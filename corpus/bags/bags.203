solid , well-made , large -- great for travel lots of compartments and pockets not the lightest backpack so you may not want it for hiking but for business travel or for commuting with business materials , works very well
fits my travel needs with the <unk> & number of different <unk> i needs for my frequent business travel i looked at a lot of different business backpacks -lrb- including tumi -rrb- and this one tends to have the right mix of features for a very reasonable price only problem is with fitting it under the seat in front of me on isle seats or smaller commuter jets . . this may change as the fabric and bag overall breaks in more and becomes more <unk>
i am a travelling <unk> who packs light and travels hard i am always on the look out for a bag that can hold my laptop , power adapters , # days of clothes , and some random stuff this backpack is perfect just get it
this was my first pass at a backpack after traveling with a tumi briefcase for # + years i was impressed with the construction and compartments - all were as described i had checked out others and finally chose this one i am extremely happy with my decision
i am a <unk> that frequently travels to meeting around the country i was tired of wearing the over the shoulder computer bags , just not comfortable or cool i wanted a backpack that also had a nice business feel to it and that i could bring to my high level meetings and not feel like i was still in college this back pack exceeds my expectations it is high quality with all types of compartments for everything i need i love it
i bought this as a replacement and the <unk> feature is outstanding as are the numerous compartments and pockets it has met all my requirements and expectations ; i travel extensively through many airports and its worth the price
this is a fantastic bag my very first backpack style business case and i must admit that i really like this plenty of room for just about everything you would want to take on a business trip outside of a suit coat you could even take some overnight stuff with you the design and build quality is good the zippers are very smooth and , by god , there are plenty of them on the bag i especially like the two smaller sized pockets on the sides great for power supplies , etc .
i use the pack everyday and is perfect to pack my work items like my ipad , my leather folio and documents very durable bag and is large enough to carry everything you need i also used it on as plane trip and worked great as a carryon i would highly recommend this backpack
this will be my overseas travel back pack it has plenty of zipper compartments which all can be locked lots of nooks and crannies for whatever you want to haul
i bough this for my macbook pro # inch retina it does not fit that screen the protector is too big and needs to be cut down to be functional if you can cut the screen protector down and size it there is the issue of getting it on the screen of your computer the screen protector does not stick well and it 's ridiculously hard to keep on i gave up and ended up throwing both of the screen protectors away and decided i would just clean the screen weekly and not bother with a screen protector either just clean your screen or spend the money and buy a better screen
i ordered it but it didnt fit my macbook pro retina . . when i ordered it , i thought it fit with my macbook i am sick of return stuff so i fix it and fit now .
i was a little upset when i realized the <unk> had folded the package , causing the screen protector to have a permanent bent mark after putting it on , i realized there were some stubborn air bubbles that would n't leave but it 's still a good buy , i like it :
we are very happy with product and how well it went on laptop the reason we gave it # stars instead of # stars is because it was delivered in a yellow envelope the corner of the envelope was bent and so was the film we were able to get it to go on but there is a crease on film
seemed like a good bag , just not was i was looking for access to the main compartment was not fast due to its folding design did not have the other organizational compartments i was looking for would be good for someone carrying just a couple main items , such as a tablet i returned it
nice simple light bag for my mac air while standing in lines , people have remarked on the bag holds my laptop , cables , etc . nicely only negative is that it gets lumpy for odd shaped stuff
i wanted to use this product for a few months before writing a review because i did n't want to make a snap judgement first , i probably use this # to # times a week i generally carry a # inch laptop , power cables , mobile hotspot , # inch tablet , and a few other items this is a <unk> resilient bag i 've stretched it an it does a good job of going back to its original shape second , i was worried about how the straps would hold up over time so far , it 's actually <unk> up pretty well i like the snug way it holds things to my back it 's secure and keeps things from flinging around
i had for long been looking for a laptop sleeve that i could carry without it bouncing around when i moved fast this definitely fits the bill i have a # inch laptop and this is ideal to carry just that in today 's world of enhanced battery lives , i do n't really need a charger to carry around and hence having a traditional backpack to carry just my laptop seemed unnecessary i love the adjustable strap the only reason i gave it a four was because i had just two colours to choose from black or blue i do like blue but it is a bit too bright for my liking if some other colour options where available , the rating would have been a five ! !
this bag is comfortable to wear and is able to hold most of the stuff i need for class it tends to lose its slim shape when it is fully loaded , but it has n't ripped or come apart at the seams the bag is capable of holding two spiral notebooks , several pens and calculators , and even a <unk> expanding folder -lrb- though that last one kind of pushes the bag to its limits -rrb- if you plan on carrying a laptop , though , expect there to be a struggle to fit some of the other things in there along with the computer and its charger also , the smell of neoprene when you first get the bag is strong , though i solved this problem by leaving some dryer sheets in the bag overnight
my favorite part about this backpack is that it feels secure with my old bag i was always worried that someone might walk up behind me and open or steal my bag this bag opens to the inside and is held snuggly to your body the size is just right for a day on campus or around town i usually do n't like carrying a bag because it is a hassle to keep track of but i forget this one is even on another thing i like about this bag is that it is not impossible to sit on a bus seat for a quick ride while it is still on i had to take my old bag off -lrb- which is a pain -rrb- because it was too bulky
the <unk> sling laptop messenger bag is just the right size to carry the essentials -lrb- macbook , notebook , and ipad -rrb- the sling strap balances the bag so well that you 'll forget you 're wearing it
love this laptop back pack won it in a competition and it is one of the best bags i have owned i ride my bike to school and it fits my laptop in one sleeve and my books in another with a very snug and safe feel on my back the adjustable straps adds to the snug fit and the adjustable inner sleeve serves as an additional option as it can fit laptops of various sizes one of the best bags i have owned would definitely recommend it
light but sturdy the quality of the product was better than i expected the two sleeves it easy to carry my surface along when i need the little pocket is not too big and not suitable for anything heavy i use it for the connectors , but wish there was a pocket for the charger
this product was broken in two places when i received it obviously , if it ca n't survive shipping , it wo n't protect my $ # macbook pro the title says it 's a & # # ; rubberized & # # ; hard case to me , this means that it 's a non slip rubberized surface the only hint of rubber on the cover , was # little pads on the bottom very cheaply made product returned it and would n't recommend it
looks and fit great but the material is brittle after some time the material is not broken but i can see <unk> <unk> the clear material is good <unk> product , but if you pretend use your computer in a rough environment o transport a lot , no the best
i 've had this case for over a year now and i do n't like it so much anymore all # of the little grips on the bottom came off and the case is cracked in some areas no , i did not drop my computer so i did not make the case crack it has scratched my computer some when i took the case off and looked at my computer which sucks because that 's why i got the case , so it would n't get scratched the color was bright neon and was what i wanted it 's an okay case just wish it held up better and did what it was supposed to
it snapped on my macbook pro # . # retina without issue the color is close to what is shown in the pictures the major complaint i have is that the edges where your palms rest are a bit sharp it appears to be part of the mold so it would likely take a secondary touch up to improve things i plan to take some <unk> paper to break the edges and see if that improves things
i have only had this shell for a couple of weeks fits my computer well , has a nice feel and is pretty i 'm giving the product # stars instead of # because it scratches fairly easily happy with the product and shipping
i love all the available colors that these kuzy covers come in but for awhile green was unavailable , so when my old green case broke i replaced it with a yellow one now that green is available again i am <unk> it up these covers keep my well used computer clean , protected and quickly identifiable , say like going through the tsa security line my experience is that the rubber ` feet ' come off pretty easily and will not stick back on - not happy about that otherwise , very happy with this purchase
this case is awesome i love the color it is so bright , exactly as it looks the case fits perfect on it too no issues getting it on its super easy
my case was slightly defective because the rubber feet were misaligned but kuzy sent me a brand new case and let me keep the old one great case and colors
very satisfied with this product also got the matching kuzy keyboard cover and i am satisfied with all of it i have not experienced the overheating as some reviews stated the top and bottom piece snap on securely and come off with out hassle if needed my mac feels very secure
it is impossible to clean i had it for two days there were fingerprints from me all over it and brown spots and everything i tried so many different <unk> and nothing worked i had to return it
not the right size for my macbook pro ! way smaller . i want to return it . what do i do ? and how long do i get my <unk> <unk> ? not happy about it
the product came quick and in good shape but the one problem is , it did not fit my macbook pro it was a bit on the small side the keyboard cover is perfect . fits snug over the buttons and can type with <unk> taps
the color is lighter to that showed by the picture and looks cheap the cushions on the bottom case do not fit in the pits perfectly the most intolerable is that there is a dent on the top case , making it an inferior
the products fit well , but there are a few things about these products that really bother me there is a stupid & # # ; kuzy & # # ; logo on the bottom right hand side of the top hard case normally this would n't bother me much , but the thing that annoys me is that the logo is not shown on the <unk> images of the product had the <unk> of the product shown the logo , i would have probably purchased another brand that did n't have a damn logo the hard case i received had two small -lrb- but notable -rrb- scratches or marks on it one of them is directly on the center of the apple i 'm pretty sure this is just a situation where i was just unlucky and got a product that had some minor flaws on it , but regardless , those two <unk> suck the keyboard cover i received had multiple small knicks on it they very noticeable and look like dirt spots or food residue stains sitting in the in <unk> of my keyboard , which just drives me insane other than that , the product is alright
i like it but somehow the products are not well-made at all , i mean there are product 's flaws when i first open the package the keyboard cover color look dull and there are some scratches on it the # stands at the bottom of the case are a look ugly and cheap , other than that the material is soft and feel
this product fits my october # macbook pro retina very well however , the bottom cover is not as stable as it could be , and both pieces have four clips -- a few less than competitor cases but of course , the price makes up for the fewer clips this case is extremely difficult to remove when i took off the front cover for routine cleaning , i broke the plastic itself i was not being too rough with it and was careful as to prevent damage to my computer this is the second case i have owned , because the first arrived broken however , after a quick email with kuzy , they were nice enough to ship me a new case free of charge i have ordered another kuzy case since breaking this one , but have learned my lesson and will not take the case off unless absolutely necessary
i was excited about the case , it arrived well before the expected date the keyboard case fit perfectly and the color matched the hard case however , i was disappointed with the fit of the case only the bottom piece fits well , the top case does not clip on
the case is a nice color , but it breaks fairly easy when you try to remove it from your laptop also , you have to consider the color when you buy it because it gets dirty very easily
the outer shell fits great and looks great only complaint is fingerprints show very easily the keyboard cover does not stay on well and is more of a hassle than help i did n't make this purchase for keyboard cover , so it 's not a big deal to me
keyboard cover is a big bonus it 's a perfect fit for my macbook pro # ' retina display the hard shell front and back covers are equally wonderful planning on buying an alternate set of covers with another nice <unk> colors
the hard cover fits the # `` macbook pro very well the silicone keyboard cover fits ok but made the keys a lot tougher to be pressed down if you type fast you will miss ~ # of the keys in your typing
it 's incredibly easy to install and is a pretty cute color -lrb- i got the pink -rrb- i like how they keyboard protector feels and this was the only case i saw for # in retina that came with a keyboard cover my only complaint is that the keyboard cover does n't perfectly match the case but you do n't really ever see both at the same time some people might not like that there is no cut out for the apple light on the back , but i like the foggy glass look it has
awesome keyboard and protection case . the keyboard fits seamlessly to the laptop people always ask if i bought a separate <unk> because it looks so clean the case although it easily gets smudged , still looks great , apple sign still shines through . happy with my
i have purchased kuzy products in the past and i will continue to do so in the future my # small complaints are minimal at best i 'm slightly annoyed with the <unk> button depending on your mac it will differ i understand to cut costs this has to be done but i dislike it the only other small issue is that they put their brand name ok both the keyboard cover and the case it 's not huge by any means but my older cases do n't have that on them so i was just surprised again both of these issues are minimal and will not stop me from being a customer in the future
i 'm not sure if this product will withstand a drop but i did n't actually buy it for protection i personally like the feel of this <unk> type plastic over the metal feel of the laptop itself here are some <unk> - the back bottom of the case is not protected when close - the case only clamps to the front and back of the laptop this case is definitely not as solid or hard as the speck products it 's also a bit more transparent than a speck case i like this case over speck cases because it does n't have any brand labeling on it if they added a couple clamps to the side , i would have given this product # stars
nice product , does what it 's supposed to it 's cheap for a reason , though , and after # months a few pieces chipped off and broke off i 'd still purchase this product though because of how long it lasts & # # ; price plus , a bunch of cool colors
the case is a great fit and the non-slip rubberized finish means you never feel like it will slip in your hand none f the <unk> are blocked by this design
this is lovely as advertised my computer feels a little bit more protected , and the colour is <unk> very nice i am happy with my purchase the keys also has a nice touch to it with the keypad cover
this case makes my gorgeous macbook look like it came from tiffany 's it fits the laptop perfectly i really like the accompanying keyboard cover as well , which makes typing quiet and soft on the fingers i thought i 'd only use the cover for the keyboard occasionally but find i never want to take it off
love the rubberized texture great fit and feel the bottom cover and feet give the macbook a solid hold and wont move easily i got black and you can see the apple logo shine through even on lowest light setting may eventually buy another color my macbook feels alot more secure and protected
i really like this laptop cover i actually meant to order the silver one , but somehow ordered this one instead which is ok , because i like the color it fits perfectly and came in no time i have absolutely nothing negative to say about this product or seller
i love this case the color was exactly like the picture ! it fits perfect on my mac i recommend it to anyone who wants to keep their mac looking brand new
i 've never had a computer cover before and i absolutely love this one i love how easy it was to snap on and use , the keypad i have to get use to because i can tell i 'm not touching the key directly i recommend covering your investment
i had ordered two other cases -lrb- both speck brand -rrb- from other sites before finally ordering the kuzy i was n't satisfied with the quality or look of the other ones they did n't fit well or look good , and they felt cheap -lrb- even though they were much more expensive than the kuzy -rrb- the kuzy looks even nicer in real life than it does online , the colour is beautiful , not too bright the feel of the case is amazing , very soft and sleek it fits perfectly and is so easy to install and remove the keyboard cover looks really cool and feels cool but i find it hard to get used to typing with the case on -lrb- especially if you are typing <unk> , etc -rrb- the price is unbeatable and i would definitely recommend it best purchase i have made in a long time
fits like a glove on my macbook # & # # ; w / retina display color is great , i got the royal blue and am very happy snapped right on top and bottom , easy to take back off if you wanted to and the keyboard cover fits perfect i did the standard shipping of # days and received this from kuzy in # days ! ! if you want a hard case get i kuzy , in my opinion stick with a little bit darker colors , like the blue or black or grey reds , i think the lighter colors will show through too much
i bought this for my new macbook pro w / retina display i love the color note : there 's no cut out but when turned on , the apple light can we seen the keyboard guard does feel a little weird and i just need to get used to it -lrb- you have to press harder on the keys -rrb- but this will protect your keyboard from any <unk> and spills everything fits perfectly
this case looks great on my new macbook pro retina i love the color and feel of it and it was a great price i would highly recommend this product to other people
i have started using this awesome case immediately after i can touch my macbook pro retina display it is totally fit with my mac and look awesome for those who are using mac book retina display , i guess you would love this case as i do right now
my son absolutely loved his blue cover and the keypad cover said it was way better then the last one he had for his old mac book pro he says the feel of the keypad cover is nice feels smooth not tacky
this case fits perfectly on my mac book pro # & # # ; retina there are no issues with this case and although it is prone to getting finger prints if your fingers are oily i would recommend this product
good price for a good product i have had mine for over # months and it has held up well and the case still fits great on my mac book pro the keyboard cover is still in good condition also , i was a little worried it would start ripping with continued use since it is pretty thin i use my computer almost everyday at least once both the case and the keyboard cover clean easily with water or mild soap and water i would recommend this as a great alternative to the more expensive cases being sold it offers protection and keeps your laptop looking brand new longer
this cover fits my mac book pro extremely well the company makes different sizes so make sure that you check the model number when ordering it i highly recommend it you can choose from a variety of colors
i ca n't get the locks on the top to engage the instructions that came with the bag are completely inadequate , and there is no corporate website to turn to for solutions
item was used and had scuff marks on it and one wheel was broken in half very poor material used to make the bag at least the return and refund was done correctly and quickly
the case looks great was my first reaction opening the box i loaded it up with about # pounds of materials and when i grabbed the handle to make my first call it came apart at the lowest slide joint on one side i carefully put it back in and got into my first call it came apart as soon as i went to leave the call needless to say i returned it
this item was purchased as a gift and sent directly to recipient it arrived with a broken clasp and had to be returned the recipient lives # miles away from me and had to pay for the return naturally , i will <unk> , but very inconvenient
based on the reviews i read , i expected better quality handle often collapses while pulling and wheels do not seem very durable already have one tear in the front flap
the locks barely work , the hinges are too tight and it just is not well made there are a ton of sharp edges and it feels like it could fall apart at any moment
this is a large size case and can hold lots of material it has to inside dividers that can secure a computer although the case seems to be well constructed , there has been some separation of the surface material on the underside of the lid
this briefcase is huge if you have more papers then it can hold , you really need to switch to filing boxes and a <unk> customer service through <unk> swiss is great the handle on my first one broke within # weeks , and i had a new one shipped by the next day bad - the material on the outside does n't look cheap , but it can not handle any wear and tear i roll mine in downtown <unk> all day the <unk> portion of the case came apart the material is hanging in shreds from the back of the case , and there is ugly <unk> material underneath not bad for the price just do n't plan on using this for
i love the matte sheen but the wheels are pretty close to the ground i had a solo previously and the wheels were pretty high this case is very roomy i do n't like the front and side pockets as they are very narrow and can barely hold my phones and other paraphernalia the price was great . some of the <unk> respond very cheaply though sometimes it feels like it wants to be a cheap item it is very wide and able to hold large files for court for the price it is ok
the bag is amazing with the space it holds , much bigger than my last one the water does n't get in through the extendable handle , which is amazing considering my last bag always got water damaged from the extendable handle i ca n't give it a better score though , because the lock broke within less than a week of using it -lrb- one side wo n't open anymore
this thing is huge and gets really heavy when loaded up ! ! it 's nice that you do n't have to unzip to get to documents etc . . . but it 's size was ultimately it 's demise it 's now sitting in the closet
this is a workable rolling case a good value for the price the handle structure could be a bit more tight , the interior -lrb- really cavernous -rrb- could have used another divider -lrb- to keep things from moving around within -rrb- or side rails that would have <unk> hanging files but is looks good and gets me where i am going .
i bought this for school because i have many textbooks that i have to bring to class although it is roomy , it is so wide that it is extremely unwieldy you need quite a wide <unk> to avoid hitting people the wheels seem like they are starting to <unk> and i 've only used it for four months
after # year of constant use , the wheels still work but the actual case is busted us and <unk> also missing the stoppers at the bottom of the case bulky and cumbersome still have it and will use it to finish out law school
when i received this product , there were some scratches at the bottom some areas the stitching was coming undone it took me a while to use it so it sat in my room still in package by the time i noticed the problems , the return window had already closed as some people said , there is also the problem with on of the flaps not opening all the way it was very hard for me to get my laptop in there i had to ask an <unk> to hold the flap for me other than that , i do love this product i think mine was just an isolated case the manufacturer just needs to have better quality control
my only complaint with this case is the weight it is too heavy , but it beats me carrying stuff on my back it is roomy for what i use it for and it seems sturdy i just wish it was n't so heavy
it 's poorly made , but it works not sure for how long it 's going to work though the # st day i had it there was an area on the inside flap that the `` pleather `` covering started peeling off -lrb- it came like that -rrb- also , one of the latches on the outside is crooked , so i 'm sure that will break soon the latch was crooked when i received it
while it 's not the best bag you can buy , it seems to be of the same quality of the one 's sold for twice the price it serves its purpose and appears to be made better than some of the other generic litigation cases
this is very well made and looks great handle could be an inch taller -lrb- i 'm # ' # & # # ; -rrb- the biggest adjustment for me has been switching from a laptop bag with a lot of pockets to one large space as i carry a lot of cables and such overall i 'm pleased and it 's a great value
this is a nice rolling briefcase , and it is worth the $ # i paid for # bucks , though , it is not leather and just a bit wobbly after using it for two months i do not expect it to last past an academic year or two but i am very happy with the space it provides for the texts and games i lug around a college campus teaching
overall , very nice case for the money one thing i do n't like is how the rear flap can not stay open because of the handle mechanism but i 'd rather have the handle than the flap opening the case has lots of storage ... one front flap , two side flaps plus a divider inside to hold thinner materials upright like file folders i find the combination lock latches to be of good quality i am hoping this case lasts as long as i think it will
i must admit that i had my reservations with this order , but i 'm very pleased for the money , this is functional , and something you can use on a daily basis very good product
i use this case every day it is well made the one suggestion i have for the manufacturer is to hinge the lid flaps the way it is made causes the top to bend when opened and closed it is only a matter of time before the material breaks this case is too expensive to be a throw away item
i am a teacher and i have a lot of papers to grade at times plus additional resources i keep with me perfect for a teacher or anyone who carries lots of documents has a lot of compartments for organization it 's just a little bigger than i expected but that can be a plus
the only gripe i have is the way the top opens on the rear side ... only # of that side lifts due to the <unk> handle otherwise ... these are great good quality , great space , well designed
this can hold absolutely everything it has plenty of room for everything my only wish would be that the wheels would rotate so that i could push it sideways too
this bag is very spacious and rolls like a dream the handle telescopes well and i bought it to carry my <unk> for sales calls i wish it had a way to hold folders with various brochures inside , but i 'm using the area where the computer would go so that works for now all in all a good purchase , but it 's bulky so make sure you can move around it on your sales call -lrb- without snagging your <unk> -rrb-
very usable case i am a teacher and i carry a lot of stuff daily this is a nice case for the price wheels work well , ` leather ' material looks good and holds up one complaint is the handle wiggles a lot and collapses on me now and then i am short # feet # inches and i find that the handle is ok but i wish it could be shorter the space inside fits my laptop and plan book , files etc . pocket on outside is great for umbrella i would recommend this if you want a reasonably priced product that will keep your items protected , and looks professional as well
the case is made of a material that provides an excellent leather-like look i have no idea whether it 's made from real hides , but it is far more impressive looking than the <unk> fabric used on similar items i found the combo locks almost impossible to set to my own combination , but i doubt that i 'll need this security feature in any event the pull-up handle works smoothly , is <unk> at a couple of heights , and seems to be <unk> of durable materials same for the wheels the inside of the case is a perfect width for holding my # `` screen laptop as well as a small projector and accessories i think i made out like a bandit , being able to purchase this thing from amazon for well under $ #
i bought this to replace my old case the rolling wheels on this one feels smoother than my old case i 'm not sure if that is just mental though it works well and performs as expected good quality for the price
this case is attractive it rolls nicely in the airport and fits in the overhead storage of large planes -lrb- carry on -rrb- it holds my very large -- # . # x # . # x # . # in , # . # lbs -- laptop and all its peripherals perfectly one of the folds on the top does not open completely , probably because of the extendable handle , but this has not caused me any difficulty the case itself is a bit on the heavy side and bulky but i needed it big for the laptop the only drawback i have had is the flaps on the sides they want to catch on things i walk by and fold under when i throw the case into the trunk however , the pockets are sturdy and have thus far <unk> considerable <unk> without looking bad i am very pleased with this product
great rolling case it is durable and sturdy you can throw everything in there and roll out of your home and into the office or trip it was everything that i expected and more reliable and durable for a great price shipped perfectly and the product is awesome !
i thought the quality would be less than desirable but my husband really wanted one of these to me , it is well made when we attend conventions as a family he can carry all of our items together it 's roomy and lots of compartments
price was extremely low for such a high quality case working in commercial aviation , this case has been around the world and never failed me excellent quality and professional looks locks work great and rolls smooth even fully
this bag is spacious and fits nicely in airline overhead compartments it is the perfect size and shape the bag also has plenty of extra pockets and compartments for everything you need to bring with you this is a definite buy
the person i bought this for is very pleased with this purchase . he is a young attorney and he was extremely pleased with this item it lived up to all our expectations
