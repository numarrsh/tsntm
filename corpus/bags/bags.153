i got this as a present for my dad ; he likes it a lot i 've got an older timbuk # bag and it is holding up fine after # years of daily use on city public transportation the quality of this new bag appears to be as good so i expect it will last a long time amazon prices are good for this product too
this is a very basic bag it works great for simply transporting your laptop from place to place and keeping it safe along the way i would not use it as a briefcase or everyday laptop bag but if you only occasionally move your laptop and do n't want to worry about dropping it on the way then this is the bag for you
i 've used this bag for about # months now i use it for my # `` macbook air i 've taken it with me on # domestic flights and # international it 's nice to be able to just drop the whole bag in the airport x-ray bin with the laptop , charger and stuff in it the # pockets under the velcro flap are large enough to hold my charger , a couple of cables , mouse and a usb dvd the laptop fits well , not too loose overall the bag is a little larger than a <unk> computer sleeve the handles are a nice addition which makes it easier to grab the bag out of the x-ray bin or where ever i recommend it
i 've been thrilled with the quickie laptop sleeve i have the small for my # `` macbook air and it fits perfectly very quick access , no fussing as with a backpack it will also fit a <unk> and two <unk> books along with an air the pockets are more generous than you 'd think -- they easily hold a power cord , small headphones , phone , wallet , keys , <unk> nylon bag , tissues , etc . it 's very light and unobtrusive , sturdy , water-resistant -lrb- including zipper -rrb- so i do n't worry about it in a light rain been giving it heavy use for # mo . and no signs of wear strap is very sturdy too , adjusts nicely -lrb- and stays where adjusted to -rrb- you can <unk> a small water bottle in the top handle pocket , though it 's probably not designed for that
i walk all over the place to meet with clients and work on-site , so i 've spent a lot of time trying to find the perfect laptop bag the quickie -lrb- a dumb name -rrb- has replaced my previous go-to , a much larger keen bag there 's just enough space in the main pocket for my netbook , a lenovo x # e , plus a pad of paper i keep pens , a flexible water bottle , and a mouse in the external pockets so that i have everything i need the light weight and comfortable strap make it perfect for carrying around i got the green version and i 've also gotten some compliments on the looks , which is a first to make it perfect , timbuk # would add a small external pocket to hold my earbuds i could put them in the area where the handles fold down , but it 's so shallow that i 'm afraid they would fall out
i was looking for a bag to travel with my kindle fire , ear buds , and power cord this is perfect i can keep my kindle fire inside the large padded zipper pocket as well as adding a magazine or mail order <unk> pockets under the velcro enclosure holds my stylist and power cord in one pocket and power cord for cell phone in the other it now goes everywhere with me
well made , what i like best is that is one of the few sleeves that has pockets to carry pens and cables the inside was well padded to keep you netbook or ipad safe the only thing that would make it better is if they would offer more color varieties
i have the small size for my # `` macbook and it fits perfectly it is large enough to hold the charger and a few cords in one pocket in the front and my kindle in the other as well it is water-resistant so i do n't worry as much about walking in the rain anymore also , i can attest to how well it protects the computer : i fell on the ice this winter and my bag hit the ground pretty hard thankfully , my computer was just fine if you just need a computer bag and do n't really need anything else to go in it , i 'd say this is the perfect bag for you plus timbuk # bags hold up so well i 've had quite a few and have never had any trouble with damage
i 've been looking forever for the perfect case with a shoulder strap to hold my ipad in an otterbox finally after much searching -lrb- and buying -rrb- i found it well made , <unk> interior protection , shoulder strap -lrb- optional hidden hand straps -rrb- , light weight holds my charger , headphones , screen cleaner cloth , stylus , pens , some papers and a small notepad i love it and much more weatherproof than the foam style case i was using
first of i love all timbuk # products their reputation exceeds the quality plus the warranty on their bags are truly back up i love this bag , i found it cheaper online at amazon compare to bestbuy which only had black bag it was fast shipping and fits my new toshiba portege ultra book overall , i would recommend this bag to any one that is looking for a quality made bag besides , i have timbuk # 's messenger bag , wallet , kindle sleeve and now the laptop bag
i got this for my girlfriend because this is the one she wanted the quality seems kinda sub-par for swissgear it 's not bad , but the quality is really lacking we ended up sending it back , and replaced it with the sa # scansmart backpack by swissgear much better and happy with that one
on the front of the backpack , there are # metal grommets with # small straps cords for attaching items the top metal grommet <unk> out at the top and i <unk> my finger on the sharp edge i do not use these straps so not caused by stress or misuse i contacted <unk> and am awaiting a response could be a manufacturing defect ? ?
i think this bag is great it 's a lot easier on my back than the previous one i was carrying and i feel like my # `` mac book pro is safe and secure the main drawback is i am very limited w / the number of case books i can squeeze in along w / binders i 'm working around it and figure i probably do n't need to carry # case books on my back anyway also the little flap thing over the top of the laptop section is unnecessary and gets in the way but it 's a great purchase and i recommend
just like the description states the laptop security checkpoint clamshell option is very useful saves some time during the security checkpoint plus you know its safe in the padded pocket i tested it at two different airports and did not have any issues i did not completely fill the bag because i was using it to stow under the seat in front of me on the airplane , but it will hold a good amount if its just being used as a backpack shoulder straps are very comfortable and the & # # ; vented & # # ; back is nice while walking around because it does help keep my back a little cooler the only reason i did not give it # stars was because it didnt quite fit my acer # . # & # # ; laptop the corners of the laptop were exposed at the top and would not get any extra protection from the padding
the bag is just the right size and seems durable the checkpoint-friendly feature means the bag opens like a clamshell and lies flat on an airport <unk> this is a super convenient <unk> for those of us who travel it means one less thing i 've to hunt down after the tsa scanning two things i think are <unk> , but were just skipped - a cell phone pocket on the shoulder strap ; a sleeve on the back near the bottom to slip the backpack onto a rolling luggage handle there is a strap on the top for this purpose , but the backpack is n't secure when attached and moves off the luggage
this book bag has met all my book bag needs it 's study , feels comfortable while wearing it , and it holds all my things nicely i 've also gone through the airport twice now without having to take my laptop out of the bag
i have one of these and bought this one as a gift for a friend because mine has held up well and looks cool the computer compartment is simple and effective the whole pack is well made with strong stitching and materials
i have traveled extensively with this bag , and it 's holding up very well with very little wear compared to my old dell bag the tsa friendly laptop compartment makes the security hassle a little less painful plenty of compartments keep me organized , and i know exactly where everything is wonderful bag , if i had to buy a replacement , i would buy the same bag again
this is the third backpack i have had for the various computers i have used over the years and it is by far the best one i have ever owned it has plenty of storage space for all your accessories ... cables , power supplies , mouse , portable scanner , etc . with this backpack everything is within easy access when traveling it is very easy to remove the computer without having to unpack other items to get to it i had another one of these earlier and gave it to my son to use for his computer for college he likes it as well this one is a replacement for that one
this is the first backpack i have used for business travel and i love it going through airport security with the check point friendly feature is much quicker and convenient it has plenty of storage compartments to keep things organized , it 's well <unk> out , and seems to be very durable definitely would purchase again
there are a million laptop backpacks out there i got this one because it 's checkpoint friendly - saves on needing # additional bins at the airport has plenty of pockets , shoulders straps are comfortable enough good padding and fit for laptop and accessories the swiss gear brand lives up to it 's reputation
this case is quite cute it 's big enough to fit my two tablets in as well as a couple other accessories and various wall plugs to charge with room to spare the pictures make it look greyish with pink accents , but it 's actually a light lavender color and definitely adds to the girly feel all in all , for the price , this was a good buy for my travel tablet bag
bought this for my wife 's new dell # `` netbook she loves it fits well and is very durable first day she had it she spilled chocolate milk all over it went in to the washer and came out looking brand new
my girls have ipads and needed something to take them in on an airplane trip plus , be able to carry things such as snacks , tissues , chapstick , etc . this bag was perfect it can fit the gen # ipad with a case , # small snack bags , a book , chapstick , tissues , charger , and ipod with <unk> headphones the strap is soft and adjusted enough for my petite # year old there are multiple compartments inside and out to hold and separate items the strap cushion did n't work well for my # and # year old but i just used their seat belt strap covers and those worked like a charm i was able to shorten the strap enough for both kids by pulling the silver ring through the shoulder strap , on to the other side it 's a nice lavender color with pink trim and has an easy to wipe down canvas surface
this bag is everything i was hoping for . it 's large enough to hold my charger , mouse , mousepad , flash drives & more i love the shoulder strap it arrived earlier than promised and looks like a sturdy bag that will last a long time
its super light and confortable to travel with i went to spain with it and was amazing has a room for other stuff plus my mini laptop fits perfectly in it . tree words i love
there is something seriously wrong with the fabric - it smells noxious - so bad as to give headaches it is the perfect <unk> but i am returning it after two weeks because i ca n't deal with the horrible smell i strongly recommend avoiding this product i believe it may be hazardous to one 's health
i 've bought this case recently and could not live with a strong chemical smell that remind me when i go to the tire store i 've processed a return now with amazon
this cover does the job , but it does n't really handle as large a player as it says i have a # inch tv and it barely fits it is very sturdy and well built however
had it for over a year now and it has n't broken , faded , stained or failed me in anyway it is very cushioned and works very well all of the pockets , handles , and other features work just as advertised
i purchased this neoprene soft protective sleeve for my laptop it is for # `` - # `` laptops , not # `` - # . # `` as indicated my laptop is # . # `` and the sleeve is a bit snug , but hopefully it will stretch after some use i decided to keep it because i really liked it
nicely constructed , easy access to the interior , lightweight , holds an ipad with zagg keyboard perfectly has just enough room for everything i need for a day the strap is just a little shorter than i like -lrb- # ' # tall -rrb- , and the cup holder is a little awkward otherwise , great bag
i would have rated # stars if not for the strap . . although i like everything about it , i just wish the strap was a little <unk> . . the interior pockets are well designed my computer # & # # ; fits in perfectly i do n't regret buying it
i got this for my ipad , and it works well , easy to travel with , easy to access contents . no complaints at all but i do have a couple of wish list items the pocket for the ipad is too small imho it holds the ipad , but just , and it ca n't be in any case , or skin i 'd rather it large enough for at least apple 's case , and maybe a bit of stretch in the pocket also i 'd like a pocket on the outside large enough to put my iphone , or whatever not a form fitting iphone pocket , but one large enough , some padding maybe where i can drop something like the phone , or a camera into when i strip down to go through airport security am i going to keep using this bag , yes indeed . - <unk>
i have had this bag about a month and love it i wanted a smaller bag to carry my ipad and a few client folders plus my cords for ipad this is perfect take note though it is a smaller messenger bag do n't plan on putting bulky items in it because it is fairly narrow the construction is very durable and the strap is very comfortable on my shoulder
no chemical odor , smooth zipper around three sides a little too large for the ipad , i would have preferred a more snug fit for the price , though , it cant be beat !
i bought this sleeve for my wacom bamboo pen tablet , and it was a good fit since the tablet is too slim , it 's a little loose , but the straps inside the sleeve are a great solution for that issue i 'm using it mainly for keeping my tablet protected at home , and to avoid the dust , however , since it 's not that cushiony , i would n't trust it at all for traveling
i got this case to fit an acer aspire one d # netbook with a # . # inch screen the construction of the sleeve is pretty good and i expect it to last quite a while since the item is described as fitting # `` netbooks , i thought it would be a pretty snug fit on a # `` machine however , it is slightly too large and my computer flops around a bit inside it the length of the case is about right , but it is maybe an inch too wide that leads me to believe that most any # `` machine will fit , probably with room to spare if you are looking for a really snug sleeve , this is probably not the one still , for the tiny price i have no complaints the free # day shipping with amazon prime was awesome , as usual
this case does not fit the kindle # g it is way too big , but i can still use it for other things or with my kindle but it will have extra room
i bought this to protect my ipad when it 's in a backpack or other larger carrier , and it is exactly what i needed perfect size and seems to be of good quality
i purchased this to house my ipad for business and personal travel i was n't sure if it would be an exact fit but i rolled the dice given the measurements in the description -lrb- and the low price -rrb- i 'm very happy that i did because it 's perfect for my ipad and exactly what i was looking for it shipped quick and <unk> in the amazon frustration free box the only amazon branding on the item can be found on the zipper pulls , which is fine by me and the inside is a bright orange which adds a little <unk> to an otherwise boring but highly practical neoprene sleeve
the case fits perfectly around my # inch lenovo netbook , and the <unk> keep the case in place even when the netbook is open and in use the material does get warm after using the netbook for more than <unk> , but i do not think it gets any warmer than the netbook itself the inside of the case is bright orange , so if you have a net <unk> is n't white or black it will probably <unk> personally , i <unk> orange color
these swissgear backpacks are complete garbage they are made for `` show `` , not for `` go `` . they have a bunch of <unk> features , but do n't even perform the most basic functions of a backpack for example , they have what 's marketed as a shock absorber system on the shoulder straps , but they are just flimsy elastic that started to pull apart within weeks these packs also leak like <unk> unlike the old jansport and eastpak backpacks , they do n't have water-resistant <unk> on the fabric , and you will notice that there are no flaps covering the zippers also , they put a hole for headphones at the top of the bag , just in case the unprotected fabric and fat zippers were n't letting in enough water already what good are all of the features and styling if they ca n't even keep your laptop and other gear dry then there 's the mesh water bottle `` holders `` on the side they are so short and loose , that the water bottle goes flying out as soon as you pick up the bag what a joke
it is a beautiful backpack with considerable space for a laptop and few textbooks there are few things i would have modified - firstly the sleeve needs to padded more with foam usually , i carry a light # inch ultrabook and few textbooks ~ # pounds and this backpack wo n't help much secondly the zippers fly out sometimes which needs to fixed , i had to return one because of that finally , the quality of the material does n't meet the swissgear standard as it has already begun to <unk> in two places i used my previous swissgear backpack for nearly # years without any wear and tear and a better padded sleeve
bought this a year ago unfortunately the zippers are starting to failing they are getting stuck drink holders are not keeping my water bottle tight , thus they fall out on occasion would not recommend this
bought this for my son <unk> in hs . it was too small for him it does n't hold his laptop , # binders -lrb- # & # # ; each -rrb- and other stuff that he has to carry finally , the zipper separated after merely # months of use it 's probably a good size for a grade school kid
i am a fan of swissgear products but i would say that in recent years , the quality is <unk> or we need to spent more money to get a decent backpack i do not feel the pad helps much when i carried with a notebook with some textbooks another drawback is that the backpack is not so spacious the laptop compartment does not provide sufficient protect to your laptop i would not say it is a piece of junk but it is not a quality product under the famous brand name swissgear
initially , i really liked this bag nice and roomy , yet still fits under the airline seat however , after using this bag on a regular occasion for the last year , i have noticed a tendency of the zippers to work their way open a couple of inches , or more this could allow items to fall out of the bag and it seems the full the bag , the more the zippers have a tendency to open so the bag is good , but be careful with the zippers
the backpack is a bit smaller than i expected compare to my old -lrb- targus -rrb- backpack , there are more pouches and places to put things , but less overall space it seems like this would be a good backpack for a kid
just got the bag first of all , thanks the worker who delivered the bag at # pm on a cold night overall the bag is good pros : - many compartments , very useful and easy to <unk> : - the fabric separates each compartment is just a single , thin layer so it looks cheap inside i keep the bag because i need it badly if you pay more than $ # , you pay too much
bag looks great and has plenty of pockets i am very upset that after less than a month , the seam for the computer pocket is ripping no hole yet , but the rip keeps growing
this is a nice backpack , sturdy and well-constructed , but has a couple of issues first off , it wo n't carry a lot of gear because it is a narrower -lrb- thinner ? -rrb- backpack than my # & # # ; laptop bag also , it barely fits my # . # & # # ; screen but with some work i can get the zipper all the way around
this backpack is made with very cheap materials and this is why if you are walking in the rain , it will seep in and possibly damage electronics kept within the backpack on the plus side , it looks okay
the bag is fine however , the inside pockets do not have any zippers it is difficult to keep things inside he pocket if the bag is not always in upright position
is nice , stylish exactly as shown in the pictures and is really strong i have not really used it to comment about the robustness but i can say its worth the money
it 's a well constructed backpack it 's perfect for my school supplies , but i could see how it might be a bit small for other people i carry a binder , an ipad , a wacom tablet , and sometimes a textbook in this backpack along with the usual pencils and pens it could probably be stuffed with a few more things , but i always try to keep my pack light if i can i 'm pleased with the backpack and i believe that i will use it for years to come
overall i am very happy with this bag the quality is excellent and i think it will hold up for many years i 'm giving it # stars because i think the laptop padding could be better , but overall i would probably buy another swissgear backpack it 's the perfect size for commuting to work , not too big , not too small i 'm # ' # & # # ; with broad shoulders and have trouble finding backpacks that are comfortable this one feels great
this bag has plenty of space and plenty of pockets it has nicely padded straps for a comfy carry and is n't very heavy price is high and i only got it as a lightening deal on sale it is a great buy
its your straight up swiss gear backpack it has the same pockets as my other older swiss gear -lrb- it seems they keep a constant design -rrb- very elegant headphone hole for the main compartment which comes with a pouch for a device -lrb- phone ipod -rrb- the red is not too <unk> and has elegant pockets to use such as for pens , cards ... enough to make it useful but not complicated
plenty of pockets for all sorts of items the padded laptop compartment protects the computer with a flap and velcro closer , and has a pad so it 's comfortable against your back when wearing the backpack i 'd have given it five stars if it had a chest strap to keep the shoulder straps together
the backpack is a little smaller -lrb- in depth -rrb- than i was hoping but it 'd do for now seems to make out of good material and so far , no zipper problem as a few others have reported hope it would last for a few years
i bought this as a gift for my brother so that he could carry his books and his laptop to school and he absolutely loves this bag it looks and feels good and it 's well built a good purchase for # $
great value on a <unk> brand it 's very convenient for all of the hardware students currently carry on a daily basis i 'm glad i purchased this from amazon.com the shipping was right on time
i was tired of carrying my age old tumi around i find this is perfect for carrying my office computer , ipad , folders , and supplies light but rugged very happy with the quality for the price
i used this bag recently in korea it was during the rainy season so we did get lots of rain the bag provided minimal protection against water i was pretty disappointed that it did not seem to even be water resistant , much less water proof one thing i have done in the past with a backpack full of electronics in the rain is to wear it `` backward `` so the pack is under the umbrella better i did that but the handle on top would press into my neck very uncomfortably i still give it # stars because it did not advertise being water resistant i just thought it would offer some level of protection the area i was in is very <unk> and i <unk> up and down the <unk> carrying the bag a lot and it performed well just be forewarned that if it rains you better make sure electronics are in a waterproof baggie or something
i bought this for my son who rides a motorcycle with no storage he wears this most of the time for his things i was worried that the load could shift and throw him off balance , but it fits great and is made of great construction
i bought this for my husband for christmas and he really loves it only downside to it was after six months the zipper broke and we had to take it in to get fixed no big deal , just wish it would have been a little more resistant
seems to be a well built bag -lrb- just like the other swissgear bag i have -rrb- but the dell precision m # laptop does not fit , so it is going back
it looks very good i gave only four star because the swiss gear emblem is twisted to the left not a big deal but is visible and a bit annoying this is my second purchased in a week
i have so many back packs and bags , i wanted this one to be small , it is smaller than most but not as small as i will get in the future good bag with lots of compartments and seems to be well built
this backpack is great for a college student like myself i can fit a good amount of stuff inside , but it would get # stars if it were a little bit bigger when i pack it with folders and notebooks , i can manage to fit one or two textbooks and no more if i want to put in my laptop -lrb- the in padded area -rrb- i have to remove a textbook or two the large water bottle pockets on the side are great . the front pocket -lrb- used to put in <unk> -rrb- would be better if it had a zipper the bag is comfortable to wear for long periods and does n't hurt your back the material feels great and the bag is strong i think it will last for a long time
i owned a samsonite laptop which i belive was far superior but paid usd # for it while this deal at usd # is worth strong sturdy bag with <unk> storage only missing thing is some inner pockets with zip chain which help you secure some small loose items such as memory cards , usb sticks , keys etc .
this is a very good bag if you are looking for small bag . you can carry a lap with two note books . anyway i like it . this is what i am looking for
lots of compartments , basically what you expect to get from swissgear always made to last still have my first backpack by them which has lasted over # years just needed another one great buy
bought this backpack to travel cross country with me on my vacation so i could carry my laptop with me it has plenty of room for a laptop , pair of shoes , hats , books and anything else you need to add looks great and ca n't beat the price . would recommend
wow , this backpack is a fantastic bargain ... paid $ # for it ; but it 's worth twice that strong material and stitching , padded computer pouch , perfect size all pros , no cons if you can buy at this price , get it
this is the best choice i had ever made on back packs for college at first i was unsure about purchasing it because of the gender look , size , and support and we all want to look decent for college with style and etc . well this has it all mp # <unk> pouch , and a great amount of pocket spaces for books and little things i would most definitely recommend this backpack to college students -lrb-
purchased this backpack to use as a carry-on for traveling laptop pocket easily fits my computer and the rest of the bag has plenty of room - there are several pockets for everything else you need the quality seems very good - in particular the zippers are high quality the shoulder straps are comfy - they do n't dig into your shoulders i would recommend this the product is excellent for this price
i 've been all ways liked the swiss army backpacks i just did n't like there price when amazon has this on sale for # $ it was a no brainer the backpack is comfortable and very well built it 's the perfect size computer backpack not giant and and to small for your smaller laptop and a tablet and all your wires and adaptors plenty of storage pockets and good padding to protect
this backpack is great for a college student it has a lot of sections to organize your pencils , pens , calculator , etc . it can hold a lot of book plus a laptop i have a # . # in laptop and it fits perfectly into the laptop compartment . comfort is also provided by all of the cushion on the back and on the shoulder straps
first time buying swiss gear and i really like this backpack the material is good quality , it is very sturdy , it is an all around good backpack it exceeded my expectations , it got here at an <unk> time , and i would definetly recomend this seller
i like the pack , its light , comfortable and the colors are good it has one large back pocket with place for the laptop and the <unk> - looks and is very secure i tried it with my # `` laptop and it fit well and was comfortable to carry the pack also as a front large pocket , that first i did n't notice but its there and there is the # rd obvious one <unk> is a bit smaller , and the # th is just under the cross the pack was well packaged and arrived on time , as ordered no defects after checking carefully i am happy to have it - its very nice , light and convenient
i presented the bag to my hubby and he loved it - sturdy , right size , fits his huge laptop i personally feel that it needs a few more front pockets otherwise , a great buy !
i was a little worried with some of the reviews <unk> that their laptops did not fit , but i must say it fit mine perfectly i currently use this pack with my school supplies -lrb- # spiral notebooks and a folder -rrb- along with my macbook pro # `` . the macbooks dimensions are # . # in -lrb- # cm -rrb- wide # . # in -lrb- # cm -rrb- deep # . # in -lrb- # cm overall i love this pack it 's what i 've been looking for good amount of back support , straps are comfortable , plenty of pockets , etc . i 'm extremely happy with the construction of the backpack get it while it still available
this has been a great backpack for the price it says that it can fit a # & # # ; laptop and one may fit in there very snuggly , but i have a # & # # ; macbook that fits in there quite nicely the airflow back system is listed as a feature i 'm not really sure what the effect of it is the bag is comfortable on both my shoulders and back so i guess it works i 'm a big fan of all of the separate pockets and places for my <unk> / headphones
this bag is durable and beautiful there are some many pockets to contain small items it 's spacious for # inches laptop and good for outing purposes it 's well designed and made i would like to recommend it to my friends
i bought this bag for my teenage son who will be heading off to college next year he said he loves it because he can fit his laptop in it and so much more ... he 's a happy boy
no doubt this is nice quality bag i already have couple of swissgear bags and i am very very impressed with them and bought this bag even though i <unk> need one
bought this for a little boy 's bday -lrb- turned # -rrb- ... and this will be great for the <unk> school year and when he goes to friends houses tons of storage compartments , plenty of space and built very well should get two school years or more out of this one do n't let the & # # ; laptop & # # ; <unk> fool you , this is plenty big for any <unk> school
i love this backpack everything good others reviewers said is true only two cons : when using it shirt less the straps are not very friendly on the bare skin mostly when you are sweating not a good experience the second one is that it needs some middle hook to get the two main shoulder straps closer to the center of your chest i am thinking about stitching those by myself i need this when using the backpack while riding on a motorcycle because of the breeze this also would be useful if you put a lot of heavy stuff inside so less stress go on the side of your shoulders please click `` yes `` if this review was useful
my # year old son loves this backpack he loves this color , black , and also the red accents on this backpack it 's well-made , with plenty of pockets and good padding too i 'm sure in the future i 'll continue buying backpacks made by swissgear , and i will buy them here on amazon , where you ca n't beat the price
this backpack is great for light items -lrb- e.g . carrying a laptop and a tablet together -rrb- would definitely not use it for large college textbooks - its compartments are simply not large enough to fit more than one at a time otherwise , it is a high-quality product
i have been using this backpack everyday , for school or work , for a little over three weeks and so far it 's being great i pack it with notebooks , textbooks , and clothes my only complaint is that the straps are n't as cushioned as i would have liked but they still feel good i would recommend it especially if it 's on sale
i usually burn thru backpacks every # months i travel with them carrying my computer and various business files i have purchased probably # different backpacks on amazon and this is one of the best the pockets are the right size the quality seems pretty solid so far i really like that it is not as heavy as some other backpacks
sturdy well made and perfect for hauling a laptop around lots of space for other things as well i also like the color design and accents of red i do not regret my purchase in any way and would recommend highly to others as well
this backpack was perfectly designed for & # # ; city & # # ; use you can lug this backpack while traveling with a small laptop , two bottles of water , and any music device you have all day and not feel <unk> the padding is a great feature i also like the <unk> holder , the spot for your smart phone , and special slots for earbuds it has every pocket one could ask for a must buy
this backpack i use it everyday for college and i walk a lot to get there the main reason for why i bought it was for carry on my # -inches laptop also it has a lot of <unk> that allows me to put everything i need like bottle water , notebooks , tablet , my coat , laptop , purse , pencil case , etc .
the product description says `` accommodates most # `` laptops . i would guarantee this thing to comfortably hold all # `` laptops and possibly hold most # `` laptops the straps are comfortable and there is plenty of space to carry everything you need for school , work , or a lengthy hike you will not be disappointed with the quality of this backpack
as an it guy i use this bag to hold my macbook pro -lrb- # & # # ; -rrb- as well as a ton of other cables , adapters , and misc gadgets it 's not a massive backpack like you would use to disappear into the <unk> but that 's perfect for either a student or more casual professional who does n't carry a traditional briefcase very well thought out and loaded with cool features for holding drinks , keys , phones , and pretty much any other think you might have on your person while living your life
picked this up during cyber monday and could not be happier backpack itself has a small form factor , yet manages to fit everything i can throw at it you can feel the quality build as well
