i received this bag as a gift and it fell apart after only a few weeks of use the handle started falling off right away , and the shoulder strap clips snapped right in half this bag is not worth the money and is made extremely cheap i tried to return it to amazon but because i received it as a gift they make it very difficult and the window of return is very short the return policy is not friendly for products that fall apart after only a little use so buyer beware
i purchased this laptop bag as a replacement to one of the same make and style -lrb- so i thought -rrb- that i used daily for over # years the first bag was wonderful and i loved it it keeps me organized , as i use this bag for work on a daily basis , the new bag i received and started using the first week in january the top handle fell off after less than i month of use this bag obviously was n't made as sturdy as the previous bag i purchased
i ordered this bag for my # inch laptop and when it arrived the laptop does not even fit in the case we will see how the return process goes
a little over a year of use and the shoulder strap is broken , detached from the bag itself , and the handle on top also detached on one side , and the other is right behind it was dissapointed the bag was very stylish and <unk> , got lots of complement , but not a good investment
i was super excited about this bag and have been using it since the fall of # over the last few months , it has been falling a part first , two of the zippers fell apart today the strap broke such that i ca n't fix it i work part time so i only carry the bag # times a week i am extremely disappointed that the bag did n't make it a year before it started falling apart , especially considering , that it does n't get a lot of wear and tear
this bag is great except for the fact that the handle has broken off after only # months of use i have n't had anything in the bag aside from a laptop , thumbdrive , and a few pens would have thought that the bag , designed for a # & # # ; laptop , could handle the weight , but obviously not the shoulder strap is still an option , but it tends to <unk> as you wear it , so the bag ends up by your knees wish that this bag was built to last as much as it was built to look good
this bag is really big ! really too big for just carring a # inch laptop and a few cords . it is great if you have alot of files or other things to put in the bag i was looking for something less like luggage and more like a light laptop bag it did have a strange smell when i got it but it wore off once i got it out of the box the colors are really pretty
cons : it 's heavier than i was expecting which is a bit of a disappointment given how heavy it is with the computer in it i also think the <unk> is cheaper looking in person pros : i do appreciate and like the extra <unk> the case offers it provides good padding and protection for my computer
it 's really freaking cute but it is huge and very awkward to carry around you are better off getting a laptop backpack if you transport your laptop a lot -lrb- college campus -rrb- i ended up giving it away to my roommate
i found this briefcase on amazon after weeks and weeks of searching for the perfect bag for my # `` laptop it is very hard to find one that is not only affordable but attractive as well as having the right amount of storage everyone says this suits me to a tee and i must <unk> just disappointed that i 've had my briefcase since march # , # and the strap broke march # , # just as i 'm walking the stitching is n't sturdy enough for such an item as a large laptop , so now i have to find someplace that will restitch it for a small fee
everywhere i go women want to know where i got my lap top bag it 's exactly what i expected it to be , pictures and descriptions match , worth the price it 's now # months later and the handle snapped right off , i 'd like to take # stars away from this review , although it is nice looking it 's cheaply made there is no warranty on the bag and no returns so i 'm out # . #
i ordered his for my # . # in dell laptop the fit is perfect , the bag has tons of useful compartments , and it looks great it was exactly what i wanted i carry my laptop often , so it stays in the bag most of the time after about # months , my daughter was carrying the bag on her shoulder when one side of the shoulder strap snapped sending the bag -lrb- and computer -rrb- to the concrete luckily , the bag is well padded but i had to then carry the bag by the handle - which snapped a few weeks later i will reorder in a new color but will find a way to reinforce the handles
love the bag itself , great storage of things , etc . but i 've only had it for # / # and the handle broke and a seam is already coming apart have n't been carrying really heavy stuff in it just my computer , # heavy science book and # notebooks frustrated ! !
my husband got me this bag for christmas and as soon as i took it out of the box the zipper didnt even work on one side now fast forward to april and the handle breaks i only keep my laptop and computer plug in this bag and it breaks i wrote to them concerning this and have n't heard back as of yet the bag is really cute but it 's not sturdy maybe i just got a bad bag who
i just told my coworker i 'll never leave this case behind it is definitely an eye catcher it did smell a little at first , but i was prepared because of reading it in another review it is roomy , pretty , and big enough for additional storage items
i bought this wonderful bag my laptop is an acer # . # aspire & it barely fits into this i read the reviews of tons of bags it 's hard to find one for a laptop this size , that is n't a fortune i 'm really not trying to complain , it 's really great i was just hoping my laptop would 've fit better so , if you have a # . # laptop , get a bigger size should be perfect for # . # - # `` laptops have n't decided whether i 'm going to keep it or not yet because i do love it , but it is a really tight fit
the product is as shown in picture beautiful and the quality was good the pink in real is much lighter than the pink in the image the only # things is first : the pink part gets ruined quickly because of the material the other thing is i think the shipping was not careful so it had some little dirt on the handel
i bought this for my girl and she loved it fits her laptop and a few extra things the material is kind of cheap like but that 's in my personal opinion still a good buy for a good price
i love the labtop case it is a beautiful stylish and spacious bag containing multiple pockets for papers , a mouse , lap top charger , and any other accessories you might have it is also sturdy and i disagree with the comments about the smell it smells like your typical new product fresh from packaging which is great <unk> you can tell it is not used overall , i love the style and quality and am happy : -rrb- it did take a while for the product to arrive but was worth the wait
i am going to use it for carrying <unk> when i travel it 's big enough for the largest of laptops my first reaction was , ` wow , this is big , ' lol as far as being sturdy , i would give it an # out of #
i love everything about it my hp pavilion # . # laptop fits perfectly in it plus i have the pocket for putting the cord and my cell phone charger and my business cards and pens it 's even more beautiful in person it 's very sturdy and durable i must say i would do business with the seller again
i carry my laptop everywhere this bag is huge , lots of pockets and it distributes the weight very well and its so cute , no one has a bag like mine
i was actually a little suspicious about the quality , but i actually love it it has plenty of room and pockets so i can take it to college with me and still stay organized and as a big alabama fan i love the pattern
just recieved this laptop case today and it is beautiful i love it it came super fast the inside is very roomy and there are differnt zippered compartments for all kinds of things the price is a little steep but it should last a long time it looks well made too
i have a # in laptop and it gets pretty heavy this case bag carry on is amazing i am able to have my laptop and papers in with plenty of room to stuff my charger and portable hard drive
i bought this laptop bag for my daughter for christmas she had been looking for a # & # # ; bag , which was not easy to find this one is firm and protective as well as soft inside and out
this is the perfect case to carry a # `` laptop it fits snuggly in the case but has lots of room in the other pockets for the cord/charger and files or papers good quality and pleasant print
this makes a great brief case for me the only complaint is that i was sent a zebra bag instead of the damask , probably just a mix up , but i loved that print just as much so i am happy with it anyway it has compartments for everything and i carry all of my important paperwork in it
this bag is perfect for my oversized notebook it has plenty of room for that and my mouse and my kindle and my phone and pretty much whatever else i want to pack in it i like the fact that it has all metal hardware so many products have plastic clips and fasteners on the handles and straps and they break i do n't see that happening here it did have a funny smell , but it was packaged in a plastic bag and i imagine the smell is just from the <unk> and will fade with time
got this for my wife she has a big hp # `` laptop and it fits in just fine added benefit is my wife said it looked like a very expensive laptop bag ...
i absolutely love this bag it fits my enormous laptop just right , plus it has lots of little compartments with plenty of room for my textbooks and school supplies even with as roomy as it is , it does n't take up too much space , and it 's a perfect carry-on bag for plane rides and i love the design it 's the perfect computer bag for any student or young professional on the go
great bag and <unk> except for the strap it came apart where it was sown in days of owning it thankfully my mom was able to sow it back together on her sewing machine i really like the <unk> but would have loved the teal chevron if it would have been available good buy happy to find a laptop bag that fit my # & # # ; laptop
i purchased this laptop bag about # months ago i was weary due to some of the reviews i had read where the shoulder strap had broke on people i carry my laptop almost every day back and forth to work and i have n't had any issues with the shoulder strap this bag is sturdy , has tons of pockets and space , and holds my laptop securely the best part is that it 's super cute i have tons of people comment on how cute this bag is i absolutely love it
holds everything , is sturdy and no one else has one like it so there is no danger of someone else accidently picking up the wrong case color is bright and cheery would definitely recommend it
i have had this bag for a while now i travel a lot and i am able to get everthing i need for my mobile office in it it shows no sign of wear it matches my luggage and i have <unk> many compliments on it the sholder strap makes it easy to carry on when you are flying
this laptop bag is great it 's very classy and chic . it holds everything i need and i get compliments on it all the time i have washed it and it did n't shrink or lose it 's shape i 've had it # months and there is not signs of wear
great bag , plenty of room for those larger laptops , even enough for the those little extras colors are bold and bright , well made looks to last purchased as a gift , was well received
i have been looking all over the internet for a bag for my large hp laptop i wanted it to not be dull and black i wanted it to be feminine but not frilly and be very functional this is the bag it is very well designed and made of sturdy canvass material with numerous pockets for storing cords , mouse , thumb drives , and files the picture does n't really do it justice i would suggest some pictures of the many pockets last night as i walked from work and passed a group of <unk> a young man <unk> `` that is an awesome bag ! i <unk> him , <unk> , and felt like the most awesome <unk> woman in town thank you , <unk> 's bags , you are awesome
i recently purchased this bag and i love it i was worried about finding a large enough bag , but this one fits my oversized laptop perfectly i was pleasantly surprised at the room , and all the pockets it has i 'm in college , and the large folder size sections are perfect for me i will definitely purchase from this company again
i love this bag i get so many compliments on it looks just like the picture i use it for work to carry my files and laptop and it 's perfect
i own a # . # hp laptop i searched on-line and in stores for a laptop bag that would fit both my laptop and my unique taste this bag was exactly what i was looking for ! it is sturdy , well made and has ample storage space for my power cord , mouse , and any papers i might need to carry as well i am extremely happy with my purchase
i bought this for a new sony vaio f series laptop - # . # `` based on previous reviews , i was hoping this would be roomy enough the laptop -lrb- which is a beast of a desktop replacement -rrb- fits perfectly i am especially pleased with the design of the case -- in addition to the laptop compartment , there are several well placed pockets and document holders the material is surprisingly sturdy
i needed a new computer case for our vacation i love it i got so many compliments from total strangers it is comfortable to carry and fit my computer perfectly amazon is my favorite website
just like the other reviews , i just love , love this bag it fits my # . # laptop perfectly and i like the extra compartments it has it 's very sturdy and i like the flexibility of using the handle or attaching the strap i also feel that my laptop will be very secure in this bag , when i am carrying it around please keep making this bag , i may have to buy a second one for my work laptop great color also
i am a huge alabama crimson tide fan and i saw this and i instantly fell in love with the picture i bought one for me and for my dad for his birthday needless to say , this laptop satchel is sexy i mean when i got the first one , my <unk> dropped as to how nice it looked and how much space and room there was for anything and everything the only thing missing is big ` ol alabama <unk> a on this satchel : -- rrb-
this was the perfect case for my new laptop it has a lot of storage for those who carry a lot of paperwork or stuff it also comes with a strap if you want to carry it on your shoulder i agree with another rating i saw while considering this product that the only bad thing about this was the new bag smell other than that an awesome case , i highly recommend this case
this laptop bag is absolutely perfect ! love the color and design and my # . # `` laptop fits just right i also have had lots of compliments on it too also shipping was very fast i ordered it on a sunday evening and my item was delivered on thursday
it fit 's my over-sized laptop perfectly it 's very durable the step is bright pink like the piping it 's super stylish has nice roomy pockets that are well padded i seriously adore this bag
the laptop bag is true to size for a # & # # ; laptop it is really pretty and fits the women of style i love it and glad i made the purchase
loved the case very stylish and comfortable on shoulder lots of room for my dell latitude , cord , mouse , files and more a good choice for women who want some style while meeting with clients etc .
the bag is exactly what i needed and nice to look at too i needed pockets , secure placement of my laptop , plenty of room for files and pens the bag itself does not add a lot of weight the fabric is easy to care for while the pattern will allow it to look good even after i have beat it up very happy with it
this case is functional and looks nice however , it has a horrible toxic smell to it and it is too big i left it on my bed and now my sheets smell like <unk> i am giving it one star because it can not be <unk> i would not recommend buying this product unless the manufacturer fixes this problem i am returning mine
does not fit a macbook pro very well smells very bad , thought the smell would dissipate , but continues material is not the typical neoprene like purchased in the past
i like the look and the protection this provides my laptop , but it took over a month to be able to be in the same room with it due to the overwhelming plastic smell it 's really bad
i read several reviews before purchasing this sleeve and was a bit leery of it however , i am quite satisfied with it i use it for my # & # # ; macbook pro and it still has a bit of wiggle room the only reason i gave it a # is because there is a slight smell as indicated in other reviews and i wish it were a little thicker i do carry this in another bag though so the thickness is not really an issue
this case is really cute and i really like it a lot , but the blue color in the picture is a little more vibrant and baby blue than in real life i still like it but it is a slightly duller , darker blue in reality it fits well but i wish it were a little more snug on my # `` macbook overall i like it and would recommend the case
i use this case to bring my laptop everywhere of course it 's the only one i have , but i do n't feel the need to ever purchase another i use it for my thirteen inch macbook pro , and it 's wonderful my only complaint is that i could n't find it in purple . :
it fulfills exactly what i wanted , a case just to add another layer of protection while it 's in my backpack full of other books i bought it about # months ago and it 's still has n't ripped at all
its a good case that is padded but not to thick however the lip sticks out on mine and i wish it stayed down it should have velcro it 's tight for a # . # `` ultra book laptop would n't recommend if your laptop is thicker it would be tight exactly what i needed
using with # . # `` thin asus laptop i do n't think mine came with the cloth , but that 's not a deal breaker , as i already have one i 'm willing to bet the company would ship one if i informed them the sleeve has no zipper , which i kind of like there are no hard surfaces to scratch my computer the padding is also nice so far i do n't intend to use this as a stand-alone carrying case , so it will mostly be housed within my book bag will update if it does n't stand the test of time , wear , and tear
i was reading one of the reviews of this bag and could n't agree more with the buckle issue the buckle comes loose very easily and then all of a sudden the bag is to your feet this was happening to me over and over again even when it was just my computer and nothing extra in the bag i contacted incase and they said to take a picture of the issue and ship the item back i went ahead and did so and received a brand new version of the bag while it was nice of them to replace it so quickly it does me no good as it is a design flaw and not an issue with just one bag now i have a computer bag that will sit in my closet and gather dust since incase wo n't issue a refund and the same problem will keep occurring while i love the design of incase products the functionality and lack of customer satisfaction just is n't worth it for me to purchase from them again
the clasp on the strap does not stay closed i had to tie a knot to get it to stay at a certain length or it would slip out to full length and be way too long otherwise , bag is fine if you do n't need to carry much more than the computer itself , i would look for something smaller and less bulky
i have a # `` macbook pro -lrb- mid # model -rrb- , which fits perfectly inside the notebook compartment inside the bag there is a velcro strap that secures the laptop inside the compartment , without rubbing against the laptop itself the compartment is lined with a smooth material that will not damage the macbook 's aluminum finish , which is an important detail the bottom of the bag can expand if necessary to carry bulky items there is a pocket inside that fits an ipad -lrb- although i do n't have one to try -rrb- there is also a zippered pocket with mesh pockets inside of it that can hold video adapters , mice , pens , etc . the strap is adjustable in length , but not removable lastly , the main flap is held down with both plastic buckles and velcro this makes it difficult to open with only one hand free , but holds the bag closed very securely i ca n't recommend this bag enough if you own a # `` macbook , or any other # `` laptop that 's close to the same dimensions
maybe my netbook is an odd size i ordered another bag and it is too small can someone please measure this one my netbook is a samsung n # but is # / # x # inches
this item arrived very quickly and has a beautiful picture -lrb- as featured on the site -rrb- on the front and back of the case however the description said it would fit an ipad and i was disappointed to find out that it is in fact much too large for my ipad , so it is going unused
i still have it , it just looks a little dirty though there are also white like stars or big x that cross over the top , at first i though it was a knock off but i still dont know what to make of it because its on both sides i think i will take some color <unk> to the hats or something to spice it up a bit i didnt want the & # # ; over done & # # ; look of the others and would have liked this a little better if <unk> were more contrast
it looks cool , is not protective though if you drop your tablet while its in this than its still gon na break but its a very big case , so it fits all the xtra large tablets looks exactly like the picture
i was so disappointed to find the cover with only one side design . the other face is simply black . my ipad # is barely zipped up with it so i guess it 's ok
looks pretty cool holds a laptop/tablet perfectly does n't fit a power cable so well with my # inch laptop does n't look as great as this pic looks a little cheaply faded
this thing holds my asus <unk> slider tablet perfectly it 's padded enough that i do n't have to worry about tossing my tablet into my bag between work , home , the car , wherever it also has enough space that i can toss some papers in there alongside the tablet w/o any issues i almost want to order more in other patterns just to switch it up
like all the kindle covers and i tried and returned , this came with a funky , rubbery , chemical smell it definitely is larger than an ipad , but it 's kind of nice that i do n't have to force it in and out fits my ipad with logitech thin keyboard very easily simple , cute design
my ipad is in this sleeve whenever it 's not in my hands it keeps it clean , dust free and protected it is roomy inside , but i prefer that - i can slide my ipad in and out without it being too tight some <unk> prefer something a little snugger works for me the design is simple , yet elegant very <unk> still making a statement
i totally love this case i use it for my ipad , and while it is a little long , it fits my ipad even with a hard case on i totally love the cute design and it is very functional well worth the money
item arrived quickly , brand new . the image that is on both side and it is very cute . definitely fit my ph mini # . # ' no problem and i have the # <unk> battery
i ordered this for my ipad # with the logitech keyboard about # week ago it fits pretty good and has a little room left over for the cord i 'm very pleased with this purchase it did however arrive with a & # # ; tire & # # ; smell to it , but i 'm sure will eventually fade away i would defiantly recommend this
the sleeve is great i bought it for my hp mini , and it fits perfectly might be a little big for an ipad , i do n't know , but it 's perfect for a mini laptop i keep a few work-related <unk> and papers in with the laptop , too , so there 's a bit of room to spare i know that 's the primary information i went looking for in reviews before i purchased it and the design is very cute , too
i have an hp netbook and this case is absolutely perfect and super cute i can fit my computer cord in with the netbook when necessary this is perfect for flying because it is `` fly safe `` so i do n't need to remove my computer from the carrier
this case is a little oversized for my ipad # but i find that a good thing as i place my screen cleaner and cord in this bag when i am traveling very pleased with the product
the case is heavy duty and provides a lot of padding in addition to protecting from superficial damage i 've been using it for about two years now , and it is still in the same condition it was in when i purchased it the design is <unk> cute , as well . :
i am very happy with the case i was not so pleased with the fabric used for the edges - it looks to be cheaply made otherwise the case is just what i expected and i have no problems to report so far
it 's great and all that it says it is roomy for my ipad and cover and stylus a lot of compliments i got more for gifts for christmas
this bag ripped the first time i put my computer in it , it is really a cool bag but its made out of really cheap fabric , not durable at
this is a cute bag , but the construction is <unk> to put it kindly i carried the bag from home to the office today and the shoulder strap anchor point has already started to rip needless to say i 'm returning it the handles seem to be attached better if you do n't plan on using the shoulder strap , you may be okay buying this bag
i was surprised about the width from inside -lrb- too small & the quality is # out of ten , the color of the belt is not matching with the printed pattern i was expecting higher standards than
i really like this carry case for the print , the several pockets , etc . the one thing that is difficult is that the laptop -lrb- # `` -rrb- just fits and it is a struggle to get it out otherwise it is a very nice case just go one bigger
before i bought the bag , i read through the reviews and mostly people said that it was well padded , but in my opinion , it does n't have enough padding i do n't feel as if my laptop is protected , also i wish it was able to stand up on its own , its very slim another thing is that the pockets are very small and i had to force my charger into it , though it does have many pockets , it could be a little more spacious the shoulder strap , seems pretty weak to me , it has n't shown any sign of wear though i feel it can happen if i use it a couple more times i would have to say , it was not worth my money
i have to say it is a unique bag and the design was lovely from the research i did and reading reviews i expected the inside to have more padding but it hardly had any , wearing the strap was extremely uncomfortable i had red marks all over my shoulders by the end of the day i carried my # inch laptop in it and also was able to fit a book that was apparently a bad idea though because the seams around the zipper started coming undone i suppose i over did it i honestly love this bag for the price i got , it is just not heavy duty i would recommend putting literally only a laptop in it
this is a suprisingly lightweight carrying case with decent construction the newsprint is <unk> with random english <unk> as well as some `` <unk> `` and latin while the main pocket holds my dell xps m # laptop just fine , the outer pockets ca n't accomodate the dell # w power brick it barely holds my lenovo # w power brick -lrb- which is fairly small -rrb- the dimensions of the two square outer pockets are roughly # . # `` x # . # `` with a # `` gusset so check the size of your power brick if you planned to stick them in the outer pockets also note , the long horizontal pocket at the bottom of the case is too narrow for most ac adapters - roughly # `` high without gussets i 'm not sure what you 're supposed to put in there -- maybe cables it is not ideal -lrb- for me -rrb- to stuff the power brick in the same compartment as my laptop , so i 'm rating this # stars instead of # due to the <unk> design
i <unk> get compliments on this case , it is what it says a laptop carry case and nothing more besides for a few papers and some writing utensils nothing else can fit in the bag aka charger besides for that simple fact it 's a hot accessory and i think it 's a great buy for the price
i bought this thinking it was very cute and unique i recieved it in the mail a few days later and it was all i had hoped for the two <unk> were a rather odd picture on the back including bull <unk> and i really have to fight to get my cord/charger into any of the pockets aside from those two negatives i am still pleased with the product and have decided to keep it and continue to use it , and would still recomend it to others
i love the case , it is unique a lot of people have commented that they like the looks and have not seen anything quite like it the only drawback is that it is a very tight fit i have an older pavilion # inch -lrb- # -rrb- so it is thicker than newer laptops takes a bit of work to slide it in and then the power cord also takes work to squeeze it in the little pocket it has a battery pocket but there is no way i am going to get that to fit in overall am quite happy , just wish it was a little roomier
this bag is super cute the only problem is that i did not read the size before i bought it and it does not fit my laptop i am keeping this bag to use for other things because it is so cute
for the price , it 's a pretty decent buy i get compliments on this bag all the time the downfall is , however , that the bag seems to rip slightly around the <unk> strap area
i 'm very impressed with this gorgeous case it 's certainly a lot more fun to carry around than a traditional , black laptop case the inside padding is thick and the zippers , strap and handles seem sturdy the text is primarily <unk> and the <unk> are abstract , but you can still tell that it 's suppose to be a newspaper this case fits my # <unk> vaio e series <unk> # <unk> # -inch laptop -lrb- seashell pink -rrb- snugly with room to spare the only downside i can see is the pockets they appear to be well constructed , but i ca n't get my powder adapter into one without removing the power cord and storing it into another pocket that 's not something i would want to do every day , especially if i was in a hurry if you do n't want to carry your adapter separately or take it apart , then this is n't the bag for you
this is definitely a # star product its small and sleek and i am able to fit not only my laptop into the case but also my charger , phone charger , headphones , some pens along with a notebook if need be i would definitely recommend this product for other peoples purchase plus it is pleasing to the eyes . :
i 've had a lot of people commenting on the bag , asking me where did i buy it it 's a good looking bag functionality : # , the pockets are very <unk> i put the ac adapter in the bottom pocket , left pocket the gaming mouse , right pocket car and ac adapters for my phone , mid pocket earphone bag the main storage area can fit my ultrabook plus # fat binders from work quality : # , i like the material , it will do well against dirt and scratches do n't spill liquid on it though , it will leave visible stain i thought the bag was very well-made , but last week the pad on the shoulder strap ripped , # month of daily use
the sleeve has four pockets that are very usefull and it can carry a # `` notebook easily plus the power cord and the adapter it looks as it shows in picture
this is exactly what i was looking for a unique pattern and a comfortable bag for my baby -lrb- macbook pro # `` -rrb- to stay safe ! the shoulder strap is big enough and it has room for all my stuff i can imagine that any charger rather than macbook might not fit in -lrb- i saw some comments complaining about it -rrb- but a macbook charger fits in the front pocket very easily i am really satisfied with this purchase and highly recommend it to others . :
it carries a lap top and all accessories beautifully and we get lots of compliments on it it is well made and padded material is dense and attractive ca n't go wrong with this one
it looks and feels very durable and it is very spacious ! not to forget that it 's very fashionable . it 's a must get for college students who want to take everything all in one bag
