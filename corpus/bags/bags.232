i 've had this sleeve for a few weeks now and i love it it 's well made , fits my # . # `` and my # . # `` widescreen lenovo 's great hard to ask for more at a better price
i have been using this product for a couple of weeks and i must say it works fits my notebook really well , and the edges of the case frame out the shape for added protection the bumps on the inside provide shock support which gives me peace of mind and i also like the orange outline accents would buy again if i had another # . # inch notebook if it fit tighter just a smidgen more i would give every category # stars
good quality , works perfectly , comfortable grip seems like it will last use it to carry my # `` lenovo laptop during my long <unk> commute to and from school this does n't have a long strap for <unk> , but i did not want that
when i bought my # `` dell xps notebook , i had no idea how i was going to travel around with the thing extensive searches all over the internet found me nothing except huge bulky bookbags , all of which i can do without this sleek sleeve fits my monster of a laptop perfectly and without much effort of course , i would have liked a strap to carry it over my shoulder , but then again why would you want to do that with a # `` anyway it 's way too heavy the handles are a plus if you need to carry it short distances highly recommended for # `` laptops
i purchased this sleeve to use with my targus shoulder laptop bag this sleeve fits perfectly and it 's very stylish its also machine washable which comes in handy when you travel alot great at airport security you can just pull your laptop from the sleeve and easily slip it back it in when you clear security
we <unk> this sleeve for our son 's dell inspirion # . # `` laptop because of good reviews it fits snugly and does the job nicely i would definitely recommend it the rubber bump pattern on the inside provides a nice cushioning
i 've been using this sleeve for a few weeks for my dell d # the fit is great it 's a nice , low profile sleeve with handles if needed , i probably could fit my power supply in there , but have n't tried yet
this # . # inch sleeve is compact and provides for secure handling of laptop with flexible handle grip sleeve fits # . # inch hp laptop perfectly , but with no room to store ac adaptor if you want to carry the ac adaptor , either use this sleeve for the # inch -lrb- or use for smaller laptop -rrb- or buy the # `` sleeve
got it for my son in college to protect it as it gets taken in and out of his backpack many times a day he says it is a perfect fit and protects his laptop beautifully sturdy and attractive
i have a dell # & it fits perfect even enough room for a notebook handles are a must for any sleeve and it 's sleek design is very professional looking
i was at best buy and happened to see comparable products , but with no handle selling for $ # bucks i decided to check out amazon and order this one with handles i wanted the ability to put it in my backpack or carry my laptop on its own it 's perfect the handles are flexible , so i fold them to the side before slipping it into my backpack
i bought this simply to protect my new # . # ' sony vaio from dust and to have padded portable storage i was n't expecting too much for $ # , but i was pleasantly surprised the material is high quality and the padding inside is very nice since my notebook is smaller than the case , it helps me also <unk> my charger good deal for only # <unk>
i bought this laptop sleeve for my dell inspiron e # -lrb- # . # `` widescreen -rrb- i had to travel for work and did n't have room to lug around my trusty laptop bag that i normally carry with me this sleeve from microsoft provided good protection in a duffle bag as well as my regular backpack i also liked the handles because it made it easier to carry around before and during the security screening you ca n't really fit much more than the laptop in it , but for a trip to the coffee shop or the library it will fit the bill
my laptop is an hp # `` there was no way i could get my laptop into this case fits like a glove what a joke i needed the case for this weekend , and i do n't have time to shop at a store for it better <unk> the case
this was a attractive , reasonably priced , well constructed laptop sleeve but too small for my # `` dell inspiron # laptop i was under the impression that if it said # `` it should fit my # `` laptop not so , what a <unk>
i have a fx series gateway laptop model p- # u this laptop sleeve is too small with or without the battery pack -lrb- which sticks out the back of the laptop i actually ordered this particular bag after reading some of the reviews that said it works for the fx series but maybe the p- # u is bigger than some of the other fx series planning on ordering the <unk> # , targus # `` laptop slip case which is bigger
the microsoft neoprene case is well made and the only laptop sleeve i could find with handles i use it as an extra insulation and cushion in my laptop bag the original purpose of the purchase was to <unk> a sleeve with handles for protection when the laptop bag was not needed however , the size of the laptop sleeve does not take into account laptop batteries the gateway computer i use has a # cell batter which sticks out of the back of the computer about # inch the sleeve fits the # inch gateway like a glove without the battery , but with the battery it is unable to zip completely therefore , it is being used as an extra insulation and cushion in my laptop bag it still may be used for toting the laptop around , but the size limit is disappointing -lrb- t -rrb- <unk> -lrb- s
i looked everywhere for a sleeve that would fit a # `` every time i thought i found one , i would read the reviews and people said it did n't fit then i found this it fit perfectly i bought it for my husband who takes his laptop to work , but does n't want to carry that big bag my # -year-old started calling `` <unk> 's purse `` . his laptop fit great it 's slim the handles do n't look like a purse , but are sturdy and you can fit papers and a few other things in there if needed i am very happy with this product
i had a tough time finding a laptop case that fit my hp # . # `` this one is a perfect fit - just like a glove i also am able to add minor items such as paper or even the power charger i wish the orange color was n't so bright , but that 's irrelevant it does exactly what i bought it for - in my book that 's perfect
very happy with this product i have shopped all over -lrb- in stores and online -rrb- for a sleeve for my # `` hp pavilion laptop other products did not fit properly , too loose , too tight , etc . this one fits my particular laptop perfectly and the handles were an added bonus the price sealed the deal
this laptop carrier was exactly what i was <unk> for the fit , color <unk> and size were perfect in stores -lrb- best <unk> <unk> ... to name a few -rrb- did not carry any with this <unk> the <unk> they did have were up to # and # dollars and nowhere near the <unk> i live in chicago and with all of the stores and places to buy covers , i could not find one anywhere i went to where i have always had success , amazon , and found exactly what i needed and wanted i would purchase this item again
this laptop sleeve has just the right fit for my new # `` macbook pro with a little room to spare at the top it is well padded all around the zipper opens widely so that it is easy to slip the laptop in and out the handles make it easy to carry alone and pull out of another carry-on bag quickly and easily it went through airport screening without a problem while my laptop remained safely inside there are no extra pockets for cables , etc , but please not that if you want any laptop sleeve to go through airport security unopened you can not put anything else in the sleeve with it
i did n't expect the quality to be what it was the padding is thicker and safer than i thought it would be i have a dell with the raised battery and was unsure if it would fit and it did with just enough extra room
even though the description says it does , this is a lie , if you are looking for a case for a # `` laptop skip this one i had to return it
the leather is a bit stiff but hopefully it will soften up with use looks nice , professional , shoulder strap is comfortable laptop fits in but slightly too tall to allow me to close the zipper -lrb- i 'm ok with this but it 's something for a buyer to consider -rrb- lots of storage pockets good value and i would buy it again i 'm retired now but wanted a nice briefcase for traveling and hopefully this will be my last one
this is a really great case it is just the right size , not too big and still lots of room for paperwork , a tablet , and small accessories it seems very sturdy , but not too heavy it appears that it should last a long time although it is mostly leather , it is obvious that some of the trim is at best , pleather that is why i gave it only # stars
this is a great bag well made and easily fits my # & # # ; laptop and ipad and tons of other items with no problem my husband uses this -lrb- it does n't fit his # & # # ; alienware laptop , but that is quite large . it has a great <unk> body for him and looks manly , not like he is carrying a chick bag at any rate , it seems a nice leather and he hopes it lasts for years to come
this is a very nice laptop case i bought it for my husband 's birthday and he uses it every day nice leather and the double compartments come in very handy
this is a top quality case that has a very substantial leather my husband loved it i think it 's a great pic for him because he uses his every day to haul stuff back and forth from the office to the courthouse this seems to be made substantially enough to endure that kind of wear i wish the case was a little bit bigger so that he could stuff an extra file or two in it
i just received my laptop case yesterday i have had several laptop cases and the handles have all broken this laptop case is more durable than the others all of my folders and notebooks fit as well as my laptop it 's very professional and i already love it i would definitely recommend this to a friend or colleague
highly recommend this product and the vendor product arrived on time and is of great quality i use it to carry papers and my computer at work highly recommend this vendor
the leather and workmanship are excellent this is a classic accessory that ought to last for many years the inside of the bag is great - well organized , can hold all business items , has soft padded removable section
i love red so this is somewhat <unk> but the deep chinese red is lovely and the leather is excellent quality my laptop fits well in the compartment and is <unk> from bumps and bangs yet there is room for my work and other things in this bag i have used many industrial looking computer bags and this beats them out for quality , looks and durability
i was looking for a computer bag that could double as a purse -lrb- as opposed to looking like a laptop bag -rrb- and was having a hard time finding one for my # & # # ; macbook air finally decided on this one i absolutely love it and i get compliments on it all the time too it is a little bigger than it looks in the picture but not bulky very slim but plenty of room for cords , documents , small <unk> and a computer it looks fantastic and the quality is really nice i am very hard on things but it still looks brand new months later i love the magnet closure on top i plan to pick this out in a few other colors
okay , i first saw a version of this bag from a friend , and i knew i had to have it i have a # `` mac book and the only thing they sell that fits those are `` man bags . so when i saw that they made one that fits my laptop , i bought it right away let me just tell you i do n't go anywhere that someone does n't comment on this bag it has plenty of room to put the power cord , pens , some paper or notebook i just wish it had an outside pocket to stuff my <unk> etc . but i do n't care i am in love with this bag
i bought this to keep my wacom bamboo tablet in and it fits perfectly i 've also used it when travelling for my # `` macbook it did have a funky odor to it when i first opened it , but it has since gone away
very nice product perfect for # inch laptops and particularly the new unibody macbook my macbook fits very snugly in the sleeve keeps the macbook safe from <unk> when i put it in a bag with other items
bought this case for my unibody , <unk> # `` macbook -lrb- latest generation at time of review -rrb- it fits excellently , stretching slightly along the shorter dimensions with a little play along the length , and the flap lays flat <unk> nicely and works equally well on both sides ; no zippers means no scratching anything the <unk> colors are attractive and work well together the best simple case for the new macbook i can imagine
this is a great way to carry your laptop around very quick access to your computer , yet good protection too thick neoprene to protect your laptop from scratches , but overall , very small , and can fit in any bag or backpack also kinda fun definitely would buy this one again , if i ever needed to
i could not have asked for a better case for my new macbook -lrb- not the new macbook pro btw -rrb- it protects my laptop from spills , and of course damage , so this was a great purchase i did n't think i would like the color so much but now that i have it , i like it it 's different and not your typical color for a case so i also recommend this case for that <unk> person
this case is awesome i lost it for # days and was freaking out but <unk> it i 've even gotten it pretty dirty and simply through it into the washing machine with my regular laundry
i bought this to protect my macbook -lrb- polycarbonate casing not the newer aluminum -rrb- so i can toss it in my carry-on bag while traveling it is not overly thick , but has enough padding to protect the computer from a little bit of rough handling of my carry-on the case fits snugly with no gaps , but it slides on and off easily , the flap closes well and stays flat , and it does not have any metal parts to scratch the laptop i did not have to take the macbook out of the case for the airport xray <unk> the case does not have a pocket for the power cord , but i just rolled that up and carried it separately , and it was n't a big deal it would have been nice to have a pocket for the power cord , but then i probably would have had to remove it for xray screening i also like that the case opens on the short side , and the <unk> color looked better in person after looking at cases for a long time and doing careful research , i am very happy that i selected this one i 'd buy it again and would highly recommend it to others
it has a critical problem typical security lock for a laptop does n't fit into a hole because the protection shell does n't provide enough space for a lock , instead you can only see the hole so if you need a security lock , do not buy this if you do n't mind , you may want to try
it does a good enough job at protecting my macbook , but after awhile my battery pack became warped i think that it was due to the fact that the case made my macbook very warm , and the warm air had nowhere to go
i ordered this product after reading the excellent reviews and put it on my new macbook to find that it would not close completely with this shell on it i am returning it
the case does not allow opening of the laptop past # degrees it also does not allow easy access to the usb and other ports the leather case looks nice and the color is good , but it just is n't functional
this cover is beautiful to look at -lrb- red -rrb- and fun to hold the increased surface gripping power makes it easier to remove from my bag and secure enough to carry with just one hand i gave it just # stars because the bottom half does not fit well in the back and i was forced to use a double sided adhesive to secure it the case may not be perfect but i very happy with it
i was looking for something affordable -lrb- since other cases run for $ # + -rrb- the stylish to protect my new laptop this has been the perfect product the only issue was like most others , that you can only move the screen back so far , but it really has n't been that big of a problem plus it 's soft and more cushiony that a regular plastic case
this case is a perfect fit , and it looks great i really did not want to get the normal hard plastic cases , what protection is that this one has a soft material on the inside and does not cover the vents it went right on , and fits my macbook # , # perfect i am so glad i got i did n't settle for the <unk> what a price , for the quality and style you get this is a must have , just get it
i love how the shell fits and looks on my new macbook -lrb- one of the last of the white # `` type -rrb- i used the computer for the full battery time , and the ventilation holes take care of the macbook getting very warm i like what another reviewer mentioned about the leather making the macbook less likely to slide off a hard surface my favorite color is red , and the price was right at about $ # less than incase 's slippery plastic cases i am very satisfied and recommend it thanks to all who reviewed it before
put this on my white macbook left macbook charging on <unk> # + feet above concrete floor not sure if i left it partly hanging over the edge , but during the night one of our cats pushed it off , smack onto the concrete floor macally case has a small ding where it hit it flipped off on impact but the white plastic macbook was just fine , no cracks , damage , or issues have the same case for a macbook pro makes that computer cumbersome but on the macbook , it actually fits perfectly , and the <unk> finish of the shell makes the computer very easy to grasp best $ # i 've spent in forever
i get soooo many compliments on my new mac , but most importantly the cool red cover everyone loves it , including me of course its unique and beautiful some of my friends have already went out to buy theres after seeing mine
this is a great purchase if you are looking for a shell that # -rrb- protects your mac sufficiently , # -rrb- looks good , and # -rrb- is n't expensive no problems here with fit , overheating , access to ports , or limited range of how far it opens
i was skeptical about this product but my son loves red and i did n't want to see the computer get all scratched up what a surprise how easy it fits on the laptop and how nice the soft leathery cover feels when you use it does n't <unk> any use of the computer and i do n't notice any additional weight it adds also does a good job helping the computer feel cool on your lap should hold up well over time but only time will tell on that
put this on my macbook and have a new look . great protection and fits perfectly . thinking about getting the black one too glad i did n't go for one of those plastic covers , this one feels great
bought this for my new white macbook the white mb is prone to scratches so i ordered macally instead of the speck i heard terrible stories about the speck with scratches and all got the red and it was a breeze to install the top and bottom piece snaps into place and now my laptop is fully protected from scratches and dings plus , the white and red combo looks awesome
while this bag does provide some great features , it is also terribly heavy the bag alone weighs about as much as the stuff i 'm putting into it -- a laptop and a couple of writing pads & utensils if you are looking to only carry a few things , try another product ... this thing is heavy and big
this bag fits and protects my mac book pro # `` perfect there are plenty of pockets and places to put things like travel mouse , cables and the nice pocket at the bottom for the power adapter the materials are top quality and i have no fear of damaging my mac will inside this bag i do however wish the file folder area was a little more <unk> for my <unk> <unk> day planner . and also wish the there was a more <unk> place for my sun glass case i also wish their was two zippers for the laptop opening instead of one i either have to open it all the way or close it all the way and wish their was two zippers closing at the top the shoulder strap is great , though i miss the way my messenger bag fits on my hip compared to this bag i understand this is not a messenger bag and bought it so i could remove my laptop easier at the airport security this still is a very comfortable bag to carry on the shoulder , just not perfect for me
case was listed at such a good price with outstanding reviews i figured it would be a safe bet to buy sight unseen well , i was right a terrific case for your laptop only hang up i have is that there really is n't a sufficient pouch for the power cord and brick there is a small pouch across the <unk> designed for the cord but quite honestly you can not fit it all in there -lrb- not without <unk> the cable -rrb- i put the brick in the front pouch and the thicker cord in the main storage area where all the other pockets are this case fits my needs
this computer bag is great it has more room than it looks like it has its strong and the zippers are sturdy the shape of the shoulder strap makes carrying easy
i have been using this bag for # months now and i absolutely love it the construction is more solid than any other laptop bag i have handled the pockets are easy to access and the zippers have never hung i use this bag on a daily basis and have had it on numerous business trips yet the bag looks brand new i have used it with a # . # `` dell and a # `` macbook with equal success i highly recommended this bag for anyone who wants a quality bag that is built to last
i had an older version of this bag for # years and it finally gave up i replaced it with this bag and am super happy the compartments changed a bit but it 's obvious i 'll get another # years out of this one too
fits my mac book pro perfectly and i love all the extra pockets when it arrived in the mail , i was surprised by two things the amount of things that this bag could hold compared to my old bag this brenthaven bag wins , no <unk> the bag is a lot slimmer than it appears to be in photos on the internet -lrb- which is a good thing -rrb- the bag seems durable and i have been using it for about a month now on a regular basis with no complaints i 'd recommend
i bought this case for my wife for her birthday , she is not easy impressed but she really loved it it fit her macbook pro perfectly and she takes it everywhere it is built very well and plenty of storage a great deal
i have been a lover of brenthaven bags for a long time they are expensive compared to the competition , but their stitch , zipper , and materials quality makes that worthwhile i have carried my last # laptops in brenthaven bags and love them i gave my first bag to my dad who has been <unk> it for # laptops now and it still looks new my newest bag was purchased because i did not need the big bag from my thinkpad for my new macbook pro ... otherwise the old bag would still be in service this bag is awesome and serves my macbook pro very well great storage and enough extra storage fo the stuff you `` need `` to carry with a laptop you wo n't be disappointed
i bought this to use with a # . # `` macbook pro about a year ago and use it # times a week on average it has enough room to hold many accessories that i like to have along with me most of the time i have been extremely pleased with it and hope that my future laptops will be the same size so i can keep using the same case it looks very professional and is very well made the shoulder strap is also nicely padded and quite comfortable i do n't have any complaints about it and highly recommend it for the # . # `` mbp or any other laptop that fits it
just received this yesterday from a gold box deal and tried it out for the first time i was pleasantly surprised by the overall build and quality of this bag it has a nice initial appearance and has plenty of padding for your laptop it is n't leather but the surface material is a high quality weave of some kind of fiber not sure what kind but it looks nice there are a ton of compartments for holding all of your papers and files it even has a compartment for power cables , business cards , pens and pencils , etc . and it does look like it could handle a drop or two if you happened to grab your bag from a table or somewhere and it slipped out of your hand sending your laptop crashing to the floor it is a pretty good bag at this price for a gold box deal it was a no-brainer
brenthaven makes the best laptop bags i have seen on the market sturdy and functional the only thing the wore out were the shoulder strap -lrb- and the company replaced it twice for free for me in three years ! -rrb- and the zippers latch broke off -lrb- from too much use ! -rrb- do n't look anywhere else
this bag does a great job , it is well made and sturdy i read other reviews and found a couple of them to be <unk> i feel the these reviews are <unk> if you want a <unk> looking bag then by just looking at the picture you should know that this is not chic this bag has all of the functionality that anyone could possibly want at the price it 's being sold for if you want more then go spend $ # . # for a laptop bag just to get extra bells and whistles for me , this is great and the manufacture appears to be solid and concerned with pleasing its customers i highly recommend it
after # years of frequent use it still looks like new tough as nails - excellent protection , # st class zippers , stitching , fit , strap , etc . one of the best buys i have made from amazon
my macbook pro is completely safe in it will recommend to everyone only one little downside is that it feels a little bulky if i add some files and notebooks other than that it feels pretty sturdy and has a lot of pockets
it was really a large size bag , not bad for what you can do with the space but not on a day to day more like camping or really long trips nice fabric and pocket space had to return tho do to the size issue
fit everything i needed very well into case allowed me to carry my large laptop , all the cables i could need and school books while i was in college held up very well despite abuse i put the product through only small tear at corner on top of bag where zipper attaches , but easily fixed
i bought this # years ago it has some wear in the smallest pocket , but it 's holding out strong i use it to carry a medium intuos # tablet , my macbook pro -lrb- # & # # ; -rrb- , a clip board with a stack of paper and a bunch of other stuff i 've been able to haul a bag of dog food with room left over for a block of cheese and <unk> it 's really big it 's almost like a bucket you can carry on your back it 's comfortable , durable , and i wish it was n't out of stock otherwise i 'd get another one
i purchased this backpack last year , and it has been the best purchase i have ever made as far as bags are concerned i can practically park my smart car in it , it has so much room seriously though , i am a <unk> and it fits my practice <unk> and all my practice equipment in it with the exception of my <unk> , plus my lap top and books its rugged look , and canvas material hold up to even the most harsh abuse i do n't know how many times i have overloaded it , and it still looks new
i really liked this laptop sleeve , but there is no way i could use it because of the overpowering neoprene smell the smell was so strong that even after i hung it outside -lrb- hoping to air it out and get rid of the smell -rrb- , i could smell it in my house <unk> overwhelming nasty smell ! !
its very cramped to get a # & # # ; laptop to fit an mine actually broke the strap a month in i 'd recommend an inch or two larger to be on the safe side the fact it broke makes me suspect its flimsy
i purchased this for my hp beats laptop because guess what it matches the red and black i was so excited to receive the product until i received the package i could smell the sleeve case while it was still in packaging when i finally opened the package , it was confirmed that this sleeve stinks how bad does it stink , you might ask i washed it in the laundry # times , hung it up to dry , and it made no difference i must note that it smelled up my room even more when i hung it up to dry essentially , this is similar to throwing $ # down the toilet save yourself the trouble
did n't take long before i got it , open the box took the sleeve out and it smelled i guess they use a little too much chemical to make it , also there is n't room for the battery and cords but hey it 's under $ # like i wanted maybe if i had some <unk> it may kill the smell but i do n't i 'll just deal with it till then and that is all
i bought this to fit my # `` dell inspiron i # <unk> # laptop the reviews saying this case smells very strongly of neoprene is correct it does <unk> pretty badly right out of the package , so i hung mine outside to let it air out for a few days now i do n't notice or smell the neoprene which means no headaches this case is just what i wanted -- something soft to protect my computer when i put it into my backpack i think the <unk> closure is pretty unique and i am able to carry the laptop holding only the flat belt though i would n't recommend this as the regular way to carry this case the case does have stretch to it , so it fits over my computer without leaving extra space for it to move around i like it a lot and i think this is a nice soft inexpensive protector for your laptop
fits my laptop really good but it gets dirty really fast and i find myself dusting it off a lot and stuff but other than that it is a cool product and i would buy it
great to carry your laptop with your <unk> and other stuff yet to avoid any scratches the material seems to be made of decent quality to protect your laptop i used this with my # `` acer timeline and # `` asus and they both fit perfectly highly recommended ! !
when i first got my laptop i spent hours looking for a quality sleeve that offered a decent amount of protection the sleeve is made of a wetsuit material and fits snugly around my laptop it does well to keep the dust off as well as absorb mild impacts for the price this was just what i was looking for
i absolutely love this sleeve i wanted something that did n't stand out too much as a laptop sleeve , but was still cool , and that 's exactly what this is i love it , and it fits my laptop even with it 's additional hardware cover
i use a case when i throw my laptop in my briefcase or backpack this case fit my # . # `` sony vaio like a glove its foam is just cushy enough to protect from scratches , etc . and provide a <unk> of shock protection the <unk> closure ensures that a faulty zipper wo n't allow it to fall out unexpectedly ca n't beat it for the money
this laptop sleeve is great it fits my # . # `` hp laptop absolutely perfectly keeps it safe inside my backpack from my other items shipping was fast i would definitely recommend this item to a friend
i bought this for my boyfriend and he loves it yes , the smell is very strong when you first get but it goes away with time so it is n't a big deal and he said he did not mind his laptop is a # `` hp and it fits it very snug it allows him to put his laptop in his backpack when going to classes to keep it safe from scratches or any dirt its awesome for the price he has had it for almost over # months and it still looks great
i like all features of bag and really wanted the <unk> as i had one from <unk> with retractable strap that served me for # ish years however , <unk> would not retract on one side after about # days of use i returned for another , thinking that it might be an <unk> , but # nd one broke in exactly same way after about # week i will return and get another bag i saw another review with exactly same story i dont see many bags with this retractable strap , maybe they are difficult to make reliable
save up another $ # and buy a bag that will last you longer than a few weeks before you start having issues after about a month i had consistent problems with the zippers snagging -lrb- outside , curved zipper ... not main one -rrb- and the shoulder strap refuses to retract unless i smack the side of the bag it looks like the zippers are snagging on the inside stitching from one of the interior walls really dumb design to have a stitched seam inside the bag so close to where the zipper tracks are it 's actually a little on the bulkier side too it 's sturdy and provides good protection , but the loss of functionality in the strap and <unk> zipper issues really puts me off enough to be purchasing a new bag
i 've had the older version of this bag for # years , and i & # # ; ve been very happy with it however with all of my business travel , it 's starting to look worn and the smart strap does n't like to retract anymore i purchased this new version as the replacement several of the pictures of the bag here are incorrect , and are of the old model the new model is missing three zippered pockets , the plane ticket pocket , several card pockets , and the cell phone pocket -lrb- i don & # # ; t really care about the cell phone pocket -rrb- this bag feels lower in quality than the original model i & # # ; m very disappointed that the pictures do not match the product had the pictures been more accurate , i probably would have purchased a different product
i bought this bag because it had the normal storage areas for laptop , accessories , and files and becuase it had a retractable strap unfortunately , the retractable strap failed after about a month
this is the second one of these bags i have owned the first was the smaller version but still had the same issue with the strap not retracting well and eventually not at all it is a functional bag , however if you are just looking for a durable , day to day work bag this will do fine if you travel alot as i do , you may want to look at something a little more tsa friendly there are some great design aspects that could be improved on by combining them with some of the other tsa approved designs the combination would be the perfect functional business travel case
this is a great briefcase in theory i have had one other one that worked perfectly this time the retractable strap did n't work from the beginning i still am using it i 'm disappointed
i 'm not sure why other companies have n't used retractable straps or why this seems like the only bag solo makes with it , because it 's genius i travel all the time and have gotten the strap caught on airplane seats , chairs , etc many times the main compartment is very big - holds my computer plus a layer or # of <unk> , plus the # other pocket areas means it holds a lot -- retractable strap is awesome -- a lot of space ! -- reasonable pricecons -- the bag is very heavy on its own -- main section is not collapsible , making it wider than other bags -- have not figured out if it is possible to adjust the strap <unk> , worth it
this item is great i love the various compartments and the retractable strap but it is a little bigger than i expected i would say that it could fit a # `` computer but the protection seems to be sufficient for a smaller computer -lrb- mine is a # . # `` -rrb- all in all , i am happy with this case
i was specifically searching for something that i could carry a lot of paper <unk> and this fit the bill perfectly if you do not need something with a lot of space , there are briefcase options out there that are much lighter and a tighter fit i 'm giving it # stars because i searched and searched for something / anything with extra space and it is hard to find i did n't want a backpack , though that may be a good alternative for some plenty of space for paper <unk> and power <unk> smart strap is a nice <unk> than adequate protection for your <unk> <unk> very <unk> extra space for files is in the same pocket as the laptop so you ca n't get to the laptop without removing all your paper files
this bag is just as advertised had no trouble with the & # # ; <unk> shoulder strap , & # # ; even though others did although i did not buy it for this feature , i find i use it often when i need another hand
i like this bag even tho it is too heavy with what i carry in it to use the shoulder strap seems well made but have only had it a month
i was hesitant by the reviews that said the strap breaks easily but so far so good with mine i love the organization it provides , its not to big or cumbersome but yet it holds everything i need it to very nicely
looks great , very stylish lots of pockets very roomy , larger bag than you might expect from looking at the pictures well padded for computers and electronics , construction feels very solid thick canvas and metal snaps indicate a quality product that construction does make it a little heavier than your average bag of that size if i have a quibble , it would be that the shoulder strap could use a little padding
