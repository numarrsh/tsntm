perfect size - everything fits snugly so it does n't move around even though it 's fabric it 's really thick and there 's a nice soft lining so my lap top feels protected it 's super slim and fits well into my tiny backpacks and bags i also have a magic mouse and there 's a pocket that 's made perfectly for it
i actually use this more since it just holds my laptop than i would when i had a larger bag that held the mouse , charger , cords , etc . with this cover i & # # ; <unk> & # # ; and then worry about if i need all my other junk later nice feel ... snug
i have a hard case on my macbook and this sleeve still fits the fit is more snug of course but i prefer it that way it has more wiggle room when just the computer is in there the cell phone pocket fits my lumia # perfectly in length and width to give you an idea on the size , and the flap closes when both my computer and phone are in there the bigger pocket is too small for the power cord but could definitely store headphones , usb cables or a small notebook i do n't like the elastic band because it came a little loose and will more than likely stretch out more as time goes on also be warned that if you were expecting a dark gray sleeve , like i was , the actual color is a little lighter than the picture all in all a good sleeve , especially for the price
i just wanted a sleeve to put my mbpr in while it was in my backpack , and this fit that need perfectly its made of very soft felt , and lined with an almost <unk> material fairly short review , but it does exactly what i needed it to do , and looks pretty good , which does n't hurt
love the backpack feels great when its on , comfortable and spacious the main problem i <unk> is the middle compartment 's zipper sometimes comes of track if i keep both zippers zipped to the spot it always pulls apart its fine but i feel like the problem will only get worse also the pocket inside the laptop compartment has an odd flap that holds the mp # cord and i never use the option to put my mp # player in there so its kind of a nuisance otherwise its a decent buy maybe $ # cheaper cause of the zipper issues
there are three pockets one for the computer , one for various small items -lrb- pens & such -rrb- and the main pocket what 's been most disappointing is that the zipper on the main pocket does not hold consistently it repeatedly splits even when there is little in the backpack not sure if this is a manufacturing issue or design , but i do n't find it on the other pockets more a nuisance as i can usually get it to hold after several attempts , but i have not tested it while riding a bike or out where i could really lose valuable contents . other features are nice
the item was as described and what i wanted one of the main concerns with these items is the long term durability and while it looks good , only time will tell but , i do not think there will be any unpleasant surprises
i was shopping around for a laptop bag to hold a larger screen laptop but one that was so big that it was just as heavy as my current backpack this fit the bill i looked at more expensive backpacks and most were too big for what i needed i wanted something that was big enough , had enough pockets and storage , but did n't weigh a ton -lrb- my laptop is heavy enough already -rrb- the computer fits perfectly in the slot i have room for the few cables -lrb- power , ethernet - just in case -rrb- and a few paper files and something to write with this is the same amount of stuff i had in my old bag and it felt about # lbs lighter the mesh pockets are large and can hold large bottles i have not used the audio interface simply because i have n't had to yet but i 'm looking forward to in on my next trip
i can now carry all of my ridiculously heavy textbooks and my laptop comfortably ! it has plenty of room so i can carry my change of uniform for work in one bag too it has everything i need and more and does it all without straining my shoulders much like other bags it feels just like another extension of myself when i use it
the zipper is metal scratched the crap out of my macbook air returned it the day i recieved it great fit , great feel , but really bad zipper and very hard to avoid scratching
the case itself is pretty neat , good padding and lives up to its description the real problem is the zipper ; you ca n't get your mbp to fit in the case easily , it takes a little time to get it in if you do n't want the zipper to scratch your macbook so , it 's not very convenient if you were in a rush and needed to put your macbook in its case quickly so far , the scratches on my macbook were n't too bad , no physical damage , just a few scratches that would disappear if i rubbed on it the case does its job , it 's just a bit of a hassle to get on the zipper also smells pretty bad , you judge for yourself
both previous reviewers are correct i noticed the same things with fears of the zipper issue and having to finger guide it to seat down in that corner it is very well padded , and nice looking , made with quality but i 'm not sure i want to fuss with it in worries that the zipper may scratch it seems like it would eventually i have n't taken it anywhere yet with my mac inside of it eh , i may return it
i like this for my macbook air it fit more snugly than i was expecting , with has its pluses and <unk> -- for me , overall , a plus i like that it has an exterior pocket and soft interior
the padding is good and the is a pocket on the inside . it is snug on my macbook air but i have a speck cover on my computer and it still fits . i like that it keeps everything from moving around and the padding is excellent .
carried my late model macbook pro retina on a fairly long trip across mexico by bus you just have to make sure the zipper does n't scratch the computer this is pretty easy though ... you just have pay attention when your taking the computer in and out of the case it gave me some piece of mind when the rains hit i kept the case inside my pack and under an umbrella as best i could but a couple of time the pack got pretty wet but the computer stayed nice and dry i do n't consider it waterproof but it 's a good insurance policy against water damage the case is lightweight and well made
it is a very pretty bag however , there are no storage compartments of any kind i 'm used to having compartments in my computer bags you should have some way to let people see a picture of the inside of the bag i sure i 'm not the only person who <unk> compartments in their bag
i ignored the reviews that said this bag did not have any compartments thinking i do n't need them , but actually it would be very nice to have compartments for my mouse and power cord at least not sure how long the construction will last either as it seems a little frail
i got this as an inner sleeve for the larger carrier i have for my laptop just a bit more protection this sleeve fits like a glove i love it i would not recommend this as a primary carrier but for and inner sleeve it is fantastic
this bag is the perfect fit for my new # & # # ; hp laptop it is stylish , protects the laptop well , and has both hand and shoulder straps it arrived promptly , was securely packaged and was the perfect buy for me
the bag is cute , but looks cheap <unk> worst of all , it starts to fall apart immediately upon using it the black on the & # # ; leather & # # ; literally starts to come off and white shows from underneath the handles and any part that you touch frequently turn white while other parts remain black it looks <unk> i am extremely disappointed with this purchase
i like the fact that it 's purple but the material in the bag is too loose hard to find my stuff in the bag the loose material gets in the way
purse is so cute , lots of room and lots of pockets , but it smells so bad i tried to air it out , clean it with vinegar , even put room air <unk> in it but its still so stinky i 'm embarrassed to go out in public hoping in a few years the smell will be
i initially like the bag , however it broke after a little less than two month 's use one of the metal parts that holds the straps together to allow the bag to convert to a backpack just broke off i still use it as regular bag although the straps are too long now and ca n't adjust because of the missing piece i really needed a backpack so i will look for another brand of convertible bag i would not recommend it
love the color and feel of the purple outside very rich looking but one outside zipper on pocket came off instantly i was able to reattach it and since it is only for decoration , did n't bother returning the inside lining is very dark and loose so difficult to find things used for a christmas trip to new york city and the backpack feature was perfect
this purse is great it has lots of pockets , it 's a nice size -lrb- not too big , not too small -rrb- and it 's pretty i love that it can become a backpack too
i am in love ! ! i just bought this purse for my trip to vegas and i could n't be happier it 's a handbag when i want it and a backpack when i need it i want more colors now
off the shoulder about hip level you could add this belt with a buckle to the other , but then it was too long there was no way to attach the shorter handle it was roomy enough , and big enough for a nice # & # # ; lap top , but also it was not padded , so then again you would have to put it in a sleeve this just did n't meet my expectations
love the bag , however after about # weeks of use , started having small things come apart seam on the inside separating compartments came undone some stitching coming loose piece of plastic reinforcing a seam came sliding out overall , still a good bag just some minor issues with quality of manufacturing process
the quality of the materials used in making this bag is second to none i do n't like buying things with out seeing them but i was completely happy with this product the quality is better than anything else i have see out there
the case is good quality , so i would recommend it to anybody the only thing i did n't like was that the case was dirty and that made it look used
the case is just okay i had hoped for something to carry my acer c # chromebook in , but did not realize it would be such a tight fit i was barely able to zip the case with just the chromebook inside , leaving no room to carry the mouse and charging cord in it also if all you need is a zippered sleeve with a handle , then this will work
brought it for my yoga # . # in ' & the bag & zip works well but the problem is once u open it it smell really rubbery & a bit toxic
i like the case with handle and i am giving the # star for the horrible smell i have it hanging outside in # degree temperature if this rubber smell does not go away , i wo n't be able to use it and my rating will go to zero
just any other carry case that i carry around with my notebook in and out to <unk> is not like seem on the picture when you purchase , it not a case , it 's sleeve for
well , expect something decent not as hefty as my <unk> , but not <unk> , either do n't carry it by the handles ; they 're kind of flimsy fits my <unk> chromebook just fine zipper is very substantial roomy enough to carry the charging cords it comes with a piece of <unk> foam as a packing material i kept it in the case as extra cushioning still no problem fitting in the computer good value .
bought this to put my acer chromebook in it 's the perfect size and protect the computer nicely it did have a funny smell when i first got it but faded away after a few days
the case is of high quality i believe the material can be durable do n't worry about the handle if you often put your laptop with this case on in a backpack since it is soft and does n't take too much space at all however , the only pity is that the case runs small for my # -inch lenovo g # laptop i can not fully zip it i should have changed it to a # -inch one but did n't have time to do it overall , i 'm happy with this purchase
it 's very basic , but does what it needs to do -lrb- fit an acer c # chromebook # . # & # # ; inside -rrb- we do n't take it outside so i ca n't tell you about its durability , but i can confirm it has a factory smell that does n't fade all that fast -lrb- it 's not terrible -rrb-
i gave it a # , because i do n't give # s to too many things i liked the size , the color , the amount of protection and the easy of use i would recommend this item to anyone ... friends , family , etc .
this bag comfortably carries my laptop , an external cd drive , and the power cord i love it exactly what i was looking for the only issue i have is the odor , and that is why i am giving it # stars but with time that seems to be dissipating
this is a great case for the lenovo <unk> <unk> tablet it fits snuggly with room for cables i wish it were a bit larger because i purchased the keyboard and the case wo n't hold both keyboard and tablet
i like the sleeve it fits the computer perfectly and is secure the velcro handles make it easy to carry the only complaint is that one of the rubber zipper pulls broke within one week of usage
the amcase is a perfect fit for my samsung chromebook i is really nice that is has a pouch in the front so that you can carry the charger or something else the only that i sort of do n't like is the velcro the velcro starts to peel of after a while , but it is still okay overall i would give this product # stars though i still recommend this product to you
it serves its purpose nicely , protects and fits perfect and the handle and zipper work great there is a significant odor i left this outside last night and that has n't helped , it will spend some more time outside which will hopefully work i assume it will go away at some point but right now this is n't suited for inside
the case fits my chromebook like a glove , but i would prefer a stronger handle the neoprene handle feels flimsy to the touch nice zippers , extra storage pouch , a well made product otherwise
i really like this laptop case the color is true to the picture the inside is fuzzy and soft , so i do n't worry about my laptop getting scratched or damaged the handles velcro together , which is nice my only issue is that it just barely fits my # -inch laptop i have to lift the corners up and over in order to zip it up kind of annoying , but does n't ruin the functionality
i gave this four stars only because the zipper , in my opinion , is a bit tough to pull sometimes seems to be of good quality and the inside is really soft
great deal for the $ , and it is well made and worth every penny of it i just got a netbook and it fits great and there is a side pocket for accessories too i had a little problem with one side of the zipper , but it still will close entirely with the other zipper , otherwise i would have given it a five
i needed a case for a new lenovo helix and this seemed to be a good choice , mainly based on the other reviews it just arrived this afternoon , so i 'll just comment on one thing for now : fit one other reviewer i saw said it did n't fit his helix i got this just to carry the tablet part of the helix and that fits in the case perfectly however , after attaching the tablet to the keyboard , it does not fit in the sleeve i could have stretched it , but i did n't want to break it
i bought this for my wife and i have to say it is a good sleeve she likes it a lot so i have no real complaints i would recommend to others
my amcase sleeve arrived today and i am pleased with it one thing i do wish it had is a little bit more depth to allow for packing chargers in the case itself along with the chromebook , rather than having to put the charger in your luggage when traveling the fit is perfect for my chromebook and the accessories except for the charger as other reviewers have stated there is a definite odor from the neoprene but i am certain that will dissipate in a couple of days all in all , very pleasantly surprised
this product arrived to my house ahead of schedule have n't actually <unk> with my macbook air sleeve at my college yet , but the bag fit perfectly with my macbook and also too the laptop had a case from kuzy on it it 's a really snug tight fit with the macbook case on when i try to fit it in this amcase bag , but that means the laptop would be secure and safe i like the little handles on the amcase by the way it 's really sleek i think my only complaint would be that when i put the charger in the amcase it loses it 's minimalist look it feels really bulky with the charger in it maybe on the next iteration of the bag they should try to put a stretchy pocket or make that section a little bigger other than those two <unk> , i like it and i 'm satisfied i commute to work and college with the amcase so i think i 'll be in business with this thing on my person
this is a very nice case for a chromebook fit is snug and has a soft inside the zipper on the outside does fit the charger but adds a little bit of bulk overall i would definitely recommend this case the handles are nice as well
bought this for my sony tap # as no company has started making custom cases for this model it fits unit just barely , have to stretch zippers around top corners to get it to close but is getting <unk> time you can not put stylus on side or it will not fit , and little stylus holder on side tablet makes it difficult to get in sleeve but it has nice sized pocket in front that is perfect for holding stylus , charger and cords
a very good cover/protector for our new small laptop the only thing i did n't like was the side pocket was n't quite large enough to hold all the cords needed -lrb- the charger , etc . -rrb-
this is exactly what you think it is a nice little case it ' soft , it has a handle , and the chromebook fits snugly inside it wo n't provide severe protection -lrb- it 's soft , not hard -rrb- but i usually carry it around inside a larger backpack anyway , so was just looking for a barrier to avoid scratches and bumps well worth the price
i got this for my chromebook by samsung i 've already put a few scratches on the plastic cover and bottom of my chromebook and i thought this might afford a little protection it 's perfect for the chromebook and the pocket is actually large enough to store the adapter and cable
i bought this for my chromebook and it is a perfect fit but alas my hubby took over my chromebook so it does not get used guess i will have to buy another chromebook my only complaint was a strong chemical smell when i first opened it but after about a week it dissipated
it 's a good soft cover for my laptop , it probably wo n't protect it very much if i drop it , but that 's not why i bought it seems to be well made , and it fits the laptop i bought it for which is a plus :
i bought this sleeve for my samsung ativ book # . # & # # ; ultrabook laptop computer -lrb- model # np # <unk> # us with windows # pro - thank you <unk> business ! -rrb- the sleeve seems to be high quality material and i like the handles and extra pocket on the front the # . # & # # ; ativ book fits somewhat loosely in the case but better than the case logic # . # & # # ; that i just returned i plan on keeping the foam shipping panel that they include inside the sleeve in there with the laptop to make it fit better and for more protection
this case will definitely prevent your netbook from getting scratched up and will probably protect the computer from damage if you drop it from # feet it will at least prevent it from hitting a hard surface and cracking -lrb- i hope -rrb- it 's <unk> of about # & # # ; of a neoprene like material -lrb- like a wet suit -rrb- , so i 'll leave it up to you to determine how much protection this case offers i 'm unwilling to test my <unk> of <unk> on my chromebook i opted for a cheaper case because my chromebook # was only $ # , so i wanted a case that did n't make the overall purchase significantly higher ... this fit the bill perfectly it has two pockets ... the main zippered sleeve for your netbook , and a small zippered side sleeve for your -lrb- small -rrb- accessories it barely fit my charger , but did fit it i could fit in a tiny mouse and a few usb flash drive if i needed too the charger alone makes the case very lumpy on one side , but at least i can look at it and know i did n't forget the charger
fits a samsung ativ # t perfectly - the <unk> is a bit heavy and awkward to carry , and the handles on this pouch will make taking this along to the coffee shop or to work very handy seems like it 's just great
looks great , fits great , nice low cost however there is not a lot of room in the zipper pocket if you just need something to carry your mac book around in , you ca n't go wrong here happy with purchase
this computer case is great for keeping your laptop covered and protected when not using your laptop the handles seem durable and strong - makes for convenient carrying , like a small brief case the outside pocket is big enough to store papers or small devices such as usb drives , san disks , etc . or papers i recommend this product because of the price and its durability
i am currently using the amcase sleeve case to protect my c # acer chromebook for only a few bucks you get a thickly padded case with handy handle that easily zips it works great for added protection when placing into a backpack the side pocket is a little tight for ac adapters and may put too much tension on the laptop if not stored properly , so i 've deducted a star that said , for under $ # you ca n't go wrong
bought an # & # # ; one previously for a chromebook and liked it so much i bought this # & # # ; one for my new lenovo yoga # pro ultrabook perfect size for the thin yoga , not too thick like a macbook pro case i previously ordered for the yoga the zippered accessory pocket on these cases is just right for the ac adapter and any other small items you might want to store in it i like the folding handles with a small piece of velcro between to keep them stuck together the inside is very softly lined and there is adequate protection around the main zipper so your precious laptop never touches it the wetsuit like outer material is thick enough to provide the right amount of padding without making the case too bulky for a thin modern laptop/ultrabook and <unk> it 's portability the low price does n't reflect the quality and utility of this case shipping was fast highly recommended product
this is the perfect case for my c # fits perfectly , nice soft interior , and i even like the handles , which i did not expect to the only slight downside , which i believe is quite temporary , is the chemical smell from the case upon arrival i expect it to dissipate over the next few days the outer pocket nicely holds the power supply and a small mouse
what more can be said of a thing that does exactly what you expect the construction is solid , and the material is a protective neoprene type material the pocket will stretch a bit , but putting large items is <unk> anyway . . that 's a great way to crack your screen all in all . . we 're happy
i use this with my acer chromebook and i love it i was pleasantly surprised to see that it had a zipper pocket on the outside for the charger and other things
this case fits snug , soft as a <unk> butt has a side sleeve for charger it is the perfect pick up and go protection for your notebook without the extras , most of the time extras are a minus not a plus
this provides a nice cushioned case for my new computer that i can carry or throw in another bag the item arrived before the scheduled time and i have been happy with it
it 's small , light and my chromebook fits in it perfect the little side pocket is just big enough for it 's power cord and a few other small things that you might need
a great , inexpensive bag for my new # ' macbook pro the computer fits snug in the bag , and it 's very lightweight the handles velcro shut , which is a nice touch
i wanted a case for my acer c # that would also hold the cables and charger this amcase was a good choice it fits the chromebook very well , and there is enough room for the accessories it offers moderate protection , and is very lightweight the only negatives i can find are that the zipper seems very cheap , and it has a pretty nasty odor when first unwrapped from the plastic it comes in the odor goes away after a few days though i 'm happy with the amcase , and recommend it
i purchased this case to better protect and carry my acer c # chromebook when i travel the case is a snug fit for the c # -lrb- # . # `` screen -rrb- and it is a very good fit for the chromebook the padding is adequate without being too bulky , and the front zippered pocket provides a great place to keep the charger the fact that the two sides of the handle have velcro to hold them together is a nice touch the only negative was that the case arrived with a strong smell of <unk> , and it took # full days for the case to air out
people complained about the smell well , its made of neoprene which if you ever scuba <unk> you would know that smell i do n't notice it now it fits our dell notebook great and room on the side without taking out things of the usb ports i like the pocket is big enough to hold the mouse and the power cord having the velcro handle is nice
we could not find this product in the office product stores another parent suggested checking amazon i am glad we did the case is a great deal compared to the store prices and there were many options i like this one because it has handles
works great w / casecrown <unk> book cover - fit perfectly inside this case does n't add bulk at all i am so happy to find this case for my new macbook pro # w / retina it 's fit great and the little pocket in the front is perfect when i need to store the ac and ethernet adapter
this is a great price for the money you ca n't beat it i love it has handles with velcro on it to keep them together it is well padded for protection and plenty of room
i ordered this to go with the new # . # & # # ; chromebook i bought for my husband it fits perfect , looks very nice and compliments the chromebook very well nicely padded for protection with room for charger and cord the handle is nice but i think the entire case will just be picked up and carried since it is small enough this is a very well made excellent case , great price too
i got this for my google chromebook , and its a great fit i wanted something lightweight , and was not looking for enormous impact protection , just something to give it a little extra cushion the handle it comfortable , i like the zipper , and it still fits easily into my larger bag
i purchased this case for my ipad , and am very happy with it it is cushioned inside for good protection , and is roomy enough for the ipad it also looks very attractive the outside pocket is convenient for carrying the charger no complaints here i would recommend highly to anyone who wants a nice carrying case for their ipad or other # & # # ; tablet
i checked out several sleeve cases before deciding to order this one it is the perfect fit for my chromebook and is well made i am happy with this order
this is a very good case it is only # dollars more than the same case in black , but i think it 's worth it for cuteness the pocket is very handy , and they made it the biggest they could the inside is nice , fuzzy , and will protect your chromebook from damage if you drop it , it will protect , but it depends on the manner upon which it was dropped it is a very good case for the price , and better protecting than $ # sleeve cases
has a handle to make it easy to carry has # zippered compartments the main large one for the tablet there a lining inside it that feels soft no additional pockets inside the small zippered compartment on the outside only has room for cables to charge tablet and maybe a few small items you can add such as cell phone , flash drive , etc . .
it was a gift and very much appreciate it fit the google chrome netbook perfectly the handles are not as bulky as they look in the picture they fit well in your hand
this case is everything it 's cracked up to be : the samsung chrome book fits perfectly , and the outer pocket is large enough to hold the power cord and charger the case is lightweight , yet durable enough to protect your tech from bumps and bruises the handle is well attached to the body of the case so you do n't have to worry about it ripping off the double zipper is great for easy access to whatever you 're carrying
for those that want the best for their chromebook , but do n't want to drop a lot of money , this is the case for you it does it 's job and if you are lucky enough , you might be able to get your 's in a package deal like i was able to even without the package deal , it was extremely affordable ! !
i must say i was not expecting much due to the price , but was happy when it came as it was a good quality product it seems well padded to protect my chromebook from bumps and drops i will order from this company again product came well packed and in perfect condition , also within the # days delivery promise
i bought this for a # . # inch tablet pc and find it is a little <unk> fit in i think a # or # inch sleeve would have been a <unk> for my application for all netbooks , ultrabooks , and tablets # inches or smaller it is <unk> choice it has an excellent quality material and <unk> wears well over a long time the zipper has a protective <unk> it making it safe for all devices , for those who are worried it <unk> their prize possession the foam is stiff enough to protect against bumps and scrapes and there <unk> extra foam insert which will protect the screen of a tablet when inserted the side pocket is half the size of the sleeve and has about # . # inches of <unk> is great for carrying a slim bluetooth keyboard or connection chords like <unk> cables very well made of fine materials i would recommend
i just received this for my # years old daughter for her school chromebook , she loves it it was very soft and plus it has a side pocket great product so far the price and delivery are excellent !
we bought this along with a chromebook laptop for our <unk> the laptop fits perfectly in this case and the handle on this case makes it easier and safer for her to carry
my c # p fits nicely i also can put small items on side pocket that has a zipper , too i feel that it is good for light impact protection it is a big saving for the sale price plus free shipping for amazon prime members
case fitted the chromebook i bought my husband perfectly it also had room for the charging cord and we 're pleased with it and for the price , you ca n't go wrong
i originally ordered the sony case at $ # . # . i unfortunately got the case for the # `` instead , but did not try to get the # `` case after i sent it back it was flat , not too well padded , and no room for anything but computer this case -lrb- amcase # . # `` -rrb- is great - the handles help , it is well padded , compact , and it still has room for my mouse and flash drive it fits my sony # `` ultrabook perfectly
this is a nice little case , just the right size for my daughter 's mac book air she can open it easily and handle it perfectly i have n't tried putting the charger in the pocket on the side , but i 'm sure it will fit ok it also came by the delivery date
great laptop case fit my samsung ativ book # plus laptop well it also got the power cord in the front pocket and it 's nice that it zips the handle is nice as well good for light laptops
fits a bit snug over my asus x # ca -lrb- # . # & # # ; notebook -rrb- , but has enough room in the outer pocket for the charger and a mouse it 's sturdy enough to use as a carrying case by itself , but slim enough to also serve as a sleeve to be put inside a bigger bag such as a backpack completely satisfied with this , glad i bought it
i got this for my acer chromebook and it 's a perfect fit , and i can even put my tablet in the side pocket it 's lightweight and nicely padded on the inside i am very happy with it :
this case was everything i expected it to be and the sellers have great communication with clients i bought it for my new macbook and find it fits easily in my large purse or with the handle , i can carry it by hand
