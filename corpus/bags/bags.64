i bought this because i have a # `` macbook air i knew that it would be a tad big for the air but i also wanted some extra room for my stuff it is a great bag and fits a ton of stuff for its size i do have one problem the shoulder straps feel like they are too wide for me it feel like they are going to slide off my shoulders i guess i just do not have the size needed for this laptop i keep the straps as tight as possible and it seems to make up a little , but it feel just a bit too uncomfortable i posted pictures of above of where i put some of my items to help with the sizing i will be continuing my <unk> to find a better backpack for my stuff
i bought this backpack as a practical case for my laptop at home i find i use it now for my work rather than just at home the only gripe i have with it is where the straps get rolled with the velcro you 've got to be careful when you wear a sweater , it gets caught and will ruin your nice clothes that are n't velcro friendly
i have a # inch lenovo yoga and this bag is the perfect size for it i wish the side pockets were large enough to fit the charger , but that is my only complaint
this is a wonderful backpack simple and stylish love the # <unk> style lots of little pockets to put cables and drives around my only gripe -lrb- which is why i took away # star -rrb- is that the laptop pocket is oversized modern thin laptops like my # `` macbook pro does n't fit snug inside it stays loose so it moves around when i walk easy fix by placing a folded t-shirt inside the laptop compartment with the macbook
this is a great small backpack it can hold macbook with its accessories , a writing pad -lrb- or ipad -rrb- and some stationery comfortably its very lightweight and has some great styling thus it is <unk> for an everyday commute with essentials
this was purchased for a high school student she seems to be happy with it likes the ample amount of pockets will have to see if it survives the entire school year
excellently made , with a couple of reservations the back straps are quite thin they 're not nice and padded so for extended wear it might become uncomfortable and it 's also much smaller than the pictures show it 's probably suitable for a <unk> or a smaller person , but for a guy of average height i look a bit silly with this backpack this is not a fault of the bag - i should have measured it properly
plenty of pockets well laid out the comfort is pretty good except that the straps are too far apart at the top of your shoulders , so it sits funny it looks cheap , but that 's to be expected at this price it functions better than expected
generally speaking , i do not `` do `` backpacks but i needed a padded carrying case for my small work laptop and i tried all sorts of other <unk> options -- most either too flimsy or too heavy this case logic pack was the best fit it lets me store the laptop on its side , allowing the fan side to vent through the -lrb- slightly unzipped -rrb- top it is lightweight , has a slim profile , and is still nicely padded due to back problems , i need something that does n't dig into my shoulders or hold so much stuff as to be too heavy to carry there is plenty of room in the front pocket for my essentials -lrb- stuff i 'd usually have in my purse -rrb- and the center compartment has space to hold a few paper files i really like this pack amazon pricing was much better than at the office store where i would have paid literally twice as much
i wanted a slim backpack for the office instead of a briefcase this one was a good size and i like the quality of the bag and zippers the price on amazon was good and delivery was prompt
look big inside , but is no really big ... but is good for your laptop charger and # o # books . is good price and good quality , have a lot of pokets
its almost exactly what i wanted its small , can take my laptop , charger , some texts and note books , gym shorts and a lunch box very comfortable to wear no complaints , except it is -lrb- very -rrb- slightly smaller than perfect size had it been slightly larger , i could 've stuffed almost a weeks worth clothes , along with the stuff i mentioned above , and it would be perfect for short travel still fits a lot tough very happy with it
not sure why i thought this was waterproof or water resistant , but i learned the hard way that it is not other than that , the compact size , the amount of storage space and compartment is surprisingly large and satisfying i carry text books , notebooks , laptop and other electronics in this book bag all around campus and there 's no risk of anything being squished unless you slam or kick it if they had a water proof version of this , i would love to buy it
this back is really nice , have a nice design , the # & # # ; laptop fits perfect , have a lot of pockets out side for everything you can imagine the only cons is the size , if you put the laptop and two notebooks , the laptop 's charger will barely get in the backpack even if you put the charge on the bottom of it , it wont fit i have do <unk> the charger put the cables on one of the <unk> pockets , the mouse in the other <unk> pocket , and the cable with the power transformer inside the backpack
i hate laptop bags that look like laptop bags - i call them steal me <unk> : this nice , discrete backpack has a pocket that holds my # & # # ; macbook pro just fine i gave it # stars because it <unk> a tiny bit smaller than i thought it would be not small , but if i was to do it over i would shoot for something slightly bigger it will hold the laptop , a charger and a book or two plus <unk> is sturdy and well made and my mbp feels safe and snug in there
wanted these b/c i tend to load my backpack with everything little thing and the past other were always shocked on picking up my bag -lrb- felt like # lbs -rrb- with this backpack you can only carry only basics ipad and chargers + thin book and food container and # bottles <unk> and few other items fit nice overall has enough space and pockets if you want a light backpack
i thought i have anticipated that small capacity , but i was still a bit surprised it was too tight to carry things rather than a laptop , especially for a student i just graduated , so it 's still all right for me however , for a student , i do not recommend this backpack
this is perfect for my purposes - to carry around my laptop and a few spiral notebooks and essentials there is n't room for much else , so do n't expect to be able to fit a bunch of textbooks and your gym gear in this backpack construction feels solid and looks really stylish i would only change a few things wish it had more padding on the shoulder straps laptop pocket does n't have a clip to hold your laptop in , which is n't a big deal i guess but it would help the smaller pocket only has a single zipper
it hold every thing from my laptop to my tablet and my laptop cooling pad however it is quite small but it 's a computer bag so that 's fine i like the color and the straps fit perfect for my body frame
little bit on the small size . can only fit a macbook pro # & # # ; and one medium size textbook . it 's perfect for me but if you need more , get the larger model
i had to travel and needed my <unk> to fit under the seat in front of me on the plane it 's small and mighty , i had my laptop , kindle , cell phone , power cords side pockets held my glasses plus still had room for other items easy access at your travel check points .
i like the bag overall using it for both the laptop and camera as needed straps are long enough to hang in comfort easy access into the bag zippers work well i would buy this again if the need came up
i have had this bag for almost a year now and it holds up very nicely i usually load this thing down pretty good with books , laptop , ect . and i 've expected the straps to break on several occasions , but to my delighted surprise it held together just fine
i needed a case for my tablet that would hold all the accessories i searched all the normal electronic stores and everything offered seemed to be too small or too big office depot had this case which seemed to be just the right size but the price was # . # i thought that was too much so i took a friends advice and found the same bag on amazon for # . # i was apprehensive but later found out i had no reason my bag arrived on time in perfect condition and i could n't be more satisfied
been using this pack for about # months and could n't bee happier with it i needed better fitting pack for my books when riding my motorcycle to school and this did the trick perfectly i did n't need a ton of storage capacity just enough for my ipad , two textbooks , and spare gloves -lrb- but you can fit much more if needed -rrb- it has very well made compartments with solid secure stitching all around and did n't think the velcro that holds the excess straps was that important at first but ended up being a sweet little feature had it on through a # min ride i heavy rain and all my stuff stayed completely dry if your just looking for a great compact backpack and not needing to carry a ton of things , i would absolutely recommend this pack
i was searching a backpack that fits my # inches <unk> -lrb- # x # inches -rrb- and this fits a little tight , and i have enough space to storage my laptop charger an small umbrella and my laptop it looks well done , i have been using it daily , i was carrying a lot of thing and it supports everything very well , the zippers are efficiently designed it 's comfortable for the back , if you are not very tall in the front bag i have more space to carry my wallet , a sandwich , pens , and other small stuffs in the side bags , in one i put my keys , in the other my glasses i loved this backpack , i recommended it to you
this backpack is perfect for my # inch dell latitude it is not extremely large or bulky , but i am constantly amazed at everything that i can shove into it always holding exactly what i need and seldom more
case logic has a lot of years in the market , and it does a really good work making stuff for our laptops , smartphones , cameras , etc , do n't search anymore , this is it quality = great
the bag is very sleek and has protective padding for laptops , it have nice fabric as well as stylish design i love the bag and can recommend it for you
pros : looks good , quality made , light weight i was looking for a # oz or less because the weight adds up after you put your laptop , power cord , usb cables , etc . . in cons : the strap is a little too wide for a small person i went through a lot of laptop backpacks , and this is as <unk> as it can get
no more carrying the computer separately now my netbook and my ipad can travel together with my travel necessities , and totally hands free not <unk> nor gaudy , this is a <unk> plain grey bag , but it 's comfortable and practical , which makes it a winner in my book
i travel more than i like in the past i 've <unk> a rolling briefcase behind me i decided to downsize my laptop to an ultrabook i picked up this backpack to replace the rolling bag it 's a great little answer to packing away all my work essentials lots of pockets and critical spaces for big ticket items check out the available videos
this backpack is very light and slim i am a student and the reason i bought it was for the laptop compartment which is very convenient there are also many pockets for accessories which come in handy as well the only complaint i have is that there is no water bottle sleeve , however i 'm still rating this a # and definitely recommend it if you 're looking for a slim backpack with a laptop compartment its also pretty stylish -lrb- i have the dark gray one -rrb-
the case logic appears to be a strong product with many useful compartments i was impressed by its capacity ; it can load both a laptop and an ipad the product was delivered before the scheduled time i love it , and i recommend it to other buyers
it was exactly what i expected ; a very comfortable , practical and discreet backpack , made of high quality fabric with a very nice design it 's a very usefull product to carry on a notebook , folders , sunglasses , power cords , battery chargers , etc . and it still does n't looks like you are carrying a big camping backpack the seller have sent the backpack at the expected time
we bought this backpack and a new laptop computer as a high school graduation present for our grandson he is quite pleased with its capacity to carry the laptop and other accessories and necessities for his college classes
pros : bought this for my acer chromebook , ca n't be happier holds everything i need it to and i can even use it for schoolwork cons : a bit small but larger packs are available
i would n't buy this if you 're a freshman in college that takes every book and notebook to class however , i do n't encourage that this backpack is perfect if you have a device such as a laptop/tablet to take notes and to eliminate taking notes on paper which cuts down the amount of stuff you carry with you i would like to say this is great as i can carry several books and my ipad without having a bulky pack perfect amount of organization pockets too
exactly what i needed just enough room to take my macbook pro # inch , and other essential items for my class , notebooks etc . really good for crowded <unk> like <unk> etc .
fits my macbook air with a bunch of various items in the front pocket looks great and is comfortable definitely recommend this to anyone who wants a slim backpack if you are looking for a roomy backpack , you may want to opt for the bigger model of this
i really like this backback , i have one for work and one for my church music stuff they are perfect for my # & # # ; laptop -lrb- hp elitebook and lenovo ideapad -rrb- they also work well for my tablets they are rugged and compact , a really great product that i am happy i purchased
my daughter was needing a back pack for her # & # # ; macbook pro laptop and this fills the bill it is sturdy and a heck of a lot less expensive than the other & # # ; laptop & # # ; backpacks out there case logic typically has high quality products at a very reasonable price and i have bought several for different applications from local <unk> in the past
i 've gone thru dozens of bags for my macbook , and this one is the best one yet ! small bag that houses all of my equipment and is sleek , comfortable and sexy at the same time no bulk even when filled to capacity ! and lets not forget the price ... . practically a steal ! delivery time a complete no brainer lol ! thanks amazon
love the slim design , good storage and nice pockets i can pack it completely full and it does n't seem bulky on my back love the dark grey color as well it gives it a professional look , even if it is only a backpack
i was worried this pack might be too small but there is still enough room for accessories , a tablet , and some small items good for a light commuter or light load everyday use not ideal for students needing to haul thick textbooks or needing more space but i was looking for a minimal pack for carrying my macbook around town i really love the top pocket for holding a cellphone or sunglasses
the bag came in packaged really well i needed a small & light bag for carrying around asus zenbook and this one fit the bill this was n't too expensive and offered sufficient padding for the thin laptop it has enough space to throw in a tablet however , i wish there was some padding at the bottom cause its typical to set the bag on the base but i corrected it by adding a bit of cardboard will try and find some foam for this purpose ty caselogic and amazon
one of my pet <unk> with most backpacks is that they 're big , they <unk> , and they have a vast array of <unk> straps that i almost never use in contrast , this pack is a perfect example of minimalist design it has only enough space for a few items - you would n't use this for long travel or a day hike that makes it perfect for going to/from work or between meetings besides the shoulder straps and the carrying handle at the top , it has no other straps to get caught or to dangle
if you are looking for a small backpack for your laptop that you can even use with a suit without ruining it this one 's for you i like the straps and also how many things you can fit in there because of its design
i purchased this for my # & # # ; computer the bag has enough room for accessories without feeling like i will bust the seems the pack is not too large to carry around
case logic designs one of the best bags in terms of design and price this bag is small and best for the office worker with a smaller than # inch laptop with not much else to carry the only cons are the side pockets which are too small for practical use you would tend to keep keys in the upper pockets
the size of this bag looked really small when i opened it but once i added my laptop , keys , binder , and cell phone , it appears to be the perfect backpack for me and my purpose i travel some on business and i can carry everything i need in this bag ... binder , pc , mouse , pens , power cord , phone , keys it is not as bulky as some bags i have seen i have had it for a couple of months and have thoroughly enjoyed it
this backpack is perfect . it does just as good of a job , and the quality is as good as backpacks going for twice the price and did i mention it comes with a # year warranty ? i 'll be # years old before this backpack 's warranty runs out ! ! i have zero complaints
does the job very well . recommend for daily use its quite small so it limits having to carry so many books or what not very straight forward with the pictures
i commute to nyc every day from long island needed a light bag for my laptop , which is a little `` # thinkpad bag fits perfectly fine little more space that needed , but it 's minimal pleasantly suprised by the amount of pockets and compartments that this bag has bag seems nice and durable too not cheaply made i paid # . # for it on amazon the grey colored one was cheaper than black at the time
this back pack is nice it is smaller than a regular & # # ; school bag & # # ; and hold my macbook air and ipad perfectly has many compartments for other items like phone , note pad , pens and really anything else you need to travel with for work it is nice and padded as well for
this case provides best comfort for upto # . # inch laptop it is light weight and have a lot of space it has many <unk> to keep small stuff like headphones , <unk> tin , documents and papers as well as pens/pencils
<unk> very pleased with this bag it holds almost everything i want to stuff unit while maintaining a slender profile i use it to carry my ipad , charger , glasses , computer repair discs and tools , flash drives , usb hdd and other miscellaneous items
i just started back at school for a graduate degree and bought a # `` macbook pro wanted a low profile book bag , not a huge bag this was exactly what i needed nice strong material , plenty of pockets for accessories , strong wide zippers
i needed a backpack for my macbook air and a few other items for travel and this one is perfect it 's compact yet you can fit quite a bit in it i am able to put my mb air , my ipad , my travel documents , and my <unk> it has great pockets with very good space
my oakley backpack has seen its days and it was time for a replacement i dislike carrying a huge backpack on my back and i do n't like the look of a shoulder bag either ordered this via amazon quality on the bag is excellent enough to keep my apple # & # # ; laptop , a ipad , a writing pad , apple cords , and a few pens this is enough room and still not look like a <unk> on comfortable and modern sleek design love it and use it on a daily basis
i just received this backpack and am impressed by its construction -lrb- i.e . , feels solid -rrb- , design -lrb- i.e . , numerous compartments and tons of padding throughout -rrb- and overall value this is the perfect size for carrying a laptop , tablet , a couple books -lrb- depending on their thickness -rrb- , and peripherals best of all , it 's not bulky
it arrived on time in very good conditions , it really nice and confortable , not to big not to small , for me the perfect size and it has a lot in <unk> i like it
i bought this bag to carry my t # <unk> -lrb- not a tablet e.g . : ipad etc -rrb- to university the laptop sleeve fits my laptop perfectly there is just enough space to carry one , maybe two # `` binders in the main compartment with the laptop the front compartment can hold stationery and a thin lunch box the charger goes into the small side pockets if you want to carry a lot of stuff , then this bag is not for you , but if you want a slim , small and professional looking backpack then this is a very good choice
i bought it to use for paperwork and it is great it is small because it was made to carry a laptop i have gotten several compliments on it i would recommend it
my initial backpack had a zipper break on its first use , amazon replaced it quickly and i have n't had an issue in months of ownership since holds my mbp snuggly as well as headphones , my charger etc . the bottom of the bag does not provide a ton of padding or protection , but as long as you are n't throwing it around , you should be fine it will also hold a change of clothes and maybe some books or textbooks but not much beyond that would be nice if it could hold a water bottle on the outside as others have said , but its utility makes up for it elsewhere i have received many compliments on the bag and you ca n't beat it for the price -lrb- it has also become cheaper since when i bought it -rrb-
looks professional , lots of small compartments for keys and small items the main section has a laptop slot perfect for metro it is very thin so do n't expect to carry your lunch or a beverage in it
i bought this bag for it 's small size to replace my # year old targus backpack i use it for my macbook air and my ipad mini everyday back and forth to work both the ipad and the mac fit in the laptop slot with room to spare it also holds all my accessories for them as well
a perfect size backpack for a smaller framed woman used this to carry macbook , kindle and other ` carry on ' items on my last plane trip it is a perfect size , weight , without being cumbersome i am # ' # `` and had a ` regular ` backpack before , but found it <unk> pack is perfect it is also a nice looking pack
i wanted a slim , sturdy and bs free backpack this is exactly what i got little things that tell me the engineers cared , i 'll mention some examples first , when putting my macbook into the <unk> folder , the macbook never touches the zipper and hence ca n't get scratched second , the bottom of where the macbook goes , yea its padded third , each zipper line has just one zipper no frills , high quality , strong exactly what i wanted price was fantastic too
this bag is awesome and exactly what i was looking for i was looking for a bag for my # `` macbook air and this works perfectly i can comfortably fit my macbook air , a few dongles , few cat # cables , ac adapter , external optical drive , <unk> adapter , <unk> adapter with power brick , and a full screw driver set along with misc things like pens even with the bag carrying all these things it still has a very small profile and works great would definitely recommend , and buy again
i use this bag to carry my work stuff and computer , it fits great in my motorcycle top case then its just grab and go great quality material it is a small bag if you have a ton of junk to haul look elsewhere
- good size -lrb- i have my thinkpad x # & my kindle touch in this small bag - if you wan na see all the benefits , look for youtube reviews of this product - i mean , it 's & # # ; case logic & # # ; ! you cant go wrong with
love this bag just received it and packing for a trip to florida keys it fits my # & # # ; laptop perfectly and an ipad in the front outer pocket plus space for lots of other stuff no outer pocket for a water bottle but that 's ok it seems sturdy for the laptop but is not bulky looking forward to using it
do not order this case if you have an # inch macbook air this is false advertising and it doesnt fit it can not even zip up because it is about # inch too short i wish i would have read the # * reviews before i paid to have this shipped overnight this is false advertising and amazon should force this seller to edit their description because it doesnt work for macbook airs # inch
this is a ` generic ' case , and does not fit the apple macbook air # . # -inch laptop properly as advertised the case it way too big ; and the mba just slides around inside the construction appears to be good quality and i like the full length zipper pocket if i had a bigger laptop this would be a good choice , but does not work for the latest # `` mba 's
this case is well-made and sturdy , and i really like the bubble padding and the color but the reason why i 'm so disappointed , and why i give it only # star , is that this case does not fit the macbook air # . # `` as the description says vertically its too big by over an inch , which means the laptop slides back and forth and horizontally its too short by about # inch , so one side of my laptop goes over the lips and rests right alongside the zipper , causing scratches from the metal zipper scraping along my laptop this case is not made specifically for this laptop , like the <unk> would make you believe it was obviously made for other netbooks and this laptop happens to slide inside , but unfortunately not fit very well
purchased it because it was the website the kids ' teacher said to purchase off of sorry , the way kids are , if the case gets dropped , its not going to protect the chromebook other keeping the parts in the bag rather than from <unk> in a hundred pieces across the floor or pavement
got this case today it looks pretty nice in general , appears to offer good protection opened the front pocket zipper , not applying any undue pressure at all - and it came right off the track no way to get it back on either , as it 's totally sewn in seriously , does anyone even try to inspect these either way , it 's going back and i wo n't be getting another bad zipper quality and construction is a <unk> for a product like this , it simply does n't function without that
i really liked this laptop case a lot - it 's a snug fit and protective i dropped my laptop in this case , and no ill effects however , the outside pouch zipper broke only a few weeks after i started using it
this is a cheaply made product the low quality zipper broke after # weeks a few of the zipper teeth in a corner broke off , rendering the entire zipper useless , so i returned it to amazon for a refund
i ordered this case for my # mac book air # `` it fits perfectly and the outer zipper works fine however the zipper on the accessory pocket is already failing the material that holds the teeth is <unk> making the zipper hard to close not something i would necessarily return the case for but be aware the case however even with failing zipper does do a good job protecting the computer
overall i like this case , however the stitching on the side is coming undone nothing crazy and it 's not like the case is falling apart , but they are still coming undone , and began doing this after only few weeks of use also , though it can officially hold by macbook and the cord , the pocket for the cord is a pretty tight squeeze - perhaps this <unk> to the stitches ripping
i purchased this for my macbook air and it works fine not particularly sturdy or thick but it will protect the laptop from scratches and minor bumps the looks of this product are better than its substance
i love the case my macbook air fits perfectly in it and even has a side pocket for my charger theres not any room in the larger pocket where the computer goes but which is what i wanted so there would n't be any sliding room for my computer i also love the bubble material inside i wo n't have to stress that my case is unprotected but i ordered this case on the # th of december and i just received it today it took a couple weeks for the company to even confirm the order but told me it would be delivered last week so that part was frustrating but as soon as the company confirmed the order they sent it in priority mail and i got it # days later
# - the charger inside the side pocket will look like an ugly <unk> , unlike in the picture the pocket is a stretch , and it shows clearly the contour of what 's inside # - if at least there 'd be a <unk> for the shoulder after a while , i got bored from carrying it with me manually and making my hand busy it 's a cool case with nice colors , but not that practical for daily use
i bought this because i wanted the neon color to stand out from a group of laptop covers at meetings this certainly does that the macbook air # . # slides in and out of this beautifully , but is snugly but not tightly held inside ... in other words this is a really good fit the pockets can be used for small items , often missing on sleeves that are this form fitting there is about # inch for the case to close at the top if you want a sleeve that is skin tight , this is not it also the internal padding does not cover the very bottom of the case the zipper is nylon and fabric covered i would like to see this somewhat cheaper , since it is not a luxury sleeve , and many of the roocase cases are in this price range however , this sleeve can be recommended
i 've had this case for a couple of years wish it had a simple strap but when the zipper goes it is gone the plastic teeth broke , so there 's no work around so now i am contemplating a new case , something simple like this one , but not finding a good alternative i 'm reluctant to buy another of these what shall i do ? ? wait and think
this is a nice item the black and dark blue colors look pleasing i keep my # - # `` mba covered in a <unk> thin hard <unk> which adds a little extra girth to the # `` mba this fits well into the soft roocase without the hard shell , the case would be a little big for the # `` mba alone as other reviewers note i have not had the same zipper tearing problems as other reviewers noted , but i 'm very careful with the roocase after reading the other reviews this case makes for a great second layer of protection when travelling i only wish the outer pocket would be a little larger to support the mba charging cord ; hence , a four vs. a five star review
this is nicely padded and compact with no extra bulk we bought this once and the zipper broke fairly quickly , but my son liked it so we bought the exact same one again and this one appears to be working just fine
i feel my laptop is very well padded with this case i have put it in a very full carry on and it protected the laptop i have an # & # # ; macbook air and while the width is perfect , the length is about a centimeter long my main wish was that the product 's accessory pouch had more room power supplies are not thin for any laptop i noticed this before i bought it though and most cases did not even have a pouch ... so its the best choice of the low bulk options available -lrb- i did not want a bulky case .
this case does an excellent job protecting the mac air and the bubble interior macs the fit nice and snug the only drawback that i see so far is there is no strap for carrying the case the pocket holds enough for a cd or in my case the charging cords , not much room for to much else once you have the laptop inside if roocase could attach a strap to this without making it look like a briefcase , this would be a solid product
the neoprene sleeve case cover fits the hp elitebook # p like a glove no extra wasted space but still easy to get in and zip up the contrasting trim makes it easy to find the zippers the padding is very good - you know you are getting protection it 's like slipping your laptop into a surfing wet suit
case is a bit snug for # -inch macbook air just the corners are tight have a feeling that after the notebook has been in the case for a week that the case will stretch a bit side storage pouch is also snug for power adapter cords the cord that i have has retractable # <unk> ac plug had the prongs not been retractable i am sure they would wear a hole in the case quickly black red color combination is very classy looking
i was thoroughly pleased with the service i received although they made a mistake they quickly resolved the issue i also like the quality of the product i purchased and would recommend it to any one
newest mac air # . # fits well seems pretty sturdy as well i got blue and the color is nice has a bit of tire smell hope it dissipates
i noticed that this item was less expensive than the listed price for the chromebook roocase sleeve , and checked the dimensions they were identical , so i decided to pick this one up when received , i noticed that the description was for a more generic item the chromebook fits in just fine , and it 's snug and does n't rattle around the zippered pocket is nice to put the ac adapter in i 'd highly recommend this case to anyone needing a sleeve for their ac # chromebook
i like the extra padding that comes from the <unk> neoprene interior , but i felt it needed more padding along the bottom edge i cut a small strip of stiff foam to fit the bottom and that did the job
i got this sleeve for the new samsung arm chromebook with # . # inch screen -lrb- released oct. # -rrb- , which fits nicely there 's just enough wiggle room to not make it too tight the front pocket is stretchy enough to accommodate the ac adapter and cable -lrb- although that makes for quite a bump , see picture in <unk> -rrb- the <unk> texture on the inside makes the sleeve a bit thicker than other neoprene sleeves i 've seen , but should provide for welcome extra protection the quality seems fine to me , but i have n't had it long enough to really comment <unk> if there are issues down the line i will update here
i loved this for my mac book it goes in the case all the time to travel with me where ever i go only thing is , it becomes bulky when charger is in the front
i love this case i wanted something that i could slip into my school bag to take my air and the charger along , while keeping it safe but not adding a bunch of bulk this is a perfect everyday case that keeps my air safe and protected -lrb- plus i love the colors ! i also bought the other roocase bag - the black and orange one with the handle and extra pockets - that 's for the extended trips and all the electronic extras -lrb- i can put in my ipod , the external drive for my air , all the assorted cords and still have room left over for other extras necessary for long trips . a great deal - the only downside was that their shipping took a long time ... so be patient
