very nice case , provides excellent protection for my macbook pro the initial order was missing the free keyboard cover but seller contacted me within days of my review shipped the cover to me immediately awesome customer service ! great product for the price
was torn between this case and the similar speck i wondered how good the quality could be on the ipearl , given that it sells for less than half the price of the speck case so glad i chose the ipearl not only did i save a wad of cash , but i love the ventilation on the bottom of the ipearl , which allows even more air to circulate when you use the foot stands on the bottom -lrb- a friend who has the speck case complains of her laptop <unk> . also love the angle of the keyboard when the feet are up fits like a glove , and snapped right on and comes with a free keyboard cover and a stylus excellent <unk> value , and very pleased with this purchase
i bought this for my late # macbook pro retina when i opened the box i found the color was too feminine for my taste i returned and ordered a clear version , which i love
i am definitely satisfied with this product it arrived in # days , and the quality is superb it fits like a glove , its very secure , the door is nice and not to worry , the apple shines through quite nicely worth the money , any buyers wo n't be disappointed also , i like the little stylus that came with it , it looks nice and will come in handy with my phone the keyboard cover is ok in my opinion it 's free so you ca n't really complain , it stays on firmly but will take some use to using i probably wo n't be using it all the time but it will be really handy when i 'm cooking or something
this is exactly what i wanted there are little tabs that hold the case on right on the front of the computer that hurt your wrists if your hands rest there , but it is n't a huge deal
had the cover about # months went on easy love the color seems pretty tough have no reason to take it off , so have not tried and the free keyboard cover is ok all for half the price of the cases at the apple store
this case has saved me from many potential <unk> -lrb- just to list a few - backpack puncture from mechanical pencil , my boyfriend sitting on my computer , dropping incident , and a coffee spill -rrb- now , by no means would i suggest you intentionally subject your mac to these incidents , but i do <unk> stand by this case and its ability of protecting my mac the color is true to stock image which is more of a big deal then many people tend to think poor design in the front clips they are directly in line with my arm placement to use my keyboard short usage leads to minor dents in my <unk> from resting it or scraps from the little clips unfortunate , not <unk> after nearly a year of usage the feet to prop up my mac have popped off while i do still have them i decided to not reattach as i do not use that feature often enough to care
just got a new mac book pro in november # i got a cover from apple which did n't fit i returned it and took a chance on this one several other review said they also took a chance on this one and they love it well some review are real ! ! not only was this one superior to the one i had gotten from apple but this one was # the price <unk> ! !
seem to protect my macbook retina very well i love the matte finish of the case do n't ever get the smooth finish case it will peel off love the kick stand to raise the macbook up i love this <unk> blue perfect for a guy like me
i would never consider this item for anyone it broke within two months the bottom of the bag ripped out and the handle popped off and wouldnt go back in this is a bag i bought for a <unk> so we 're talking a few books in it and it still breaks terrible item ! ! do not buy at all !
way too big and bulky , and the handle kept sticking as other reviews mention , too , it falls over if not held up against something it is such a cute bag , and i wanted to love it i really need something for carrying my laptop around , since i work from <unk> shops i was looking for something that was <unk> and not a backpack this was so promising , but it 's just not worth it for the poor quality i 'll keep looking
first of all this bag was larger than i expected -lrb- and wanted -rrb- , but i also did n't look at the size with a tape measure second , the laptop sleeve does n't fit # & # # ; which may also be in the spec , but i did n't see it however , when it came i decided it would still fit my needs so i 've used it for a few weeks now a few times a week rolling it to work and back -lrb- from my car -rrb- last week i started to notice fraying at the top seam -lrb- as if someone overstuffed it , which i have not ! -rrb- then i noticed on the bottom the faux leather is started to wear through , naturally as expected if it 's rubbed repeatedly on something regardless , this is not for people who use a computer bag daily , or even a few times a week the material is not made for a rolling bag i would n't recommend this to anyone who <unk> to use it as a roller on the other hand , it does roll smooth , and the handle <unk> nicely too bad the material is so fragile
the faux leather exterior began to peel within # weeks i only use this bag on <unk> and <unk> for carrying my laptop to and from work for the weekends i dont handle the bag roughly but living in nyc , bags need to be made of tougher stuff the wheels and the handle work fine ; the faux leather could have been made of more durable stuff
this tote has been so perfect for me i am an <unk> <unk> <unk> in a school system and i have to carry lots stuff with me every where i go i did n't want to use those ugly <unk> on wheels and was so happy to find this fashionable bag that will accommodate so much i get compliments from other teachers all the time - `` love that bag ! `` where did you get it ? `` the only reason i did n't give it # stars is that a little wear and tear has already shown up at the bottom near the wheels -lrb- i 've only used it a couple months -rrb- i 'm a little worried about whether its going to hold up in the long run
this was perfect for my work stuff -lrb- <unk> -rrb- and my # yrs <unk> meds , wipes and <unk> keeps me from having to carry # bags or overload a bag i like that the laptop is stored in back against the handle so it does n't hang or fall over it has plenty of room inside and bigger -lrb- height , width , depth -rrb- than your regular laptop bags only reason i did n't give it # stars is because i can not put the handle over my shoulder to carry , so you only have # option , roll it or carry it by the side also great usage for short weekend trips
this bags not for me , but i think someone else would love it it 's a bit brighter orange than the picture , which is why i did n't keep it , but the style and manufacturing are very nice
i am a fashion <unk> and stylist and i am always looking for cute stuff i love this bag it looks great and i love the price and fast service ! ! i am very happy and recommend it to
i totally love this bag it 's big , stylish and affordable the only problem is its unavailable all i get is compliments and i would love to buy one for my sister so she wo n't take mine
i needed a rolling bag for my laptop to go to college , but i wanted it to be fashionable i made the right choice the orange python faux leather is awesome and very chic my colleagues all asked where i got it i gave them the good word i 'm sure they will enjoy it as much as i am . . i totally recommend it
returned this product the actual bag seems a lot cheaper than it looks on the photos also rather stiff and i think it would lose its shape after some initial use and the closing mechanism on the front is very annoying - takes too long to open and close the flap -lrb- i ended up buying the tumi <unk> by icon <unk> messenger , <unk> red , one size and i 'm very happy with it . if your main objective was to provide a lot of protection for a laptop this bag may work for you - but i was looking more for a general use bag
this is one of the best bags i have ever owned the organization inside is perfect holds a lot of equipment and stuff neatly organized however i have two little quibbles with it the shoulder pad has almost no grip to it so it easily slides off my shoulder this definitely should have been addressed the front flap clip holders are nice looking but can sometimes be a bear to undo in order to open up the bag however i like how stylish it is , and the red interior makes finding stuff inside very easy
i purchased this bag before i got my <unk> when it arrived , i was shocked at how small and thin it was then , when i got the <unk> -lrb- which is almost as thin as the <unk> -rrb- i realized why i 've been using the case to go to work -lrb- as a high school teacher -rrb- and to various coffee <unk> to do work i really like the adjustable shoulder strap as well as the top handle inside the bag it provides supreme protection for my $ # computer i also have room for my school papers , important documents , back-up hard-drive , power cords , pens , and other miscellaneous items i would buy this product again with no hesitation
i carry my # & # # ; macbook pro retina , my ipad and the chargers to work and back each day this bag works perfectly love the look , the materials are very nice and high quality the rear pouch is nice , it holds a few thin items for quick access
most of the higher end asus machines with # . # & # # ; screens are at least # . # & # # ; wide in the case unfortunately , while this case measures # . # & # # ; , the sleeve part where the computer is meant to slide in is easily # . # & # # ; more narrow that does n't seem like much , but it ultimately means that the computer does not fit into the section of the bag it 's designed to fit in it more or less fills the main bag compartment completely this means that while there is some foam padding at the back of the bag the <unk> gives very little to no padding or protection the outside pocket for the cord does not accommodate a medium to large power converter that <unk> many high end # . # & # # ; laptops so , essentially , our asus gaming laptop fills the main compartment , the cord nearly <unk> the outside ` cord ' pocket , and there is little to no room for anything else no mouse or other accessories you might get with a machine like this granted , there are very few bags on the market at all for laptops at this size , this bag will be one with which we make do until we can find a better one once that happens , this bag will get handed down to our daughter , whose # & # # ; screen previous generation gaming laptop will fit into it decently
this bag would be great with two to three times the padding in the liner , loops to hold pens , # or # pouches in pen compartment and semi elastic cell phone holder so bigger note phones can fit
marginally ok case laptop fits but <unk> padding forget about charging laptop through cutouts on side of case hp envy # power connector does n't even come close to matching any of the cutouts no matter how laptop is placed into case do n't expect this case to really protect laptop much just basic transportation for the machine is all
pros : large enough to fit your # & # # ; notebook looks nice and feels quality made i like the color -lrb- mine was black and red -rrb- cons : not as many pockets as i had hoped most cases have a large pouch on the back for folders , but not this one also , the padding is very thin and wo n't offer too much protection if you drop it overall i am happy with it would i buy it again it looks a lot nicer than some of the more expensive ones i just wish it had more padding and a larger pocket on the back or front
one thing i can definitely say about this product is that it is well constructed but unfortunately it comes with many disadvantages it is way to compact it has no accessory storage it can barely hold the laptop charger if you want a stylish and <unk> bag this is not a practical way to go simply because by the time you add all accessories your bag is completely out of shape
this laptop holder is almost too tight for the size laptop we were looking for bought it for my husband and he hates it because with the laptop in it , he ca n't fit anything else in
nice sturdy bag , i bought it because of the side openings -lrb- do n't have to remove computer to charge -rrb- but openings do n't line up with my computer -lrb- hp pavilion -rrb- also was disappointed to find the bag only opens half way does n't allow me to open top flat to work on computer from bag i looked at some really expensive ones and they only open half way too love the color nice and roomy for accessories all in all i think i made a smart purchase i would recommend to a friend
this bag is very protective of my # . # & # # ; hp laptop the fit is perfect and there are places to put the cord and a mouse i gave this bag a four star rating it would get a five star rating if there were some printed bags to choose from a nice paisley print would add a little feminine flair to this most useful bag thanks for putting the exact size and laptop make in your description as that is what made me select it after reading several reviews of how some bags were a tight squeeze or too small for a # . # & # # ; laptop , i wanted to make sure i chose one that would fit
i really like this product and use it on a daily basis the only negative is that i thought that it would have more room in it that it does
very good quality bag the colors were a little brighter than i expected the fit is very snug i would have preferred more external pockets i 'm satisfied with the purchase
nice bag ; has a bit of flair i like the separate pockets for your iphone , and ipad -lrb- or book , other items -rrb- however , # complaints ; it is a bit larger than i thought , and it could use a large pocket on the outside plenty of room on the inside though overall ; satisfied , but i would probably carry a smaller bag when i was not carrying so many items
love this case ! i wanted something durable , fun , and useful this case is everything i wanted and i love the feature in the front where i can slide my ipod in through the clear sleeve and still use it !
this bag provides luxury security to my hp envy dv # the pockets provide a great place for me to carry my mouse pad and mouse and some pens the area to hold a phone works fabulous with a cover material that allows touch screen action through the cover i absolutely love the pocket by the computer in which i carry homework or other paperwork there are zip pockets to let charger cords in and out of the bag , although i have n't tried them just yet my computer just fits in it , but it fits securely , therefore i am thrilled with my purchase i would recommend this to anyone in need of a computer bag
this case is light weight yet sturdy it fits my larger lap top and has some room for paperwork i had a larger one but it was too heavy , this one works perfectly for me
this is really the best laptop case i could find it has room for all accessories like ipod headphones cords and it is exactly as advertised it is a xmas present formy grandson and his favorite color is green he is going to love it
this laptop bag fits my hp # . # envy laptop , an # inch cooling pad , power cord , mouse , tablet , and cellphone i got the aqua blue fits snug and has good cushioning high quality material and bright color sleek and <unk> zippers and <unk> was fast this is the perfect bag
very lightweight bag , due to its thin material and lack of padding there 's absolutely no padding of any kind at the bottom of the laptop section that section is just a thin piece of nylon to separate the laptop from the rest of the interior my # . # inch display laptop wo n't fit in that section without a lot of effort i do n't believe that nylon would hold up for long if i were to regularly force my laptop in there the zipper wants to jam half of the time , when i try to open it quickly this bag cost me # . # during the black friday sale , and even that 's too much it may be too cheap for me to bother returning it in this case , i got what i paid for , and nothing more . *** update on # / # : thumbs up to amazon for the <unk> and easy refund on this item , with no <unk> fees
i got this in lightening deals for $ # . # , and received it today it 's small , ca n't really hold a lot of stuff also it 's kind of not strong enough it can not hold many books too few inner pockets just returned it
received backpack and none of the documentation that came with the backpack said it was for laptops backpack does not provide protection for a computer might be good for books , but pack is small and will not hold much pack does not have a separate pouch to secure a laptop either
i brought this from amazon since it had an offer the item was delivered # day prior to the mentioned date i was not able to track this properly during the delivery when i opened the package , i was shocked to see a small back pack than what i expected it does n't had any review comments when i brought this , means never buy an item with no review comments : -rrb- this bag can not even hold my # `` laptop which has an extra battery my old hp laptop backpack which costs around # dollar is a lot bigger than this and i could n't find much weight difference between both so if you are looking to carry your # `` or # `` laptop , please do buy this else go on searching and you will surely find a bigger backpack for a cheaper
i own a swiss backpack and this one does not even come close to the quality of the one i already own i can not give this as a gift i understand lightweight but this is not acceptable back it goes
bag is very light material with low quality zippers i have a swiss gear bag i paid $ # . # regular price from an office store that bag is what i expect from swiss gear , not this bag that is equivalent to a $ # . # children 's backpack very disappointed in this bag and i would never put my computer in this bag false advertising ! !
it just is n't made for a laptop ; there is no padding and the design does not have pockets necessary for laptop power supply etc that are often needed with a laptop why anyone would call this a laptop bag without any padding on the bottom is beyond me it is smaller than it looks in the picture , but i did n't want a huge backpack i 'm keeping it because i got it on a lightning deal for about what it is worth ; it certainly is not worth anywhere near the regular price on the positive side , it is well made and lightweight -lrb- probably lightweight because it does n't have many pockets and zero laptop padding -rrb- it does have padding on the back and is comfortable to carry unfortunately there are about a hundred models of so called laptop backpacks made by swissgear and the descriptions on amazon do n't tell you what you really need to know in order to make an intelligent purchase
this bag is not what i expected it 's too small and provides no protection to my laptop however the return is very convenient i received the money as soon as the shipment is <unk>
this item is a ~ $ # item priced at ~ $ # total rip off i got it on black friday when it was sold at an appropriate & # # ; discount & # # ; rate i would be happy with the backpack at that price except for the deception involved this is a * very * lightweight backpack it offers little protection to a laptop , which fits into a <unk> inside the main compartment definitely not a true laptop backpack
the backpack is lightweight and small it looks ok the sleeve which appears to be for a laptop fits my # `` macbook pro snugly that said , it offers very little protection for your laptop -- marketing this as a laptop backpack is a stretch at its regular price , i would not buy this bag
i 've owned several swiss gear backpacks over the years and love them i recently purchased a swiss gear <unk> backpack from amazon for $ # . # and love it i grabbed this backpack on the lightening deals and the bag was intended to be a christmas gift for an active working professional i would be embarrassed to give it to them after seeing it in person this backpack is small and does n't house the usual features and qualities i 've come to expect from swiss gear this bag might be ok for kids in grade school but not for an adult the picture also makes the backpack appear much larger than what it is unfortunately this item is getting returned
purchased this for our son to use for school for his books and laptop computer unfortunately , what i received was a small backpack with little protection for the laptop this is comparable with local backpacks priced less than the price i paid on amazon i returned it within hours of receipt
i bought it from the black friday offers . $ # quality looks good , but somehow i ca n't imagine that anyone would really consider to pay $ # for it there is an open pocket that would take half of a lap-top , inside of the back-pack what ever else is in the back-pack will have contact to half of the lap-top this is a failure , sorry , there is no other judgment for this i think i will return it
i bought this bag for $ # during a lightning deals offer after receiving the backpack i was <unk> by the quality and the overall appearance of the product i would say that it was worth the $ # sale price , but i would never pay full asking price on this bag the internal laptop pocket is made of paper thin vinyl , and does not offer much protection at all there is only one major pocket for books and whatnot i expected more from what is supposedly a $ # product , but i decided not to return it because it will work for my current needs overall , i would never pay more than $ # for this bag and i advise anyone who may be looking at this backpack to look elsewhere or prepare for disappointment
i got this backpack over a amazon deal for $ # which is a & # # ; ok & # # ; - price for the product long story short ; this backpack does the job for me the overall quality is good to carry around some things like sport gear or not so heavy books , but the original price of $ # - is ridiculous for the quality and design of this back it is definitely no laptop backpack - it brings no specific laptop compartments -lrb- has just one big compartment -rrb- . # i 'm still searching for the water bottle pocket - or is it a phone pocket ? ipod pocket there is just a & # # ; normal & # # ; pocket in the front do n't <unk> & # # ; swissgear & # # ; with & # # ; victorinox - swiss army gear & # # ; victorinox has overall much better quality and also a higher price
this is not a bad backpack , heck i have n't even put the thing on my back to see how well everything works i just needed more space in a pack this is not any bigger than the # series , as i 'm guessing they are newer a little disappointed that there was n't more of a description of this so you could determine this ahead of time the price led me <unk> , guess that should n't always be the factor will order another more appropriate one purchased this on the lightning deal , so this was n't all that expensive
this backpack is what i expected in term of size but the lack of cushion at the bottom for my laptop is quite disappointing i have to be <unk> careful when putting my laptop into this bag not what i expected do n't let the $ # fool you there is no way this backpack should cost that much even at the $ # price i got it for is overpriced in my opinion
this is a good backpack that i bought as a deal it has good storage , seems well constructed yet is lightweight it is a bit smaller than i expected though it has a slot for a laptop but no padding on the bottom so you must be careful when you put it on the floor with a laptop inside
originally purchased as a new backpack for laptop but it does not have a padded laptop sleeve -lrb- just a padded back and interior pocket -rrb- it makes a great day bag but really does not fit my # . # in laptop plenty of room for books , pockets for smaller devices , etc and well constructed
this is a small and very well made pack the reason it does n't get # stars is i wish it had more pockets on the inside to organize pens and stuff but overall it is a smallish lightweight laptop bag that is very well suited for my needs
bottom line up front : do not buy for $ # , there is much better for that price even though the title says it is for laptops , there is nothing that really sets itself apart from a normal back pack yes , there is a divider pocket that can keep the laptop seperate from the rest of the main pocket , but it does n't offer any protection from impact or anything like that i also would n't expect anything larger than a # & # # ; display to fit i do n't use it for laptop carrying but just as a regular school backpack it is smaller than i had expected but has kept a load off of my shoulders since i am limited i purchased this on a black friday price of $ # , and that should be the normal cost of this product the current cost as of this review is about $ # which is ridiculous
i use it almost everyday since i bought it it has large enough space and very sturdy it has many pockets too , which enables one to organize the stuff more efficiently
nice lightweight backpack great for taking on small trips and not having to lug a big bag around exactly as described , i do n't get all the other bad reviews they are very misleading
i bought this wanting something to protect my computer and i made sure to look at the dimentions of my computer before buying however the shell was too large for my computer the keyboard and the case fit so i ended up keeping this package however i got this for computer protection which i did n't
the case i received from amazon was not the partially see through rubberized case that is pictured it was the right color , however it was a <unk> through smooth plastic case actually kinda tacky looking you can not see the apple -lrb- sorry when i pay $ # for a laptop i would like to see the apple -rrb- the cloth case , screen protector , and keyboard protector were all as pictured
out of the # items in this bundle , i only consistently use the hardcover case , which is nice as an extra layer of protection when carrying or transporting the laptop the soft case/cover was okay , but became extremely dirty -lrb- no idea why -rrb- and never came clean despite multiple <unk> the sticky screen protector was an absolute disaster - it only stuck in some places and it was n't a clean stick the keyboard cover is nice for keeping crumbs or whatever out of the actual keyboard , but interferes with <unk> and needs to be taken off to listen to <unk> at a decent volume
it fits perfectly ! it does n't slip of or anything the color is exactly how its shown in the picture the case smells at first , like a ` new car smell ' but the scent goes away <unk> the screen protector is an okay quality overall this product is pretty good my computer feels really protected and shipping on this is extremely fast
the cover is cute and protective i was thinking that the actual case was matte but is glossy the only thing that disappointed me was the smell of the soft sleeve bag but overall i love how cute my macbook looks make sure to read the description box to know what model is compatible !
i love this whole set ! it was so cheap and totally worth it , my computer is cute and clean ! i took the screen protector off though i didnt really like it . but the rest is great
it 's just as it looks i really like it , the keyboard cover is a little sticky but it 's a great value -lrb- all keyboards made like this will have that look -rrb- you have to get used to it
this case looks just as sturdy as other brands of cases i have seen at twice the price factor in the mousepad , protective bag , and keyboard cover and it is a great deal mine was shipped via usps priority mail for a mere # dollars i would like to add that the keyboard cover is no longer mislabeled as of # / # in the past people had complained about the eject button being labeled as a power button the screen protector should have come with some sort of application tool i tried to get the bubbles out with my credit card and it did n't work that well i wound up taking the protector off i would definitely recommend this kit to a friend
i got this case for my bf as a christmas present and he absolutely <unk> it not only does it have a hard shell case but it has a soft exterior covering great buy ! !
i purchased this item as a gift for a family member the royal blue is very professional looking i choose this item over the other sellers because of the # -in- # it is a great value it arrived ahead of schedule the writer may be correct regarding the level of difficulty to apply the screen protector my niece who i purchased this item for did place the screen protector on and had some bubbles on the screen a remedy may be to take a hard piece of plastic and <unk> over the bubbles -lrb- like a credit card -rrb- i also purchased the topcase macbook pro # `` for my daughter -lrb- in pink -rrb- who was very excited and happy
i love it when you get more than what you expected the key cover was great and nicely guards against my sticky fingers case is very classy looking in black ... will suit my needs in college
this product is <unk> cute i ordered the blue , it 's sort of a robins egg color you can see the mac logo pretty well when it 's lit , and the case itself is very smooth i 've had a similar case from a different company and it let dirt get in between te laptop an case , this one does a great job of preventing that
this set is really pretty the color is like a tiffany blue and the case fits my macbook pro perfectly the screen protector was a pain to put on so i left it alone all the other components are great the keyboard cover is really pretty and matches the case perfectly all the keys line up as well overall i 'm very pleased
i really liked what i got it protects my computer and the colors were exact and i had a lot of friends of mine order it and love it as well topcase is a great
super quick shipment and a very nice bag , however , it 's not made to hold a gaming computer very tight fit and could not fit the charging cord in would be fine for a small laptop though and very well made , just did n't work for me thanks , i 'm sure i can use it to hold my smaller items -lrb- ipad , ipod , kindle , etc . -rrb-
the bag has a specific compartment for my laptop that is padded along with a few other pockets for my charger and other accessories there are rubber corners on the bottom that cushion a drop so that it does not shatter the screen -lrb- something that happened to my old laptop -rrb-
i have an asus g # gaming laptop it 's pretty bulky with a # . # `` screen it fits great in this case even with the laptop inside , the case still looks slim there 's still plenty of room for my charge cable , mouse , phone , and e-reader i love the removable strap and the touches of purple most cases i saw for laptops this big were pretty masculine , bulky , and over $ # -lrb- unless you just wanted a sleeve -rrb- i am very pleased with this purchase
i really like this bag my laptop fits very well , it is well made , it has a lot of storage , and it is very cute i am very pleased with my purchase and would recommend it to others as well
thanks <unk> via amazon for having a shoulder bag laptop case with a dash of color i really wanted a nice case that did n't look masculine this one is great with all the extra <unk> to store other business necessities like cell phone , pens , business cards , etc .
i bought this for a surface pro and it works ok i would like it better if it were a bit larger or had deeper pockets i like to <unk> a mouse , the power cord , and a book or two i can do it with this case , and have for # months , but i will buy a larger case someday
the bag opening is # . # & # # ; , making it perfect for my # . # & # # ; surface pro # the smaller pocket on the right of the bag is great for an iphone -lrb- all versions -rrb- or other smart phones pull down the velcro strip and through the plastic , and am able to still use touch , although no speaker holes it is easy enough to quickly remove the phone the larger pocket on the left side i use for either a portable blu-ray <unk> <unk> or portable usb drive the bag is rain proof , has two inside pockets -lrb- one with a mesh partition if you wish to carry something else also comes with a shoulder strap if needed
i wanted a very light bag to carry my microsoft surface pro # , the touch pen , external mouse , power adapter and small items for meetings this bag was the right size for all of those items the external zippered pocket is exactly the right size for my kindle so it makes it easy to get to reading materials while travelling it is very easy to get the surface in and out of the center pouch i have had the bag for about # months and have taken it to many meetings and on a few planes it is a great to have such a light-weight way to travel the look is ok -lrb- the only reason i did not give it this item # stars -rrb-
has tons of space and ample room for all the accessories that go with the surface i 've carried it on planes a couple of times without an problem at the tsa check point or using the sling i do n't care for the phone pocket as it 's just not something i could see being useful , as its a tight fit and difficult to removed once inserted but , for a carrying case with alot of room . this is for you
this bag works great for the surface pro i use it to store the surface pro , type cover , charging cord , stylus and screen cloth the charging cord fits in front left zipper pocket , however it is very snug i would say that 's the only negative about the <unk> a larger pocket for this overall , i am pleased with the item
the only draw back is the cell case is just velcro , if it was a zipper all around , it would receive a # star rating in my book , as it could be more versatile in many respects this bag fits a surface pro # quite well with room for accessories , i.e . keyboard , mouse , powercord , usb drive and even an external cd drive
this is the best sleeve i could find for the surface pro the surface pro fits nicely inside and the material protects it pretty good i love the handle and it comes with a shoulder strap the large front zippered pocket fits the charger and cables , but they are a tight fit i gave it # stars because the large pocket needs to be slightly larger and they should replace the cell phone pocket with one that would hold a mouse overall , i would recommend this sleeve
this case is great , it has plenty of room to hold my surface and type keyboard -lrb- the thicker one -rrb- inside the protective cover i purchased for them it has great padding and is a nice size , i have no doubt that it will protect my tablet the only thing that keeps me from giving this # stars is that it could use an extra internal pocket to carry a textbook or my wallet and keys
love the color the material used to make the bag is great , very strong but the sewing is bad if the thread was n't so bright i guess it would not matter but the color makes the bag also , it has <unk> of pockets so if you want then make the rating a & # # ; # & # # ;
i love this bag the only thing i would change is the cellphone compartment it 's not quite big enough for anything other than an iphone , and the new ones barely squeeze in there that pocket is great for other things though
the surface is an amazing machine book plus when you travel with it you want to take everything your power cords , mouse -lrb- a must have -rrb- and any paperwork you need most of all its not bulky
this is my main carrier from my surface pro and it is great plenty of room for the device in either sleeve or in a leather case and power , stylus , and all connectors it looks good and is built well
i bought this bag specifically for my husband 's ms surface pro fits perfectly with the keyboard , some extra peripherals . and enough space to fit a wallet , note pad and charger looks even better in person extra pockets are perfect for his phone he 's picky and he likes it , so i am a happy camper
this item works great for my surface pro plenty of room for the a/c adapter as well there is even side holes if you want to put your surface in the bag and have i plugged in
much better than carrying around a laptop bag . . and the colors , so styling i can also fit all my accessories in the side pockets , making this the perfect surface messanger bag
the size is great to host surface pro and accessories accessories include logitech keyboard , usb hub , power plugs , and assortment of cables phone pouch fits # . # in phone perfectly seems sturdy , but still early
this bag works great for my college son to carry his tablet and calculator it frees up his hands to carry other things and does n't have to worry about losing it as it has a shoulder strap
i purchased this to take to <unk> from boston on my business trip first time using it , as i was walking through customs , the first strap handle completely broke off the second one broke as i was getting on the plane the only thing i had in it was my macbook pro and my passport so weight was not the issue needless to say , i could n't use it on my trip i left my laptop in my hotel room i would not recommend this product unless you want to go through what i did the first time using it very disappointed in this purchase
i like the look of this product very much it has a lot of nice compartments as well the problem is that i just received this just last week , and one of the handles has already ripped the other handle is ripping as well i have to carry the bag by the shoulder strap this makes me question the durability of the product
