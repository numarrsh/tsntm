i very much like and appreciate my mcover for my # `` mbpro it clicked right on and fits perfectly since purchasing it , i have spotted what would have been three nasty scratches on my book , but instead the cover <unk> the brunt i have seen no problems with overheating , and i appreciate the little legs that pop up the fact that this comes in so many colors is the only thing challenging about making the purchase i still wonder if i should have gone for clear , lime or orange instead of the blue for my life , it is vastly preferable to the covers where i would have to slip in or out the macbook this is much easier to use
this is a great cover if you are hard on your computer or just want to protect it from scratches i have two in college with mac book pros fits greats and works hard to protect when my kids came home for thanksgiving and i saw all the scratches on their cases , i was happy the scratches were on the cases and not their computers
i love this product ; however , i was a little disappointed that i had to pay for return shipment -lrb- mostly my fault , i purchased the wrong size -rrb- still , the customer service was excellent and quick
i bought it about six months ago when i got my new mac and could not be happier at first i was n't real sure about the keyboard cover but have grown to love it anything that can protect and help it last longer is a good investment
i bought this for my brother for christmas , and he said he could n't be happier with it he 's already spilled water on it and the water just ran off great case , great protector
this cover is wonderful the price is fantastic and the quality is really nice i used it on my macbook pro and it fit perfectly the keypad fit nicely and you can still easily see the illuminated keys
this item is great worth every dollar , looks very nice , and fits perfectly i wanted something that wouldnt be cheap looking , and wanted something that would do its job this case does that considering i only paid like # bucks , it was a great deal i receive compliments all the time
i love my pretty laptop with shell case and silicone keyboard i have the # `` macbookpro and it snaps right on , and is like the mother shell to my pearl of a macbookpro . : - -rrb- good
i bought my first case nearly # months ago and it has held up very well i have also bought # others as gifts and they too are just as good the half keyboard protector is still in great shape i have zero complaints regarding the quality of the products the seller has excellent customer service and great communication i will definitely order from again <unk> # -lrb- ebay id
simple , nice looking and strong the silicone front pads will fall off soon , though , but it is n't a big deal and does n't affect the functionality i also like the rear fold out legs , which tip the whole computer up a bit for easy typing
the hard shell fits my mac pro perfectly and protects it from scratches and stains i feel safer carrying it around like i need to for school i like that the bottom piece allows it to stay cool and not over heat the keyboard cover keeps dust and particles from getting in between the keys this color blue is very beautiful and
i have bought these for all my macbook pros now and am recommending them to all my customers they are a great product and provide excellent protection for my computer i would not go with out on any mac computer they are great and take a lot of abuse
great case to product my macbook i ordered the turquoise and the color is bright and cheery easy to put on i ordered the royal blue for our other macbook and it is equally nice while i was worried the case would cause the laptop to heat up , this has not happened i 'm updating my review july # after purchasing this item -lrb- in # colors -rrb- , i was emailed by i-pearl and asked to leave feedback of this product in exchange for a free additional hard shell mac cover i was happy to do so b/c i liked the product -lrb- and it is still working well -rrb- however , although i followed the instructions , was one of the first # reviewers , i have not received it as promised it 's been # weeks
i just got this to replace a purple speck case i bought # months ago the clips that held the speck case onto the bottom half of the computer started breaking right away , though enough lasted that it did n't start falling off until recently the clips on this case seem much sturdier right off the bat i also like how the bottom has way more vents in it everyone i know who has tried both cases prefers this one as well -lrb- which is why i bought it -rrb- plus , it 's $ # - $ # cheaper
i was n't sure what to expect when i ordered this i was hoping for something similar to a phone case can i just say `` wow `` ? ! ? ! ? this case fits my macbook pro like a glove the color was exactly as it appears on the site the only difference is , you ca n't really see the lighter square around the apple logo -lrb- love that ! -rrb- it looks like the macbook is the color of the case all of the ports are accessible and there are # `` legs `` that lift it off the surface for better airflow and best of all , the price was awesome
very nice case it is a solid plastic case , which will prevent scratches from occurring on the frame it has a neat little feature which allows you to <unk> up these two tabs to elevate the computer , which helps you type better the apple logo is still visible through the case as it lights up all around , an excellent investment for my macbook
awesome cover for mac pro # & # # ; it fits great and looks awesome and i like the legs to prop it up and let it breathe a bit , since i do a lot of studying at my desk :
the tabs on the bottom help my laptop not to overheat and the cover hides the smudges you would normally see on the <unk> body of my macpro
my # year <unk> use these on their computers and so far they have really protected them the do n't add much bulk and have held up well under tough conditions
i ordered the case and was a little skeptical but was pleasantly surprised when i got here the case fits well all my ports are still <unk> and the case <unk> awesome protection
i left the dark side -lrb- sorry mr. gates -rrb- # years ago when i bought my first macbook for my high school age daughter knowing that she needed some `` help `` protecting her new computer , i did my homework and bought her what i thought was a good cover from an mcover competitor within # months that cover was cracked and would not stay on the macbook i replaced it with an mcover product and it has survived quite well -- even now that she 's a college freshman , living in a dorm i have sine purchased an mcover for both of my company 's macbooks and have found them to be superior in design , construction and durability -lrb- i 'm almost as hard on my mac as my daughter -rrb- i particularly like the way you can prop up the unit to distribute heat and make it easier to type if you are new to macbooks , definitely buy a cover for it -- that pretty aluminum can scratch quite easily
i purchased this cover for my daughter who is attending college in hopes of it protecting the outside of her computer she loved the color and it was easy to put on and it actually stays i am thinking of ordering the cover for the keyboard
really awesome cover the cover was easy to install , great vent slots on the bottom and feet for faster cooling better than the speck in many ways and came in lots of colors
i love the <unk> it makes typing so much easier the color is very pretty also it protects the computer very well and i get compliments all the time on the case
i am enjoying the <unk> out of this laptop cover & key shield it is fun and handy for <unk> my computer from the other # + <unk> around my school district <unk> , there are many of these covers floating around as well , we just all have picked different colors the final verdict will come when i am able to assess durability if it lasts , then it is a total winner
very good product to protect your expensive macbooks very good price too it is about twice more expensive at the apple store it comes in a variety of colors and looks elegant
this laptop case was a piece of crap its made of cheap plastic and does n't fit my macbook pro # & # # ; very well at all buying this product was a waste of my time and money i am never buying from this company again
i never even put this on my macbook because its edges were so rough that i 'm sure it would have <unk> up the finish on my laptop just to get it on there i love the color but it is very poorly made , very cheap looking i 'd recommend spending a little more $ and going with the speck satin finish see-through hard cover case - it 's well worth the extra $ #
i received the ipearl case very quickly i love the color of the case and the legs that lift it up in back my case made a <unk> sound when i opened the top of the laptop it turns out it was the tabs on the bottom of the case <unk> the hinge to the top when i emailed the company concerning this , they were extremely nice and sent me a replacement bottom unfortunately , the replacement bottom had the same problem my <unk> just could n't tolerate that <unk> every time i opened my macbook the fit of the case also was n't quite as snug as i had hoped i guess sometimes you really do get what you pay for
i used this product for only a few weeks before i noticed pieces cracking off the & # # ; stands & # # ; on the bottom were both gone after just a few weeks , and a few side edge pieces were cracked , as well the <unk> at the bottom also collected crumbs
when i got it it cam in time but when i tried to fit it on my laptop it just wouldnt fit the right way but i did get it with in #
the silicone pads that supposed to keep the case from sliding around came right off they could have used better glue or something to keep the pads on without the pads , it slides around and does not stay in place otherwise , it could have been a better case
this case is a beautiful vibrant green and looks great , but has a major design flaw the upper shell does n't fit snugly against your computer - there is a gap between the back of the screen and the hard plastic case , where dirt , crumbs , etc . , can get stuck then the gunk is trapped right up next to your computer , creating lots of little scratches on the surface you 're trying to protect there are better cases out there - this one can actually cause more damage than it prevents
do n't get the keyboard cover it has never stuck to the keys since i got it what is worse it buckles up in the middle of the keyboard not worth it
the color for this looked a little more lime green on the website , but it 's actually closer to a kelly green one clip on the side of the case on the bottom does n't snap on and is a little warped neither of these things is enough for me to send it back
thin , plastic cover not sure it will actually protect the computer son likes that it is colored ... so we can tell our computers apart ; for we have the same type of computer
i bought my case over a year ago and have recently have had to buy a new one i liked it at first , however soon enough the little feet on the bottom had broken off and it would cut into my leg if i had my computer on my lap the case also severely scratched my mac it was not a bad purchase but i would not purchase it again
when i bought this i was looking forward to using this to protect my macbook pro unfortunately , this is not a # inch shell case , it actually seems a lot smaller than it should be i was very disappointed with the purchase
this works well to protect my computer but it makes my mac book get hot -- it never got hot prior to having a case on it if i take the case off it cools and is like normal again
i love the green color of this case the cover was very easy to snap into place , but the fit seems to be just a tad `` off . whenever i open my macbook pro , it makes a sound as if the top and bottom covers were rubbing against each other i think this cover needs to go back to the drawing board for a little adjustment , so that the opening of the laptop is <unk> , without that rubbing sound
the case is easy to put on and seems sturdy the power port can fit in both ways , so none of the other ports are blocked the only problem is that the legs on the back seem very weak and just the weight of the computer might be straining them
seller was great and the product arrived on time , my only complaint was that the material that the cover is made of is not the highest quality and rubs off and looks greasy sometimes
i recently purchased a macbook pro and i was looking for something to protect it with and i resorted to a cover there are lots of pricey covers out there , so , being the poor college student i am , i went with this one and i 'm more than happy the color is vibrant and it 's easy to snap on i feel a lot better taking my laptop outside with me because it 's protected
i purchased the green because it is my favorite color and i want to extend the longevity of my computer exterior this was a great purchase for the price , and it is nice to finally see green cases they were so hard to find last year it 's a nice soft plastic that wo n't scratch the cover
i really love the look and fit of this cover however , after only a few months of use , the rubber feet on the bottom of the case both came off it looked like they had just been glued on however , the case still functions well and looks great you ca n't beat the price
my case shipped immediately it was extremely easy to put <unk> just snap the bottom section on and then the top it grips it pretty securely i love the added future of the # legs on the bottom part to raise the back end of your computer to allow the fan to vent what i do n't like about the case is the fact that the bottom part has two rectangle areas that are just <unk> do n't know why the case is n't solid they are each ~ # `` x # `` i do n't understand the purpose otherwise , i love the green color , and it seems pretty durable
this is a good product and definitely sets my mbp apart from others installation was extremely easy and <unk> is as well i would have given this cover # stars except that one of my tabs that folds down does not stay in the upright position and swings freely other than that no complaints
this is the first case i have bought for my macbook pro i love the lime green color and the fact that i can see the apple <unk> through the cover the only downside i have seen so far is that the top cover that attaches to the lid of the laptop keeps falling off it does not seem to fit as snug as the bottom cover does because i dont want to glue it to my laptop , i just put up with it i like the little feet on the bottom so that air moves through but i have to say it it keeping my laptop clean and shiny and safe from banging against stuff
i really enjoy having my new case the legs on the bottom help keep it from overheating , which is nice i accidentally ordered a case that was too large -lrb- because i measured my laptop fully from <unk> instead of just <unk> of my screen -rrb- , so make sure you do n't make the same mistake i did overall , good product and i 'm happy to have it
compared to speck -lrb- apple 's hard shell cases -rrb- , i like the ipearl much more the color is awesome , and it fits my # in macbook very well however , i am afraid that the little feet might break off over time because they seem a little flimsy to me
the bottom corner does not fit perfectly and neither does the middle top ... it fits good to protect the computer and you get what you pay for i love it and how it is bright
a hard case 's main purpose is to provide protection and this one does that it does n't block any of the essential slots / ports my screen does feel a bit heavy though ... it 's way too easy to close the lid on the computer
the color was not quite as pictured , it is a little darker green , but still love the product fits perfectly , snaps on easily but does n't pop off at all , and does n't feel cheap
i only gave four stars because - the fit is not perfect on the lower piece it 's good <unk> -- it wo n't be falling off -- but not quite perfect - there are only rubber feet on the front , none at the back - the keyboard cover , while an excellent fit -- has the words ` mcover ty ipearl ' on the space bar i do n't care for that the fit of the top <unk> really is perfect be aware than any keyboard cover will interfere with the keyboard light the green colour looks really sharp -lrb- i had been worried from the picture -rrb- that 's a matter of taste , of course
i was extremely excited to receive my case , i had been contemplating where to buy my case for a week or so i really wanted to get the best deal but feel safe with my purchase , and be satisfied that i got to choices that i wanted i did with this case , i purchase the green , and was greatly <unk> with what arrived in the mail
i spent a few hours reading the many review on different macbook pro hard cases and other protective accesories before purchasing this item to be honest , i was a little nervous as i have not gotten into online shopping before now but i am pleased with the case all around and am happy to see that the negative reviews were <unk> i made a review video but was unable to upload it due to it being to large ... maybe i can get it smaller to post later it includes video of the case opening and <unk> without a clicking <unk> like some other review mentioned the case also does not <unk> the charging port as another review informed me of maybe being a slight problem i am glad that i was <unk> enought to just get this and hope you get it # , its a great product
it 's a good case , but dust and crud gets between the case and the laptop , so it needs cleaning after awhile i just wish it fit more snugly but its pretty the laptop has been bumped off surfaces a few times and it seems to protect pretty well
excellent product just as described the item came well packaged and quick quick quick it is durable , and my son absolutely loves the apple green color the price was excellent <unk> i had seen prices $ # . # and up for a similar products
the translucent colors are really great -lrb- we have both the aqua and the green . it fits perfectly without <unk> with any of the ports the pop up feet create a nice angle for comfortable typing and snap back down easily and believe it or not , the free keyboard cover actually works great it stays in place and keeps dust and crumbs out while really not bothering me at all when typing the only reason it does n't get # stars is that the protection it offers is quite minimal but that might not even be a fair <unk> because i knew that when i bought it all in all , i like it and would certainly buy a # rd one
this case is exactly what i expected it 's a good semi sturdy case that keeps my laptop from getting too dinged up as i take it to campus everyday my only complaint is that the rubber grips on the bottom like to come off i just keep putting them back though the green is the green that is shown in the image and i think it 's an awesome color
this cover is great but when i put it on , when i opened the macbook it would squeak i had to break off two of the tabs in the very back they were just tiny little things and served no purpose any way i got the green which is very vibrant and my husband got the orange which he loves it 's the color of <unk> orange
i like this cover because it protects your macbook from damage it is colorful and bright and makes your computer look good i buy decals to put on top of it , and that <unk> my computer even more this is the second case i 've gotten in two years the rubber front legs come off in about # weeks the back legs break in about a year to # months but for the money , when it does break , i get a new one , because it is good protection for my macbook
i really like to hard shell case , i do n't seem to have a problem with it thus far the keyboard cover kind of annoys me though , it does n't fully stick to the keyboard everytime , i open up my laptop the keyboard folds up
product is in great shape and fits perfectly i have a new macbook pro # inch and this is the same as the ones in the apple store the product arrived before the estimated time and snaps right on the cpu good buy ! ! !
great product for the money you would pay $ # + at the apple store for a similar product this has held up well for almost # years the anti skid pads have fallen off though but not a big deal
i still have it on my macbook i rarely take it off i do see scratch marks on my mac and i think it 's from keeping the cover on too long my roommate and i got our macs around the same time he did n't get a cover and i did his look newer than mine and has less scratches but still , mine is green
i 've used another brand of cover on a # `` macbook pro and it was great this one was about # the price for about the same performance it snaps on easily , looks great , love the little feet that elevate it from the table and helps keep things cool the fit is nice and it stays on well two small issues : # the new design of for the charging plug means the case interferes slightly but have n't had a real problem . # there 's a little space between the case and the apple the cover is a little flexible across the top but it really does n't cause any issues over all a great buy - would purchase again
when i first opened the package , the case seemed a bit flimsy , but i 've been using it now for a few weeks and love it the free keyboard cover is great , though it takes a little getting used to because you have to press the keys harder the fold-out legs elevate the keyboard perfectly only downside is that when you move the screen , the case pops off easily but for the money , i would highly recommend it
i love the color and sleek look have had many compliments on this my only complaint is that the case interferes with the power adapter so that it cam only be attached one way into the port , obstructing the ethernet port thus when i need <unk> via ethernet i can not charge the laptop
when i ordered this case , i was a little skeptical - but thankfully it surpassed my expectations it does n't block anything on the computer -lrb- usb , power , etc -rrb- i just got my macbook pro at the beginning of june and the new shaped power plug fits in either direction you choose to plug it in it was very easy to install , and it does a good job of protecting my macbook pro -lrb- i noticed very quickly after purchasing it that the aluminum scratches very easily -rrb- i especially love the color the green is pretty and bright - i noticed that a lot of the other cases that claimed to be green looked more yellowish green the color in the picture of this case is very true to life , which made me very happy , because it 's my favorite color i plan on recommending this to my colleagues and , its cheap enough that you can afford to buy several in different colors and rotate them so you do n't get tired of having the same color on your computer all the time i 'm very glad i bought it
i purchased the mcover hard shell case for my new mac about # weeks ago it snapped on to my laptop very easily , but i do recommend being gentle so as not to potentially break any of the tabs it allows easy access to all of my ports , including the <unk> , on the sides unlike some of the cases i looked at , there is no `` stickiness `` to it making it easy to clean the little retractable feet in the back are an extra bonus and keep my laptop at the perfect angle for keyboarding or working with the track pad the green color is amazing ! as i am new to a mac , i think that the glowing green apple effect is appropriate i this case will last a long time , but for the price , i may get more in other colors a great purchase for me
i could already tell it was a durable case when i opened the packed and the best part was that it arrived at my house in # days one thing i did n't know was that the case had two kick stands so you can also help the laptop vent air and use it at an angle which is very nice when needed i am super happy with this product for such a good price to protect you mbp
i bought this product thinking that it would be an okay product because of the reviews i read but they were wrong this hard case fits perfectly i snapped on the case and it fits perfectly on tried opening the screen and the case stayed in place the color was the perfect shade and the price was a better deal i have no complaints about this green macbook pro hard case i highly recommend this product and five it # out of # stars ! :
i love my new green case it was very easy to follow directions and snap onto the computer fit my mac perfectly and has not left my mac since i snapped it on i love the green color and have already had multiple friends tell me they liked the cover and ask where they can get one i also love the little stands it comes with they do not feel super sturdy but they do the job and so far , mine have <unk> me typing like a <unk>
a very cool looking case very easy to install -lrb- took less than # seconds -rrb- durable molded plastic fits my macbook pro a # perfectly does n't make the laptop bulky - still easily fits in my sleeve traveling case
... buy this cover i picked green because it was the cheapest , but it turns out that it 's really good looking -lrb- if you do n't mind bright it 's really much brighter than it looks in the picture -- closer to neon . the case fits well , although i know from using other ipearl products that the cases do n't all fit well the manufacturing standards should be <unk> so there 's more uniform quality control
i thought it 'd be ugly and this or that but it 's a great case others can cost up to # bucks but this one was a very <unk> one . : -rrb- great
i like the product very much i recommend this product the keyboard cover works well however it does not allow the lighted keyboard to show as well simple solution , remover cover for use with lighted keyboard
arrived very quickly the case looks great on my macbook and it fits well my other case would slip a bit around the laptop -lrb- obviously not the right size -rrb- but this one is awesome definitely recommend this item
this mac protector is great i did n't expect it to be as nice as it is for the money love the color and it does the job very well would recommend it to others looking to protect their investment
when i purchased my macbook pro i knew i needed a cover for it i did n't want to pay the extra money they charge at the apple store so i figured i would check here first and i 'm glad i did ! ! the color was exactly as it is shown and it fits perfectly i recommend getting the keyboard cover to go with it because they complete the look
the color is great and very accurate to what you see on amazon perfect for someone who wants their macbook pro to be protected and look cool at the same time
i bought this case for my brother , and was hesitant to do so because he can be very careless with his stuff however , this case had held the test of time it still looks brand new , his kids play with his computer and it has protected it from the accidental drops from the kids overall a great product , and well worth the price would use this seller again to buy another case
everything fit together perfectly and easily it did n't take me long to realize the added security it gave in knowing that my macbook was really protected great looking and easy to clean as well an absolute necessity for every college student green mcover hard shell case for # -inch aluminum a # macbook pro -lrb- # . # -inch diagonal screen , black keyboard
i bought my mom this case to protect her new macbook pro , and when she received it she was amazed she loved it and , what 's more , she was able to put it on properly all by herself ... which amazed me it looks great , fits great and even protects great i had a lot more selection with mcover and i * personally * like the fact that it cost less than half the price of the more famous brands sold at nearly every mac outlet
everything fits great the keys are a little difficult to type on with the silicon cover so i 'll probably only put that on if i 'm going out with my laptop
i 'm so glad i bought this product for my new mac it fits perfectly and provides a layer of protection my mac recently slipped from my hands and -lrb- my near heart attack aside -rrb- , all was well thanks to this shell as an added layer of protection i 've also purchased an ipearl soft case that fits perfectly over the hard shell
i love my mcover my <unk> bought the fifty dollar counterpart and mine is so much better i love the bright colors and i get tons of compliments do n't miss out on this great item
this case is great it fits my macbook pro perfectly and i love the color it protects my case nicely , though i am unsure about the <unk> heat from the bottom i have n't determined yet if it traps the heat during usage in general , i like it very much and received several compliments on it the first day i brought it to work
<unk> have gone through a few cases and most of them have fallen apart this one seems the best so far made of high quality materials and fits the macbook pro like a glove very happy with this purchase
it would be nice if all products `` worked `` so easily and did the job as described this cover snapped on my macbook pro and fit perfectly all of the ports are easily accessed and the color is great it does fit the notebook like a second skin and does n't add any bulk with respect to fitting the notebook into a computer bag great price , too
just what i was looking for seems to protect my computer nicely the keyboard cover was n't for me , but also seemed to work well i will probably order more in different colors
for the price , this mac cover is amazing in durability i previously purchased a different one for more expensive that cracked until it fell off this one , however , is wonderful my only issue with it is that it is often difficult to remove that might be user error on my end , so i 'm still rating it # stars because it is definitely worth the money
our macbook travels quite a bit and though we have a laptop travel bag , i wanted a cover to add some extra protection from minor impacts and to prevent scratching of the finish this cover definitely fits that need and adds very little weight while adding some personal style it comes in two semi-transparent sturdy plastic pieces that easily snap to the bottom of the laptop and screen back all the <unk> are accessible through the case openings and the bottom has slots for ventilation the flip out feet are a nice touch , angling the computer forward for a better typing angle as well as providing better ventilation the case has been great , giving me piece of mind from the minor bumps and scrapes that laptops always go through
this case was a fraction of the price of the one i originally purchased at best buy out of the package it snapped together like it was meant to be there i have n't had any problems with fit or construction i get compliments on the <unk> every time i use it i did n't pay for expedited shipping , and it arrived within # days of ordering
el <unk> <unk> un <unk> <unk> de lo <unk> , el producto es lo <unk> <unk> en <unk> <unk> y lo <unk> se describe <unk> <unk> del <unk> . <unk> en <unk> <unk> y es lo <unk>
i 've had this product for over a year and it 's fantastic love that it has its own built in & # # ; stand & # # ; if you want to prop it up definitely a good buy
i have been so pleased with this case it is durable and gives me such peace of mind , especially with the keyboard cover i also love the feet to raise the back of the computer , allowing for air flow underneath great all around product , exactly what i was looking for
i am very impressed with their product and quick shipping to my home i am really <unk> with my products from them . i brought three products from them and all of those products are very fabulous i would keep ordering more products as i need for my baby , macbook pro thirteen you are also recommended to purchase from their products
the cover fit easily over my macbook pro ; i had no problems in attaching the external cover or keyboard cover the color is as vibrant as seen in the picture
