a great case with a handy zippered front pocket to hold the power supply and a few cords love the handles that fold flat , so it works as both a sleeve and a carry case as needed
this case is great if you want the smallest possible padded case which can hold a chromebook and its power cord it is soft , flexible , and well padded the cord pocket stretches enough to zip the cord in this case is not hard-sided , so do not expect it to prevent all bangs against the chromebook
i love it the inside is this really soft plush like fabric that almost <unk> the outside of the laptop it fits nice , not snug but i like because it leaves room to make it snug with charger cable on the pocket overall a great
very nice case the samsung chrombook i purchased fits in perfect i bought it as an accessory for christmas for my son and i 'm sure he will like it also

this is a soft side carry case with handles good sturdy zippers on both the main compartment and the smaller one i am using to store the charger for my chromebook the inside is lined with a soft fur like material the price was great for the product i was expecting something cheaply made , but this is a nice quality storage sleeve
i just love this case it is very well made and fits my mac air perfectly it has enough room if you want to put a folder in with the air or something it provides good protection , just the right amount of thickness the inside is like soft fur that protects the air from scratches and there is also a lip on top to protect from the zipper now the outside zippered pocket and handles are what makes this case so exceptional and are hard to find features i ca n't speak yet for the quality of the zipper as i have not had the case long enough to make a judgement the odor is not bad at all as all neoprene has that oder just leave it outside a couple of days and the odor is almost gone i would highly recommend this case
this has turned out to be a really good purchase it fits the acer chromebook with a little wiggle room the cord and charger will not fit in the case , but that 's not a problem for me i 'm glad i purchased this sleeve
was looking for right size carry case and protective sleeve for my acer # p chromebook and this case does the job beautifully high quality material soft to the touch but durable is exactly what i am looking for can use handles to carry on its own or pull the soft handles down and stick it in my backpack side pocket is just large enough to fit the power cables hopefully it will last longer than the laptop itself
my sister needed something for her netbook while carrying it in her purse or pack she really likes the protection and design it has usable handles that fold completely flat when not in use and the small zippered compartment really great for the price
i bought this specifically for travel with my chrome book , and am very pleased with it it is well constructed , and has storage space for accessories i would recommend this item
this sleeve case is great my acer c # fits really well in it i love the velcro handles and the outside pocket where you can keep your power cord the neoprene smell was <unk> at first but it does dissipate over time , so not to worry . # stars
the product was packaged well & delivered on time the case is a good basic case , that does the job of protecting against scratches & light bumps while in a backpack , but is not a substitute for a properly padded stand-alone <unk>
great little bag for my google <unk> fits perfectly and the side pocket has enough room for the charging cord and my earbuds it is true the smell does hit you when you first open it but a day outside opened up and all is good
i just recently purchase this case and i like it because my chromebook fits perfectly inside and i like the extra pouch for the power cord the handles make it easier to carry it around
bought it for my new acer c # chromebook not only does it fit well , but the charger fits easily in the zippered pocket many cases do n't have a zippered pocket the handles are a great feature as well honestly , the handles are the reason i bought it and i have been pleased with how they work
i recently got an acer aspire v # - # . # & # # ; laptop this case works perfectly the outside pocket is big enough to hold the charger and headphones it has a smell when you open it right out of the box , but i 'm sure it 'll fade over time
i love this case i got it for my macbook air -lrb- # inch -rrb- and it fits perfectly snug in there i feel like its nice and protected i really like the handles too
this case is perfect for my acer c # chromebook the fit is perfect and the extra zippered pocket is perfect for the power cord , a few usb sticks , and a microfiber cloth there 's still room for other things as well the protection from the padding is great the zipper is protected by material from coming in contact with my chromebook , so no chances of scratches
received this on the date that it was supposed to come and it so soo cute and formal i love it i love how the inside is so soft and plush , it definitely protects the smoothness of the chromebook i just love it

i ordered two of these , one for a samsung chromebook and one for a macbook air # . # -in this case was a perfect fit for both devices , plus the zippered , <unk> allow plenty of space for power bricks for these devices , as well though not absolutely necessary , the handles are convenient the nylon zippers seem sturdy enough , and will not damage the finish of the computer inside this case is really a good value at the price
i was surprised how much i like this case for my chromebook at first i just wanted something to protect my chromebook from getting banged up in my service van i did not want the handles , because i thought they looked stupid , but now i use them all the time and they lay flat when i do n't need them the material is stretchy so when i want to carry the cord in the pocket it fits just fine and when i do n't bring the cord the <unk> lays flat like it 's not even there the outer material is like a fabric so it does not slide around on the passenger 's seat in my van when i 'm driving which is a bonus especially when i have to hit the breaks the inner material is smooth so the chromebook slides in and out easily the zippers even have rubber like handles which make them easy to operate -lrb- i think they over did it with the advertising on the zipper handles and case , but i can live with that -rrb-
omg , i never expected this product to be so well made ; i just got it and time will tell if it survives airport after airport and my chronic need to write and <unk> no matter where i am nice lining , it 's soft and the outer shell appears to be padded well enough to withstand moderate use for the price , i do n't think i do n't think i could find the same thing in a brick and mortar store
i bought this product for my son 's acer c # it was a perfect fit i like the quality of the product and the way its padded throughout for added protection for your device great product for a very reasonable price i gladly recommend this product

need to air it out for a few days , after that it serves the purpose well zippers are good , front pocket , though not roomy , can hold a small mouse and power supply
i have an asus vivobook q # e with # . # & # # ; touchscreen this case fits like it was <unk> for the vivobook it has a convenient side pocket for earbuds , flashdrives , sd cards , etc . while still keeping a thin profile i also like the handles that allow me to pull the case out of my carry-on bag besides , you ca n't beat the price on this nice case

as a writer constantly on the go , i needed a portable setup for writing this included a usb keyboard large enough for rapid two hand <unk> connected to an android tablet with word processing software this case is the perfect size and offers the necessary protection for my android tablet , # key <unk> keyboard , power supply -lrb- for the android -rrb- , cables and tablet stand the total cost for absolutely everything including this case was under $ # i could n't be happier

the case is exactly what i needed for my # year old 's new chromebook the chromebook fits perfectly so he can slip it in the case and then put the whole case in his bookbag there is a small pocket that the charger could go in if needed he was excited that is was nice and plain -lrb- nothing fancy for this kid -rrb- and i was very happy with the low price
only have had it for # weeks or so but it is a simple , well-designed cover , snugly fits # in laptops , currently housing my samsung ultrabook well-padded without being bulky ; simple hand straps make for a useful way to carry the cover or transfer from one bag to another there is an extra pocket in front which i do n't use , as i do n't feel covers are made to carry other supplies , but could come in handy for the inclined user given the snug fit of the laptop into the bag , however , there is not a lot of space left for items to go into the front pocket , though other reviewers seem to feel it works just fine both zippers are durable and well made and attractive i wish it came in other colors -lrb- aside from pink -rrb- but honestly the black looks rather nice itself all in all a great product at an appropriate price
i bought this for my daughter 's chromebook when i bought her chromebook we looked at covers for it but the ones for the size she had seemed to be too tight a fit when i ordered my chromebook from amazon , i saw this and ordered it for my daughter she really really likes it <unk> likes the fact that there is a pocket on the outside so she can put a flashdrive or the power cord in it when she takes her chromebook with her , and she uses her chromebook a lot
bought this for an acer c # chromebook and it fits perfectly small size , great inside lining and a pocket for the charger perfect in every way only downside is strong chemical smell from neoprene hopefully that will go away in a week or so
i just got this bag and it is just what i was looking for perfect fit for my chromebook and with a handle and side pocket it fit the bill it looks like it will last a long time
it is exactly what it claims to be it fits the acer c # p perfectly , it is soft and cushy on the inside , and the zippered pocket on the outside is perfect for the power cord the icing on the cake it the very low price very happy ;
i purchased six cases for my acer chromebooks in my classroom my third graders have been asking to take the computers home to work on their homework i was very hesitant , but the cases are working beautifully the computers fit in the cases perfectly the handles were a must for little hands thank you for a great child friendly product
this was a perfect little case for my boyfriend 's laptop it 's soft but still a durable material and the handles makes it easy to carry it is really sleek so you can slide it in your bag or just hold it under your arm i liked the white interior for the price you can not beat the value
we purchased this case in combination with an outer clam shell for our # & # # ; mac air and we could not be happier it fits like a glove , is easy to carry , is padded and offers extra protection in combination with the clam shell i think the handles minimize the risk of dropping , and make it easy to carry
the product is nice exterior is black interior is very soft white additional storage in front zippered pocket is great handle is placed well and feels comfortable in my hand i like the little velcro closure on the handle to help keep the sides together the sleeve seems to be of good quality it fits my new hp chromebook # like a glove and also works well for samsung tablet as well the product was appropriately packages and arrived quickly i am pleased with purchase of this product
i bought this to have an extra layer of protection around my asus q # e in my bag i was quite surprised by the quality of the case the handles with the velcro are a nice touch i was not expecting the front pocket to be as big as it was it has more than enough room for the notebook 's charger , a stylus , a wireless mouse , and a screen cleaner i 'm very impressed with what was delivered
wanted a nice and simple case for my son to carry is chrombook to and from school this is it very light but provides enough protection while in his backpack
i am one of those less then more people this case is perfect for travel and securely holds a mac pro would highly recommended this case and the handle make it even more versatile
i ordered this case for my chromebook and it fit perfectly then , i ordered another for my ipad it is light , has a zippered side pocket for my cord and wireless mouse the handles are just right the material and the padded sides allow for the needed protection i highly recommend this case
great quality and speedy service this is going to be used by my middle school students for the school-issued chrome book it was reasonably priced , but protects their computers even in back packs and throughout a school day
works and looks great , was extremely easy to connect to wifi , one click and i was on this is a great laptop and the company itself is good to , if i ever need one again i would gladly purchase from this company
the case is protective , yet flexible to fit in my bag i was looking for one to fit my chromebook and they were all either too big or too small -lrb- meant for ipad or tablet -rrb- this was fits perfectly the company was great about checking to see if my order arrived and offered to send me another one free of charge if it had not arrived by the expected day or there were any defects
i bought two of these for chromebooks , one for me and one for my daughter when i opened the packaging , the white interior of one of them seemed less pure white than the other one - so i decided i 'd keep that one for myself and give the better one to my daughter when a follow-up e-mail arrived from the company seeking to know my satisfaction , i mentioned the discoloration adding that it was really no big deal but i wanted to be honest a replacement was sent immediately and i am equally impressed with the product and the desire of this company to make sure that their customers are # % satisfied
perfect for my new chromebook fits , is lightweight , offers some protection , easy to carry , and has a nice zippered side pouch for the cord and plug i can easily slip this into my tote bag for further protection and have one less things to carry got the black one so it is not too girly and goes with everything would buy again - good price , too
was very pleased , not only did i get an excellent deal with the need of two but delivery time earlier than expected quality so far seems better than hoped and now i can rest assure
i bought this for a friend for his ipad he says he loves it and keeps his ipad safe <unk> a little worried about the velcro going bad but it zips anyway just the handles velcro together so far so good maybe ill buy # for myself
very nice sleeve for a chromebook or other small laptop the handles and side pocket are a nice touch , and the material is very soft with a decent amount of padding the smell is a little strong out of the package , but nothing unbearable great product for the price
the sleeve looks great however , it did not fit my # lenovo correctly i had to squeeze it in because the edges on my laptop are square and rounded as the other laptops
however has an awful smell i aired it out and now it smells a little better . smell resembles a smell of a tire shop but really cute and i get a lot of compliments on it
exactly what i wanted it looks just like the picture mine came really fast , within two days of when i purchased it does have a chemical smell to it not too bothersome , but does give me a headache a bit other than that it is perfect
i was very happy to receive this product all the way from china # weeks before it was due to be received considering that i 've had to wait the full length of time for other items bought from china , this was unexpected and awesome ! ! i love the design , exactly as seen by the pictures however , the one major complaint i have about this item is the smell it 's a very strong chemical smell for the price i paid and how fast it got here , i am not upset i have sprayed some perfume in it , hopefully to <unk> it there is some padding , but i feel that more padding could definitely improve this product making it a lovely laptop case
i liked the laptop sleeve the colors are fun and stylish and order came quickly similar to the other reviews , it did have a strange chemical smell i think its the printing on the sleeve its been a week and it still has n't come completely out , but definitely not as strong as it had when it was first delivered it does n't offer much padding or protection for your laptop so if your looking for something more & # # ; cushy & # # ; , then i would not get this sleeve overall i like the design though and it gives me light protection for my laptop good for the price and the <unk> are great
okay so there is nothing wrong with this usually when i get a case or something decorative for something i already own , i find something wrong with it this is just perfect it fits my charger on those days i need it , my macbook pro retina # & # # ; , pencils , pens , a small book -lrb- not all of these at once haha , it 's not like <unk> huge ! -rrb- for sake of understanding i usually put the charger on one day , then pencils , pens , & a small novel on another occasion <unk> it 's beautiful , well priced , and has a nice cushion it 's not suitable for drops higher than # feet unless you 're looking to damage your computer ... so # would buy again if i ever <unk> it away
this laptop sleeve is , in terms of style alone , unlike any i usually see it 's super cute and boho and i love it it is also well-padded and protective it fits my # . # & # # ; dell inspiron perfectly
i got this case on sale and it has lived up to standards way past the price i paid the case is made to last and is very soft inside so i know that my laptop is well cushioned it is a little big for the laptop but i would rather have it bigger than smaller it was a great buy and i recommend it
i love this pattern it is even more gorgeous than it appears online my laptop fits nicely inside , and it is easy to slide in and out of my bag i love the durability of the material ; my laptop feels secure and protected inside the only way i can think of to possible improve it , is to maybe include a pocket on the inside or outside
keeps laptop from getting scratched my girlfriend likes the look not very padded , but it didnt advertise as being such warning , smells like burnt plastic for a week , but it wears off fits widescreen # inch hp well
it 's very pretty but i really like the zipper it 's very sturdy and heavy duty i do n't expect it will break anytime soon and that is always a concern with zippers it is a real good fit for my toshiba satelite <unk> # a snug enough it does n't move about but there 's room for me to leave the wireless mouse thingy plugged in
i absolutely adored this laptop case i have an asus # & # # ; , and was slightly worried that my computer would fit too loosely because it is extremely thin , but the case has been ideal trendy and protective two very good things
this is a well-designed backpack that holds your laptop next to your back , which is part of what makes it so sturdy the computer itself has a protective pocket , but aligned next to your back , it feels quite secure add to that lots of pockets , pen slots , and other organizational features it 's pretty much spot on for carrying all your gear to class one big thing is the loop on top which is sturdy and lets you hang it ... not all backpacks have that that said , it is a bit taller and <unk> than my other backpacks , which makes it feel like i 'm hiking a bit more than normal and , there 's really no design or style to it ... it 's pretty minimal in detail that might not be bad , but i always kind of preferred colors and designs
the amazon basics laptop <unk> lives up to its name : it is definitely basic this is an <unk> , bare bones , light duty backpack that would probably last the average <unk> one school year if they were careful with it it has a nice padded storage area for a laptop that fits my dell nicely and plenty of room for books , clothes , or whatever other personal belongings you need to tote around with you this backpack is not going to win any fashion or beauty <unk> in fact , i think it 's <unk> ugly it is quite functional , however , and i believe it is worth the purchase price
a solid backpack i 've been trying it out for a month now , and generally using it as a backpack - walking to nearby stores and bringing basic stuff home the compartments are well made , pretty standard sized , and the only flaw i have with the backpack is not it 's own it is too small to handle my laptop if you have a wide screen model , more than # & # # ; , it wo n't be a good laptop backpack for you - though it remains a good old fashioned backpack
it looks very basic , but for the price , this is a very sturdy , good quality bag there 's a well padded area for your laptop , lots of extra compartments for accessories , etc . the compartments feel very roomy with large openings , not narrow or tight at all the shoulder straps are padded and is very durable i think it 's sturdy enough to be my travel bag to drag on the road without fear of broken straps , etc . . the only drawback is it feels a bit big sometimes to carry daily whether it really lasts , only time will tell
this is a very nice backpack it fits my macbook pro # & # # ; , the charging equipment , and all of my school stuff -lrb- <unk> , etc . . i highly recommend this product it sits nicely on your back , and distributes the weight evenly without sacrificing comfort
i love , love , love this backpack there is plenty of padding to protect my laptop and lots of room for the cord most laptop bags are very thin and only have room for the computer this backpack leaves plenty of rooms for books , folders , and pens and pencils i enjoy the fact that it 's very & # # ; gender neutral & # # ; in color as well the price is very reasonable for such a quality backpack
* very well designed backpack with lots of space and clean contemporary lines * padded straps and padded pressure points on back wear well * well constructed with strong seams , yet lightweight and not too bulky * handle at the top of pack for carrying in one hand is convenient , but could use some padding * great value for the price
like all of the amazon basics gear bags , this laptop bag is simple and very well made in basic black with a bit of gray accents , this may be to bland for some people , but i love it the lack of flash means it will not draw attention when i 'm out and about the main compartment of the bag has a padded pouch that will easily fit a # -inch laptop , which makes it perfect for my backup computer my # -inch main machine will not fit also in that compartment is room for the power brick and a wireless mouse along with several other smaller accessories the middle compartment has more than enough room for a large book or two , several notebooks or a weekends worth of clothes -lrb- if you pack lightly -rrb- the front compartment is segmented off with what appears to be nylon fabric , but this is where you would keep pens , pencils , possibly your phone or other mobile device there is a front zippered area , that is small compared to the rest of the compartments , but would easily hold a cell phone or wallet with no problem all in all , i ca n't find anything bad to say about this bag and like other basics gear bags i 've received , i expect it to last me for quite a long time
this nifty backpack has three main compartments : # -rrb- a padded area with a pocket to secure a laptop or an ipad , # -rrb- a large area in the middle , and # -rrb- a zippered fold-down flap it is well constructed , light weight , padded and seems quite durable what a great multi-purpose accessory a must for every student
ultimately , i was looking for a backpack that would fit my small frame and this does a good job of it i have received compliments on the style not too bulky and carries my laptop , files , and other essentials the front pocket zipper was broken when it arrived which is a disappointment i can live without it , but it would be nice to use since it 's there
overall it 's a very nice , comfortable backpack amazon wont let me return it , though , and i do n't know why so it looks like i 'm keeping the sky blue one i would definitely rather have my chosen color than have this company choose it for me
i use it as a brief case to take <unk> papers on public transportation daily compute i works fine it looks fine if you do n't look too closely ok value for the money
i like the bag a lot it is compact and holds two big textbooks and two # & # # ; binders with paper . i will say that if i want to transport my laptop i will have to carry the binders . . but thats no sweat off my <unk> and all happy <unk> my
i thought it would be made out of leather but it is just made out of regular backpack material the buckles are made out of leather though because it is not leather the style sort of goes away and it is too simple for me however it seems sturdy and big enough to fit everything i 'll need for school it would be fine for someone who likes plain and simple things but that 's not me so i 'm returning it
i had intended to use it for school but it is a bit too big , it should be very useful for short weekend trips though or as a large carry on on an airplane
i 'm updating a previous review i wrote at first when i got it the backpack the zipper in the front was broken the seller immediately emailed me and helped me figure out how to fix it the backpack is really cute and fits my shoulders perfectly , which is hard to find for a petite lady like myself now that the zipper is fixed i 'm really excited to be able to use it again ca n't emphasize enough how nice the seller was about it , even giving me a percentage refunded to my account for my troubles
i love this backpack ! ! i bought it for school , as i start college in the fall i 've not yet put it to use , but i did a test run by filling it with some of my heaviest books it has quite a bit of room in it my only concern is that i question if the straps will stay strong enough to last me my days lugging around heavy textbooks , they seem a bit thin but as a laptop bag i know it will be perfect stylish and prompt shipping are major bonuses !
i bought the navy blue and brown one and i love it i have only been using it for about a month now , but it is holding up great it has plenty of room and i feel like my laptop is safe
this backpack holds everything and it is cute the only thing is that it is a little bigger than i expected so it makes me look like a little kid -lrb- i 'm # ' # -rrb- also the zippers run smooth but not as smoothly as they should
i really like the style it looks great , and i 've gotten lots of compliments my only complaint is that the zippers are a little cheap , so you have to zip very slowly to prevent the zipper teeth from <unk> also , it had like three different tags that said & # # ; hot style & # # ; that i removed it greatly improved the look of the bag
super cute , i get a lot of complements fits my books and folder and some snacks for college smells a little weird , but for the price and quality i can easily overlook it
wow , i love this bag i got it to replace my old school bag that i was just completely tired of , this bag has the perfect amount of pockets and i love the main zipper compartment i was worried a little about the size being to small for all my books and big binder , but it 's perfect size the straps are <unk> comfortable on my shoulders even with all the weight in the bag great durable material all around the bag do n't be fooled by the lines on the side though , those are n't water bottle holders like i was expecting , but that 's definitely not a problem for me personally . # stars wonderful , cute , and very functional ! & # #
everything about this backpack is as described in the description the colors are just as pictured and i 've had it for about a month now with no problems at all the very front zipper is a little tricky to close sometimes , but other than that , this bag is greater than i expected , especially for such a low price
i was planning to buy a bag for my laptop that i could bring around to school then i found this and i 'm very pleased with this purchase i got the black one the quality of the material is also really good so i do n't see it ripping or breaking anytime soon my only worry about it before i bought it were the straps on the back there were n't any pictures of the back and i did n't want the thin ones since those rip easily and are very uncomfortable if the bag was filled with books so i was very pleased when it came with the thicker straps with the padding it 's extremely comfortable and cute would n't hesitate to buy another one as a gift this was a great purchase and would recommend it to anyone looking for a good-quality laptop bag that 's stylish and can be brought anywhere
poor quality product metal rings that hold zipper tabs are flimsy , easily bendable , and have a gap in them so that the zipper tabs frequently slip off of them also , the zipper is difficult to zip around the edges and often gets caught because of the angle of the loose fabric surrounding the zipper i do not think that this product is defective as much as it is just poorly designed and very cheaply made laptop cases ought not be flimsy and unreliable , as a computer is one of the most important tools we own nowadays what a huge letdown
did n't fit had to send it back really disappointed but a macbook pro w / retina display is too small for this unit this little <unk> was not mentioned in the <unk> text
i love the aesthetics of the case and my laptop feels nicely protected , but overall the fit is a bit larger than i 'd like one would think that a # & # # ; might squeeze in this case better than a # & # # ; , which feels like it 's swimming in space overall , a better price than the bookbook version , but not quite as fancy
this product is great ! it is an excellent laptop protector in my bag and it provides extra security because people think its a book i would recommend this to anyone who would like to protect the life of their laptop
clicked into place , but not very tight , but stays on i thought the shell would be solid instead of more transparent you can still see the color of the yoga , which is chrome
i ordered this to not only protect my # s but to also let me add flare to my laptop without sticking things directly to the laptop unfortunately , i did n't look at the cover close enough it has <unk> ridges which affects the ability to apply stickers and decals , such as my # & # # ; <unk> decal i was hoping to apply fit and finish is great though
i love it i am a big fan of pink and it is easy to attach to laptop now i know which is mine when i go to family function and everyone has tablets
