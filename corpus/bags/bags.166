this is a great looking briefcase and appears that it will hold up well zippers are sturdy and it has a classic design the biggest drawback is that its sturdiness makes it so stiff that it 's hard to fit much into it i have a # & # # ; laptop that just makes it , but it 's a tight squeeze for the charger and the # other small chargers i need to carry the portfolio side is also tight , a thin padfolio and maybe # pretty thin files is all it holds maybe it 's just taking awhile to break in , but i may end looking to another solution due to the lack of capacity
pros -lrb- according to my boyfriend , a lawyer who i gave this as a gift - plenty of space -lrb- this was the biggest briefcase i could find for him , since he kept saying he needed more room for legal files than any others we saw had - excellent pockets for organization - shiny leather -lrb- if you like , my boyfriend does
i bought it recently and am using it for my job as a teacher it has enough space for storage of the materials i need i am very satisfied with it
very nice looking case which has a lot of pockets for storage of documents the only this is that there are so many compartments inside the case that you can forget sometimes where you put things however , overall the case is stylish and has a nice clean shiny appearance
this samsonite is just what i needed for my lectures there is a vast amount of space for virtually anything a student would need in this <unk> world , it even had multiple pockets for every product that had come to mind
this briefcase gave me mixed expectations when i read the reviews i was worried about the quality of leather and the size , along with the durability i 've taken this thing everywhere , and i have n't had a problem out of the # briefcases i 've owned -lrb- of $ # - $ # -rrb- , this is by far my favorite very spacious , if needed leather is super nice and it is sleek everyone comments on how great it looks it fits everything smoothly and has room for virtually and office supplies you 'd need to put it in very happy with this and i recommend it con : only thing is that the strap for the computer never can be pulled very tight because the velcro is too high
this samsonite leather expandable briefcase -lrb- black -rrb- was purchased as a gift for my son who is a musician and a music teacher he is pretty particular and fell in love with it 's great quality and <unk> he can use it for his music concert trips and music books , lesson plans and papers from his students he is happy and so am i. also , i did check quite a few places to cost compare , and amazon was the least expensive that is always a plus
<unk> <unk> <unk> la calidad del <unk> <unk> <unk> lo <unk> del <unk> para mi <unk> <unk> para <unk> <unk> un <unk> de <unk> en la <unk> y <unk> <unk>
i read all of the reviews before buying - actually my wife gave to me as a christmas present - and i am very happy with this purchase - regardless of price has held up well , still looks new and i carry on sales calls about # days each week i am not rough with it but it does get tossed in my trunk and carried on airplanes and has no noticeable marks pockets and dividers well placed and expands if needed . a great buy
i 've read that some reviewers feel this case is cheap or that it seems like fake leather , i disagree the case is certainly a polished leather however i do not feel as though it feels cheap in any way its samsonite and carries all the quality you 'd expect from the brand i love the amount of space it offers since i am able to fit my computer , books , ipad , and other items in it at the same time its definitely not for someone seeking a slim case , but for anyone seeking extra room , you 'll love it
i bought this case to take care of all my daily tote needs and it has served me well so far i 'm three month in and i 'm not known for being easy on my stuff and this bag is holding up great i fill the thing to the point that it 's heavy then i stuff a few more things into it i have but one noticeable scuff and that 's because i hurriedly tossed it into the back of my car in a rain storm assuming it holds up for a year or two i 'd gladly replace it with the same bag again
i gave it as a gift he really liked it he was looking for this style of expandable briefcase and i found it thank samsonite for <unk> a variety of briefcases
i love this briefcase i use it every day it is beautifully made i am amazed to be able to use this for organizing the <unk> parts of my personal life
i travel every week , and bring this with me it is well-organized , handy to expand when necessary , and looks great - i 've received many compliments on it - in fact i 've been surprised at how much people pay attention to that people are also surprised at how affordable it was the only downside for me is that the sleeve to put the handle of my roller bag through this is tight , especially when i have a newspaper in the outside pocket i <unk> just slip the handle of the briefcase of the roller-bag handle instead , which seems to work fine and is faster - but i do push it through the sleeve if i have a very long walk
i gave this to my husband to replace one that he has had for years it is lighter than his old one and very roomy inside the test will be to see if it holds up to all his traveling
this briefcase is everything i expected stylish , yet professional the storage compartments are set up exactly to fit my needs i think this is a product i will use for a long time
i bought this as a gift for my husband and he absolutely loves it it 's fantastic quality and perfect for his laptop the only drawback is a very minor one he said that it 's the first bag that he 's had that did not have a spot for his business cards
i bought this item as a gift they reported they thoroughly love it because it fulfilled all their needs with the compartments and the style also , because the name brand , i expected this and it did not fail me
so , it is the second one i bought , which might scare you but i am pretty rough on bags i carry lots of heavy things , and i travel a lot so , when a bag lasts a year and a half , i think that 's a pretty good thing
i bought this sleeve for my # inch macbook pro- retina display the length and the width are perfect but the height is not it better accommodates laptops that are & # # ; fat & # # ; , such as the older # inch macbook pro or dell for ultra-thin laptops -lrb- like macbook air or the mbp with retina display -rrb- , there will be a significant gap i use this with the flexible insert that came with it to give laptop a snug fit otherwise , great product , excellent finish also , the price is unbeatable
it 's not great , and it 's not bad it holds a laptop i do like the flaps inside to hold the laptop in place , but they do n't do much because the sleeve is too big for my laptop the foam lining has some dents in it , mostly a cosmetic issue rather than a functional one the zipper is awkward because it does n't go down one side completely a handle would be nice
i bought this for my new lenovo t # the quality of the sleeve is great with lots of padding , as one would expect for a samsonite product however , my t # can only fit in without the battery -lrb- it is not impossible to zip the sleeve with the battery on , but it takes a lot of effort and probably will break the zipper in a few days . i decided to keep this product anyhow and carry the battery separately , given the negative reviews about the <unk> sleeves but think twice if that 's what you want to do
this laptop sleeve is ok out of # , i would give it a # it is a samsonite but the zipper and the handles on the zippers are very cheaply made i have gone through # of these in two years so the average life span on these things is around # years but , for the money you spend , it really is n't a bad deal this sleeve is very affordable and honestly does the job my dell xps # z fits perfectly and the sleeve does adequately protect my laptop samsonite could have done a much better job on the zipper good product and value for the money spent
it 's elastic , so no problem fitting my fat # . # much better than the targus crap they sell at target ca n't beat the price either a tight fitting sleeve not wasting space
fits my dell # z perfectly -lrb- # . # in screen -rrb- decent amount of padding , has small flap that sticks out to hold laptop in place and to protect edge of laptop
i thought this product had high quality zippers unfortunately , my $ # laptop was testing out the back part of the backpack and it flew out with the zipper zipped the zipper was opened from the bottom while it 's zipped my backpack wo n't even zip properly and now i have a damaged laptop and screen the backpack was not even half full i am very upset with this brand i wish i can show pictures here to show you guys exactly what i 'm talking about i 'm so frustrated
this bag was really good while it lasted i bought it # months ago i only used it for travel -lrb- only # times during last year -rrb- but last week , the right strap of the bag was completely ripped took it to several luggage repair stores , but no body could repair it
i loved this bag for traveling with all of its room and pouches however , the used right should harness is already coming apart after # months this is not a real heavy duty bag , and i 'm going to need to get a refund or something from amazon
i looked and looked & do like this pack ... but it is a little heavier than i expected biggest disappointment is that the space intended to hold a tablet will not hold a full size ipad -lrb- in the apple case -rrb-
i love the storage the backpack has the issue i had was the strap <unk> broke the first day i used it i didnt even have <unk> heavy in it looking at them they are small and easily breakable
this is a fantastic backpack for carrying a laptop , organization , summer <unk> water bottle bag , and light hiking with one small exception the stitching on my right shoulder strap is coming undone , leaving a mix of neoprene , canvas , and threads bare and exposed i have owned this backpack for # months and i need it to go all day , every day for as long as it takes i worked for a while as a <unk> and if you get subpar equipment there was a lot more on the line than a <unk> <unk> i 've owned two of these backpacks and i 'm not sure if they recently <unk> production or if i have an <unk> but frankly , i 'm disappointed it cheapens the brand as well as leaves a <unk> taste in my mouth to pay a good amount of money for a subpar product i love you swissgear , but you 're bringing me down
this was my third swiss gear bag i have already replaced it the rt shoulder strap separated from the back pack almost instantly also , this bag was not as padded and comfortable to wear as my previous bags
i have used the pack for several plane trips and carry my laptop in it when traveling . it seems quite sturdy and well made it is rather heavy though especially once anything else is packed in the many other pockets i 'm a petite woman and it is a lot for me to carry through the airport along with a carryon , but it is a nice pack
i purchased this backpack because i knew that the swissgear company made very good products this bag is definitely made with very good materials and seems to be very durable i am rating it as only a three because i found that although it is a very big bag it does not really hold all that much , this is because of the scan smart section of the bag it takes up a lot of space and it will probably not be used so often the laptop sits in a separate compartment that semi detaches if you were n't carrying your laptop you would probably be able to fit a text book of something of that size in that area if you travel a lot and it is an inconvenience to take your laptop out than , the convenience of the scan smart feature may be beneficial and i would rate this bag higher but if you want this bag for daily use it may not the the best choice there are other bags out there that would better suit you the bag also is a bit heavy to begin with so this adds unwanted weight to your load
the swissgear backpack is great - a really nice bag but it was not what i wanted the amazon dimensions were wrong , and i ended up with a very large bag that when i wanted a small one great bag , but not described accurately
this one is a winner my # . # inch ol & # # ; <unk> toshiba laptop fits in the laptop compartment just like another reviewer said it would it 's good looking and has a ton of space the only reason i did not give it # stars was when i received it the seam as coming apart on the inside top flap i did n't have time to mail it back and wait for another one , i needed it yesterday , if you know what i mean so i had it repaired and it 's good as new i would not suspect that the seam defect happens a lot nonetheless i would highly recommend that you buy this product it 's the real deal .
this is a really strong and well made back pack it is much larger than i expected it to be the storage space for the laptop seems to take up over half of the space there does n't seem to be much space left for other things but it does work very well for airport security i have n't had any issues going through that makes life a whole lot easier if you travel a lot and hate digging your computer out all the time
i like this backpack i use it to transport a laptop , a # inch tablet , a kindle and an ipod nano all of the electronics and chargers , etc fit easily i also use it to transport my daily papers , notebook , etc . this really fits well on my back
i have an asus g # -lrb- # . # `` screen -rrb- and it just fits in this backpack it has enough room for my gaming mouse and the giant power block the laptop comes with , with room to spare material is durable , and is comfortable to wear for long periods of time
i tend to overload my <unk> and end up ruining them but this one just takes it all great load distribution over your back the backpack is large enough to fit everything -lrb- even my # `` laptop , some books and a projector ! -rrb- my only concern is that , after # months im starting to see some signs of wear not critical but worth looking after to avoid having it ruined before time
really awesome bag , i work and commute in san francisco , and this is the perfect travelers backpack i 'm able to carry my work clothes and casual outfits , textbooks , shoes , boots , and even my lunch i even lost three <unk> in there xd , i forgot it was in there lol still for the price , of what feels to be a high quality bag , its worth the buy my only concern is the thin shoulder strips , everything else about this backpack is thick , sturdy , and strong , but then you have these thin shoulder strips it just doesnt make since to me still this backpack is holding up , if anything ever happens i 'll update this post
i have a # & # # ; laptop and there is room enough for a bigger one i do like all the pockets but i think there should be more inner pockets on the two front compartments very we 'll made compared to all my previous packs
room for all my laptop equipment and is large enough for my # & # # ; laptop love the scansmart ability so i no longer have to pull my computer out of my bag
the backpack is generally great it is sturdy and has a ton of compartments the only problem i have with it , is that it holds a great deal of stuff but does n't supply enough support to take the weight off your back or shoulders it would have gotten # stars from me if it had a hip support belt to ease the load that the capacity offered i ended up putting less stuff in it than it could take because i was wearing it while walking so much everyday and even though it 's big , it still fits under airplane seats , which is a big plus for me
this swissgear packpack is very solid and has plenty of room for everything i need to store in it i took it through security on a recent flight with no problems at all i 'm very satisfied with it
though bigger and heavier than expected , this bag is great well made , great features like the show through sleeve for laptop , lots of pockets and zippered pockets straps are comfortable
this is not light weight at all , but it is an awesome backpack i like all the pockets straps are n't too wide that they get in the way very nice design i got it for work because i needed a lightweight backpack , but i feel like it is heavier than it needs to be it is heavy because it is very sturdy and made of excellent quality , however , when you fill it , it does become quite heavy
i am constantly traveling for my work and this bag makes it easy to transport my laptop the only thing i would add is a connecting strap between the two shoulder straps to keep them from rubbing on the inside under my shoulders
there is only one large section to store your belongings it 's kind of awkward how the bag can zip all the way in half i would rather have another large storage section that the & # # ; airport safe & # # ; laptop zipper *** this is not an <unk> safe bag *** they still demand you that you pull out your laptop and place it in a separate bin
this backpack is well constructed and holds quite a bit of stuff i find the ` scan ' feature , which allows you to unzip at the airport so your laptop can be scanned , actually reduced carrying capacity plus , at the airports i traveled through i had to remove the laptop anyway so , i would prefer to have the space used for the ` fold open ' feature to be another cargo area instead but this is no fault of the manufacturer - some airports require that all laptops come out of the pack this is still a quality backpack and well thought out
you never know about backpacks and how they last until you actually use them some start to wear out in a matter of weeks and others hold up for years while we wo n't know for sure about this one for a while , it seems well made with nice features and a good look i gave it # stars instead of # only due to the higher price it it indeed holds up , then it 's worth the extra money
i ordered this backpack because my old one started to tear around the top of the shoulder straps granted , i had been using it for # . # years , so it 's not as if it had n't met is usefulness i bought this one because i needed something really sturdy that also had a section for my laptop i like it so far it 's got great reinforcements throughout the main compartment and the shoulder straps have a nice amount of padding the only complaint i have is that it 's a little heavy , even when it 's empty i suppose that 's something i 'll just have to get used to , because i 'd rather have a <unk> bag than a <unk> bag that has to be replaced in a few months ' time
this backpack is of solid construction with plenty of pockets to store all of my gear it has a nice padded compartment for my lap top with plenty of space for my kindle , magazines , notebooks etc . i am very pleased with my purchase and would highly recommend this backpack to anyone who is in the market for this type of item
there were not a ton of options for a backpack designed to fit a # & # # ; laptop when i began my search for this product swissgear delivered with this great solution while i am not a frequent flier , i still find the quick access design of the laptop compartment to work great with lots of storage and organization this backpack has been just what i was looking for the only thing i would change would be the net style beverage holders on the side could use an adjustment device to accommodate a larger variety of containers as long as you dont have anything in the side zippered pocket behind it , it will fit a larger -lrb- # oz i think -rrb- <unk> or the like would definitely recommend to a friend , i love this bag
this is a great item it 's very well constructed and just the right size for school -lrb- not too small , not obnoxiously large -rrb- plenty of pockets and compartments for good organization i would without a doubt purchase this item again
i love everything about this back pack except that its a little bigger than i expected overall , it 's good design , very good quality and has great pockets it 's perfect for a long weekend get away or your daily commuting
this thing has so much space i 've packed in several text books , a laptop , a charging <unk> and handheld mobile computer along with flash drives , external harddrive and a bunch of other stuff and still had plenty of room big zippers and lots of pockets to keep secure and organized only thing i do n't really like is the laptop bay since the size adjustment just velcro 's in , does n't seem that secure but would be great if you had a # & # # ; laptop
layout , pockets , quality , comfort are all excellent only complaint is it can expand rather deep , even without being too full the contents just kind of settle in a way to make it fat and difficult to fit under an airline seat length and width are good , but i 'd try to find a less deep backpack for air travel
very happy i purchased this back pack i carry a hp # in monitor laptop , kindle fire hd # in tablet , note # phone and all the charging cables , wireless mouse , books and notebooks , a # in binder plus other school supplies and i still have lots of room to go comfortable to carry , zipper are perfect for a tsa master lock just a great purchase i will gladly buy another one if/when needed
this backpack is <unk> of heavy duty quality materials and the compartments are plenty and spacious it has one fewer compartment than the previous swissgear backpack i replaced -lrb- because i tore a gaping hole in it -rrb- also , the main aggravation is that some of the zippers do n't operate smoothly the way the backpack is sewn together , some of the zipper go around a fairly tight corner and the bind there and do n't always operate smoothly it 's an aggravation more than anything
backpack is really good , comfort and spacious for # in laptop . this is really worth to have this and i dont have any complaint on this product i recieved
this is a great business backpack this is the second i have bought in three years i travel extensively for business and like to take a slr camera , which adds quite bit of weight this backpack handles it all it is well balanced , has room for my computer , books , materials , and photography equipment it is also very easy to use when going through security in the states or europe some of pockets have been shortened from my previous pack , but i find it still to be the best traveling & # # ; business backpack & # # ; i have found
got this as a <unk> christmas gift for the husband before we flew out to canada for the holidays turned out to be a great investment , so far seems to be top notch quality in many ways -lrb- good , strong material and stitching , heavy duty zippers -rrb- , and is even comfortably shaped for both a tall mr. and a short tiny <unk>
i have had the backpack for a little over a month i purchased it for business travels since my computer bag was getting too heavy to lug through the airports so far it has worked out well the scansmart feature has worked at # airport security <unk> thus far with no questions asked i carry a # & # # ; laptop and all my it support gear scansmart feature - my laptop stays in my bag through <unk> roomy interior section for jackets etc . zippers and pulls are smooth and very well <unk> handle saves wear and tear on shoulder <unk> of pockets - very handy and keeps things <unk> as a business traveler , it would be great to have a pocket dedicated to pens and <unk> straps could use a little more padding -lrb- i would give it # stars if it had more padding i do n't have alot of mileage on it yet so i ca n't vouch for the durability but it appears to be well-built of high quality materials so i expect it to last so far i am very pleased with the purchase
i bought this to replace a timberland backpack that was less than a year old and already starting to fall apart my first impression of this bag was very positive it is a much better built bag and feels like it will hold up very well to daily use lots of room and compartments inside to help you stay organized it 's very comfortable to wear even with a heavy load and i love the rings on the end of the adjustable straps i do n't travel much , but the scansmart feature will be handy when i do
i ordered this backpack for my boyfriend as a grad present i wanted to get him a really nice backpack for all the heavy books he 'll have in med school this backpack looks as good as the picture and he loves it ! the shipping was <unk> fast and the bag came within # days after ordering , and # days earlier than expected overall this ebags provided great service and i will definitely recommend them to anyone

i bought this backpack for my husband to replace his previous backpack which was coming apart my husband travels for work and carries his laptop in his backpack he appreciates the ruggedness of this backpack and has no complaints about it my husband hopes this will last as long as the backpack he had for thirteen years which was , unfortunately , stolen a while back so far , it is a great backpack
strong , sturdy , comfy , and roomy all that you would want to find in a backpack pocket for laptop is great as it separates it from text books , binders , and notebooks which makes everything much easier
i 've bought this backpack for my # & # # ; laptop but it fits # & # # ; laptops too also it have a big main pocket , # bottle externals and <unk> pockets it is more comfortable than i expected
i did a lot of research before getting this backpack i have had it for almost three months and have been enjoying thus far it is very durable and has plenty of space the design works out great for organizing the things that i like to carry there is only one thing that i would like to change , and that would be to have thicker padding on the bottom where the laptop sits i would definitely recommend this to a friend
i gave this back pack # stars because it is very well built and has ample storage for my things the security checkpoint <unk> at disney world actually asked me where the kitchen sink was love it ! ! !
when i saw the swissgear travel backpack # black , i thought the price was bit on the high side however , i said one day let me treat myself for good quality product i got it and had taken it on a trip to <unk> in germany i was happy that i bought it since it has all the right <unk> for anything you need to think off i attached my home keys to the key holder at the front pocket there was an opening in the back pack so that you could get your earphones through and keep your ipad or ipod in the backpack the side compartments you could use it for a water bottle you try to scan through the airport security it stays flat , etc etc . a good product
bought this to use as my tennis bag i always had the conventional # or # <unk> bag but wanted to downsize to a backpack firs saw the swissgear backpack in sams club but when i was ready to buy i could n't find it in sams i play with a # square inch <unk> and usually carry # sometimes # <unk> and the all fit the great thing about it that it has the swiss logo so i tell everyone it 's a <unk> bag !
i bought this for a # nd laptop that i have in my apartment it is nice - a basic backpack the is colorful and has lots of places to store your materials it is also very attractive as i have received several compliments on it i highly recommend
lots of pockets , zippers work so easily and are of high quality easy carry , easy to adjust holds a lot of gizmos just the right weight to be durable but not heavy at all recommed to anyone in fact have already to at least three people looking at the bag
showed up on time and was a replacement for a much cheaper version of the more or less same backpack that gave up the ghost only after years of travel and lugging the backpack around this new version is way better than the other version lots of <unk> for hiding the one ring , if required the flip down back means you can keep your laptop snug and save in the backpack and saves you about # . # seconds of effort when you normally have to remove your laptop at airport security as a frequent traveller i will gain about # minutes of time and time is money so , <unk> i 'm a richer man for it , so thanks swiss dudes <unk> though , great quality , solid stitching , great zipper quality , more pockets than sense , and no complaints you 'll love this if you have a # . # & # # ; laptop -lrb- i have the vaio and its a monster and easily slips inside this backpack -rrb-
this is a very well made backpack and i 'm happy with my purchase it is quite comfortable to wear and fits the laptop along with a lot of extra stuff i would suggest two improvements - on the inside , it would be nice to have a few more compartments second , the bag leans forward when sitting in an upright position - almost like you have to lean it at a sharp degree tilted back to stand up straight oh one last thing - the zippers can be a little difficult to zipper quickly - i think this has to do with it being so new though , and it should get better with time
super fast shipping really nice backpack it took a few days to get used to the various compartments but i like it much better than just having one huge space i can separate my workout shoes/clothes from <unk> etc - it makes it very nice to keep everything organized material seems like it is very durable and will last a long time which is great , because i 'll definitely put it to the test
the build is quite sturdy it holds enough , meaning it is not too big , therefore helps resist the <unk> to pack more items than necessary access to the laptop compartment is very convenient i have n't had the opportunity to be subjected to airport <unk> since purchasing this it does open to easily display the laptop i use this on a regular basis and find it easier to use and more comfortable than the over-the-shoulder laptop bag it replaced
i did not want to have to check in any bags for my # week trip to ireland so i bought this backpack and was able to fit everything i needed in it lots of compartments make it easy to organize items it is durable , very comfortable to wear and just an all around great quality product i would definitely recommend this for travelers
this is the best purchase yet it arrive super fast , product was well packaged quality awesome i just ca n't say anything negative on this i will so purchase another one soon
i really like this backpack it appears to be well constructed and has thoughtful placement of pockets throughout i really like the pockets on the inside that are dedicated to a smart phone and a tablet it 's empty weight is also low relative to other backpacks i 've had
things get lost in here , it 's so spacious i ca n't wait to take this on a trip to see how it works right now it 's what i use to carry everything to and from school , which given the pockets and sleeves , allows for a lot
great bag ! fits everything perfectly , with plentiful compartments and spacious pouches ; pockets of all sizes i love the computer compartment . also , it is amazingly comfortable with nice cushioning on the back .
we were looking for a backpack for my husband for work this one might of been a little too nice for this tasks but her likes all the pockets and options that it has for carrying all his stuff to and from his semi
great backpack for a travelling student easy through airport security , more than enough room for ... well , everything -lrb- you might fit a kitchen sink in it -rrb- only thing it could use is a solar panel for charging while you fly durable , comfortable , and -lrb- again -rrb- lots of space
