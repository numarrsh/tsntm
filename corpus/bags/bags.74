i bought this for my daughters new mac book pro , call it an <unk> policy it fits like a glove and the neoprene case material would help absorb some of the shock if it was dropped or help protect the surface finish if it was in a backpack
i was worried it would be too tight since the case said it was for both # `` - # . # `` netbooks ; however , it fits just right for my acer a # . # `` netbook i can easily slide it in without my netbook feeling too snug or too loose for a # `` netbook though , i think it might be a bit on the loose side , but i do n't have one to test it with good padding and material to provide a little bit of extra protection should last a fair while

i needed a soft cover for my new hp envy and this definitely fit the bill it is well padded on the corners and sensitive areas , lightweight and will not take up too much room in my travel backpack the only suggestion i would make is to include the actual inside dimensions so buyers can measure their devices before ordering
