i love this cover the color is very pretty , and protects your computer i just had one problem , the keyboard that came with it was clear not black , and the quality was very poor but the case works fine

i am very very happy with this product i did a lot of research before purchasing this hard shell case for my mac this case fits perfectly and the keyboard cover was an added bonus i would recommend this case
i have a macbook pro # inch and this case fit it perfectly i received the free keyboard cover as well , but chose not to use it per advice from a tech friend
i have been looking for one for a while i was a bit hesitant to order it but i am so happy i did it is perfect ! service was great a definite winner
this is the # nd macbook cover i have purchased from ipearl mcover i bought the first one about a year and a half ago and just recently needed another one i had to do a little bit of research to figure out who i ordered the first one from but it was more then worth it the cover fits my macbook perfectly and delivery only took # days ! great customer service will purchase from them again as i need any products that they sell
very nice hot pink cover actually the color <unk> down and also gets more vibrant in different environments but the picture is a good representation of the color the case was shipped very quickly & it was super easy to snap on i love that it gives my macbook personality i 'm really happy i ordered it it does make me smile just looking at it
i had a real hard time deciding what to choose for a cover for my macbook pro this by far was my <unk> <unk> ever i chose this because what it offer and i was reading the other reviews and by god , this case is perfect i love the color first off , i got a pink color secondly , the covers snapped on easily i actually messed up and snapped it on the opposite way so i was hard to take off , obviously because i put it on wrong but once i took it off , i put it the right way and i instantly felt happy about it i still do it protects my macbook from scratches and i feel safe to place my laptop on tables and such places -lrb- of course with a quick wipe down , to keep it clean -rrb- you wont regret it
it arrived in the time they said it would this case is wonderful , the legs lift it at a perfect angle for me to type i chose pink love the color it was a true pink and matched the keyboard cover i had chosen
i was worried that this would not be very strong case to protect the computer . but it works great , protects it , and i love the color . . you have to write back legs comfortably while <unk> equipment . very good price
i love the case just what i needed it is my favorite color and it protects my macbook no complaints here shipment was fast and in a hurry , i received my macbook case in # days from order date happy as van be
i like this it 's so nice it fits good . all my coworkers and friends complement me on this only bad thing was the key board cover was all clear and not the pink one from the picture
this case fits my # inch macbook pro perfectly the pink color is exactly as shown and not only does it look great but it provides great protection as well
i 'm in love with this case , not only does it protect my mac , but it makes it look cute and girly the little back legs are awesome , it makes writing so much easier
i adore the case the plastic is durable and the color is fantastic , though <unk> than pictured -lrb- i ordered the pink -rrb- the keyboard cover is not my favorite but it was free so i have no complaints
this is definitely an awesome deal it is very easy to snap on , and adds color to your laptop i love the pink especially the case is very secure and worth the buy
i have had this case since my freshman year i am currently a junior and its still keeping my mac perfect and free of damage it does have some minor scratch on the case but it is hard plastic i ca n't complain because it had done a great job of protecting my case and i love the pop up legs under the case
i had already bought the green one months back and i have fallen in love with this one ! ! so cute and the shipping was very fast ! glad it went on
i have bought many covers but this one is fantastic it is great quality looks amazing , fits perfectly and it feels pretty neat too if your looking for a good cover you wo n't go wrong with this one trust me i 've gone through so many covers and this one truly is the best one yet also it is not hard to take off and put back on for cleaning
love my case . it was very easy to put on and take off if necessary to clean fits perfectly and was happy that i got it mailed to me sooner than expected i would recommend anyone to buy this
it was definitely a good buy it arrived quicker than i expected and fit my laptop perfectly i really liked the feet so my laptop doesnt overheat and the matching keyboard protector will definitely prevent a lot of crap from getting on the keys
this cover was easy to put on , and i love that my apple logo shows through it 's very nice , i get compliments on <unk> all the time the keyboard cover feels weird to use , so i do n't use it often , but thats ok it 's still cute
perfect product , very nice color , i even bought one for a friend , since it is offered at a very reasonable price it covers macbook perfectly i also like the board cover , and the option to make the retractable feet -- a great option to have
my daughter wanted this case because it was pink i wanted it to protect her laptop this is a great cover very well made we had it now for year love <unk> it thank you ! !
i needed a case and in local stores they were # + . to get all of this in a bundle together was a huge bonus highly recommend this product
this case is one of the best things i ever bought this is my first macbook ever & i love pink so this fits well for my new laptop it 's very easy to snap on and off & it really <unk> it i love it i recommend everyone to buy it
i received this case for my mac and i have to say i 'm extremely happy with it i have had it on my computer for almost three months and still have n't gotten tired of it it does n't make your computer bulky and is very cute
i 've been looking at cases for my macbook for months now i saw this one and read some of the reviews i decided to purchase and i was not disappointed the case looks just like the picture and its easy to take on and off i love how it looks on my macbook and i love how it has the retractable feet at the bottom but i can say the only negative i had was i did not receive a black keyboard but other than that i would recommend this product to anyone
i researched all the reviews for days in search of a good hard shell case and i found it the ipearl is cute and fit great on my mac the price was great and i will definitely buy another one in a different color
i had previously bought an ipearl cover for my macbook air and it was a perfect fit and worked great for me not only does it fit well , the price is excellent i had previously purchased a name brand cover for my macbook pro # & # # ; and paid close to $ # . # and it was only available in clear or black , boring ... i love the pink and the one i bought for my macbook air is turquoise , a great color too , but the pink is the best
bought it for the wife and she loves it this is not going to & # # ; save & # # ; your laptop from a major fall , however it looks neat , and keeps the laptop from getting scratches , while providing protection from minor falls i am thinkin about getting one for my own computer , probably just in a different color than pink
i was skeptical when it arrived and i saw the packaging but it fits perfect and is good quality i did n't purchase to protect computer if dropped but to protect for scratches when in book bag etc , it looks great and the keyboard cover is a great bonus . i love it !
i would definitely recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a cheap , reliable computer case i love the color and the case fits my computer perfectly i am very satisfied with the product
the ipearl pink macbook cover is perfect it was delivered on time and i just snapped it on , easy as one two three to remove it is a little more <unk> , you 're afraid of breaking the case or denting your laptop , but that means its pretty secure so far the retractable stands in the back and the feet in front are good , but i just got this so i 'll have to update it the color is adorable i love it it opens and closes smoothly , and all the ports are open sufficiently i would suggest cleaning the ipearl cover and your macbook prior to snapping it on so it does n't leave any residue or scratches definitely would recommend this product to anyone who wants some cheap durable protection !
this item is labeled `` fit for acer aspire one `` it does not fit to get it on with the battery requires great force and almost rips the seams of the sleeve if the battery is removed , it fits but , who travels with a netbook without the battery i recommend against this item it fits like <unk> 's glove
even though this was suggested as an <unk> to my acer purchase it does n't fit . . and even if it did the sleeve configuration makes it hard to get the computer in and out spend a little more and get something else
this sleeve does a more than adequate job of protecting my lenovo s # it 's as attractive as something like this could be expected to be it does n't include any place to store a charger , but it never claimed to it is a perfectly <unk> netbook sleeve sadly , the piping on the edges has started to come away from the neoprene , and i have n't really used the sleeve enough to think that wear is a factor here
however , i much prefer zippered sleeves to this , since if you turn it the wrong way , things fall out of it too bad since it has such a snazzy look
i bought this hoping it would fit my wife 's # `` eee pc , but it does n't the packaging on this one specifically says that it 's designed for the acer aspire one i wish amazon had included that information in the product description if it 's there now , i did n't see it when i ordered if you 're looking for something to fit a # `` eee pc , look instead for kroo # zipper sleeve it fits perfectly
quality seems good , and the material is nice and thick it 's a bit roomier than i 'd like for our dell mini -lrb- but not roomy enough to put the power cord in with it -rrb-
this reversible laptop case fits my dell mini # laptop nicely with a little room to spare the only drawback is it does n't have any zippered compartments for accessories but for the price i think its a great deal
i ordered this for my dell mini # it arrived # days earlier than estimated , and fits the netbook perfectly i think the case is thick enough to protect from the everyday wear and tear glad i bought it
fits my <unk> # . # inch netbook perfectly fits my friend 's acer netbook as well , which is also # . # inches for $ # this thing is a steal similar products at local electronics stores cost over $ # ! was not going to buy it at first , but i ordered it and now i love it got here in # days via usps
the product is good , but the shipping i ordered the fast shipping , and it came , it protects my # . # inch <unk> quite well -lrb- anything smaller than # inches , i wouldnt reccomend this product
this is a huge backpack -lrb- as expected -rrb- yet there is not a lot of space the middle compartment is useless when the laptop is inside sad thing is i read about the space issue in the reviews but decided to ignore them do n't make the same mistake , this backpack has no space , do n't buy it
ordered this together with the qosmio the backpack is still intact it 's being used almost daily and it 's holding up to the daily grind will buy through amazon when the need arises
this is a great book bag it has a solid build the zippers are a strong metal , the straps feel comfortable , and it looks good it fits my dell inspiron # r special edition -lrb- # . # in . -rrb- and a couple of text books without much problem the sleeve that 's supposed to hold your cords , a power block , a mouse , etc . is more so a hassle than anything , so needless to say i do n't use it the only reason i rate this # stars is the fact that it is tall and wide enough but does n't have the depth i was hoping for i can only put one , maybe two , textbooks in the same pocket before it starts to get tight overall , i enjoy this bag a lot and would recommend it to anyone looking to lug around their big laptop and a few binders and folders
i really love this product , the room is exceptional , the quality is great i took off one star because the shoulder straps could have been spaced better for comfort i can put everything i need in this backpack , to carry along all my gaming equipment and laptop equipment
this is the bag i purchased for my asus rog # . # inch laptop ... and it works perfectly i carry my laptop to work and between clients all day and this bag not only services the large laptop , it is also very comfortable and convenient for day-to-day use
i had ordered this toshiba backpack after having returned the thule <unk> it would not hold my large hp # . # `` laptop thus far i am impressed i use it for professional and personal use and since the laptop pocket is adjustable it fits both my # . # and # . # laptops i like the slide-in divider which has four net pockets to hold all of the power supplies and cables it has more than enough compartments to even carry magazines and my new kindle fire the harness supports the backpack and distributes the weight when i carry it i 'm not a gamer but am a geek the toshiba is a keeper
i have a very large gaming laptop -lrb- asus republic of gamers # . # inch -rrb- which wo n't fit in most # . # inch bags this backpack is perfect for it however i used it to do a lot of traveling and it has kept all my electronics safe and having had any issues with anything getting broken it is comfortable to wear and has plenty of pockets to store all your different devices
fits an asus # . # & # # ; republic of gamers laptop let me tell you , that thing is a monster i bought it for my girlfriend who has a sensitive back , and it makes things # % more comfortable comes with a netted insert for <unk> and wires has a hole for an mp # player 's headphone wire , so you can listen to it while it 's in your backpack . : d laptop sleeve is <unk> to fit any laptop nice and snug
i bought my toshiba # `` gaming backpack to replace an older toshiba backpack i had , and to carry my massive asus g # laptop i am impressed > looks good > comfortable > good build quality > lots of useful pockets > fits the biggest of laptops > extra room for cooling pads , textbooks , accessories , etc . . > well <unk> > not cheap > zippers do n't go all the way down the
i needed a backpack for my extra large asus laptops -lrb- or portable desktop -rrb- i will be buying another whenever i finally destroy this one , since it has held up extra <unk> well for the abuse i have put it threw
with needing a case for an # . # `` laptop the choices are few and far between to be sure this is probably the best choice i 'd found that actually fit my computer correctly and securely good padding , great balance when worn -lrb- one shoulder or # -rrb- only drawback i see is the plastic zippers which , are still surprisingly sturdy
i have a toshiba qosmio laptop , which is a gaming laptop i 'm not a gamer , but use it for work as i 've got several pieces of software that require graphics and heavy processing i 'm on the road a lot , so bought the backpack to carry the laptop , mouse , mouse pad , cords , pens , notepads , <unk> , etc . the backpack has several pockets of various sizes that allow me to compartmentalize all of the different items the laptop has a # . # & # # ; screen and has no problem fitting in this backpack ; the area where the laptop goes has extra padding to protect the unit the exterior of the backpack is mostly black with some white piping , so looks nice without being flashy i would recommend this item
i 've searched a backpack for my asus rog g # s for almost # months i have returned # backpacks and this one is the third one i ordered and my asus # . # large laptop fits in perfectly also i can put my second laptop and my ipad , too if you are looking a backpack for your gaming computers , i definitely suggest this one
fits my qosmio x # <unk> # x # . # -inch gaming laptop perfectly and provides room for all of my college textbooks and notebooks even though it is pretty expensive , it was totally worth every penny as i use it everyday and there is no sign of weakness if you have a large laptop and need a backpack i would suggest buying this as soon as you can
i recently bought a huge # . # `` widescreen laptop i went to toshiba 's site and found this backpack being an avid amazon user i search here for it and found it cheaper holds my laptop nice and snug with the ajustable compartment for it lots of pockets even one for an mp # player with a pass through for head phones so you can listen while walking or bike riding with the pack on i am very pleased with the design
i have a huge laptop -lrb- probably # inch or bigger -rrb- , and this is the only backpack that i found so far that can handle the monster laptop i recommended it to a colleague of mine , and he loves it also
we were having trouble finding something to fit our new asus computer we purchased this one and are very pleased git fits , is great looking , and still has room for other things
my husband has a hunk of a huge laptop . it actually fits ! it should definitely fit any size laptop you have and pockets for all your add ons and gadgets
the big fits my giant # & # # ; gaming laptop perfectly the only problem i had with the bag was on of the strings got caught and ripped off but <unk> than that it has survived multiple plane trips and is still in near perfect condition
first off i got just over # years in the army now and have gone through my share of bags <unk> packs pouches and even an occasional shell so i am not an <unk> but have field tested my share of backpacks now i have just received the <unk> # <unk> # bg # backpack from toshiba and the initial impression is i am impressed the bag has solid double stitching on all the zippers and the material is comparable to any <unk> bag i have owned -lrb- and love -rrb- i currently have a rog g # vw laptop -lrb- huge powerhouse gaming laptop -rrb- and this bag holds it perfectly have alot of traveling over the next year about to start with this bag so i will post an update when available and let you all know how it is holding up
this backpack perfectly fits the hp hdx # t # . # `` laptop with room to spare the laptop slot is very nicely padded and fully adjustable for any thickness of laptop it also has additional padding at the bottom of the backpack that i have not seen in other bags there are many useful pockets for cords , full keyboards , mice , etc . this is not just a gaming backpack , i use mine for business only downside i can see , if you are looking for a bag to fit you # `` laptop and books for school it would be a very very tight squeeze otherwise , very comfortable to wear and seems well made as far as style is concerned , i have been told it makes me look like a turtle ... it is not a small bag
i really like the bag but it already shown bad <unk> of wear in only the third month of ownership big flakes of leather are coming off the bag i would love for the company to address this
this thing lasted me about three months it was a great bag at the time , stylish , lots of room , and a great layout then the front buckle broke the actual tab that snaps into the loop on the front of the back snapped in half did n't just come apart at the hinge , but snapped useless bag now
this is a pretty versatile bag , great for taking to the office or traveling with the compartments are handy for notebooks , electronics accessories , chargers , etc . wish there was a separate sleeve for a tablet , but the inner zip-up pocket works unfortunately the clasp that holds down the front flap came open a few times and eventually broke -lrb- i 'll try to fit on some magnetic buttons -rrb- also , some of the nylon threads of the inner lining have started coming out after a few months of use it 's a good bag , but i wish it were a bit sturdier
notice none of the photos show the latch for the flap it is not a snap or a slide latch but instead a thumb pulled hook think the hook you use to fasten the dogs <unk> to it 's <unk> now picture having to work this hook every time you want something , or want to close it compartments are loose and no <unk> in design overall it looks pretty nice the <unk> system is a deal killer i went back to my old bag , this is going on ebay
it 's okay carries my laptop with a minimum of fuss , but i 'm going to be looking for another i really do n't like the <unk> that holds the bag 's flap it 's so big that the flap bulges out at that spot and it 's very deep in from the edge , so that you have to bend the flap back to get at it i can see this <unk> or damaging the flap over time
all in all this is an ok messenger bag assuming that the only thing you need to carry a laptop and only a couple files the exterior of the bag is durable , however the lining is cheap as is the stitching i have used this bag for two months now and the stitching on the front flap has already come unstitched also , the bag is n't all that secure so beware of using it when traveling via train or plane as items can fall out you get what you pay for with this solo messenger bag
our son , # , wanted something less <unk> -lrb- <unk> -rrb- and more professional for his medical research job he really liked this bag it is still not & # # ; high end & # # ; , the canvas is more of a ripstop material , but the leather accents really dress it up
this is a really great looking bag sure , it 's got the <unk> pocket in the back , but i do n't mind that i was hoping for something a little thinner ; i only want to carry a laptop and a few select other things but the fact that it 's thicker means it 's a little more versatile on trips ; i 'll be able to carry my camera body and pancake lens with my carry-on i think my only real complaint is the flap latch i 'd prefer something quicker to <unk>
i bought this for work when my wife told me i should throw out the old army bag and look more professional it is more professional and certainly was a great price
i 've looked for messenger bags for my two college-age sons from a lot of manufacturers , and this one is by far the best for the price one of my sons got this bag for christmas last year and the other has been asking for one just like it luckily i could find it on amazon now my son-in-law wants one , too the sales <unk> says it 's made from <unk> leather i 'm not sure what percentage is truly leather for this price , but it feels like a quality leather bag it also has an <unk> flap and lots of room
i got this a christmas present i love the leather feel , and it does n't feel cheap either it has nylon sections as well which accent the bag perfectly there are so many compartments for your items , it 's a perfect bag for carrying all my stuff and my laptop perfectly fits my macbook pro # & # # ; the shoulder strap also has the support piece which makes it more comfortable when carrying around your laptop , and it is snug on the strap so you do n't need to <unk> hardly ever would definitely recommend this bag
i just have to add to the positive reviews of this bag ... it is very nice while it is not fully <unk> it is plenty leather enough it is very sturdy with a nylon backing and partial front under the flap , and a nylon padded interior it 's a perfect combination of style and strength i use it for work , my # `` ultrabook , kindle , files , and accessories fit in it no problem the handle sits off the back like people have mentioned but , you 'll be using the strap most of the time it 's not too big as people have said it 's just the right size one thing i also like about it , it 's not coated in `` <unk> `` just the leather pad on the strap and the zipper pulls ... it 's very inconspicuous i would recommend this bag to anyone that is looking for a stylish but sturdy bag
i like everything about this bag the areas that are visible are a nice soft leather . the other material that makes up the bag is a tough but attractive sort of tight woven vinyl that matches perfectly that material is also on the back of the bag in the area which rubs against your body , which is a nice touch no colors are transferred to your clothing because of this design i think it will also result in longer life of the bag there are numerous compartments and a pad to protect your laptop very neat and well designed and crafted my first experience with solo amazon price was way better than staples where i first saw it
it looks great , and seems to be quite well constructed i 've got a # & # # ; alienware laptop and it fits in this thing easily , along with it 's charger , a mouse , mouse pad , and my wacom tablet does n't feel & # # ; overstuffed & # # ; , just right yet it 's also normal sized enough to use as a regular messenger bag , which just rocks stylish , durable , and with well designed pockets , i ca n't ask for much more
i bought this for an airline trip with my dog - it has plenty of pockets for everything and folds up easily for going through security i like the messenger strap , makes it easier to carry
this laptop messenger bag is just perfect for a young computer <unk> <unk> bought it for my son for christmas and he really love it he must have adjusted it so many times just so that the bag will hang just right on his back very sporty at the same time but yet will carry a lot
i was very excited about the quality if his bag i was going to get a more expensive bag thinking it would be better quality i 'm very glad i did n't the leather does not feel cheap at all
fits my laptop which is bulkier that the macbooks has pockets for my mobile , chargers , bluetooth , etc . nicely lined and i 've received many compliments a fantastic value and no regrets
i am excited to be able to put this item to use it will be nice to have something to hold my small laptop and other items i know that the should strap will be very handy
it is a nice bag my boyfriend wanted it , i think it is quite unisex i personally do n't like the way the flap locks to the bag in the front , but he is happy and he is the one using it it has a good number of pockets , and the material is nice overall , it is well made and has a <unk> look
this is such a great idea it will be great when someone makes one that actually works the one i purchased would turn on , but it would not print and it would not turn off do n't waste your money
i was really excited about the idea of this printer i would be able to easily take on trips to be able to work on vacation first , installing the drivers was a huge project that involved several hours with a <unk> computer tech we finally got the drivers installed and i was able to use on one trip the next try at plugging the printer in resulted in a memory dump blue screen to my laptop no printing on that trip after installing new drivers , we were able to send a print job only to discover the paper will no longer feed i so wanted this thing to work very disappointed . :
i bought this printer to use with my android phone you have to contact tech support to find out that the only smart phone that it will work with is a blackberry
it would not work with my new <unk> # my laptop so i had to return it this is the first product i <unk> for amazon that i had to pay to return
i placed this item on my wish list it was purchased by a friend the cheaper incorrect model was shipped instead it arrived broken customer service was rude when we contacted them they refused to ship the correct model this turned out to be a terrible experience
i have been trying to get this to work for # days the drivers do not work for usb connection . went to the website for latest driver and it does not work either calling the company is a total waste of time - all you get is <unk> machine with same <unk> regardless of which option you chose sending email to support email address is totally useless they responded to me with this comment : it should work do not buy this product i am returning amazon should look closer at companies who make them look bad - because i am now concerned about the comfort i felt in making all of my online purchases exclusively thru amazon.com
this is an awesome little printer that 's good at what it does : print simple documents , on the go , on the field installation is simple you just need to download the appropriate drivers from the manufacturer and make <unk> those matches those matches your os do n't pay attention to the bad reviews they seem to be from very frustrated users which their pcs ought to be incorrectly configured
i paid $ # total just to ship it to me fits the shape of my netbook perfectly , but straps ca n't grip the laptop effectively i 'm afraid one of these days i 'm gon na drop my netbook and there wo n't be anything i can do about it but all in all , decent i guess it 's best to shop for these straight up and not online
i purchased this case for my daughter , who was getting a new acer aspire netbook the design on the case is nice , and it is well-padded , but we encountered a major problem the case is designed to hold the netbook while it is open , so you can use it while it 's still in the case the problem is that you ca n't fit the netbook in the case with the battery on since you ca n't use the acer computer without the battery , the case is useless i will be sending the case back because of this it 's too bad , because it is an attractive looking bag
