pretty nice sleeve thicker than your average notebook sleeve and has extra padding for protection the floral pattern is smooth in the front overall construction is high quality , from the seams to the strap and buckles
this netbook sleeve is just that - a sleeve it perfectly fits my netbook , however there is no room to pack in the ac adapter everything else about it is great , but unfortunately i 'll need to be looking for a slightly bigger bag for my netbook
this is a very stylish and attractive sleeve with just the right amount of space inside for an ipad and some extras -lrb- i 'm assuming a netbook would fit inside nicely as well -rrb- aside from the print , which is on a really nice shiny ` mod ' type material , the rest of the sleeve is your usual ballistic nylon with sipper and plastic hooks for the strap for the price , you ca n't beat this sleeve for design and looks and quality build
this product is just what i was looking for i needed something for when i am carrying around my ipad # that had a strap long enough to put over the shoulder it fits my ipad # perfectly i also found that it even fits my ipad # if i leave in the soft styrofoam that was in it when it arrived it provides extra protection to screen side of my ipad
i had hoped that this case will hold my dell # in laptop it does not it does hold it in the inside pocket if i remove the inner case that means the inner case is useless so far as the laptop is concerned but it is a good case otherwise
the bag provides three inside pockets and a smaller one on the outside the internal smaller bag is very convenient my problem is with the retractable handle it does not slide easily and gets stuck on the last extension
perfect size for my laptop & was a great portable office for business travel the wheels worked great & i was able to easily store it under the seat or overhead compartment
packed very carefully , this case showed up on time and when the gift was given , it was loved he packed it right away , with a place for all his tools and computer this bag is just perfect <unk> place of the heavy backpack and stress on his back the pack is very well make <unk> duty looking forward to many years of good service
this is a well built durable bad set i pack my laptop in the laptop bag and all of my school books fit nicely in the big book bag i love how you can make the laptop bag ride on the rolling bag by sliding the handle over the roller bar to hold the bag in place
this is a good roller bag with substantial cloth , zippers , wheels , and handles i think it will last a long time the storage compartments are well organized and useful it will fit in the overhead of the smaller crj regional jets i would recommend it to a friend
i 've had this for over a month now and it still has a chemical smell but most annoyingly my mac pro # & # # ; barely fits in there plus the material is very thin i have not use this case but i keep it around just in case of . . besides i did not want to bother with returning it
this case was n't exactly what i was looking for i have a hard shell case on my macbook pro and it does n't fit inside the case with it on its too small and does n't have a lot of padding to protect it from really anything its a good little case for a macbook air but not for a pro
if you are looking to protect your apple laptop , do not buy <unk> product , but if you are simply considering a simple cover for <unk> , i guess , it will do just that
in theory this is a fine case for your laptop computer it 's well made and well fitted , with inner corners to grip it firmly -lrb- though it has thinner padding than the case i 'd had previously -rrb- but it has one annoying problem : a nasty chemical smell i suppose if your room is really messy and you ca n't find your laptop case then you could sniff it out but that 's not something i 'm looking for in a product
i just got this in the mail and was very disappointed <unk> it barely fitted my # inch macbook pro the zipper seemed to be like coming off the case left no room for the computer and is not shock <unk> i would rather spend a little more for a better sleeve
i bought this case for new macbook air # . # inch after reading lots of positive reviews the mac does technically fit in the case but not without effort the quality is good , but it is too small and requires extra effort on the corners when zipping
if you have a cover shell on your mac then your computer will not fit the case at all it does look exactly like the picture so it is `` pretty `` but for me it was not useful as it did not fit my
for the price , it was n't that bad of quality although the seams were not sewn tight and were not straight at all i did n't feel there was enough cushioning to protect the device it was intended for never understood the carabiner they included , it is not strong and could only be used for a set of keys in the end it was returned
i bought this item a little over a month ago , which means i 've had the case for less than a month it already has a hole in the corner of the fabric ! i use it to case my # `` macbook pro the fabrics are nice and so is the outside pocket , but it 's not durable at all i 'm a student and i carry my laptop in this case in my book bag it 's not like the case gets heavy wear and tear and yet it has already torn better to spend a little more money on a more durable case , this one is barely worth the money
i have a # -inch macbook pro , which is what the description said this product is for the case barely fits around my computer , and is very hard to zip i also find the case to be very thin , which i feel does n't provide enough protection for my new computer although shipping was fast and easy , i am somewhat disappointed in the product itself
it 's pretty cheap so you get what you pay for i have the # . # mbpro and it did n't quite fit - the lip was very hard to secure and it did n't zip properly because it was way to small i think this case was definitely meant for the macbook air
this product is pretty and exactly as it is looks in the pictures , but it is not so useful it is very tight on the laptop it is advertised for , and it is garbage materials i have had this case for under a month , and it has # holes in one of the corners i am extremely dissatisfied with the quality
the case came in on time and in general was the color we wanted but the quality was far lower than we expected in any case do not really love it . the zipper is bad and would buy another one
one of the better neoprene sleeves but none of them last long or provide much protection mine wore out at the corners in a bit less than a year and i replaced with a padded denim sleeve which is much more robust
so the case is not as thick a i imagined its fabric to be but it 's not bad overall maybe something a bit more expensive would serve you better if you 're looking for a high
i bought this for my # `` macbook pro it works decently , but one of the zippers has broken off ... the edges are <unk> and there are permanent indentations where the pocket zipper usually goes the padding is nice though and it is a cool color the product is of a fair quality for it 's price
this is a decent product not great , but not bad it was the cheapest i could find , so i can understand why it is thin material it might add some cushion if you were to drop it , but i would n't count on it it seems to be decent workmanship so hopefully it will last for awhile i would recommend going to a physical store so you can really see and feel what you are purchasing just a suggestion though
it is very pretty , compact , and simple protects laptop well . only thing is if you already have a hardshell case on your computer than this zipper case does you know good
i figured my macbook would be smaller than a <unk> pro . but when i put it in this case , i was barely able to zip it closed i had to force it also it doesnt feel like it would protect it against any kind of shock . it just protects against scratches if you want a case that you can throw it around with , you might want to buy a more heavy duty case . over all though , for # bucks its good
i was looking for a small footprint bag to hold my # `` macbook air , as well as the power brick , dvd drive , a couple of usb keys , external drive and some paperwork this is a neoprene sleeve that 's attractive and just big enough to stretch around the macbook there is really no room for much else , and since there is no protective hard cover anywhere , it also wo n't protect other than to keep the surfaces free of scratches so it is not what i was looking for , but the price made me decide to chance it anyway it 's a very inexpensive sleeve , looks good , and appears to be much the same as bags you can pick up at an apple store for three times the money if that 's what you 're looking for , this seems like a good value
the case works it is a little stretchy and i love the pick color , but i did not get the clip it says it comes with it it shows it in the picture , but it did not come it is not the most important thing in the order , but it is in the order ... so if you are satisfied with getting just the case and do n't care about the clip buy it
even though this product does smell after you get it it does live up to its expectations you only have to force your laptop in the case and squeeze the top to get the zipper to close all the way i bought it for protection for my laptop if i go anywhere <unk> i have n't gone anywhere and one of these days i will . and guess what , i will take this case with me and maybe even the laptop because mostly everywhere you go there is wifi out there these days if you can stand the smell of mold for a week than i would recommend this case man horrible smell , than i finally took a shower than the smell was gone , how weird is that
this was the cheapest case i could find for my new macbook pro i simply needed a case to keep it covered for when i have to take it places the material is very durable and has a snug fit it also has a outside pocket to keep discs or flash drives which i really like its not the best sleeve out there but for the price you ca n't go wrong with this purchase
the case is most definitely a snug fit and there is n't any room for cords or other accessories the material appears to be fine someone mentioned that # holes appeared in one of the corners that idea of holes appearing did cross my mind because of the effort required when zipping the case at the corners all in all though i like it , it keeps my mac safe and that 's priority
it fits very snug on the computer , but even with the rubberized case i have on my mac already , it still fits you ca n't really fit anything in the front pocket though
i ordered several of these for some macbook pro , # . # `` laptops after reading a few reviews prior to ordering i took a chance on these since the price was so low they do fit the # . # mbp a bit tight , should stretch a little with time most of these will be put inside a <unk> anyway , so they are for added protection they are what i expected decent protection and slim fit for a few bucks
this product is a good value it is a nice looking sleeve and for half the price of comparable sleeves you ca n't beat it it is a snug fit but that 's ok since you do not want the sleeve to have the laptop look bulky the front pocket fits my charger , flash drive , internet card , and apple ear buds , so with this product i 'm # <unk>
if you 're looking for something that looks alright and fits over your device nicely , this is the case for you it 's not the most expensive one but definitely looks sharp worth the money in my opinion
this sleeve carries my macbook pro so tightly , i feel so secure using it it has an inner pocket that keeps the macbook in place and it also keeps the macbook from getting scratched by the zipper it 's thick so it 's a bit heavy , but it 's worth it because it covers the macbook so darn well it also has a front pocket that comes in handy when you need to carry some extra stuff but wo n't touch your macbook the material stretches so it 's really versatile anything will fit in it
the case is the perfect size for my mac and the pocket in front is practical too the only reason why i did n't put # stars is because i thought the color would be a <unk> pink but overall i am happy with this purchase
it fits my # `` macbook perfectly the inside flap protects the machine from the zipper there is an outside pocket , but it is too small for my power cord i 'm not sure how to use the free carabiner keychain with it either but overall its a great product for the price it does exactly what i wanted it to do , protect my macbook
i bought this neoprene sleeve <unk> aspire timelinex as # t- # . # -inch hd laptop -lrb- black brushed aluminum -rrb- it 's a bit snug fit but good thing neoprene can stretch inside there is a sewn clear plastic pocket probably for memory cards -lrb- # `` x # . # `` divided into two by sewn in the middle -rrb- the edge of this plastic is somewhat sharp a could potentially scratch some laptops i recommend removing this unnecessary pocket also the `` <unk> `` tag inside could interfere with the zipper possibly damaging it if caught while zipping i recommend removing the tag as well other then these minor issues , i think this is a good enough sleeve for the price
i purchased this case after i went to best buy and they were selling a similar product for $ # the case is slim and fits the computer perfectly however , the zipper only opens half way
i bought this for my daughter to use with her new # . # inch laptop it 's perfect i love that there 's a little internal sleeve inside the case to protect the laptop from the zipper it also `` tucks `` the computer in securely it 's a wonderful product i 'm a big fan of kroo
i have been using this item for the last few months apart from the <unk> chemical smell that went away within a few days the item has been just fine the only issue is that i also put a hard shell on my macbook pro which caused it to not fit very well into the sleeve i have since removed the hard shell -lrb- it was worse than nothing at all -rrb-
the sleeve is a bit smaller than what i was expecting and i actually have to stretch it around my laptop , but it still fits , nonetheless thanks for the quick shipping
fits my macbook pro perfectly has good cushion for support and can fit my cables -lrb- powercord and hdmi converter -rrb- in the pocket might be able to fit a few little minor things in the pocket but not much more but i use this all the time and glad i purchased it
love this carrying case protects my laptop well and the pocket is really convenient never had a problem with the fit , it was definitely tight but that was a good thing
i purchased this carrying sleeve for my daughter 's macbook i also bought the blue hard case and the blue keyboard cover the case is stretchy and zipped snugly around both the computer and the hard case my daughter is very pleased with the sleeve and all of the accessory purchases made for her macbook
this fits my cr- # very well i bought this as protection for my chromebook , which is # . # inches but after reading many reviews about how # . # inch sleeves work i decided to give it a try due to the low price and good build quality of the sleeve it fits perfectly snug with my cr- # in the bubble sleeve it came with it is has a dual layer cover that fits over the laptop so the zippers wo n't do any damage to it if you use the sleeve correctly , when you zippered it up , the cover closes up and encases the laptop and there is no exposure to the zipper the material is pretty well made , it is thick enough to provide some protection but not thick enough to make it heavy , bulky , and unpleasant great <unk> build and <unk> up to # . # <unk> a zipper for extra <unk> layered cover for maximum <unk> do n't understand what the key chain is <unk> is no key chain hole to attach the sleeve onto the key chain
i ordered this because of its competitive price ... it was delivered very quickly , and i must say this is very good value for your money the design is intelligent and it fits my macbook # perfectly ... the padding is good too ... overall , if you are not in the mood to spend extra , this is a very good laptop
i bought this case to carry my # `` tablet pc and it fits perfectly fine . it 's a very well made bag for very low price . i would recommend this to anyone
i purchased this for my # in macbook pro it fits perfectly , and i love the inner flap that protect it from the zipper it has one outer pocket , and # small slots inside -lrb- big enough for # cf cards or jump drives . i searched forever for the perfect sized case , with pockets , at the right price this did not disappoint me
the gizmo dorks dual pocket zipper laptop carrying case does a good job offering protection for my early # macbook pro it 's very snug the protective <unk> found inside is high quality and the pocket on the outside is convenient for storing a power cable my one complaint would be that if you are not careful the zipper could potentially scratch your macbook pro however , if you 're careful about it , it is n't really that big of an issue overall , a great addition to help protect your investment
this cool looking little case fits my macbook pro # `` perfectly it 's very durable , protects my laptop , and looks great the front pocket is perfect for carrying the charger along with me price was great too
it was exactly what i expected , and fits really well in my bag for school it was a little snug with the snap-on case i bought for it , but overall it 's really nice
need i say more ordered two of these for my macbook pro # and the material used is very good workmanship is superb fit is a little tight but i just got it so maybe several more ins and outs of my macbook would make it fit better great purchase and nice looks
product arrived quickly and is exactly as expected -lrb- in a good way -rrb- seems to be well-made and fits my laptop -lrb- dell latitude d # -rrb- well it comes with a removable styrofoam insert - i leave it in to provide extra padding for my screen i 'm very happy with this purchase
i 've been using this for my # inch macbook pro for a little over # months now i put my laptop away , and take it out of the case sleeve on average , # times each day when i first got it , it was a tight squeeze to get it into the sleeve and zipped up , but after a while , it stretches out and becomes a perfect fit after # months , it 's still in great shape have n't had any rips or tears , and i use it quite frequently , so the material is definitely sturdy if you 're looking for a cheap way to protect your macbook pro , this is definitely the product to get
ordered it for my new macbook pro # `` does what it is supposed to and also has room for other things you may want to carry it 's a great price for a product that definitely fulfills its purpose
this case fits and protects my new macbook pro beautifully the pockets are convenient and the price is great , certainly compared to what i could find at the apple store
received product more than a month now did not travel with it in this period but it seems to fill the need the lip that protects the computer is very good idea the foam on the sleeve seems adequate so far have not seen any one better on the market
good for the money not very think , but i like the pocket on the front to hold the chargers perfect to prevent scratches and external damage , but not solid structure to prevent damage if dropped
this case does exactly what it 's suppose too . . average protection . very slim and portable flaps inside to keep macbook air in place tightly . also pockets on the front for charger the smell isnt as bad as everyone says ... it smells like any `` fresh out of the factory `` new item . no complaints from me
this case does everything i need i carry my laptop in my backpack where ever i go and have n't had a single problem with this case my macbook pro # . # fits perfectly snug inside this case stop any scratched or small dings although i would n't trust in a fall more than a foot off the ground i would recommend this product if you want a simple case or travel a lot
like other reviews have said , it 's a snug fit however , it was exactly what i wanted a nice protective case that i can put in another bag to prevent scratches and limit any trauma that my larger bag may be subject to the tight fit keeps it small so it does n't take up to much room in either a suitcase or briefcase the power cable does n't really fit in the sleeve , so you can carry it alone when fully charged or use it within a larger bag it looks nice and it feels nice
i 've using this case for almost one year without an issue i use it every day to carry my macbook wherever i go -lrb- and i usually fly a lot -rrb- recently , i 've washed it in my washer and now it looks like new when i bought it i was a little skeptical since it really stretches a lot to fit my macbook and i thought that it would n't probably last too long with all these daily <unk> i was wrong almost one year after i have to <unk> exactly the opposite : it still looks as brand new
item arrived fast through gizmo dorks and is pretty much pictured as stated im using this with my toshiba portege r # and it fits perfectly i like the little zipper guard on the inside which is also found on more expensive <unk> the item is not padded with anything special but does offer fairly decent protection from minor bumps and scratches
this bag is a good , inexpensive choice for a # -inch laptop my powerbook fits in just perfect , and there 's enough space left in the bag for a couple books , umbrella , etc . it is definitely much lighter than the more traditional <unk> bags i 've had in the past it does show dirt fairly easily my biggest complaint is that within the first # uses or so , one of the fobs on a pocket zipper broke off on closer inspection , all of the <unk> are sort of <unk> , with the rings coming apart enough to break away from the zipper
i really like this bag well constructed and the material is water resistant so it 's perfect for the boston morning commute plenty of space for your necessities i 've gotten several compliments on the design as
this bag is great for the most part it easily fit my laptop in the main compartment and i could cram notebooks , pens , lunch , etc . into the other compartments this may be the most padded laptop bag i 've ever seen i would 've felt confident dropping my laptop down a flight of stairs if it were in this bag the color might be a bit bright for an office , but it 's fine for a grad student the only issue i had with this bag was the strap it is thin and cuts into your neck such that if you have neck problems it is painful to carry this bag for more than five minutes i ended up giving the bag away to a friend and purchasing a bag with a sturdier strap that more evenly distributed the weight
i like this bag a lot i use it for work and it has held up very well so far -lrb- i 've had it about # or # months ; use it a couple of times a week -rrb- it has n't show any signs of wear and tear and protects my laptop well my only dislike is that my laptop wo n't fit in the back half of the bag , only the front , but it 's not that big of a deal and the design is cute it also does n't appear to show dirt as easily as i thought it would -lrb- since it is a light color -rrb- overall pretty good
i was carrying my laptop in my purse , so this really came in handy the compartments hold my mouse , mousepad etc . overall sturdy bag in a very cute color / design i love it
bags looks very cool and i love carrying it around classy yet funky it is very comfortable to carry thanks to the wide shoulder strap and i can fit my laptop and a number of other things in there i like the pockets that keep things organized and separate all in all - a great
i love the bag i love the compartments i love the design the only complaint that i have is that the two straps meet and are held together with velcro the first time i <unk> the velcro to adjust the length of the strap , the velcro would n't hold i had to <unk> it over and over , but each time , under the weight of the laptop , it broke apart finally i <unk> it together really hard , and finally it stuck as we all know , velcro eventually loses its ability to hold i am concerned that at some point , i will either have to replace the velcro , or figure out a new way to secure it a buckle would be more resilient
i love this bag the only reason i gave it # stars is because it is a tad small for my # `` laptop i have to squeeze it in just so to make it fit i am hoping it will <unk> up a bit with use i get compliments on this bag and feel more stylish and girly than with my old black bag
this was a christmas gift for my working daughter and given to her with the napa <unk> the bag has lots of compartments for holding various things , and is the right size -lrb- and color combination -rrb- to fit with the <unk> she was extremely pleased with the item and could n't see any potential problems
this computer bag is good-looking and stylish with lots of room for a laptop -lrb- not a # `` -rrb- and all of the accessories it has a separate padded interior compartment for the laptop but overall it is a little too `` floppy `` for my <unk> i have travelled with it with no complaints , but i just do n't feel as well protected as i would like i use it to store my kindle and its accessories also when i travel , and there is still plenty of room
it 's beautiful but it does n't hold much without looking too bulky do n't get me wrong , it is able to hold enough i can put my laptop in there and couple of notebooks the front pockets are good if you put minimal stuff however , if you put in too much or to big an item , the bag will look bulky ... and it 's not an even sort of bulky the strap is nice and has a solid grip so it wo n't slide off . the drawstring ... can get stuck i 've had it for a couple of weeks now and some of the drawstring gets caught when you <unk> it , pulling some of those pieces off other than that : -rrb- it 's pretty decent for day to day if you need to pack lots of stuff though , it 'll prolly be in your best <unk> to choose something more <unk>
i got a messenger bag so i could ride my bike to work with my laptop -- could not do that with this bag it 's huge and the strap is <unk> long i 'm only # ' # & # # ; and even on it 's shortest setting it was no where near tight enough to my body
i bought this as a birthday gift for my sister for her first college experience and from what i can tell she loves it i personally think it is super cute and comfortable from the times i have had to carry it for her with all of her books and laptop inside the only draw back is the way the flap secures to the bag itself if the back is full it does n't seem to close properly other that that this bag is awesome .
i love the cute , stylish design of this bag the shoulder strap has a textured underside so the bag does n't slip off ever separate , padded compartment keeps my laptop from getting scratched by anything else i carry smaller compartments are handy , though the compartment with the pen/pencil space is <unk> a tight fit to zip closed once those utensils are in over-all i really like the bag a great buy
the title sort of says it all - it 's a nice bag , but not amazing the strap has a nice lining on the bottom - feels better than canvas on my skin very roomy ; plenty of room for my laptop and a book and notepad my only complaint is that instead of a zipper there 's a pull string to secure your laptop in the bag seems a little strange , but it 's ok
i bought this product and it seemed very good at first but over time it got dirty very easily and was hard to clean but the inside is great and perfect for my use
i bought this laptop bag for my boyfriend 's # year old daughter and it is perfect nicely made with a lot of room and pockets in it it is perfect for when spends a weekend with her mom to bring her computer as well as her clothes for the weekend
all could be better if the pocket meant for the laptop would be larger , really does not fit a # inch laptop new laptops seem to be of the wide screen variety and this just is not meant for them fortunately there is another larger pocket that can fit the laptop although not as secure my wife likes the looks of it as it is not a standard black or grey case and is more feminine wife is happy
this bag is very durable i took it on a # k mile trip across the world , loaded it with my laptop , accessories , and school books , and i have not seen any weakness from the # lbs i put in it i have yet to attempt cleaning it , but i am hoping that will go as well
i looked at several laptop bags but none of them measured up to this one in style or price i have had it for more than a year and i get several compliments on it i do n't even need to carry my hand bag because it has enough compartment to fit all my expectations i recommend this item to anyone interested in purchasing a good quality product
great for laptop and other things , i carry the messenger bag everywhere great for school and go on travels my older sister and my mom like the messenger bag i 'm glad i got the bag here in amazon
excellent product for the price originally bought a bag from best buy and ended up taking that bag back because this bag was so much better and my husband ordered one too , but the all black one
i love it , it 's cute and well padded for my laptop , i can carry books or folders next to the laptop and more in the # nd compartment plus the battery the bag is roomier than i expected there are also # smaller pockets in the front , very handy for small items like pencils or sticky <unk> notepad the <unk> strap is large so it does not hurt to carry the bag even if it 's full of books added to the laptop i love the design and received compliments for such a nice bag i 'm not very tall so i would have liked being able to shorten the shoulder strap more but it 's still ok
i was slightly worried about my laptop fitting into this bag but it was a nice snug fit i was also a bit more worried about the padding i had shopped around in my area and all the ` pretty ' bags were just bits of cloth sewn together ; there was no protection for a laptop i was skeptical when this arrived and opened it with a touch of fear but it 's the absolute perfect bag there is a nice layer of protection , front and back there is also room in front of that protection for two or three notebooks , as well as two zips under the main flap for various bits and <unk> to be stored i feel i also have to mention that the pictures do not do this bag justice it is even more beautiful in person overall , i find this the perfect bag for me and my lifestyle and will definitely recommend it to friends and family
i love this bag , i love the way it looks and the inside is big enough for my laptop the colors are bright and pretty it is the perfect bag for me
i got a new laptop and was leaving the country for the summer i bought this bag to help out i love it i used it as a carry on and was able to fit all of my other electronics in it for safe keeping due to the padding this was a beautiful excellent purchase it was also very comfortable to carry for hours on end through airports and different cities
i bought this for a friend for her birthday for her office laptop and she said not only loved the way it looked but it is well made and holds her laptop perfectly
this laptop bad had everything i needed - including great style you can adjust the strap for over the shoulder comfort there is a large pouch for the laptop with the same size pouch in front of that for paperwork there are also two other smaller pouches , one split into three mini compartments and another around the size of a large checkbook all in all , i do n't have to carry a purse anymore to work , everything fits into this one bag which i absolutely love and it 's adorable
i really like this bag it has several compartments for all my pens , folders , and other supplies , and the shoulder strap is very comfortable and easily adjustable the most important feature to this bag is how securely it holds my laptop , it velcro 's in very nicely and stays put the stitching is very well done and sturdy i would recommend this bag over some cheap one you might be considering
i 've gotten a few compliments on the bag it looks unique , is sturdy , holds the laptop well and still has space leftover for other <unk> i 've had it out in light rain with me and stuff inside stays relatively dry , although i would n't recommend testing it in a downpour only downside is it 's starting to look dirty because of the lighter color , but i 've had it for a while now i 'll have to either look into how to wash it or just might replace it entirely i would buy a bag from this brand again , maybe in darker color so it does n't get dirty fast
i love this bag for my macbook ; fits perfectly and lots of well-designed pockets and zippered compartments for stuff it 's nicer than the run of the mill bag and feminine to carry without looking `` cute `` . very well-made and has nice fit and finish
i love this bag my husband even likes it i love everything about it school hasnt started yet , so not sure of the roominess for school yet , but it stores my laptop and accessories very well
