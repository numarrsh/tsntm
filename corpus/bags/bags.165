this is a simple but great and functional idea you can keep all your cords handy , easy to transport and only rarely will you leave a key cord behind saves in <unk> or <unk> your cords too i have two
this is a must for any backpack , no matter what you carry we always have <unk> items in our bags this is the solution for cables & chargers , earbuds , usb harddrives , post-its , stacks of cards , travel size liquids , etc . you name it , you most likely can secure it to the grid-it board the board is <unk> and slides down in my backpack smoothly in front of my tablet
holds all my electronics travel stuff in a single place i no longer need to search through all the small compartments in my laptop case for the thing i 'm looking for
i bought this so i could easily transition between purses and have all of my necessities ready to go , and i really like it my items stay in place , and it keeps all that little stuff from floating around in the <unk> at the bottom of my purse
i use several different <unk> bags depending on what i 'm doing that particular day these things allow me to strap my chargers , usb cables , usb drives , pens/pencils and whatever else i need the thing i really like about these -lrb- i have two -rrb- is that if i change bags , i simply grab my two organizers and throw them in the other bag these things are fantastic i little bit of warning though i would n't - if you using these in a laptop bag etc . - get anything smaller than these i almost wish i had gotten the next size up
i like this little idea i was curious how these items would stay in my bag without falling to the bottom they have done so nicely do n't buy from apple store they <unk> there either best buy locally or amazon
i bought this case because , like many other people , i ca n't stand those neon plain cases so this was a no-brainer for me however , less than # months after i bought it , the cloth design on the top had started to peel off ! ! and within another month , it had completely peeled off i really liked how it looked , up until it completely peeled off though but , definitely not worth the price , unless you plan to buy another one very shortly after
i bought this for my new macbook pro and love the look of it , but the corners of the fabric are were peeling off after about six weeks of use not worth anything close to the price buy a plain plastic case instead
pretty much the whole reason for anyone to buy this case is the nice plaid on top mine began peeling off after # months or so other than that . it serves it 's purpose it 's so ugly now though -lrb- sigh . .
got this as a gift back in late may , loved the design and style and the cloth finish have had for only # months and the fabric on the front is coming apart and peeling all around the edges was really disappointed , even tried to glue down the lips when it first started peeling , didnt work
well , i did not buy this item on amazon - but rather in the store at first i really loved it i actually still do - it 's very cute as you can see but i noticed very quickly that the fabric was coming up at the sides , and now it 's peeling off on the corner this <unk> me , because i know it is only going to keep peeling and i will need to buy a new one i feel like if it is just going to peel the way it is , it really is n't worth the price
this case is pretty and fits my mac very well i bought this in september and recently i accidentally spilled a little water on my mac so i took of the case and i realized the case dented my mac for some reason it only happened on one side i 'm no longer using the case in the fear of that it will dent the other side
good product , soft and fluffy , but if you open the lid , the laptop scratch cover something where the cover above the level of the laptop , but it 's little things overall , i really like the idea and design
the details of the product on amazon says it fits a # & # # ; laptop but that is wrong , its for a # . # inch i have had to squeeze my # . # inch x # e into it and it barely has enough room for the ac adapter and a couple usb drives i 'm not happy
if all you want is a bag that will carry your ipad and charger , then this is a slim , well made bag it just did n't suit my needs , so i returned it i needed more room to carry a couple of extra file folders or perhaps a writing tablet i also did n't like that the two zipper pockets had no organizer dividers inside to separate things like pens , business cards , phone etc . they are just single pockets if they made a slightly larger size then i might consider it
was disappointed that the bag did n't have the many organizer pockets that my old worn out samsonite classic business netbook bag had no wonder it was fairly inexpensive i may decide to return it
i liked the case as far as quality and functionality it 's built well and has adequate storage my problem was it looked like a purse because of it 's size , could n't get past that
the case is good quality , and matches some of the pictures however , some pictures show two top zippered compartments the actual item only has one the bag is smaller than some of the pictures lead the buyer to believe i submitted image feedback stating this
this is a nice bag , very well made my i pad <unk> fits nicely i would wish for a little better pocket layout and a bit more room if i buy a bluetooth keyboard , i 'm not sure it will fit so overall gave it three stars which is for the minor things its
the bag is great and it fits a # & # # ; e-reader , but not much else my e-reader has a cover on it so it makes things a little snug i should have gone one size bigger overall it 's a well constructed bag zippers are solid and pocket space is good
this little bag definitely does the job it 's sturdy , durable , and somewhat water resistant -lrb- light to med rain has not affected contents inside -rrb- the only downside is that this bag does not stretch much at all i have the asus transformer prime with keyboard dock . the bag holds this , a small notebook about half the size , charger , and a few pins
i have a leather case on my tablet , which <unk> a key board , so it is a snug fit for my use i am now looking for another case , a little larger if you just use it for an unprotected tablet with a key board it would work just fine i keep looking at samsonite for an # & # # ; to # & # # ; by # & # # ; to # & # # ; wide case all in all it is a very nice case , if you use it for what it was made for
the bag is well made but is larger than necessary for a # & # # ; netbook it works out well though since i tend to carry a mouse , charger , a couple pairs of glasses , and folders with # . # & # # ; x # & # # ; paper it could be a bit more stylish but it is durable and not too expensive overall i am very happy with it
i would have given this bag a # rating if it had a little larger side pockets the <unk> on it are nice but do n't really expand far enough out from the side to accomidate the power supply to adequately hold it
i use this case for microsoft surface pro along with numerous accessories including number pad , charger , stylus , bluetooth speakers , and miscellaneous cables they all fit the charger fits a bit tightly , but only because i have stuffed the case with every imaginable accessory i recommend the case as it looks professional and is very durable
just what i needed for my new ipad very well padded and it fits my ipad , my wallet , glasses , charging cords , stylus ' , camera connection kit , etc . . i can put it over my shoulder and go anywhere
i was looking for a carrying case for <unk> ipad <unk> <unk> fabric skin keyboard folio for ipad <unk> many of the carrying bags designed for the ipad have a storage area just big enough for a `` naked `` ipad , and are not capable of fitting an ipad inside a folio style cover this case , however , has plenty of room - a bit of room <unk> and perhaps # `` left over on the top previous generation ipads are about # . # `` taller and # . # `` wider than the air , so i would expect them to easily fit in this samsonite case -lrb- with cover or without -rrb- it also has separate storage pockets for cables / chargers and seems quite sturdy while remaining lightweight the carrying strap is a nice option not found on many smaller cases
this bag is everything it says it is . fits my ipad perfectly iphone and the charger only thing if your tall the strap will be a bit short but i replaced it with a strap that i had laying around the material is not cheap at all could use a little more padding but gets the job done as is
super sweet little netbook bag . plenty of pockets , well made , ca n't imagine how they 're making money on this . the hardware , fabric and strap are great . . love it , got ta get
a bought this to hold a # . # inch acer aspire i use while traveling this is a perfect fit and looks very high quality can easily fit power cord and travel mouse in the pockets without much bulge
i <unk> my husband who bought this first i bought another brand because i did n't want to copy him but this one kept calling to me so , i asked for it for a gift i saved my old case for a spare but will probably end up giving it away you could n't blast me out of this case if you tried plus & # # ; the price is right you ca n't go wrong
this case is ideal for my intended purpose of providing extra protection for an ipad while traveling it is light , well padded , and perfectly sized for the ipad -lrb- with a bit of extra foam added at the bottom -rrb-
you get what you pay for i guess the handle ripped within the first couple <unk> of using it it 's a very thin case that would offer no protection if dropped
shown is a zip sleeve received was a <unk> slipcase , no zipper , that not only smelled bad but did not correctly fit my laptop , despite stating that it would highly disappointed in this item
its alright i guess kinda cheap but the price is cheap too good for just keeping your laptop in a bag with other things and protecting it from rubbing against other stuff
purchased for a # `` macbook pro for use in an old unpadded bag the neoprene is thin and i 'd think would offer little shock protection certainly i 've seen thicker covers on the market however , the cover fits my laptop adequately and will offer some additional protection - it will at least prevent the power cord from scratching the case given the price -lrb- $ # + $ # shipping at the time of purchase -rrb- i do n't think you could expect much more i believe others have claimed the zippers -lrb- which run around three sides and half of the fourth -rrb- have scratched their computers but i have not found this to be an issue
i really liked this case at first , because it provides much better protection against impact than many other cases out there however , the zipper is right next to easily torn fabric , and the design of the zipper guarantees that it will catch the fabric and damage it this happened after the first few times i used it , but i was n't paying close attention and just assumed that i did n't zip it properly i tried to zip it super carefully after this , but this did n't prevent further damage after a couple of months it was unusable
the item arrived with a broken zipper from the moment i opened the package the case was not functional as other reviewer said , the case would be a good product if the zippers worked however , i guess there is no quality inspection before shipping , since , as i said , the item arrived with manufacturing defects
the case is ok , not the best i 've seen , but definitely not the worst the thing that i absolutely hate about it though is the zipper it 's like an inch long rubber piece , which is n't the bad part , the bad part is that there is only like a # inch hard metal zipper inside the rubber piece therefore if you grab the zipper by the other # inch it breaks mine broke the very first day i had it out of the box , and it went right back into the box not a bad case , but fix the zipper . # out of
great product , fits really well , great size and protection the only problem was that when i zipped it up , i could not get my computer back out the zipper was stuck right at the corner because the designer thought it would sleek by <unk> the teeth of the zipper , the the zipper head gets caught on the thin material at the corners and cuts right through it i was bummed , the case is awesome and only had one flaw that made it unusable after five minutes
i like the design a lot this case gives excellent protection to the laptop unfortunately , in well under a year the zipper is coming off the case hard candy 's customer service department sent reply email stating that the case is <unk> for only six months
the company name may be misleading `` hard candy `` but in the product description itself it says `` ... rigid case provides ... `` this case is not rigid it is not hard the case bends and will not protect the laptop from outside <unk> i was planning on using the case for use in a backpack that would be filled with other stuff , but i cant use it for that it will do nothing to protect the laptop from pressure
this is a good and very protective case but the zipper broke after less than a week of light use i have their ipad case and it has proved very durable so i guess you win some and loose some
well , the title of this review states it all prior to purchasing this item , i did notice a previous consumer making this point and within a couple of weeks , this happened to my hard candy case it was n't abused , nor <unk> <unk> designed this zipper and rubber covers did n't feel the zipper needed to be as long as the rubber covering that metal piece so what happens is that the rubber breaks at the half way point , which is the end of the zipper the case is sturdy and protects the laptop but it irks me that the zippers break off
keeps my laptop safe , the rubber part of the zippers came off rather easily , and the zipper snagged a little soon too but when you are worried about safety there is no comparison for this size and price
i wanted a hard case for my # macbook air # . # inch which zip open so i could work on my macbook with the case still on it the only one that i could find is the hard candy case i liked this feature so much from the thule case that i bought for my macbook pro w / retina # . # inch the problem is , thule did n't make one like that for the # . # inch instead , the one that thule makes was like an envelop which you would have to remove the case to use the macbook air anyway , the hard candy case is great , i give my delicate macbook air a lot of protection which as exactly what i was looking for lots of protection dropped so many times and the macbook air still look like the day i bought it adds a considerable amount of thickness to macbook air # the zipper handles are a bit too long it sometimes get in the way #
this case is great it 's relatively small , extremely protective , and appears to be made of high quality material , everything that is except the rubber zipper pulls they are metal covered in rubber , but the problem is the rubber extends about half an inch from the metal inside of it so when you pull the zipper it break the rubber off at that point it happened to both pull within a week of using the case it does n't take away from the case , but its annoying the designers did n't think of this
i was in doubt between this case and the one made by thule -lrb- for macbook air # `` -rrb- however , it was really hard to find the thule model in stores and online , so i took my chances and bought this case without even seeing it i solely based my purchase on online reviews and i must say it was a perfect hit this case is really hard on the outside and my macbook fits perfectly inside ultimate protection and cool design looking back at the thule , i am glad i got this one because the thule model does not seal completely as this one does best case ever
this is an awesome case for the macbook air it keeps the computer very well protected , with the hard exterior and rubber corners it has a nice soft interior and the zippers do not touch the computer , which would scratch it awesome case , i highly recommend
as much as a mb air costs and how terrible apple service is you really need to keep it safe this case is well designed and well thought made could n't be happier i recommend this product to anyone wanting a nice case for their air
this case is perfect for a student 's life it is stylish and sturdy , which allows your to put it in your backpack and not have to worry about taking any damage on your laptop i have gotten compliments about it by other students in class i would buy again , but i do n't think my current case will break any time soon
if you 're looking for a protective case and do n't mind a little extra bulk , this case works very well it 's quite similar to booq cases , but this one has extra corner protection
this hardy case bubble sleeve is perfect for the apple macbook air # inch it protects the macbook from any harm i was lucky to make the right decision amazon also make it very easy for us to select thanks a million
i purchased this case for my # `` macbook air and it 's a perfect fit it 's much sturdier than i thought it would be and the adjustable rubber corners help to seat the laptop
i bought my wife a macbook air & wanted a good case to keep it protected after some research , this is the best case i found with the features i wanted i myself use a thule for my macbook pro , but they only make an envelope type case for the air which my wife did not like she has not had any issues with the zippers so far just pull them by the top & not the ends and they will be fine the <unk> rubber holders inside the case are removable -lrb- held in place by velcro -rrb- so you can either take them out or reposition them if you like she has used it for a month as of this writing & i can say it is durable and will keep your expensive macbook protected great product at a great price
i really like the case it came recommended by a friend i ordered it and everything went so smoothly amazon sent out a log so i knew when and where it was and when it arrived it was great !
i bought this product for my macbook air and at the same time bought the case for my ipad # could n't be happier very sturdy with a high quality zipper hopefully i never drop but if i do i feel confident my apple products will not take any damage
having seen my mba in the <unk> -lrb- ? -rrb- for the first time i could see a good case was a must have i did not want a permanent <unk> type case for the known overheating issues nor ` just a pretty case ' offering little or no protection i saw the bubble sleeve and knew this was it very impressed with the sturdy workmanship unsure about other reviews and issues with the rubber zipper covers breaking no issues with mine at all and i carry it around and open it several times a day a very good product
i am a new macbook air owner and needed some protection for when i 'm on the road i purchased the hard candy case around three weeks ago the hard candy case provides the ultimate in protection with a tough outer shell and a nice soft interior which grips the macbook air perfectly the outer protective bubbles offer an added layer of protection which keep your macbook air separated from resting surfaces the cons are that it is a little bit on the pricey side and it 's bulkiness as compared to a sleeve while a sleeve is much more portable it does n't come anywhere close to the hard candy shell in terms of protection overall i recommend this case if you are looking for the best protection for your macbook air
the case is nice i wanted something harder to protect my macbook air inside my messenger bag which i do n't feel provides enough padding this fits that need it is fairly hard and holds the laptop very well inside the case seems decent quality the big rubber zipper extensions with probably break eventually and the zipper is n't super smooth , but it works fine honestly i think the price is pretty high at around $ # , but it seemed like every other harder style case was in that price range too i feel that a case like this should cost $ #
the case is really hard though i thought it could be more soft and it 's <unk> it 's a very steady and nice piece , yet lacking the feeling of some # + dollar high end case
this prime eligible and ships in # days the product itself is is very high quality and fits my asus ux # <unk> well it was not made clear when i purchased this product the the rubber corner protectors on the inside had velcro on them and could be moved to the position of you choosing if you are like me , and do not own an apple notebook , this case may require some slight modification to the rubber feet in order to give your ultra book a snug fit the modifications require little time , and are fairly easy to perform with a pair of scissors , or a sharp knife if you have an ultra book with less <unk> corners simply cut off the center of the bend in the rubber corner brace , that way it will be a more of a # degree angle this , along with having velcro on the rubber feet will allow you to custom fit it to your ultra book
the zipper thing is probably true ... but like the other guy said , if you hold close to the metal and keep the zipper straight while you are zipping you will have no issues i feel like it is the most protective case for the money i saw someone say they got in a motorcycle <unk> with one of these and their macbook did n't have a single scratch or issue ... pretty amazing . definitely well protected in this i would recommend it
the hole thing is very strong except for the zippers which need to be treat with careful the inside is very soft and strong , no scratches or any damage to your laptop , guaranteed good for macbook air # & # # ; and new -lrb- slim -rrb- macbook pro # & # # ; although the new macbook pro # & # # ; is a little smaller than the old air # & # #
i found this case a great <unk> to my mba over the years however when the second zipper eventually ` snapped ' i got in touch with the manufacturer direct to explain my <unk> with very little fuss they replaced the case sending the replacement to my address in oz ; how is that for great customer service
my apple air is in this unit , it 's great protection , easy to work , material is great and it looks good in or out of it like it much more than the alternatives out there there are four rubber <unk> sewn into the interior that are supposed to align with laptop when inside on mine one has it 's alignment off a bit but it works , i figure it was during production and not all of them it ; s really inconsequential i love it , would get another if i needed one
perfectly form fitting , light weight , does n't add a lot of bulk , but it protects well , and looks cool this may not be of much use as a stand-alone case as it has no other pockets or space for anything but the air -lrb- unless maybe that 's all you need and have a full charge -rrb- that 's fine with me , i just wanted extra protection from the other stuff in my bag
this case is rugged and the rubber corners move as needed to make it a perfect fit for your computer . worth every penny , plus it looks great and draws a lot of compliments
i needed something that was a bit more rugged than a sleeve and smaller than a full on case this looked like it fit the bill , and upon delivery i was not disappointed i take my laptop with me every day i throw it in this sleeve and it <unk> matter what else is in my bag it 's protected with the corner bumpers it 's even protected from drops spills and too many drinks if i go out has about he same foot print as a # inch macbook pro
fits any slim laptop thats # `` or smaller , the corners are velcro so its adjustable , and you wo n't scratch your computer on the zipper like some cases , overall very protective light and
a sturdy , well made case that has some unique features to protect my macbook air there are corner protectors in all # corners these are held in place by velcro , <unk> are easy to adjust to get a nice snug fit that does n't allow any movement <unk> case the bubbles on each side of the case , does n't make it bulky , but <unk> of protection my son is using one of these , and puts the case in his back pack every day for school it has n't missed a beat yet , despite my son being # yrs old , who has ` accidents ' <unk> has <unk> his bag around
i love the hard case and feel that my mac air is protected the corner protection keeps it in place and the zipper does not scratch the computer it opens up so that i can lift the computer out rather than others which are more sleeves and i have to slide it out , thus risking the scratch on the zipper i highly recommend it
i wanted a minimal case that offered solid protection so i could throw it in my backpack with all my <unk> this product delivers i can see how the zippers broke for the other reviewers but if you take a slight bit of care in not bending the plastic in awkward angles then you 're fine so , thank you amazon reviewers for the <unk>
this is exactly what i was looking for the only case that allows me to carry this computer in a thin backpack that is not padded at all or even in a plastic bag the corners of a macbook air are very fragile probably more the # `` than the # `` , because more weight means more <unk> shocks other similar products do not protect the corners at all , they only protect from scratches it weights # . # kg the mba # w / charger weights # . # kg total : #
this is a great case at a pretty reasonable price the corner pieces hold the laptop in for even more support so it wo n't slide around all in all , a great case
so far i love this case while i have n't used it much , the quality as well as this profile make it a distinct and superb case for your macbook air i have read the other review regarding the zipper issue , however i have n't found this to be an issue as soon as i discover this issue , i will update the review great case for a minimalistic user great job hard candy no complaints so far
the bag is nice and very well made , but it is too heavy the bag can have a few papers alone in it and it 's still very heavy it hurts your <unk> , while packing it
if i could have <unk> this bag down to # % of its size it would have been perfect it was pretty and well-made , just bigger than i was looking for
this bag is exactly what i needed i can hold all of my personal items and business items in one place the bag is big enough for my laptop also
i love this bag ! i searched for a long time for a bag that was just right , could hold all my stuff , and would look classy this bag fits the bill in fact , it fits everything it is quite large inside are three vertical and deep pockets that could fit a lunch or a large water bottle , etc . it easily fits my <unk> microsoft surface pro # - as well as cords , chargers and file folders it is very well made with thick but not stiff leather it also stands up when set down which is nice so your stuff wo n't spill out since it wo n't fall over this was well worth the money paid for it
i absolutely love this black leather # . # tote it is beautiful , fuctional & stylish my wallet fits nicely in the front pouch plenty of storage spots make sure to check the size of the bag you are ordering because this bag is sold in # . # also i would buy it again check different sites for price <unk> i 've seen it as low as $ # . with no shipping up to $ # . no shipping the bag cost $ # , if ordered through clark & mayfield company clark & mayfield <unk> vintage leather # . # ``
i bought this bag about a month ago , and it has stood up -lrb- literally -rrb- perfectly i 'm a graduate student who carries a macbook as a work computer and recently ordered a # . # & # # ; pc for personal use this bag has traveled with me to a wedding , a weekend getaway , constant visits to high schools i visit for work , and class every week , and yet it shows no wear at all it has the perfect amount of room for my laptop , tablet , papers , cords , pens , and the clutch i carry when going to dinner it 's professional looking , but very practical , as well i ca n't say enough great things about it i got it in red , which is actually a little bit darker than the picture shown , but i was worried it would be too <unk> , so the warmer red is perfect for me i highly recommend i guarantee i 'll be using this bag for years
i bought this bag to put my # . # & # # ; laptop in it fits great and still has room for other stuff i wanted a bag to fit my paperwork , laptop , and laptop accessories -lrb- power cord , external hard drive , etc -rrb- in this bag is exactly what i was looking for the picture does it no justice it is such a beautiful looking bag as well definitely worth the money
i bought this for my wife to carry her laptop i was worried when i placed the order that it would not meet her standards as she has many high end bags she absolutely loves it very high quality in material and workmanship
i love this bag had a lot of trouble finding a laptop bag large enough for my notebook -lrb- # . # inch -rrb- that still looks stylish was so happy to receive this bag , it is very well made and looks beautiful also the colour is a lovely , nice to have something other than black or grey very happy customer here :
i bought this for my wife because she could n't find a very feminine case for a # & # # ; laptop she loves it has plenty of room for all her work papers , folders , and binders even has room to spare for the charger too great buy !
this bag has been phenomenal holds up to daily use , has more than enough compartments , pockets and segments for everything i haul around my laptop is well protected , and i never worry about not having enough room for items inside even when fully loaded -lrb- laptop , book , notebook , umbrella , water bottle -rrb- the straps are sturdy and still fit comfortably over my shoulder highly recommend this bag for both its visual appeal and functionality
very disappointed in the quality of this bag i have used it for less than # months and already the inside lining is coming apart and the straps are cracking on the edges not worth the money
i recently purchased a dell inspiron # laptop , which is a # . # & # # ; model , and it fits in the bag perfectly with plenty of room for cords , etc . there are pockets galore and i love the deep crimson color the feet on the bottom are handy to keep the bag from toppling over i am a fan of clark & mayfield products and this bag did not disappoint
i looked at a lot of bags before i decided on this one it is a very well made bag stitching is strong color is true looks very professional , rich and classy plenty of room for my mac air # inch with all the cords and hook ups i need for presentations plenty of room for folders , magazines , calendar and much more nice size bag it would hold a bigger lap top than mine with ease i almost bought the bigger bag -lrb- # in -rrb- but glad i did n't this one is plenty big with room for more i really like the red , it stands out from all the black ones most people carry
this bag is absolutely perfect for any sort of medical graduate program -- it is huge , but still easy to <unk> around will fit : my laptop , its cords , my tablet , its <unk> , my <unk> , my <unk> and kit , my wallet , personal items , and even a small lunch if you 're going to be in class or doing <unk> for # hours a day , this is the right bag for you it is incredibly professional in appearance and is a great contrast from the more masculine options the # & # # ; option is way too large -- this one is perfect -lrb- and will always have enough room for any of your needs -rrb-
this was a replacement of a samsonite bag i used for the last # years the original was nice leather and had convenient compartments that each opened up with a zipper the newer design appeared to be very similar except when i tried it the two side zippers were only there to give a wider center compartment they took out the convenient side compartment which is what i really liked about the
i know the tag and online description says real leather but this is not natural leather it looks like vinyl but could be composite leather i do n't want to find out ; its going back there needs to be full disclosure so that customers can make informed decisions the bag looks good and is roomy ; but the handles are <unk> too small to stand up to a filled bag of heavy books and papers i already know with wear it will fall apart so i will not even try i will keep looking at my local discount stores because i have bought all leather bags there for about the same price ; so do n't tell me i get what i pay for
similar to other reviewers , this briefcase started showing severe signs of wear after about # months of use it starts with cracks <unk> along the top and sides , followed by flaking and shedding of the & # # ; leather , & # # ; making visible a lovely light grey cloth material while i moderately travel for a living -lrb- silver level -rrb- , i was not expecting a samsonite brief case to be of such low quality i 'm not sure what samsonite 's strategy is , but cheap products attached to a classic name is a <unk> for trouble wo n't be buying samsonite any time soon
+ it has a lot of space + my wife thinks it looks nicer than my old bag i looked at quite a few samsonite bags at the store i was impressed and thought that i could n't go wrong buying a product from them i was expecting to get a nice quality bag at a reasonable price , so i was disappointed when this bag arrived - it looks like cheap pleather - poor craftsmanship - my friend said it looked like a knockoff - i need to buy another higher quality bag
bought this for my husband for christmas thought since it was samsonite it would be a good briefcase actually it is a very nice one however it is much bulkier than the picture appears and so my husband chose to purchase a different one
my first one of these lasted about # years and more than a million air miles this one seems to be made of thinner materials and is already showing damage after a few months i really miss the little outside pocket that held my passport and boarding pass first one gets five stars , this version only #
it appears to be a quality product but i found it necessary to return it due to the fact that i could not fit my laptop into it the dimensions said that was # & # # ; but those were outside measurements because of the was made , it was actually far smaller inside i have ordered a case that is listed for larger laptops -lrb- # & # # ; -rrb- , just in case my previous ; laptop case was samsonite as well but it was better made and softer more flexible leather i gave it three stars because it looks like it would be great for a smaller laptop
the briefcase was o.k . my son did n't like the color or the leather quality i was satisfied because it looked exactly like the one i saw on line my problem was returning it with ups the scheduled a <unk> day they did n't come and said that i rejected to send it back which was not true it took to call the corporate office to schedule another <unk> date -lrb- # days waiting for the brown truck -rrb- at home , unable to go <unk> waiting for them amazon - great job ups failing grades
the briefcase is very well made with fine leather the compartments are practical , and there is plenty of room in the case it projects a very classy accessory for work purpose
