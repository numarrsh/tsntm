i 've had to buy # of these things over the course of a year and they have both broken i do n't do anything that extreme with my computer , and put it in an additional case when i take it outside of my house i 'll be going with an incase case next time for my computer i would not buy this product
it looks nice but it adds bulkiness to the laptop and does n't protect well after a year or so of having the speck case i decided to remove the case my laptop had scratches all over it the case allowed dust and debris inside the debris moved between the speck case and my laptop and over time did considerable damage to the exterior of my laptop i expected my laptop to look like new underneath the case and it looks pretty bad i guess you could clean the inside of the case daily to prevent this from happening but i did n't know that was required in addition , the speck case itself was not resistant to scratches it began to dull
i 'd stay away from this case i 'm on my third one they chip and crack so easy last one i got was less than a month ago and it 's already cracked on the sides and underneath with no travel involved or any unusual activity just in the backpack to and from work save yourself the hassle and get a different product
the satin see-thru cover for the macbook air # -lrb- # -rrb- fits well , and i like the feel of the satin finish however it is made out of cheap material i have only had it for less than a month , and internal cracks are starting to show i do not recommend this product
i ordered the hard shell case for my # & # # ; with retina because it fit perfect and looked great since it was so great , i went ahead and ordered the same one but this time for our # & # # ; macbook air since it was sold by amazon.com , i got it out of the package and threw away the box and slip without even thinking twice i was later very disappointed when i put the case on the macbook air only to see that the back corner pieces do not clip to the top like they are supposed to shame on me for throwing everything away before putting the case on the laptop ... now i am stuck with a perfect fit on the top piece and a flimsy fit on the bottom piece be careful when ordering
i received a black satin speck cover for my # & # # ; macbook air at christmas -lrb- dec # , it 's now may # -rrb- i love the looks but the bottom component started to develop cracks at the rear , near the magsafe and thunderbolt ports i contacted speck , was told that nothing could be done without a receipt , which i did not have since then , the base component has basically disintegrated , and i noted when i took it off that there was some scuffing of my air 's case , which further adds to my dislike the top cover continues to do its work well , but speck 's <unk> to take care of what seems to be a design or materials flaw makes me <unk> to recommend this product or purchase anything more from speck
ok , so i got this product maybe a year ago ? maybe more , anyways , its been a while after using this case , and almost never taking it off for a year , i have discovered that this product has done more damage than not i 'm sure this is the same with any case , but using this case , things get in between the case and computer , and constantly <unk> against the computer has destroyed my computer 's resale value the bottom part of the case seems to do the worst , with the top part of the case seeming to be a lot better anyways , be aware if you plan to use this case for a long time
the case is very beautiful , however , in only about a month or so of use , one of the tabs has broken off and the case is not completely secure on this computer strange how this happens just a day after my return window <unk> it costs too much for such a cheap product i will not be purchasing any products from speck again
within a year , it began to show cracks , and then pieces started chipping off and , i am very gently with my electronics , no children , etc . since speck was so expensive , i thought i 'd give topcase a try i 've been really happy lots of colors , every inexpensive , and seems durable so far
i ordered this product twice ; the first time i received it the corner of the bottom half of the case was already broken so it could not attach to my laptop the second time i received it , the case cracked when i put it on my laptop and then the corner broke off again not impressed , considering the money you have to spend for it and then it breaks
i bought this product in august # i had to replace it because it started to fall apart around the corner are cracked and breaking off i would n't recommend this product it is not durable
i have the purple matte finish # `` it looks nice and fits well , but the corners on the bottom near the back hinge have cracked and fallen off , so now the corners have no protection i do n't travel with my laptop and have only used it around the house it seems quite flimsy for the price i would not recommend this case
my first speck case cracked # months after purchasing it they replaced it promptly , but # months later , the new case is now cracked even worse than the first i rarely use my laptop , and never move it farther than from the coffee table to the couch for getting such little use , i do n't understand how the corners are constantly cracking i wo n't be purchasing another one
i have a june # macbook air # & # # ; and the case does have ports for the new dual mic , which is just what i was looking for the color is great the texture is nice ; very soft but it does track fingerprints a lot easier than i thought it would the clips do n't exactly stay snapped on the bottom cover i have to press them back into place every few days also , the top cover makes the screen heavier than i 'd like when i 'm using it at a certain angle , the screen will just fall all the way back
product lasts much longer than the ones you buy off of ebay but i was expecting something more durable that could withstand shutting my laptop without chipping it did just that and that why i give it three stars love the color
loved the color , loved the protection it offers however , the little tabs holding the case onto my laptop are weak and two of the four on the bottom half are already gone
i love the material and color the piece for the top cover snaps on # corners and not the fourth it falls off constantly i like speck and previous covers have been great i am disappointed this time
i want to start by saying i love speck products with that being said , this particular case needs to be redesigned my wife wanted a cover to prevent scratches on her new macbook air have had this less then a month and the clips have already broken the laptop gets minimal use and has not been dropped unlike the cases designed for our iphones , this has not held up and keeps coming off , defeating the purpose be cautious as this will let you down
great looking case with an awesome fit i recommend it for all who want some protection for their macbooks if you want maximum protection , get this and put it in a carrier case
# % of me loves this product it is a good hard case for my macbook air -lrb- late # -rrb- , and i feel confident putting it in my bag without any additional protection there are two snap on pieces -- one for the bottom and one for the top very easy to clip into place my one complaint is that the bottom piece , near the track pad , bubbles out a little everywhere else , the case is flush against the laptop , but in this one spot , it <unk> out drives me crazy i sent in for a replacement , but the replacement was even worse than the first so i kept the original case and i try to ignore the one little area where it does n't sit flush overall , a good product
i had an older version of this case and it was snug . the top part literally will not come off the bottom was a lot more snug on the old version , there is a slight gap under the mouse pad and gets a little annoying it 's a great case though , there is a reason i bought another one i love it
my daughter wanted this to protect her new macbook air and i agreed she loves the way it looks i love that it protects her computer we are both happy
i have read other reviews about this product but i have not experienced any of the negative things mentioned fit my macbook air model just fine nice and tight : -- rrb- -rrb- nothing broken i love the soft touch
this case is super light and has such a rich texture it goes on very easily , and you get to see your apple logo right through the back of it it 's nice to have my mac protected without adding extra weight
i do n't understand the problems others are reporting mine went on perfectly and functions perfectly the color is a dream for a purple lover like me i get my laptops dirty from so much use i wipe this one off every few days as you c an see grease , etc . very easily , so it is actually helping me to keep it clean
this case is perfect for my # -inch macbook pro it 's a really lovely color , and it fits perfectly it came really quickly , and , despite what some people say , it fits in a sleeve with the case on just fine it has a few scratches already -lrb- i 've had it about a month -rrb- but they 're not noticeable
this arrived right on time and was a perfect gift for my cousin the color is a slightly more plum than purple shade of the picture , but not too far off it is made to fit the air and did so without any complications , just snaps right on i have taken it off to clean and is fine in soap and water
i love the case its perfect for what i needed and it fits great i love that it allows me to see the decal i have on my laptop looks brand new even though it is not and it has no damage whats so ever
i bought this for my son as a christmas gift after less than # weeks of ordinary use , the strap is ripping away from the case i guess it 's okay for storage or infrequent use , but it 's too flimsy for daily use
definitly a sharp looking notebook case , but does not hold a # `` as it states in the description ... plus , there is really no room to hold accessories -lrb- charger , mouse , etc -rrb-
> as other reviewers have noted , the fake leather that attached the handle and strap to the case started tearing after a few months > i purchased it in september # for # . # plus shipping there is probably a better price out there than $ # . # i definitely ca n't recommend it at that price > the configuration of compartments is great at the right price -lrb- under $ # -rrb- i would recommend it more for protection and storage of accessories if you are going to carry it more than a few times a month , it is probably not the case for you because of it lack of durability
i travel extensively and had some success with samsonite luggage , so i bought this notebook case expecting a reasonable use life i have had the case for just over # months and the carrying handle has already nearly <unk> requiring me to replace the case i would not recommend this case for anyone who <unk> to carry any more than seldom
i have a dell # `` screen and i had to return the case because it was n't big enough also , the hole in the back pocket -lrb- for sliding on the luggage carrier -rrb- seems a little big -- do n't know if i would trust papers not to fall out of there
got this very compact and good looking laptop case for about a month well , this morning the shoulder strap ripped from the side of the case no more shoulder strap for me , handle only from now on i guess it was worth every single one of the # bucks i paid for it
i used this case for business travel and noticed very early on that there were durability issues with the loops where the shoulder strap connects as others have noted , the leather hiding the metal loops where the shoulder strap attaches quickly popped off despite this , i continued to use the bag for another year , and last week the metal loop on one side broke as well the shoulder strap is now unusable with the case , so i 'm looking for a replacement the handle , which i rarely used , also had the leather tear away on one side , and the leather on the handle itself is cracked and worn the rest of the bag has been fine , and useful for travel with a laptop unfortunately the poor durability has made this bag unusable for me in a professional setting i really expected more from a samsonite product
this case did not last very long i was traveling for business pretty heavily when i used this and it only lasted about # year before the clasps on the shoulder strap ripped apart as well as the zippers failed go for a targus case if you are thinking about buying this one that one has lasted me # times as long
purchased this bag for use with a toshiba satellite # `` screen laptop the laptop barely fits into the bag , and it is obvious the bag was designed for use with no larger than a # `` screen laptop the bag does however have a quality look and feel to it i would recommend this bag for laptops with a screen smaller than # ``
i usually carry my laptop with some other accesories like a mouse , extra cables , some folders , etc . my lap top is a hp tablet # `` , but things inside the bag got tight
this bag is very sturdy it can probably bang against anything and your laptop will not be damaged , however , it is very heavy and may work better for a man or a very strong woman
i ordered this notebook case , and was really enjoying it for the first # weeks it was the perfect size for my small powerbook g # , plus there was some additional storage room for small books , etc . unfortunately , the handle fell apart in week # bummer ! -lrb- i do n't think i 'm that hard on my luggage ! if it was n't for the <unk> handle , i 'd gladly give this product a # star rating
i bought this for my # in the laptop did fit in snugly , by with the power cord and usb optical mouse , it bulged in the <unk> i had some difficulty closing the zipper the quality of the material is excellent though if you have laptop with # in . or bigger screen , my suggestion is to look for a bigger one
i bought this for a dell # laptop # `` screen , it fits perfect , could be problems for any larger size laptop quality is very good , well constructed if it had more padding i would rate it a # star
the size is kinda tight for a # ' # size laptop . . as some said if u want to just carry the laptop alone fine but the extra accessories makes it bulky . . stil a great
ok , i was stupid b/c i have a # . # `` widescreen laptop and i got this bag anyway i guess i was stubborn well , it fits , but it 's <unk> tight i would not recommend this bag for more than # `` screen laptops . haha besides my own error , the bag is very <unk> and easy to handle it looks very chic and i 've been getting a lot of compliments from my friends i actually do n't use it that much so everything is still in excellent shape i would highly recommend it for people thinking about buying a laptop bag that is n't too bulky for some reason , it attracts dust i think it 's the polyester fabric
ordering the samsonite l # notebook case for my laptop was the best choice i 've made it 's very practical , light weight , and easy to carry i believe i would order this item again for any future laptop 's
for being a samsonite product and for the price paid it worked for us we purchased a # `` laptop and needed a smaller carry case this case seems like it was made for our laptop it is small but does have ample zippered pockets for papers and cords if necessary would work well as a `` carry on ``
great case for a laptop , and only a laptop does n't fit much else inside pockets are a little cheesy but , for the price , it is a very functional bag with very stout padding for the computer
the notebook case is just what i needed to tote my laptop and a few of my very important files i just wish i had more space to carry school books in it also to keep me from carrying an extra book bag
the bag is durable and does a good job of protecting my laptop i would have liked a bigger bag since it 's hard to fit all of your extras in there all in all it 's a good bag would recommend it
this laptop case is sturdy and well made i would n't expect it to fall apart like the last one i bought , which actually cost more i like it well enough that i am thinking about buying a # nd for my husband 's laptop
i bought this case for my husband because the one that i had gotten him with his toshiba was heavier than my suitcases this one is great and only slightly on the small side so if you want to bring your <unk> with you in it , it might be a bit small , but otherwise , what an improvement
is a very good product , good materials just have a problem if you need to carry out more than your # . # laptop -lrb- dell fit perfectly -rrb- and a few <unk> a dell battery charger and other stuff like that a big mouse , may be too much for the limited space great is you dont need to carry much more than your laptop
this is a great little laptop bag i checked the dimensions against my toshiba laptop before ordering note that a # . # `` laptop is the diagonal dimension of the screen , not the width of the laptop it is a snug fit and it might be annoying if i were taking the laptop in and out of it several times a day -lrb- which i am not -rrb- as noted in other reviews , you ca n't really carry peripherals or large documents in the case
it is durable , light weight and lives up to the name of samsonite we purchased this case over a year ago and it 's been through hell and high water it main use is going to work with my hubby and in law <unk> , not everything last for very long this case still looks brand new well worth the price
just got it today i bought a different model for $ # and it fell apart in a couple of weeks this appears sturdy and my dell e # fits beautifully great deal for the money
at first , i was skeptical how well this laptop case would be mainly because of how inexpensive it was but , being a samsonite , it did not disappoint the case has tons of room and is very durable i 'm very happy i purchased this item
the samsonite l # notebook case is a snug fit for the e # , but for me that 's good since there is no room for shifting it is a good sturdy case with adequate padding and has room for mouse , ac adapter , extra battery , etc . the price was right from amazon when i got it , its good looking and unless you think leather is necessary , i do n't know what else you could ask for
i bought this case for my dell inspiron # its dimensions are approximately : # . # , # . # , # inches and it fits <unk> into this case the material that protects the laptop is thick enough to keep it safe i highly recommend this case if you have a laptop quite similar to my laptop 's dimensions
this bag provides plenty of useful pockets without being excessive and appropriate padding for its precious cargo without needless bulk this is done with the very sturdy craftsmanship one expects from a <unk> brand my only complaint is that the internal pockets in the front <unk> can be somewhat difficult to access , since the compartment does n't open very far
i bought this product online and was really happy with the sleek and stylish laptop case in very reasonable price it has a lot of pockets to carry many important stuff in the case
this is a nice little bag ... protects the computer well looks good too just make sure that it will fit the size of your computer i have a # `` and it fits
i own the <unk> m # with the # . # `` widescreen , and this case does the job i 'm constantly traveling with my laptop and it 's very easy to load the laptop and the charger and my external usb wifi adapter the outer compartment has room to store lan , usb , firewire , etc . cables and a few other things such as a pen , pencil , that kind of stuff being a student , i can easily slip a few papers into the outside sleeve on the go overall i 'm very impressed with the quality of it and would recomend it to anyone who has a widescreen laptop with travel needs
its a good bag to carry almost everywhere it looks sharp , and is just the right size so that it does not get in the way also the shoulder strap is quite comfortable
before buying the samsonite case i shopped at every store and on every website possible i am very pleased with my purchase and my new # `` mac laptop fits perfectly inside it 's a classy , professional looking case some users complain about it not having enough compartments to hold things , but i find it just perfect to suit my needs you ca n't put something as thick as a binder inside , but it has the <unk> and pockets to hold at least # , # subject notebooks , floppy disks and cd 's , power chords and the like it also has pockets to hold cell phones and ipods the strap is comfortable and is held on by metal clips that should not break there is also a handle if you would rather carry it that way i love this case do n't be afraid to buy one for your expensive technology investment too
i am very pleased with the notebook case i purchased i am very pleased with the quality of it for the price i payed it arrived very fast and seller <unk> was <unk>
i love my samsonite l # case it fits my toshiba satellite notebook perfectly , providing a secure fit and ample protection it is slim , and can only fit a power cord and a slim file of documents in addition to the satellite the front organizational area has room for a pen case , cell phone , ipod , and external wireless card it is compact , light , and has endured abuse well so far
this is very compact and slick fits my lenovo t # perfectly i also tried my dell e # , it does n't fit this is slightly small for the dell # . # `` , it does n't fit at all quality of material is good , but <unk> its the design and compactness that makes me give it a <unk>
the samsonite l # notebook case is compact , good looking and has excellent workmanship i bought two : on for me to carry my laptop computer , and the other for my wife to carry her books and paper my thinkpad t # fits the case perfectly
at first , i was thinking `` just a laptop bag `` when it got here though , i was shocked there are so many pockets for stuff in and on this bag the strap is very nice and comfortable the best part is , it is very light weight i recommend this laptop bag if you are looking for one
very well designed bag with lots of integrated usefull pockets , it is simply perfect for a sony vaio <unk> not too bigger , not too small , it 's just perfect ! very good quality as every samsonite product i am very satisfied
bought this for a dell laptop the side pocket is surprisingly roomy . the back opening is wonderful for attaching to your wheeled luggage and overall access to pockets and documents is great very well built and sturdy , excellent padding to keep my computer safe
i am very happy with this case it 's a perfect fit for my ibook # `` laptop this case has room for my power cords and all my extras , even my ipod , batteries , pens , etc . the <unk> is also a big selling point for me , as it will be easier to travel with than my previous laptop case
this case is small but neat and at the same time has <unk> of room for your laptop and some additional documents and other devices like cell or handheld pc looks good especially for women who are looking for something small and elegant the only problem i have with is that the compartment for a <unk> is very small but i could fit there my # . # `` dell however when you want to take out or put in your machine is very <unk> and the compartment seems too tight , but i am sure smaller <unk> does n't have that problem over all , i am very satisfy with a purchase
this notebook case is well made and has lots of storage compartments my laptop has an extra large battery that makes the laptop over # inch deeper , but it still accommodates is nicely i like the storage pockets with the velcro closures to keep small items from moving around
i wanted something that was durable , would protect my laptop , and provided space for essential accessories this bag does all of that perfectly like a previous reviewer said of his dell # . # `` it too fits my hp dv # . # `` `` snugly `` but nicely i did n't want an oversized bag for my laptop and stuff , i wanted a smaller form , protective sleek case that is what i got from the l #
i checked out other peoples ' reviews on this product and bought it based on this information they were right it is nice quality , relatively light and has some nice extra compartments for pens , folders , software , etc . i bought it for my son 's hp dv # us and it 's a close fit , but not too tight
my # . # `` laptop fits very comfortably in this case the thick shoulder strap makes the load less <unk> to carry at school or work this case is durable , practical , and my laptop 's best friend
i did a bit of research before buying a laptop bag for my dell laptop this bag was a great price , something i was a bit skeptical of at first that is , until i got it in the mail the build quality is excellent in my opinion i love the handle grip there are plenty of compartments to add things to and the laptop portion is well padded it fits my dell inspiron # -lrb- which is a big laptop -rrb- just perfectly however , there is no obvious room for your power cord - a minus i would think but i 've never seen a laptop bag have a place for that definitely recommend this laptop bag make sure to check your laptop dimensions and compare it with this laptop bag to make sure it fits before buying
looks very sturdy and an exact fit for my # `` macbook pro shoulder strap looks pretty sturdy it seems to take enough weight as long as we use it right i can not put my <unk> in it like i used to with my earlier `` compaq `` bag , but it has decent space to put my mac power chord and some files and a note book
this product is well-designed for travelers it fits a # `` screen laptop . with multiple pockets suitable for accessories like power adapter , pcmcia cards , compact flash , usb drives , cds and even cell phones and pens a hole at the back of the bag is provided to fit the handle of a traveler 's rolling luggage the case offers very good protection against impacts the latch is of very good quality i have been using it in my travels for several months now i recommend this for buyers who wants to spend less on an excellent product
this is a very good case it has a pocket and a strap to hold the laptop , not just a strap like some other cases my hp dv # -lrb- # . # `` widescreen -rrb- fits perfectly in the pocket i have no problem sliding it in or taking it out from the pocket as to accessories , it holds the power adapter , a wireless mouse with ease and there is room left for a # . # `` portable hd the quality of the bag is very impressive i highly recommend this case
i bought this after i bought my dell # `` laptop , and it did n't fit as it should i had to cut out part of a bottom divider so i could get the laptop to fit in the section designed for files good backpack for a # `` laptop though
this bag is lovely ; however it does not fit # `` laptops i bought it for my daughter as a christmas present and her # `` dell does not fit in the laptop sleeve inside the bag i was very disappointed and feel the description of <unk> is misleading
i bought this backpack on october # , # i usually sling it over one shoulder and walk <unk> from my car which is not too far the strap is already tearing if you like to sling your bag over one shoulder and carry a laptop , do n't buy this bag other than that , i like the design
i got this backpack because it was supposed to hold # `` computers but it did n't hold my # `` dell computer what a waste of money for something that does n't work the way it is supposed to i find that i still have to find a convenient way to take my computer with me
i learn my very lesson when buying this backpack always read the reviews first definitely this product is not for # inches laptop . it may fit # inches i try to put my asus g # x laptop , but it not fit at all
even after following the instructions to rip the seams my dell studio # inch laptop still wo n't fit i 'm very disappointed in swiss gear for a misleading description of this product i will take the laptop with me to be sure it fits the next bag so i do n't waste my money again
swiss gear makes an excellent backpack and i would have given this a # star except that i bought it for my # in computer which it does not fit
i purchased this to hold my hp pavilion with a # `` screen in the rear compartment there is a special padded sleeve for the notebook if it is used , the laptop pokes out the top of the bag and it ca n't be zipped up putting the laptop in the that same compartment , but not inside the padded sleeve allows the backpack to be zipped completely closed all in all it is a good value at $ # , it would be a complete <unk> at the full price
i like a lot of things about this product it has many pockets and different functions however , the bag barely fits the laptop it 's designed to fit also , the zipper containing the inside mp # <unk> chord broke
this is an awesome bag and will fit a wide variety of products it has lots of pockets and seperate <unk> for all your stuff the laptop sits in sits in the last pocket <unk> to your back but does not rest on your back like so many other bags in this respect this bag is like the swissgear <unk> bag the only downfall is that it will not fit the # `` macbook pro , which is what i purchased it for , it does however fit my # . # `` hp pavillion
i use this for my frequent business trips and love it the main paper compartment is large enough to carry whatever i need the side small pockets are great for my camera , mp # , <unk> ... whatever else i want to toss in my carry on it is a little heavy , but so are any of the other good bags i 've owned
absolutely amazing bag for travelling or daily use the only problem i 've faced till date is with the headphone jack it very difficult to connect to some headphones and after few days of use there was no sound coming from one of the ear plugs this could be improved upon but do not hesitate to buy the bag , it 's worth it there is ample amount of space to carry apart from the laptop
fits my # `` toshiba just as easily as my # `` dell no modifications or problems noted it is a bit heavy but it so far serves all of the functions i 'm looking for in a backpack the picture does n't do it any justice but the red is swiss army red
as you have seen other people 's reviews , this product is the bomb ! ! totally awsome ! ! ! > except *** does not fit my hp # `` laptop only outside its holding compartment will it zip up kind of <unk> the benefits for protection , but does work *** the backpack itself is fantastic and has so many compartments and is very very comfortable
this is the most amazing laptop backpack ive ever owned , so much storage , i suggest it for anyone ... does not fit # . # `` laptop in the actual sleeve but it fits in the bag no
i got this at a great price because it was on sale i could not believe how nice it looked and how sturdy it was we used this on a trip and it performed well now i use it daily for work -- i wish i would have bought two for the same price
this swissgear bag is a job well done its huge , sturdy and easy to use total value for money one thing i do not like is the shape of the main compartment -lrb- not the laptop compartment -rrb- its kind of too big and so if i keep my notebook in here they come out all bent but other than that i love this bag different pouches to hold your stuff a music player connector overall from a student ` s point of view , this bag is a very good product for a day to day student life it definitely deserves # stars
the bag has a vibrant red color and nice design catches attraction at its first sight there are lots of compartments that allow you to keep different types of items for eg , the small pocket at the front has <unk> to keep differnt types of stationery helps to keep us pretty organised its light too worth its price
i bought this backpack as a gift for my brother-in-law he really loved it the color combination , the material are all good plus a got a pretty <unk> from amazon when i bought it
