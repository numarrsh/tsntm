i have a thinkpad t # and i <unk> this card due the usb problems no problems at all at the moment of the installation the power cord -lrb- comes with the card -rrb- is a perfect solution for those devices that it need more power i tested so far with my wd passport hd and my <unk> <unk> hd and both work perfect
this bag is a beast it 's survived mountain hikes , international travel , and harsh <unk> environments it kept my gear organized and protected and always seems to have just enough room for all of my equipment four stars because it occasionally takes extra effort to cram into an overhead luggage bin
love this bag it is constructed very well ... heavy duty it 's a great bag if you 're looking to put everything in one place probably not a good day pack as it get 's very heavy with everything in it you can take out what you would n't use though
this backpack bag is darn nice , well built , spacious and flexible on the interior , and truly does hold the new macbook pro # `` laptop despite the claim that it is for # `` laptops you can fit your dslr , lenses , accessories , batteries , chargers , laptop , drives , and all that inside this thing and still carry it on your back if you load it up with a the # mm zoom expect that it will be heavy
i bought the airport essentials and had to return it because it was to small this bag was about $ # more but it has made traveling with my gear so much better it actually fit under the seat of all four planes i was on -lrb- no legroom but it worked -rrb- it 'll fit my dell # . # & # # ; laptop and a tablet with a little extra room above it if you do n't have the grip on your camera
i debated a long time between the think tank <unk> hard drive and a similar sized kata bag in the end reviews and capacity tilted me towards the think tank it has proven to be everything i wanted the capacity is very high easily accommodating my d # , d # , # / # . # , # , # , # , # <unk> and all the assorted gadgets needed plus it conveniently carries my macbook pro the quality of the bag is also very
my wife and i each use one of these as our carry-on bag for airline travel they 've been around the world and keep asking for more because they 're so light weight , i can pack it full of gear and still meet carry-on restrictions though the bag is n't rated for it i can put my # <unk> # in one my macbook pro fits well inside the zipper pouch i do n't even know it 's there all the pouches are great i 've tried a bunch of bags and could not recommend this more highly
i used this pack on my last trip to ireland and london a few weeks ago and it performed like a champ it 's very sturdy and it easily handled my # in laptop , d # , four lenses , filters , spare battery -lrb- and charger -rrb- as well as two pair of glass and my two mobile phone it felt safe through my travels getting there as well as being there i have n't used the tripod support yet , but will do so soon this was a great purchase
excellent quality and design -lrb- three cheers for mcklein my only beef is the strap does not <unk> to the manufacture 's <unk> . `` <unk> , shock absorbing , shoulder strap <unk> body strain , `` this is false , big time the strap 's cushion shoulder pad slips out of position <unk> the strap is too thin the adjustments are annoying because there are only three belt holes mcklein needs to produce other strap options
my wife bought this for me as a graduation present it can hold lots of files , but there is also a zipper down the middle to collapse it a bit if you 're not carrying tons of stuff -lrb- and do n't want it to be as bulky -rrb- solidly built , very good looking , good compartments overall great briefcase -- great value
i had this product for about # years now and love it still looks brand new i use it almost everyday and sometime i am very rough with it . the only thing that i have had problems with is the strap is broken i have n't replaced it very functional and hold my # inch laptop
bought this as a christmas gift and my boyfriend seems to like it you can carry it individually , or stick it in a backpack easily he does both it is basically as secure or safe as a neoprene case -lrb- which is n't going to prevent it from major damage -rrb- but the handles are a nice touch only complaint he has is the front pocket `` barely `` is big enough for his charger good product , though slightly overpriced for what it is update : june # straps broke only lasted # months :
the neoprene on this is thinner than i expected from previous cases i 've gotten from other companies i 'm keeping this because i 'm too lazy to return it , but i would n't buy this again
i purchased this because i need a bag that i can carry and can slip into my hand carry bag when traveling sleek design , light weighted and yet can carry lots of stuff
for the price , i was really not expecting too high of quality but man am i pleased this thing fits my acer aspire v # g- # perfectly the zippers are & # # ; spaced out & # # ; and appear to be metal there are fold over covers for the top edge of the laptop which help protect the top corners , and the threading is nicely done i 'll be getting more mobile edge sleeves for sure
this is a nice laptop sleeve the quality is great it fit my # . # `` gateway # u laptop quite well , with just enough room that it would have fit a # `` like it claims the outside pocket is zipped , which is great for storing small accessories overall , this is just what i was looking for it fits nicely inside my backpack and offers protection from scratches and scuffs
i like the features in terms of the size , the extra pockets and the very comfortable handle the problem is the strap appears to be designed for a # . # inch laptop that is # to # inches thick since my new laptop is only # . # <unk> thick , the strap is useless and the laptop bounces around inside the case targus could have solved this problem by using more velcro to adjust the sizing range , or making the strap out of elastic unfortunately they did neither , and this will have to go back it was perfect for me otherwise
the case itself is , as others have said , well padded -lrb- having file folders in the back also helps -rrb- , sturdy grab handle first time i used it i put an hp # & # # ; laptop in it , three file folders , my small power brick and mouse the ring attached to the bag -lrb- to which the shoulder strap clips -rrb- broke away from the bag the moment i lifted the bag up
this bag is n't the most stylish one out there , but it has the features that i want for a reasonable price although the compartment is more square than my computer -lrb- it is the shape of a traditional laptop rather than a widescreen -rrb- , the velcro strap holds my # . # `` widescreen laptop securely it is well padded without being too bulky the outer pocket has separate compartments for my mouse , adapter , etc . , and a second flatter pocket is great for holding my paperwork in addition to the handle , it also comes with a nice adjustable shoulder strap
i just got a new macbook pro so i wanted a sturdy case to carry it in this case really fits the bill my # -inch laptop easily fits in the case the shoulder strap is very comfortable , which leaves my hands free to carry other things zippered area easily stores the charger very functional and attractive too
my gateway # . # `` nv # u widescreen laptop fits perfectly , with the removable end section removed , in the targus <unk> # us case a velcro strap holds the laptop securely in place there are plenty of zipper storage pockets for accessories such as charger , wireless mouse , paperwork etc . not quite as nice as my samsonite l # case that is no longer available -lrb- which does not fit my new gateway # . # `` widescreen -rrb- bottom line is that it fits my needs
good basic case fit the lenovo laptop with no problems no room on the side with our computer for the power cord like some of the pics showed , but that 's ok , for a smaller one there would be seems well protected we got this for a heavy computer that does n't move much it 's not a fashion statement , or easy <unk> , but it functions well
this case around my acer # , # cell battery , # . # display leaves # to # . # inches of play around the bottom and the top do not believe the it guy or the <unk> student reviews for i 'm sorry i believed them and ordered one do belive <unk> <unk> 's review for this case is obviously too big and too loose for this # . # laptop <unk> i had # . # `` foam laying around and can still use the case of now
when i purchased my # . # `` netbook , i bought a sleeve because i heard that 's what people carried netbooks in i guess if i had bought a # `` machine , and i carried a purse , this solution would make sense carrying this sleeve with a pc and a power adapter inside it is awkward i do n't know whether to pinch the corner with two fingers , or carry it under my shoulder like i 'm walking from my locker to # rd period shortly after my purchase , i bought a small case with handles and a shoulder strap then i put the sleeve inside the case for some additional padding and scratch protection so at least i 'm getting some use out of it
hi , i bought this for an # . # `` notebook knowing it 'd be a little big however , despite the fact that it is supposed to be for netbooks `` up to `` # `` my # `` macbook fits in it and my wee netbook slips around i should have paid attention to an earlier review about size . :
good quality product and fits my # inch gateway netbook just fine fit is a little loose but definitely does the job i 'm able to fit the charger into the zippered pocket on the front of the sleeve no complaints at all
i was having a hard time finding a good inexpensive sleeve for my netbook because it has an # . # inch display and a # cell battery this sleeve is perfect for those not so typical netbooks it 's well built ; good designed and has a great price the pocket with the zipper is great for securely holding your power cord and/or any other accessories highly recommend this for anyone looking for a good sleeve for an # . # inch <unk>
i really love this sleeve for my acer it fits perfectly , the colors are vivid and beautiful the front pockets hold my headset , manual , dvd rw drive , and my computer , all quite comfortably i got the red computer so it matches perfectly i love it
i bought this to store my # . # `` netbook the very first time i connected and subsequently opened the velcro , all of the stitching holding the `` soft `` side of the velcro came undone i am returning this item as it is not a quality product whatsoever amazon on the other hand gets # stars for their return policy
does not look like the case i ordered but it does have the inside & outside pocket i did not give it # stars because it is not the case i ordered
the case arrived on time quality and construction are descent enough it should last for awhile as my daughter is not that abusive with stuff fit her # `` net book perfectly , and should keep it well <unk>
the bag is great looking and it is well built the important thing is it does protects my # . # dell netbook and the external pocket is indeed large enough to hold the power supply and the digital mouse i find this bag very sturdy my sister also tells me that it looks classy i recommend this to any one who needs a bag to protect their netbooks
bought this based on reviews from others who said an # `` toshiba qosmio laptop would fit well , it fit alright , but not much room for other things , like the massive charger , a wireless mouse , etc . ended up buying a much sturdier targus @ local store i figured a toshiba laptop bag would be the best one to get for my toshiba laptop - but not so this is n't a terrible bag , but if you have a huge , heavy laptop , you might want to rethink buying this
i have had it a little over a month but only used it for about three weeks i love the available storage in it and the layout of the bag but , i noticed the other day that it is tearing at the seam of the shoulder strap seems way too quick for a laptop bag that was made specifically for the laptop i 'm using it for i 'll have to figure out a way to get a new one and then return this one or i 'm not sure how amazon will handle it i 'm guessing i 'll find out
i 've had this bag for roughly five months now and to start it was an absolutely fantastic bag the bag it self is a little huge , but when you need to tote around the monster of the qosmio laptop , what bag would n't be huge unfortunately , after about <unk> months , the stitching holding the d-ring in place where the strap clips to started coming apart the stitching holding the shoulder pad together started coming apart as well finally , after five months i need to replace the bag
i got this case for my # inch dell laptop and for lots of extra room the problem is the velcro on the strap that secures the laptop is not long enough to secure a smaller and thin laptop in the bag the strap also goes up and down and not across this bag therefore , some padding was needed on the sides of my laptop
it 's difficult to find a hand bag for the # . # `` toshiba qosmio this is the one good made quality but it gould be some more space for accessories the qosmio power adapter is very big it fits , but with some difficult because it is n't many alternatives for this heavy laptop , i recommend this one
do n't like the <unk> action of the shoulder strap its a good shoulder strap but located in an awkward place on bag initially thought the nylon make-up of the bag would be more thicker inside and out good style , good design , padded well worth the money
this bag is large enough to hold the dell precision m # with room to spare the pocket spaces are large enough to hold the power supply and accessories i did notice some stiching down in the bottom of the bag that was not as `` finished `` as i would have expected the odd thing was the dual access front pocket the first zipper <unk> the same space as the middle , double zipper that seemed <unk> to include a better option would have included an individual pocket for the zipper for smaller items
although this bag seems expensive it 's totally worth it it seems to have endless pockets and the padding where the laptop is placed is quite sufficient i actually dropped my bag and almost had a heart attack thinking my # dollar laptop would be damaged but when i inspected my laptop it was just fine i had the unfortunate case of getting a damaged bag though the side near the large opening is becoming unraveled and the thread is popping out other than that i would recommend this bag especially to anyone looking to carry their asus around
this bag has plenty of room for my # . # inch laptop and plenty of storage for my power cord/charger and other items great product / well padded and good handles for carrying highly recommend this product
this is a great notebook case and an excellent value for the money i was looking everywhere for a case that will carry my toshiba # . # `` notebook system and i have found very few i also , wanted something that will be easy on much shoulder and well padded all around as i lug my ` mobile desktop ' around there is even enough room for my brick -lrb- the ac adapter -rrb- and other material to store properly
took # . # `` laptop on a flight with this bag it 's a heavy laptop but this bag held it well and stayed on my shoulder plenty of room for everything else i needed too
i could n't be more pleased . if you have a large laptop like me , this is the bag to carry it in lots of room and a perfect way to keep organized and protect your large laptop
this is a great bag to have it has great padding , and even metal strap connections and metal strap <unk> i do wish it had more compartments for documents , but i can manage without it also comes with another smaller zip bag , i do n't use , but i may someday the shoulder strap pad is <unk> with a rubberized side made to grip , and the other is made so it does n't cause rubbing <unk> that usually happens when they have dull strap sides my laptop is a little over # & # # ; wide -lrb- screen is # . # & # # ; -rrb- and this fits with room to spare
i own a qosmio unit that is # . # inches there are no notebook cases that can handle carrying this unit without being extremely tight and unbearable with a # lb power brick the backpack design itself is organized with more than efficient space for files and documents the biggest advantage of the bag is all the <unk> room available for your other accessories where other bags come short this bag has plenty of room and space to fit mouse , keyboard , power chord , <unk> , speakers , external <unk> the list goes on , this bag is huge but comfortable for the price and the quality you really ca n't beat it it is an excellent buy the design is flawless you can compare this bag on site in a store to any other bags and you will pick this one over the others
i am very happy with this purchase , i was looking for a case to accomodate my # . # lap top fits my lap top perfectly with nice padding and i like the extra storage compartments i was surprised of how quick the shipping was , came in two days i am very pleased with my purchase
i 've owned this case for about a year i use it for my lenovo g # . # `` laptop this case was designed for the toshiba # . # `` laptop , but after reading <unk> reviews on other <unk> # . # `` cases having such a tight fit , i ended up going with this one excellent choice for a # . # `` laptop plenty of room for everything laptop , ms <unk> x # gaming keyboard , mouses , cables , etc . the case stands without it falling over , which is nice for a soft case this case is made out of ballistic nylon materials with strong zippers it should last for years i made the best choice in going with this laptop case
after purchasing my # . # `` laptop , i quickly discovered that finding a case for it was impossible i thought the store that i purchased it from would at least have the case to go with it , but it did not there began my search on the web to locate a case to fit this laptop after a failed attempt with an on-line bargin company , i realized that i should have purchased the case from amazon in the first place i placed my order and got free shipping and received the case within a few days , just as promised this case allows me to carry this large laptop with ease and has easily accessible compartments for the storing its accessories and my paperwork
bought this for my daughter to carry her new , large toshiba laptop it fit the computer perfectly and is well made , equal to cases we saw at local stores for much higher prices the computer compartment is well padded and the front section is convenient for miscellaneous papers
plenty of room for all computer gadgets with loads of pockets for everything else easy to organize the outer strap that allows it to attach to the wheeled luggage handle is a must for the larger and heavier laptops that will be in this bag it 's a winner , especially in a field limited by size
it 's hard to find a big laptop case with all the <unk> for a decent price i bought this for my husband who carries his work laptop to and from work daily he is really getting great use out of it i would recommend this product
this case is excellent and does everything i could ask the only way to make it better is add wheels to haul around that large , heavy , laptop and power supply
i really enjoyed using this bag for the first year it holds everything i need to have with me on a business trip and like the many pockets that help to keep everything organized one annoyance of the rough velcro is that if it 's not covered it snags the fabric on the opposite side of the bag also , in the last month the rough velcro square has becoming detached i also noticed one of the vertical seams within the bag is coming undone as well i tried many bags before finding this one but i do not want have to replace it every year
i searched a solid week for a good # `` laptop tote - hard to find decent ones that are n't messenger bags if you need a nice looking bag to carry your laptop to and from the office every day , this is perfect no need for a pocketbook or any other bag - this fits everything i keep a small clutch purse & wallet in one side in case i need to run out for a quick <unk> during the day i 'm # ' # ' - this bag is the perfect size - does n't look huge at all when over my shoulder , even when it 's loaded with binders , my computer plus everything else laptop area is nicely padded with a velcro strip to keep it secure and the bottom of the bag is flat so it does n't tip over nice zipper over the top keeps stuff inside dry from weather plenty of separate zippered areas to keep everything organized i keep my umbrella in one outside side pocket and a small water bottle in the other additional outside zippered areas for pens , business cards , cellphone , eyeglasses , notebook , etc . , are perfect for quick access
originally though this bag was a little pricy , but it is high quality and a year later it is still in great shape this was purchased for my daughter and she is very pleased with it and has received several compliments on it 's appearance
this is the perfect bag for me i needed to replace and old but & # # ; perfect & # # ; tote i 've been using to carry my laptop to work and business meetings that i 've had for almost # years i 've tried for several years to find something big enough , sturdy , and still feminine looking that would work this is it
i purchased this case shortly after buying the white macbook and after doing my research , incase seemed to be the best brand of neoprene sleeve the sleeve arrived within the time it was supposed to and color looks identical to the picture it was also half the price of the incase sleeves at the apple store the sleeve is pretty thick and the inside is lined with a very soft material , which i really like , especially since i am a college student and am carrying my laptop on a daily basis one complaint i have is that this says it is for the # `` macbook , but is much bigger than the other incase sleeves for # `` macbooks when i compared my sleeve to my boyfriend 's incase -lrb- same exact style , but bought at the apple store -rrb- , it was almost an inch larger lengthwise and about half an inch larger <unk> in addition to this , my laptop is still getting scratches all over the surface and i 'm thinking about purchasing a snap-on cover as well this product is great for the general protection of your macbook , but if you are worried about fine scratches , you may need to purchase a snap-on cover as well keep in mind that this will be a little big on the newest white macbooks and macbook pros
everything i expected , i have been using for it over a year now and it 's great sometimes it takes my laptop to another dimension but that 's a story for another day
cheaper on line than in the apple store tsa friendly so you do n't have to remove the laptop from the case to go through the scanner the fit is excellent , slides in and out easily and provides a fair degree of protection i love the color red may be a little easier to keep track of while on travel
bought a new mac and wanted to protect it a little this case works perfect ive had my mac now for almost # years and i still have this case to go with it and it is still in great condition just enough padding on it to give protection , but not big a bulky so its easy to slip in a bag and carry with
this package came promptly and the item was in great packaging the sleeve was in great quality and i was very satisfied it protects my computer and has more cushioning than some <unk> sleeves
this is totally <unk> it is exactly what it looks like , protects my macbook well , and the red looks sweet get one if you think you can handle its raw <unk>
case was about # `` too short in length to fit my # macbook pro # `` unibody had to return it , and picked up a case at the apple store -lrb- for a lot more , unfortunately
had to file a back corner down a little so it would n't catch when opening ... had a tendency to discolor a little from constant contact ... other than that it 's great at protecting
this must be the # th hardshell case purchased for my macbook pro all the others cracked beginning with chipping at one of the corners eventually making them unusable the material seems thicker and the screen will not open all the way but enough so that it can be viewed in normal operating position
this is a great case i have one for my macbook air note that this one does not fit the new macbook it is made for the one that is thicker good ventilation at the bottom and snaps on easily my fault for not reading the details closer -rrb- o
we buy used macs for work and i always buy these to cover up the blemishes this is the first time i have bought a clear one , but it works the same as the black that i usually buy
i had ordered my husband a black incase a couple years ago for $ # , so i was shocked when i found this for only $ # same great product from incase , just different color
i order a hard shell case from ebay its the same exact one on amazon and it does n't fit my mac book pro i sent an email to them but no reply back yet i had sent # emails but nothing so far i 'm so disappointed with them it never said it would n't fit my mac book pro mine is a late # model
they send me the wrong size , it said it was a & # # ; # and when i opened it it was a & # # ; # they send me the wrong one . i am not happy at all
this is not at all what i was expecting when i ordered it i was looking for a hard cover case that snaps directly on to my computer this product was advertised as such , but is a snap together box which fits around the computer as a carrying case i 'm disappointed with this product
i have a # inch macbook , so haha i am out of luck and do not really know what to do with it now might use it in a garden or an art project
it did not fit my mac book pro so i sent it back and they only partially refunded me because they said parts were missing there are only two parts its a hardshell case i emailed to <unk> and never received a reply the shell itself looked nice if it only would have fit
macbook pro # & # # ; is a big laptop and it generates lots of heat when it 's running all day this shell really protects the computer during transport , and the holes in the bottom allow it to breath enough to allow my cool pad to keep it at a safe temperature it 's a heavy cover , but it 's what i needed my computer is my <unk> at home and at school this is the ultimate hard cover
i recently purchased this for my # `` macbook pro with retina display it absolutely does not fit this laptop it should mention in the product description that it should not be purchased for that specific computer the color is absolutely gorgeous , and i am sad it does n't fit . : -
i like the case the color is nice the case comes just a little too close to my charger port i can only put the charger in one way and have to press down hard to make it fit
covers my macbook pro just fine it has nice ventilation holes at the bottom so the computer can breathe after long periods of studying could n't have asked for a better case i also really like the green color
still around but the product disappointed me with respect to its carrying capability for a bag meant to carry a # inch laptop , as a university student it began to rip at the strap attachment to the bag due to its inability to handle the wait in no time
i love the bag it 's amazing like the title says it came within # days of purchasing the item and the texture of the bag is lovely its very easy to use and there is also a compartment to store pencils , pens , mouse , etc . i 'm glad i got it
i bought the bag expecting it to be a <unk> until i could get something a bit more `` professional `` to tote my # . # acer laptop in this bag looks great and fits my laptop like a glove i have absolutely no major complaints if anything i would like to see some more easily accessible compartments but other than that awesome bag for larger laptops
i am so happy i finally found a good sturdy bag for my laptop i have a dell # , and i 've never found a bag that actually fits my huge laptop other reviews say the bag is huge , and it 's true but it 's exactly what i needed all other bags i 've tried that said it would fit a # `` computer , well it never fit i wish there was a zippered pouch on the outside for quick access , but hey , i 'll deal with that small flaw for something that finally works and the strap is very comfortable and holds a lot i 'd say , at least try it i fit my laptop , and then the front pouch holds everything i need -lrb- power chord , a book , and several notepads , my phone and a pencil/pen case if it does n't work , just return it
awesome bag , love it it is big but it is perfect for my # . # `` laptop and all of my accessories ; which i have plenty of it has # big pockets on the inside , i main flap for cords with another mesh covered pocket , and several more accessory pockets lots of padding too
i purchased this bag in order to carry my new hp g # . # `` laptop the bag is huge but when you slide the laptop into the case it 's like the bag was made for the computer it could n't be a better fit i wo n't be using it to carry to class but for the occasions when it needs to leave the house , i 'll feel confident that it 's well protected definitely plenty of room for a textbook or binder in the bag w / the computer very high quality on the craftsmanship as well this bag should last for years
needing to go out of town unexpectedly i was in a rush to find a laptop bag to fit my new laptop unable to find one large enough in the stores i turned to amazon and found this one i placed an order with overnight delivery upon arrival , i loaded the bag up with my laptop , power cords and other misc items that i would need and i still had plenty of room for more while the bag is not the most stylish bag i have seen , it fits my needs perfectly and it did n't break the bank
i love this laptop bag it 's been great i 've had it about # years now it has been everywhere with me it 's strong and very well made the only trouble i 've had is the logo emblem falling off
this handsome bag is perfect for netbook carriers - men and women alike i like it because it has enough space for my netbook and pockets for my wallet and other essentials , so i can carry it without needing to carry my purse as well my husband likes it because it does n't look `` girlie . `` : -rrb- the bag is well made - the straps are sturdy and the fabric easily cleaned the <unk> flap is unique and nice in that you can give the bag a whole different look just by `` flipping and clipping .
the only and -lrb- i mean only -rrb- thing that i do n't like about this great bag is the lack of space for my power cord do n't get me wrong , there is a pocket that i jam it into but ideally , there would n't be any `` jamming `` involved if you need a standard size mouse , keep in mind there would be no room to store it in this bag overall , love it just what i needed & it 's cute to boot
i was looking for a super lightweight `` man satchel `` to carry around my ipad # to local places and friends houses and this is perfect there is enough padding to supply adequate protection , yet it retains a slim enough figure the pockets do not hold to much , especially bulk , but that was not my intention when purchasing i wanted to carry a pen , charger , business cards , ear buds , and maybe some breath <unk> i 've owned other brenthaven bags before and they make high quality stuff my other bags are # years old and still look like new after traveling the world they include a lifetime warranty as well for those looking to have a light bag to bring your ipad and a few accessories to someplace like the local coffee shop , this is an excellent choice if you 're looking for a road warrior style bag that can also fit an apple bluetooth keyboard and more , i would suggest looking for something else
i bought this because i wanted a purple cover for my mac <unk> came and it was n't the colour advertised and it was clearly used i will never buy from this seller again . for that price it was a complete rip off and a huge disappointment
this case scratched my macbook pro really bad , i got it in december # so its not old or roughly used i keep it at my desk most of the time sense i do n't have warranty on it and i strongly recommend you never buy this
i was <unk> the first time i took my laptop case off there were tiny little scratched all over my laptop ! from where dust and dirt had gotten trapped i ended up putting a napkin on the bottom case to protect my laptop from the case i have thrown it away and i would not recommend any speck laptop case
this case fits great , feels great , looks great , but it is just too heavy the macbook pro feels like a brick now and the screen hinge feels a little looser with the case on i wanted to like this case , but just could n't
used this case since # on my macbook pro after the first # months the rubberized coating began to peel off resulting in hideous spots all over the case in # , thinking it was a fluke , i bought another speck case soon after , that case too was plagued with peeling on the plus side , it does provide some protection from minor scratches and scuffs , but really , you can get similar quality for less
this fits the mac book pro very well no doubt it will do a great job protecting it however , i have had it on there for only # days and the satin finish is rubbing off in several places , showing the shiny finish underneath for the price , i expected much better quality i would not recommend this cover
this case does the job but it catches fingerprints like crazy and after a while the cover started to feel a little loose in some areas overall this case is okay but expensive for a piece of plastic but it 's worth buying before your scratch your macbook pro , trust me it sucks when that happens . > .
i second everyone else 's positives about the case , but after a few months of use one of the tabs -lrb- there are # , one in each corner -rrb- broke off during regular use -lrb- not <unk> -rrb- a few months later , another tab broke off , and unless it happens to be opposing corners , it makes the case essentially useless because the entire side will just hang off of the laptop and just now , another tab broke off so now there 's only # remaining i 'm pretty gentle on the laptop , but these tabs have a very very small footprint over the top of the machine , so it 's very easy for them to simply snap during normal use if it gave me a full year of good use , or was around the $ # range i 'd give it # stars , but given the relatively expensive price vs. performance i 'm giving it # stars
it 's kind of hard to snap onto place when if you have the moshi palm guard on does a good job of protecting the laptop kind of weighs down the screen but decent product
this case was exactly what i wanted it was the right color and the right finish i did n't even notice the cutouts and other things , but after a month or so the satin finish started coming off when it comes off the bright plastic neon purple show through and it was specifically the color i bought the product for
cover fits fine but came defective the bottom shell left rear corner snap-on tooth was missing did not bother to return since i had not time due to overseas trip even with that missing corner snap-on tooth , the cover is holding fine bought it mainly because the aluminum apple shell is too slippery
