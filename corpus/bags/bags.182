this case fits my # & # # ; macbook perfectly the color is very pretty and as shown , the case still allows your apple logo light to show show this case protects my computer well and has a nice & # # ; non skid & # # ; type of surface that can also be cleaned as needed good price , good product to protect my investment
i bought this cover for my newly purchased macbook pro # inch -lrb- mid # -rrb- the cover was delivered in time and reasonably packaged the cover fits perfectly snug and i love the fact that it does not catch in the back when opening the lid the only other comment is that the feet of the cover do not seem to be plastic , more foam based not a big deal but something i noticed all said , i would purchase this again and recommend to someone else
i am so happy with my purchase of this case for my mac book pro i get so many compliments on the color it makes me glad i ordered it great product and it 's so fun to carry around such a pretty computer ! !
so far i am glad that i made this purchase it doens ' t ad any noticable weight to the computer and i like the soft feel the color is pretty much exactly the same as the picture i added the palm and touchpad guard and am now trying to get the bottom half to play nice and clip on without pushing the palm guard up we 'll see how that turns out
i had one of those & # # ; clear hard plastic & # # ; covers made by a brand name , for a macbook air that i had purchased it was too hard , and was easy to crack because it was so darn inflexible so when i got this , i half expected the same thing , but was a bit surprised it is just a very teeny tiny bit flexible , or so it feels , so it is likely to have just a smidgen of give and likely not crack from day to day use it is n't rubbery feeling really , but it is n't slick glossy either it is a happy medium in clear , it allows your to experience the whole mac thing because it is hard to tell it is even on there a nice hard case , that seems to address things the other guys did n't while i just got it and put it on , i do n't expect it will disappoint
i ordered this for my macbook because i was looking for something simple but still different i love the mocha color and love how it almost has a matte feel to it also , it hasnt shown any scratches from use even though i 've had it for a while now oh and let 's not forget - it 's very inexpensive : -rrb- very happy with this purchase
i ordered the white / clear and i love it it is actually more of a <unk> color & it matches my # & # # ; silver macbook pro perfectly i had a problem with a tiny scratch , but the seller sent me out a new one immediately customer service is aaa the cover fits perfectly and was less than $ # i 'm so happy i got this
absolutely love this <unk> blue satin hard case cover talk about form and function not only have i gotten a lot of compliments on the color , but it really protects my delicate mac book from shock and potential stains
i bought this cover shortly after purchasing my computer and i absolutely love it i wanted a case that did not hide the apple decal on the front , while offering protection for my computer all around the cover sits securely on the computer and i have never once had an issue with the case popping off -- even after i sadly dropped my computer once the cover is easy to keep clean and keeps your computer safe from nasty scratches my only negative is that the picture shows this case as a dark purple , which i really liked , but the case i received was more of a pastel purple that being said , i still loved the color i received and would definitely recommend this case to anyone in the market for a cover for their computer
got here on time , love it ! ! ! it feels so soft and the cover is way cuter when it arrives . my laptop has fallen twice cos i 'm clumsy but the case is very durable will probably buy more colors from this buyer in future :
i purchases the case along with the keyboard mat and i love it it came true to color and the texture is great and i get so many compliments on my case and keyboard i did n't expect it to be of good quality , given i read some of the reviews before purchasing the case i was very surprised when it snapped right on and has not given me any problems thus far i was disappointed on how they packaged my case ; it came in a usps envelope with no padding , like it was just thrown in there and sent out the company needs to improve on packaging , but other than that , i am happy with my case and would recommend this company to friends and family if they are in the market for a case for their computers
when i first got this product , i was very pleased the quality of the cover was much nicer than my previous one and the color is perfect however , i got this in the summer and both the top and bottom cracked this winter i 'm <unk> that to my traveling everywhere with my computer and having it been put in situations that could have easily cracked it it did it 's job , and maybe if i do n't put my computer through extensive stressful travel , the cover will last longer than # months for this reason , i plan on just buying this same cover again i 'll let you know next year if it 's lasted also , the cover has gotten dirty and is n't as pretty , but for this price and the college life , i think it 's been a good buy
i just got this today , it came sooner than i even thought it would it fits perfectly the color is even prettier in person if you think its gon na just be a cheap piece of plastic prepare to be surprised , because it is well constructed it has great grip if you want to carry it around ultimately , great product so glad i chose this one
love love this i ordered a pink cover advertised as being & # # ; soft rubber & # # ; not at all . i was afraid i would get the same quality not at all i love this , exactly what i
so far this has turned out to be a great cover for my # `` macbook pro the bottom and top cover fit snugly and do n't rub at all when you open the lid i have access to all of my ports and the venting slots on the bottom are generously cut and helps keep it cool the feet on the bottom cover are a little awkward since they are about # `` thick foam pads not very surface gripping the rubberized surface is just that , if you are looking for something rubberized that is more on the gel side , this is not it it is just as it describes it : a hard rubberized case , like a soft satin finish other than that it a little less of a brilliant purple , slightly darker than the picture , but thats being very finicky overall , it seems to be a very decent cover for the price
i love this case just as good as the brand `` incase `` in stores , but so much more cheaper it did take me awhile to put it on , but thats just because i was so excited to see it on my laptop shipping was fast , i was surprised to even receive it this week most def a must buy for you mac book users who would like to add some color to your baby i would recommend it to anyone thank you amazon , yet again , for another wonderful , cheap , great quality , item i will most likely be purchasing maybe more colors in the future . <
i just got my case today and was worried it would not look like the color i picked or not fit like some of the other reviews said it fits wonderfully , was easy to put on and the color -lrb- i got raspberry -rrb- is so pretty its for the new # . # & # # ; <unk> pro , not the # & # # ; which explains why some other reviews said it didnt fit i love this product so far ! it fits nicely and i like that is is somewhat see through im very happy that my macbook is now protected and safe thanks kuzy for this inexpensive beautiful case ! :
this is a really really really nice case , for the price it fits my macbook pro # & # # ; perfectly it fits snugly , but still allows <unk> it has a silky feel , without being slick the color is a pretty lilac purple , which looks great with the silver laptop the edges by the <unk> do not feel sharp at all i absolutely love this case , and i would recommend it
this case adds personality and offers protection at once the apple logo shines through the front cover and gives it a cool visual the fit is perfect . very happy with it -lrb- bought for a college student -rrb-
gave this cover to my daughter for christmas she loves the appearance of it i love that it firmly attaches to her macbook pro , providing great protection it is not as squishy as i thought it would be if it was , it probably would not have the physical structure to stay attached firmly
product is cute , bright and delivery was extremely prompt -lrb- i pretty much got it in # days after ordering -rrb- get the matching keypad cover as well to really brighten up your mac and make it uniquely yours would order from this company again ... who knows , maybe if i get bored with this color wish it came with installation instructions , but it only took me about a minute to figure out what went where and in what order
my mac has been dropped on the sidewalk and shows deep scratches this case is opaque enough to cover them all even with the light color , you ca n't see through snaps on very snugly and does exactly what it was made to do
just what i wanted it protects my laptop , looks great -lrb- especially with the `` apple `` showing through -rrb- , and i love the yellow color case makes computer easier to grab and hold very happy with this purchase
the product is everything i wanted it to be and more i ordered it on monday and got it on wednesday it fits my macbook pro # . # `` perfectly i got the cover in aqua , which is a fun color , while at the same time protecting my new computer i would definitely # % recommend this product from this vendor =
i love this computer case it fits nicely and does n't make your computer big and bulky plus the color is beautiful and looks really good i would suggest buying it ! ! -lrb-
this case was a breeze to put on , and is very durable because it is see-through , the decal i applied below it can be seen i love the color , and it goes perfect with my rainbow keyboard cover
if you love neon colored things like me , then you will love this it is very true to color and fits perfectly to my computer the price is also very good compared to a lot of other places i am very impressed with the product and plan on purchasing from them again
the description they give is exactly what you get , the only thing is , it is not as purple as it looks but it 's a gorgeous shade of purple do n't listen to the reviews that say `` it 's not rubber or you ca n't see the apple icon through the cover `` it 's rubberized ! ! ! meaning it has a rubber feeling to it you totally can see the apple icon when your macbook is on i bought it about a week ago and received it a day early than the company originally told me that was a major plus ! it fits perfectly ! you wo n't regret it :
when i received this product , it was wrapped up from head to <unk> , great packaging i took out the covers and immediately snapped it on my laptop , top and bottom , within # seconds fits perfectly on my macbook pro # . # inch , it was so quick and easy to snap on the color is really cute as well , its like a tiffany 's and co. color love , highly recommend
i am so happy with this case i spent a good hour or # looking at cases online ... totally could have been more <unk> with my time but i wanted to make sure i got the right case i am super happy with this purchase the case looks great -lrb- beautiful tiffany blue color -rrb- and it is really a quality product easy to put on -lrb- seriously , if i can do it , anyone can do it -rrb- and just a very high quality product i feel really safe having my macbook in this case i 've received tons of compliments on it too highly recommend this product
i bought # covers , one for each of my children they went on without difficulty and fit perfectly the colors were as they appeared online not sure about long term durability , as we 've only had them for # week ... time will tell so far , they seem like a good value
# nd one ordered , the first one my daughter spilled nail polish remover on it and it saved the computer from being ruin ! ! this case protected the computer , no damage to the computer thank you , it protects the computer and looks good too
the color is so perfect this was exactly what i was looking for and the pictures are exactly what it looks like fits perfectly and was so easy to put on definitely recommend this product
this case fits and looks great , plus it adds that much needed customized look to my macbook pro i would highly recommend this case for anyone wanting to protect their investment
my dad got a new computer a couple of months ago and he was looking for a nice case to protect it after doing a little research we settled on this one and he is very happy with it
the package came so fast it fits my computer like a glove the color is a little darker in person , kind of a red color , but nonetheless i am enjoying it
i wanted a case for my mac but they were so expensive on apple 's site for a piece of plastic this case does it 's job , and for a reduced price
i bought this as a gift for my <unk> daughter for her macbook pro laptop she loves it and gets many compliments on it it has helped protect her computer
a little darker and <unk> that the picture , but it is a perfect shade of purple fit my # macbook pro i just bought very smooth finish to it , and such a steal for the price
this product was a very pleasant surprise and i feel like it was money well spent color is true to the picture and gorgeous , fits very well and is beautiful on my macbook i like that it 's more of a frosted look than one of those super shiny reflective ones , yet the apple logo shines through anyway i 'll probably buy another one in a different color one day i love it
it turned out being just what i need it i loved the color and it fits as a glove to my laptop so it gives a very good protection to it i will recommend to double check your laptop specifications before buying .
some other companies -lrb- topcase for example -rrb- have essentially this same mould -- but produce a lavender or & # # ; light purple & # # ; product , or even hot pink i wanted a deep , rich purple and kuzy <unk> it also , props to their customer service department for prompt response replacing a foam & # # ; foot & # # ; when i let them know mine had fallen off
this product fits my # in macbook pro perfectly not only is it the exact color shown , it has an amazing rubberized feel i am more than happy with this product amazing product for an amazing price
i just love this case so much i love the way it feels and how accurate the actual color was to the color in the picture the keyboard cover does n't fit as well as i hoped but it is n't a huge deal to me considering the fact that i will probably be taking it on and off anyway i definitely recommend this case to anyone who is a huge fan of this color and is looking for a reliable case
this product works great , looks great and is as promised . used for # days and still great . if your looking for a nice color and great protection this is the case for you
i am all about protecting my investments and i believe that this case is doing the job in the past i have used expensive cases on my computers and had no luck this case has been the mill and keeps on ticking well worth the money
the case fits my # macbook pro perfectly it 's rubberized , so it 's got a nice grip and does n't slip out of my hands on accident it looks fantastic , it looks even better in person than in the picture you can see the apple logo in the picture and it 's tinted brown a bit , but in person it 's vibrant white as it should be it actually looks like there 's a cutout for the apple logo but there is n't it looks really awesome , like a skin rather than a case/cover i would definitely recommend in fact , i went and bought a black one for my macbook air as well , we will see how well that one fits and looks on the air
this newer model is perfect because it does not have pieces that snap into place -lrb- that break of after continued use -rrb- its a simple model that stays in place , no extra pieces that fall off or break
i could n't have made a better choice with this case it is absolutely beautiful , i had ordered another one prior to finding this one and i immediately returned it the color is just fascinating it was tough finding this color , since the most popular are the hot pink , or bright colors i love the color , texture , and price it truly makes my macbook look stunning two thumbs up ! :
this cover is amazing everything from the feel to the fit is just great - color as <unk> <unk> finish -lrb- great feel - fits <unk> laptop without adding much <unk> ! ! - some edges are a bit rough -lrb- not well cut -rrb- but for the price i paid it has n't bothered me a bit
sturdy hard case the zipper on my laptop bag recently broke and my laptop literally fell out on the street the case hit the ground and the bottom part popped off from the impact not a scratch on the macbook and no internal damage -lrb- could just be lucky , and in fairness , any hard case could have served the same purpose ... but the case really did soften the blow -rrb- i 've had hard cases before that pop off very easily -lrb- like when pulling the laptop out of my bag , for example -rrb- and this one has always been rock solid may need a new one now as the impact left it with a small crack ... but it 's still functional and stays on perfectly even with a cracked corner and having hit the ground hard excellent quality , especially for the price
i wanted something - <unk> - looked good - <unk> is these things exactly , do n't expect a high end , indestructible case if you are looking for the three things mentioned above , this is the case for you
i have had no problem with my case thus far also , the case came in on time just as it said and to be honest , considering that all the other products are way to expensive , this is a perfect buy
i bought this for my girlfriend , and she loves it to give a little background first , i have a similar case that i bought from apple , it 's also matte and i love it as well however , i purchased that for around $ # . # without tax this is less than half the price , and is almost exactly the same it opens entirely , and it is n't bulky it has the matte feel and looks pretty cool
this is such a good macbook cover it feels like its plastic when it arrives , but when you put it on the computer it feels smooth and like a thick rubber the color is so bright and pretty , i would definetely recommend this
it 's a great color , it snapped right onto my macbook and it looks awesome i 'm really happy with the product , especially for the price my only issue is that there are two , very small , black dots on the case and i do n't know what they are but i 'm sure it is n't like that on all of them
it took me a while to decide whether to buy this cover or not i did n't want to change the original look of my computer , but i needed to protect it from scratches i am happy because it protect my lap top and it looks like there is nothing covering it the mate finish really looks like the real lap top
it 's held up well for the several months i 've had it my laptop was already warped so it does n't fit very well but if my computer was a normal shape i 'm sure it would fit great even with the stress my abnormal laptop frame puts on it there has been minimal cracking at the stress site good product for the
bought the kuzy purple to match my ipad cover i love the color i love that it 's rubbery so it does n't slip from my hands when handled i would purchase another color if need be
i loved my new case i thought it was a bit pricey , but it was definitely worth it after i got it the cover is still hard but with a smooth feeling to it , and the cover did n't scratch the computer when i put it on the <unk> of the yellow is really cute , too i also like how the apple logo shines through it when it 's lit up overall a good buy
i love this case i really like the rubberized feel of it also , it is not the color in the picture it is actually a tiffany blue color i still like it though
i chose this protective cover for my # & # # ; mac because i wanted something stylish that would absorb a bump i feel confident that i chose good protection for the computer i love the color they also have it available in other colors
they seem to have these in every color , so i could <unk> my preference for all things cobalt blue it fits perfectly on my computer and i still have access to everything i need what more can i say i recommend this to anyone who wants a cover that is slim rather than bulky , adds to the beauty of an already beautiful laptop and makes the laptop less likely to slip from one 's hands
i love love love this cover i actually saw this cover on a woman 's macbook in a starbucks & just had to have it she gave me all of the info on it & i ordered it that same day i also got the matching keyboard protector & was not disappointed they are the most gorgeous blue color , almost a robins egg , tiffany blue color it 's got the most soft , satiny finish that 's very easy to clean i love it & get compliments on it all the time get this , you wo n't be disappointed
i was ready to send this back since i figured that usually with these cases its a finger magnet boy i was wrong i purchased the grey color and it looks beautiful the apple logo still lights up white and i really love the grey color gives it a bit of a darker grey but looks bad ass ! !
i 've ordered the product shown above . it looks exactly as it shown in the picture . clean , never used or harmed i 'll order other product from this seller in the future . i love the color it looks perfect on my
did not fit the macbook pro and did not see how that will work and cover it up i do n't know if i ordered the wrong piece but it seems not useful though
i absolutely love the feel of this and thought it was awesome , but the plastic is cheap and begins to crack and crumble apart after only a couple of months it has n't been dropped or mistreated the plastic is hard , brittle plastic , not flexible , durable plastic like it should be this kind of plastic reminds me of junk from the ' # s . it seems that after a short bit of time , this happens to all of the cheap rubberized cases like this look at the # star reviews on this one and all other cheap rubberized hard cases and you will see that they started cracking quickly , and eventually broke into small pieces and became unusable they literally crumble like a cookie into small , brittle pieces all of these cheap cases look exactly the same and have the same problems , so i 'm sure that each company just buys them from the same manufacturer
when i first put this case on , i thought it was great it looks awesome , and it fit snugly however , after using it for a few weeks , i noticed it would cut into my arms if i typed for any great length of time . the edges were sharp , and very uncomfortable also , you need a pen to push the battery check button so i decided to take it off , but it would n't come off i had to pry it off with a butter knife it had me bending the case trying to get the top off , and i was very afraid i was going to crack my screen in the end , i had to get one side off , and then slide the case across the top of my macbook to get it to come off i will not be putting it back on it looks great , but it is not comfortable to use
it was a nice fit , but after owning it for three weeks all four of the little rubber tabs on the bottom of the case fell off all at once on the same day i guess the glue they use is terrible the rest of the case is fine for now i have no confidence that it will stay together for longer than # more weeks can not recommend
the case is nice for the price it fits my mbp fairly well there are a few drawbacks , though : i feel that the rubberized shell absorbs grease marks from fingers too easily i also noticed that it seemed to greatly effect my wifi reception i was <unk> my brain trying to figure out why this brand new computer suddenly started losing wifi reception i took the bottom of the case off , as a hunch , and noticed my wifi return to normal immediately i do n't know if that is a common problem or not
it is nothing too <unk> it fits your computer just fine , and it looks good it keeps of scratches , and protects it from bumps i 've had it for a little over a month , and it still looks good , but there is nothing that sets it apart from others on the market
splits in the corners when the computer is set down chips out very easily as well it does fit the machine very well , but will not take much abuse have had this one on my machine now for about # months and my wife has one too hers is in pretty bad shape and the corners are cracked out of mine even when it 's carried in a padded computer backpack
i 've had this for about # months now and after daily <unk> , it has held up ok the rubberized feet on the bottom have all disappeared and it has suffered small cracks on the corners and in places where the plastic is thin i 've been overall pleased with it , but the durability is n't quite what i expected i 'm not hard on computers and the only reason i bought this was because the bottom of my macbookpro is so cold sitting on my lap , i wanted something between it and my legs
the word & # # ; rubberized & # # ; i feel was misleading , but i 'm happy with this case was looking for something bit & # # ; softer & # # ; but i 'm satisfied nonetheless dropped it once and the corner cracked macbook intact but it did absorb the shock
very simple and inexpensive way to have a little more comfort in knowing your laptop is protected if i had to say one bad thing about the product it would be that the rubber feet on the bottom were n't glued on straight other then that i am a happy
this cover color in blue is as vivid as my site displayed in description i was replacing a speck cover the speck design covers all # corners of the bottom of the macbook the kozy only protects the bottom # front corners this feature was disappointing the kozy has an overlap that grabs the laptop in the front better on the bottom cover better than the speck but does not grab the back bottom the speck bottom tabs broke what i considered very fast considering the gentle care given to my macbook we owned # covers from speck and they both snapped about same time frame ~ less than # months the speck company was not interested in backing their product at all when i contacted them as i purchased it off the internet so keep this in mind just got this new kozy , hope it has better track record
snaps on easy ... apple shines through and i think it looks pretty cool the only minor issue is that it leaves streaks when cleaning but im sure any case will i would recommend this to a
this case fits my # & # # ; macbook , but its pretty tight the top piece is very secure , so secure that its difficult to remove the bottom is a little loose in the back but its not too bad color is very accurate and i like the feel of the rubberized plastic
i bought this cover for my husband 's new macbook pro i had difficulty finding a cover that was the color he wanted -lrb- blue -rrb- and fit the new laptop many covers claim to fit but do not if you are looking for a cover for your macbook be sure to search by your model number found on the bottom of the computer my husband loves this cover , it is soft to the touch and provides protection for the computer i am giving this # stars instead of # because the corners of the laptop are left exposed and are not covered this cover does not cause the laptop to overheat like the speck other than that minor flaw , it is a great case and does fit the new macbook pro # inch with retina
i rarely write reviews , but i dig this little rubberized hard cover so i had to say something fits well , feels good to the touch , protects my mac and it looks good - what more could you want price is right too if you 're on the fence , i say go for it you wo n't regret it
i love my kuzy . it rocks today i am not a happy customer with amazons shipping my package was suppose to show up today normally with amazon it even shows up in the morning i 've been waiting for this package all day normally , i find their service quite fast timely and reliable . but today they were not so now i have to <unk> breaking up with my boyfriend for one more day i have to drag out one more <unk> <unk> evening ... again
good color , still some scratches on the case , but not as secure as i was hoping feels like the case can snap off easily computer seems to overheat more often with case
fits very well . . almost too well . if you ever want to remove it i would suggest having a plastic pry took or guitar pick or something i just about tore my fingernails off trying to get it off also make sure it is lined up perfectly on all # corners before snapping on the tabs that hold it on
i feel this is a relatively decent case i like how it looked at first i love the matte black and the feel of the case i 've had it for nearly a year now i 've since purchased a new one because this one has since cracked leaving my computer somewhat exposed for the time i had it , it got the job done
the bottom part is a bit flimsy , but the top snaps on nicely it is the exact color as advertised , and looks very nice when the apple shines through not the best case , but it does it 's job i 'd recommend it
only thing i <unk> n't like was the rubber legs fell of for no reason at all otherwise it protects my computer very well , does n't scratch , and it does n't feel heavy
at first i was a little worried it would n't , but this fits my macbook pro perfectly i love how it looks on my computer especially when the apple logo <unk> looks gold the only thing i disliked about this case is that it 's cheap plastic
this cash looks and works great , but the fit feels a little forced at times it does n't quite wrap around my macbook as well as i had hoped i did however drop my laptop and it saved me a dent to the lower right corner opposite the battery gauge
my case arrived in a timely manner , is beautiful , exactly what i was expecting , and fits like a glove i 've only had it for # week but i have n't had any major problems only minor complaint : it shows fingerprints very clearly and for me it has been impossible to wipe them off this ruins the beauty of the case :
the top snaps into place nicely , but the bottom does n't it kind of hangs in there , but wants to come off in the back requires a helping hand to stay in place it does protect the computer nicely the black rubber is transparent enough that the apple glows through it
i like the color a lot , its a really pretty pink , and it fits my mac pretty well -lrb- my mac is dented on one side -rrb- but other than that , i love it
fit my early # macbook pro perfectly i love the clean look and fit and the way the apple logo glows through the case the case let 's the lid open and close all the way has great ventilation on the bottom , i 've never had any problems with the bottom getting hot excellent product , would recommended it and would buy it again
this was for my wife , she had a plastic pink one before that broke this one seems a lot better and it fits real nice and feels good to the touch
this was a great addition to my mac if you want that little bit of added protection to your very pricy computer while simultaneously personalizing with the color of your choosing this is the product for you
after using several other covers and shell cases , this is as close to perfect as you can get it has a good snug fit the soft , rubbery feel is perfect ; smooth enough that it slides into my laptop bag , but with just enough grip that it does n't go sliding off my lap the bottom does a good job of venting heat , making it comfortable if i 'm wearing shorts all around this is a much better product than others that cost twice as much
i was very happy because i got this case a day earlier from when it said it would get here the case is what i expected , i love the purple color it fits the computer very well and makes it easier to open the computer
shipping was very fast and item description matched exactly what was received packing was non existent -lrb- cover was shrink wrapped and slipped into a thin plastic envelope , no bubble wrap protection or in a box -rrb- was shocked that the cover arrived without any cracks maybe says more about the quality of the cover that it could withstand delivery abuse by usps fit was perfect and the aqua blue color matched what was shown in the product description nice color to brighten the day miss my apple logo cutout on the top cover , but the light shining through will suffice : -rrb- guess not having the cutout will minimize the amount of debris that would get in between the cover and the lid we shall see how the cover -lrb- the rubber paint is really silky smooth -rrb- wears over the long run with all the travel i do my last cover lasted over three years , so i have high hopes that if it can survive delivery with no packing it can survive three years of travel
fits well , feels nice and seems to protect the macbook pro well i ca n't speak to durability though and it does n't seem to fit perfectly , although i have no concerns # month
this is the third case that i have purchased for my macbook finally , a case that fits snuggly and has not weird corners that will break and compromise the integrity of the case over time the issue with previous cases was with the bottom part of the case , in the back left corner <unk> the power supply over time the bit of place that clipped around the corner would loosen and eventually crack this kuzy case does n't have plastic on that corner
