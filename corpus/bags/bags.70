lacks a side pouch supposed to be good fit for my acer netbook however , forget packing the cord/charger and still having a sleek case i bought it and rarely use it i use a bigger case when traveling not a wise choice on my part
my # . # & # # ; lenovo yoga did not fit in this sleeve it was too snug and i was worried about being able to get it out of the sleeve alone my husband had to hold the laptop while i <unk> the sleeve off
it looks to be well made i think the foam padding on it is nice and could handle some good drops but i would n't describe this as a sleeve i even put my macbook pro retina -lrb- oct # model -rrb- in it with a hard protective case on and my computer still slides around inside of it more of a padded foam case it is about a half inch bigger in width and a quarter inch in length then my mac macbook air would be even worse really it depends on what you want i thought this would be a tight sleeve based on reading about it ... it was n't you may like it still because of the quality of protection
i bought this case for my asus laptop to use when i travel the case was a little too tight for the computer , i have difficulty getting the laptop in the case , it fits but it 's tight
disappointed ; i have a # . # & # # ; mac book pro and my computer slides back and forth in this case ; i was expecting a snug fit it comes with an extra piece of foam , which i was told by manufacturer is just packing ; however plan to use the foam because it gives a snug fit
this case is ok , it probably keeps most laptops safe , but it 's too large for the # -inch macbook air i do n't feel like my laptop is super safe , but since i mostly use it to store my laptop on my desk , it does just fine
i just got the sleeve and it is very flimsy and looks like it was made of the cheapest production material straight from china it should be sold for half the price i got ripped off
seems like a fine sleeve , but do n't buy if you have the late # pro retina # & # # ; , does n't fit my macbook just slides around inside , too big for this model
the sleeve & # # ; s zipper broke on the fourth day of use since we don & # # ; t take our precious chromebook -lrb- cb -rrb- anywhere outside our home , the sleeve is used <unk> the cb when not in use
i ordered a sleeve for my # . # & # # ; hp envy laptop and it is about an inch too big measured away from the zippers after reading some of these reviews i thought it would fit but it looks like i will have to return it as it is way too big for a tight
i have a # & # # ; dell the diagonal measurement of the screen is exactly # & # # ; the sleeve description says # & # # ; the sleeve was too small for he computer but , the sleeve was too big for the # . # attach & eacute ; case which was also made by case logic ... go figure the sleeve is going back
i just got this case today and was disappointed by how <unk> it was i had read reviews about this being a good fit for the macbook air , and decided to buy it well , it does fit the air ... and a macbook pro , and probably an ipad too it 's much too big for just a macbook air , as it bounces around in the case/sleeve i 'm sure it 's a better fit for a macbook pro , but i have my doubt about that as well the quality is also very cheap , but you get what you pay for , so i do n't have an issue with it just do n't advertise this as a case/sleeve for macbook air
there 's way too much room if used with a macbookair it 's not snug at all , which means it 's about twice the thickness it needs to be granted , half of that volume is air i think one can do better <unk> , the materials are good , and will protect from scratches -lrb- but not from drops ! -rrb-
the actual functionality is fine it fits perfectly on a # inch two year old macbook but the color is definitely purple it was for my girlfriend , who liked it but i thought it would be more <unk>
according to the item description , the # -inch size fits a & # # ; # . # -inch & # # ; laptop i guess laptop sleeves are sized like socks , where a pair of socks labeled as & # # ; size # & # # ; seem more appropriate for someone with feet like <unk> the <unk> my dell laptop is definitely # . # ; i measured it carefully before ordering the moment i unpacked the sleeve , i knew it was too big the laptop fits so loosely that there 's almost a half-inch of empty space on all four sides maybe case logic <unk> if they make these sleeves too large , anything will fit into them and everyone will be happy
bought this item as a replacement sleeve for my # & # # ; mbp -lrb- # -rrb- found it to be too big and the material is n't good with and does n't feel like it 'd protect the equipment much if dropped the mbp actually moves about , especially up/down with this sleeve
i have a # inch late # macbook pro , i purchase this sleeve to provide a little bit of protection when i carry the laptop without a bag the build quality of this item is fine , however , this is much to large for a # . # inch laptop i could fit a # inch laptop in this the laptop i bought this for just flops around inside , the # inch version of this is probably better suited for a # . # laptop
i got this for my previous laptop and i was sad to find that it was way too big for my # . # inch laptop the thing could shake around in there and the padding was actually not that good for the price returned and got another one
the case is very good quality and simple which is why i bought it i have a # . # inch macbook pro with retina display and the case is too large to give the laptop a snug fit other than the case being a bit too large , it 's a great purchase for the money
well it works , still it 's a little big for my # inch laptop , probable better for a # inch the materials are not <unk> good , i guess it could be better
i have a macbook air # & # # ; purchased june # it is an extremely tight fit i have to wiggle it around to snug it in the case but it works okay
the item description stated it would fit a laptop up to # . # in when i recieved the case , my # inch asus did n't come close to fitting in the case ended up giving it away
this a very minimalist case , ideal for simply for providing a bit of protection to your laptop in your purse or briefcase it 's a very snug fit , so you have to tug a bit zipping it up an outside pocket for a power adapter , and a carry handle would make this a pretty <unk> product
this is a nice sturdy sleeve i bought with my asus x # e laptop the sleeve is too small for the laptop and does not fit properly otherwise i would recommend the sleeve
the product seems to be a finely constructed laptop sleeve it is advertised for # inch laptop unfortunately , amazon does not report the maximum laptop size that can fit in this sleeve i went to the case logic site and found the following max dimensions make sure your laptop is less than or equal to the max dimension : fits devices -lrb- l x h x w -rrb- : # . # x # . # x # . # in our laptop is a # inch laptop that is # inches wide and would not fit in the sleeve
i purchased the # inch case while the outer dimensions of this product fit my dell lattitude e # , the inner dimensions do not this case is sized to fit a maximum laptop size of # . # x # . # x # . # unfortunately , these dimensions are not posted anywhere and i have to return the product i am still giving it # stars because it is a nice case and would protect a laptop smaller than mine
case looks nice , feels nice , provides decent protection , but even with a kuzy case on my mac has room to move around . would have liked it to be a tighter fit
i got this for my late macbook pro # late # model and it 's way to big , based on other reviews i thought it would fit only kept it as i needed something to put the computer in , did n't like it was sleeping without covers quality is ok , very thin do n't expect much protection aside from dust and very minor bumps -lrb- not falls !
looks good but its a real pain to get in and out and no <unk> or <unk> but a laptop so it <unk> even <unk> <unk> # stars for my bad <unk> and being
case is what i expected , except in one respect ... it 's quite a bit larger than my # . # inch macbook pro with retina the width is at least # / # inches too wide this can cause the laptop to shift around not an issue if i 'm carrying the case underneath exactly in the middle otherwise , the weight shift has almost caused me to drop the case -lrb- with laptop inside -rrb-
the case is a little loose for a # & # # ; macbook pro the problem is that now the laptop can move around in the case and get bumped etc during transit there is padding in the bottom but none near the zipper
i have a lenovo y # p , and it barely fits in the case it 's hard to pull it back out it 's a # . # `` screen , so it should fit fine but it does n't another downside , is that it does n't have a handle or a strap so if this is all you 're going to carry , look for something else easier to transport still , good quality material , and it protects the laptop well enough
only writing this review because i wish i had known some things before i bought this overall , you get what you pay for this is one of the cheaper cases , and it shows when you get it basically the only function this case will serve for your laptop is to protect it from scratches and light dings when you get it and feel it , it is very thin and flimsy -lrb- a lot more so than it looks in the picture -rrb- this case absolutely will not protect your laptop from a drop or a large bump i was under the impression that this case was a little thicker , but it really is very thin if you want something to protect your laptop more <unk> or from a drop , invest in a more expensive case
this product is amazing for the price you are paying , yet a sleeve is supposed to be snug , and i would be happier if it fit my macbook pro better like
this is a soft case and it does a fine job of protecting the computer , but the zipper broke and wo n't quite close all the way the case still gets the job done but potential buyers might check reviews to see if others had similar problems
i ordered this sleeve in anticipation of using it on my # -inch lenovo y # p once i received this product it quickly became apparent that it was not tall enough to cover the entire laptop , and would not even zip i found another sleeve on amazon that was slightly cheaper and had a front pouch that holds the power adapter and everything fits beautifully
it 's a solid sleeve but i think it would better fit the older macbook pro or macbook air of course the macbook pro with retina will fit inside this case but there is too much room so it 's not even close to being a snug fit not bad but its slightly irritating that case logic just added the macbook pro label to this item rather than actually making a new one for a new computer
the material is heavy duty , but what good is that if your brand new mac baby is <unk> around in it i think they need to make a separate one for macbook pros and macbook airs since the air is so much thinner
i just received the case logic # . # `` sleeve that is made for the macbook pro , macbook & pc for $ # . # this product fits my macbook pro just barely if i attach a snap-on protective plastic layer to the top and bottom of my macbook pro it will not fit unless i wrestle it in and out of the sleeve not very <unk> without the protective cover it slides in smoothly but certainly does not leave much room at all just an fyi i wish is were just a little roomier snug as a bug in this sleeve as long as the computer is naked
the description says that it can be for a # inch air however as soon as i received it the packaging said it was for macbook pro # in it still fits and is fine but it is not made specially for the air
this is a good case , but it would be so much better if it had a strap or handle this protects my laptop , but not from damage caused by dropping it -lrb- which is a constant issue for me -rrb-
i bougth the # to # . # sleeve but it is just to big for my # . # hp laptop the product is of good <unk> but it does n't fit <unk> & eacute ; el <unk> de # # . # <unk> es <unk> <unk> la calidad del producto es buena <unk> no <unk>
i was so totally bummed , because this seems like an amazing product and it does a good job of protecting my macbook pro it 's still usable , but the zipper is made of some <unk> material , but it simply snapped in half i subtracted # stars for that
i have a # & # # ; lenovo and i have to stuff the corners in to close the zipper so either lenovo 's # & # # ; or case logic 's # & # # ; are a little off i knew it was a & # # ; universal & # # ; so it would n't fit perfectly but i guess i assumed it would error on the side of too big
i got this sleeve because i 'm going to make a leather messenger bag without padding to hold my laptop and a few other items when i first <unk> the sleeve my first impression was that it was too thin to hold my oversized msi gt # but it did stretch to fit and i was able to zip it i think the sleeve will provide minimal protection while the double or triple layers of leather in the bag will provide extra padding i think the sleeve is ok for the price
this item was good quality from a trusted brand - case logic i have a samsung laptop that is a # . # inch screen size and it fit inside , however there was a little wiggle room for it it did not fit snuggly inside not exactly as described and did not fit my needs good quality overall , just not exactly what i needed
this is a nice case but not for the macbook pro retina the new macbooks do not have drives in them and therefore it is much <unk> then the old macbook pro 's . this is absolutely not the right case all it does is provides a loose <unk> for the laptop to slide around in it will keep it from getting scratched , but does not hold it securely
i bought this to go on my new lenovo # & # # ; <unk> talk about snug around the corners i hope that i do n't end of tearing the zipper on this maybe it fits better on a macbook air that is thinner they sell it as compatible for # & # # ; ultrabooks , but i think it is a little too tight
it 's a laptop case , designed to protect your laptop , which it does well but it fits almost too snug on my macbook pro i have to force it in and out of the case , which leaves me feeling a little uncomfortable
i bought this to go along with my macbook pro retina , and even with a case around the device there is still a substantial amount of wiggle room but with that aside it is a solid product
this case is advertised as being designed for the macbook air and pro retina , but is generously <unk> for a # & # # ; ultrabook of any kind otherwise , the product works as advertised just bear in mind that this case will be sacrificing some of the smaller form factor that make the mac ultrabooks so competitive
i purchased this for my son 's # . # in asus , but it needed to be # inches to work correctly it is not a bad product and i would buy it again if i buy a chromebook or netbook
its very nice quality and has good padding , however not a good fit for the macbook pro # & # # ; with retina display its slightly to big so when you put the macbook inside , its sliding all over
it seemed like the perfect sleeve but the laptop slides around in it it is way too big for my dell xps # on the other hand , the # . # . # `` sleeve fits my acer c # chromebook perfectly
i have a # `` macbook pro with retina display purchased in # and i had to return this because it was way too big with too much loose space unfortunately the cases at best buy did n't fit either , so i had to buy the one from the apple store for mega bucks
this fits fine and protects my chromebook , but it has no pockets for things like a wireless mouse and the charging cords i 've used the case logic brand for years and have never had any problems with protection and durability
i picked the right size , but it still is too big for my # . # & # # ; aspire e # - # laptop you will have plenty of room for other stuff , like documents etc . other than that , product quality is quite good
i guess the item was as described , but it just was n't as cushiony as i thought it would be it is definitely a tighter fit with a case on the mac with it too just a head 's up
i was a little disappointed if you want something that 's protective , portable and comes at the lower end of the cost scale , you should purchase this if you want something that 's nice and comes with a sense of coolness , do n't waste your time
we bought it for my daughter laptop , she liked the color and the texture but having difficulty & # # ; <unk> & # # ; her lap top with this sleeve it ends up beside her laptop not on it
i received this within the designated time and it was everything i expected about # days after it came and i 'd been using it , the zipper all of the sudden got super hard to pull back and forth nothing is caught on it so i do n't know why all of the sudden it does n't work now i put some soap on it to try to help it along but it did n't help or hurt it at all
the case does a fine job of protecting a # . # -inch macbook pro , but it 's not an exact fit there is about half an inch of empty space on both the long and short edges of the computer while it is in the case it 's not a problem in terms of function -lrb- protecting the computer -rrb- but if you want a tightly fitting case , this is not it
i expected it to be just a little bigger than # . # so that my laptop could be snug and not move around inside the case well , it does i feel that the case is n't what i truly wanted it is okay in the fact that i can use it to transport my laptop without it getting additional scratches
my lenovo edge # `` fits snugly in the sleeve the sleeve feels pretty thick and i 'm assuming it will do a good job in protecting my computer from dust , scratches , bumps , etc . i do n't like how <unk> the sleeve is and how rubbery it smells , but that is negligible the part i really do n't like is how there 's only one zipper and that the zipper does n't go back very far i would prefer to have two zippers and have the zipper go farther back to make it more convenient to put in and take out the laptop overall , the laptop sleeves seems to be a good protection for my laptop and i 'm reasonably satisfied with it
there 's not a lot of choices when it comes to sleeves for a # & # # ; laptop having owned case logic products in the past , this seemed like a safe choice i expected more and it just seems light and flimsy then again i 'm comparing it my to my incase for my macbook air
even though the title states that this case fits the macbook pro with retina display , it does n't the notebook slides around and is not secure do n't buy this for a macbook pro w / retina
this case is ok for the chromebook , but there is n't even room for the cord we prefer a mouse to the track pad and this case has no room for anything except the chromebook itself
this case is fairly thin , and it is a little too big for the # inch macbook air although my mba does n't slide around in the case , it does move around a bit once inside i guess this would be nice if you wanted to slide a file folder or two inside the case along with your laptop , but i would look for something tougher for long term protection and a more snug fit
i like the case the only problem is the case is very small and barely fits my laptop i want to use this case to bring my computer to/from classes so with the case being small , it takes a while to get the laptop in and out of the case other than that , it is fantastic and i do recommend ! -lrb- especially for the price -rrb-
this came as advertised and no problem with quality i was disappointed it did n't have even one pocket or space for an ac adapter , but i guess that 's my fault for not looking at the product more closely before i purchased it
i think this is a nice case , but it creates an issue for me the type of material used picks up lint and other items very easily , such as pet hair just be aware of that
when i read about this product i thought it could fit for my asus vivobook # . # & # # ; but it is too tight i had another netbook from hp with # & # # ; and i 'm happy using with it
the quality is excellent ; i own another case logic sleeve for my chromebook however , this # . # sleeve does not fit as advertised , specifically my asus g # w model i was disappointed , had no choice but to return it thankfully , amazon refunded my money <unk>
love the color , saves space do n't like the fact that fits my computer to tight , it makes it hard to put in and take out the computer , but otherwise is good
it looked like a fine case , but my # & # # ; retina macbook pro swam in it , so i sent it back i ended up getting the similar incase neoprene model designed for the # & # # ; macbook air it fits the retina perfectly
case is okay there really is n't that much padding and it feels kind of cheap but it gets the job done and i still feel like i can -lrb- moderately -rrb- safely move around my macbook it 's okay for the price might have to invest in a better one though , the feeling of this one is just too cheap for my taste
this functions to hold my laptop when it 's in my bag it 's thin if it was in it 's case , in my bag , and somebody ran into me on the bus , i 'd still be nervous about damaging the computer if it dropped more than # inches while in this bag , i 'm sure it would prove itself useless regardless , it protects from chipping and sharp blows
i was looking for a case for my # & # # ; retina macbook pro , but the case is too large for it -lrb- it keeps moving inside it -rrb- : -lrb- the overall case quality is <unk>
this is a <unk> # `` laptop accessory it fits macbook pro too , so for the macbook air there 's obviously too much space inside but the price is reasonable and provide basic protection
i bought it for my dell inspiron # r special edition laptop i was hoping the sleeve would be a bit more <unk> it is a bit too large for my computer -lrb- which is pretty big already -rrb- , but at least it covers it from stuff would need to try it on person next time
i just received this product today however i got confused when the logo on the front says `` <unk> `` instead of case logic is it the same brand i wonder if any one had the same experience too
i think the price is a little too high for the quality of the case i could 've just cut up a sweater and done of one of those diy laptop <unk> , but it 's alright
it 's pretty much what you pay for just cheap foam with a zipper only reason i gave it # stars is that it listed macbook air specifically in the title , but is too big maybe it 's that . # inch ? it 's not snug at all , but it will do for someone like me who just needed something in the chance i take my laptop with me somewhere would not recommend it for any daily use
look and feel : # it 's smooth and has a nice feeling to it , the padding is n't bulky but feels like a decent cushion -lrb- though i have n't tried any <unk> usability : # my lenovo y # -lrb- # inch -rrb- barely fits into it and i almost scratched the edge when i was zipping it up it works a lot better with my # inch vaio , though it slides around a bit inside one major issue with this sleeve is that the zipper only unzips to less than # of the width , which makes sliding in your laptop very difficult it would be much better if the manufacturer made the zipper go down to # or even # of the width of the sleeve
i purchased this case for my # . # dell it has great quality but the fact that i am not completely satisfied is because my laptop doesnt fit perfect on
i could have gotten an incorrect item but the sleeve was very loose -lrb- extra # . # `` in each dimension -rrb- and did not hold the laptop well at all sent it back for return as it seemed like the totally wrong size tags said it was for a # `` laptop but i tested it and it holds my # `` older machine better than a # retina mbp seems like a decent sleeve . not going to protect much but it will protect from scratches and will give you confidence throwing it into a backpack i had the earlier generation for my # `` mbp -lrb- non retina -rrb- and it fit like a glove seems like they tried to compromise with multiple models with this one and it does n't fit well
it 's a tight fit for my laptop , and something i should have expected it 's also a tight fit in my backpack , which makes me worry about stretching if i 'm carrying it around without a backpack it should be useful though
if you are looking for a tight fit , this is not it it gets the job done and for the price it was worth it it is very functional and light weight
there is no way this would fit a macbook air i have a # . # inch macbook pro with retina display and the computer actually <unk> around inside the neoprene case only way to make it snug is to leave the foam insert that comes packaged in the case in with the computer surely thats not how it was designed
had to physically stretch it out for it to fit my # . # inch laptop i continue to use it for my # . # inch but it is still a very tight fit would not recommend it to those with laptops larger than # inches
this case fits the macbook pro # `` a little loose and it feels kinda like it 's made of cardboard but it 's a great price and does protect your case i would upgrade next time to something that costs a little more and feels nicer
my older macbook air sleeve has recently started to fall apart after i dropped it -lrb- just in the wrong place , where the zipper meets the case , causing part of the zipper to rip off -rrb- i did n't have high hopes for this case , but there were enough positive reviews for the macbook air and it was cheap enough to warrant trying it the case is far too thick for the macbook air when my air was in the case , there was a noticeable amount of `` flop `` inside the sleeve so its not going to work for what i was hoping it seems to be a decently made product for the price , so i gave it # stars my roommate has a # `` macbook pro and it fits pretty nicely i gave it to him in case he decides he wants it -lrb- not really worth the effort of returning it , due to return shipping costs -rrb-
in the product description , its says the dimensions are # . # x # . # x # . # inches the packaging says # . # x # . # x # . # inches the product seems great but i now have to return it for a larger size just a heads up
i suppose that since macbook is in the title of the product that it will fit a macbook i bought two of these for my lenovo yoga # . # & # # ; ultrabooks and the sharp corners of my laptop were very visible on the outside as it stretched the case outward i returned both due to the fact that my laptop made it look like it was going to burst at the seams this may not be made to fit my exact laptop which is why i still gave it # stars the case itself is great , just did n't fit my laptop
i got this case for my lenovo yoga # , but it was really tight getting it to fit in , and then the bottom part was baggy i think it 's because the yoga is kind of wide i returned it and got an ipearl case instead , which fits great
fits loose with my # & # # ; retina = / about an half an inch wiggle room on each side may buy a plastic cover to make up for it but it works fine
i have a # `` macbook pro even though the title of the this object is # . # in , it is made more for # in laptops there is a # in gap on the top other than the size , the case is very well
a few weeks ago amazon ran this notebook cover on sale for around $ # it just fits my acer aspire s # - # # . # -inch ultrabook that said , for that price and seeing it in person , i personally think it is worth $ # at most , primarily because there could be a little more padding also , for the tannin color , what amazon sent me is definitely purple ; this was a pleasant surprise because i was expecting something more <unk> brown like the picture and what the <unk> says the color should be
this laptop sleeve is a good , usable product my # . # `` laptop is a perfect , tight fit but i had wanted one that would hold the cord too the case logic label says `` # - # . # `` and that is what it is -lrb- not # `` - # `` -rrb- it seems sturdy enough to last as long as the computer so i 'll have a long time to figure out how to carry the cord inside the case would have been nice
the case was too big for my # . # -inch laptop i wanted a snug fit and this was far from it my laptop could slide about the case i ended up returning it
