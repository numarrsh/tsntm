i bought this to protect my son 's new macbook air # & # # ; it fits nice and snug the rubberized finish makes it easy to grip without slipping it is all translucent to allow the apple logo to shine through he loves it
i got the protective cover in purple for my # macbook air and it fit nicely i like the color and that you can see the lighted apple logo through the cover i also got the purple keyboard skin and it fit perfect as well
product came to me exactly as described i wanted something to protect the outside of my laptop from all the wear and tear and abuse i put it through , while making it look fun and colorful i have had this cover a few months and it is still holding up
after reading all of the reviews on covers for my new macbook air , i settled on the kuzy i am so glad i did it was incredibly easy to install , looks great , and provides excellent protection i especially like the & # # ; feet & # # ; on the bottom that protects my laptop from other surfaces i am thinking about buying a couple more of them in different colors i like the & # # ; light & # # ; color because you can still see the laptop through it i highly recommend this product
seems like it will do a good job protecting from minor scratches i do n't think it would do much for a drop from any height does not seem to have caused any heat issues i 'm pleased with it and would purchase again
this case is amazing i was worried the cover would not be the blue i was expecting but i was proven wrong it 's a perfect tiffany blue and snaps right into place it 's gorgeous
# stars for great feel , i like the matte finish which gives the macbook a little better & # # ; grippy & # # ; feel when handling the cover does not have any cut out for the apple logo , it is solid and the logo shines through pretty well however when its off , it looks solid black which i like overall , same quality as a speck -lrb- i replaced with this case to save some $ $ and returned my speck great cheap , but doesnt offer much drop protection , but great for minor scratches to the lid and bottom also ads some grip to the macbook as the oem pads on the bottom dont offer much grip
i just got this case in the mail and so far i like it it does add some weight but its really thin and easy to apply it looks really good and makes me feel better about getting scratches on my computer i 'd recommend it
this cover is great i absolutely love it i love how easy it was to snap on and how it feels when i carry it around i played it safe and got the black , but i could see myself picking out a few more colors in the future if you are on the fence about this case -lrb- as i was -rrb- , please know that i 'm happy to say that i feel good about my choice
i just dropped my air from my table because i accidentally tripped over its power cord i was nervous and wondering if it was broken turns out everything was okay best $ # investment i 've ever made
i have bought multiple cases from kuzy and they all fit my computer extremely well and hold up for a long time i will never buy another case from a different vendor fast shipping and great customer service
fits perfectly for my new macbook air i was a little taken aback when i got it , it is in # pieces and does n't seem like it will stay on but it snaps right on and looks great attractive way to keep dirt and dust off your computer and does n't impede the movement of your screen my friend saw mine and ordered one for herself i also got the incase neoprene sleeve for the same computer and even with the kuzy case on the mac air it fits into the incase case
easy to install on the new macbook air i do n't think it will provide great protection in case of a drop , but good to prevent normal wear and tear
the cover fit perfectly my macair , it is very nice to the touch , it is exactly as described in the ad , it is of a very beautiful color i absolutely love it best buy from amazon ever
i was a little hesitant to buy this case after looking at the reviews because it had an even number of good and bad , but i am so glad i took the risk the color is so soft and pretty , i love the way the cover feels and it offers good protection for my fragile macbook air i would definitely recommend this case to anyone , the price is great and it was very easy to use , it just pops right on also i received it only # days after placing my order
great fit , no squeaks or creaks , looks good , feels strong but still thin for appearance does show fingerprints , and they do n't come off super easily , but that 's better than a case that does n't fit and/or creaks , or is weak i probably just have n't found the right method of getting the fingerprints off
thin and lightweight great rubberized texture ca n't see the apple logo through the case as clearly as the picture shows but that , personally , does not bother me color is a little off from the picture ; it 's more like the actual `` tiffany blue `` color overall , very pleased with purchase
i feel like this is the best cover out there right now its sleek and the material it 's made out of is very light and also does n't feel too plastic and hard like some other ones out there on the market i bought myself one and my boyfriend immediately wanted one for himself to replace his & # # ; incase & # # ; one that was peeling
my laptop looks great i love the way the apple light <unk> through the case i got mine in frosted white , it gets dirty , but that 's my own fault other than that , its a great alternative from the really expensive ones
cheap and protects my mac from wear and tear i like the rubber so my mac does n't slide these fit snuggle and prevent scratches and wear great for the price
i just received this case in the mail and i am # % satisfied it is everything i thought it would be and more the color is <unk> and beautiful and the case feels sturdy and durable it was worth every penny
i have had it for about two months and i love it no cracks or anything , but then again i take care of my things really well beautiful softer , medium if you will , pink it also has a slight rubberized feel so a few times it has helped me get a grip on it when i almost dropped my laptop would definitely recommend , easy on , have n't tried taking it off because i am completely happy with it
the cover snaps on quickly and remains on without any hassle looks great , provides a little extra grip when carrying it , and protects my mba very happy with this cover
this is the first and only cover i have ever bought for any apple laptop generally i loved the way they looked without any covers anyways this is a <unk> design and snaps on very well no complaints or any comments on packaging other than it did its job the cover has a rubber like finish to it , really in my opinion makes the laptop actually look nicer and the apple logo in the back does shine through once the laptop is on just not as obvious as with the protector off of course if i do get future laptops from apple , i know which brand i will be returning to for covers overall , i am a vey satisfied customer
i got the turquoise hot blue for my macbook air # & # # ; model a # it came fast in the mail , love the color too beware not to put it too close to your skin when you open your computer , was wearing shorts and i pinched my leg lol the top cover was easy to put on , latches on bottom cover did n't stay in place all at the same time pushed it in place <unk> and all latches stayed in place would by it again
i have had this cover for about a month it works very well very good for the surprisingly cheap price i have a new macbook air , and it fits great . it fits well , and does not have a hinge that cracks like with other brands
it was as described color is exactly as shown apple cut out looks great arrived in # weeks but was worth the wait planning on ordering one more
was exactly what i ordered , reasonable price , shipped on time and has been great for keeping my computer just like new also absolutely loved the color ! would recommend for anyone , my old macbook air looked like it had been through the # th circle of hell by the time i was done with it , so i decided to be nice to this one
the case was a little hard to get on the top of the laptop but once it was on i can tell it wont be popping off i have stickers on the front of my computer so with this crystal clear case it does n't block the decorations i like that the bottom of the laptop case has rubber feet so the laptop <unk> sliding everywhere
this is the second kuzy cover i have purchased , first was for macbook pro both fit extremely well , easy to fit , and adds no bulk to the thin profile protects the laptop from scratches and dirt , i would not and do not expect it to provide any protection if drop any distances over a couple of inches but i did not purchase for that reason
i just received this case yesterday and it is beautiful the case fit perfectly on my macbook air # ' june # edition the glow through the cover from the apple is really cool looking an the rubberized texture gives it a soft feel instead of a shiny plastic feel overall i am super happy with my buy so far i think the case will last a long time and the price was great it also came in a timely manner with the standard shipping . =
i was a little worried i was n't going to like the color and that it would be too blue and not enough <unk> , but it is sooo pretty i love it i ordered it along with the gray chevron <unk> keyboard cover and together , my computer looks so cute i know that is totally superficial , but it makes a difference when you 're having to look at it all the time to do work fits like a glove , snapped right in to place without much effort the texture is also really nice i used to hate putting my laptop directly on my lap if i was wearing shorts because of how cold the metal is , but with this i can easily type on my lap comfortably for the price , you really ca n't beat it
it is really good , and the quality is so high as what i expect . the color is the same as the picture showed . i would recommend it to my friend
probably not meant to be put on and removed too often as the tiny clips could possibly break , but very satisfied as i plan to leave it in place fits new version of macbook air with # speaker openings on the side i would also recommend a padded sleeve for extra safety if it is to be moved around a
i am thoroughly happy with my mac air kuzy cover it snapped into place and fits my notebook like a glove i could n't recommend this more to anyone also , i bought the blue one and it 's so vibrant and bright it 's true to the image they advertise
i was very pleased with this cover it fit well and is light i like how the apple shows through when the computer is on it was easy to install
color is good , fits mba snugly & like that it 's not slippery only negative is it seems to add a bit of weight to mba ; a surprise but not something i 'd give it up for it 's a keeper
great product , fits my macbook air perfectly and makes it look great apple logo clearly shines though the cover i would recommend this to anyone looking for a cover for their macbook air
this is a great case it feels smooth , but not rubbery very sleek looking i do wish that the apple logo would shine through the black case a bit more but not a big deal at all i got it mainly so i would n't get my new macbook air all scratched up , and this case does the trick
the kuzy - air # -inch black rubberized was the most economical out of the # and the one i chose to rock with it 's the best i purchased the speck for # . # dollars it 's ok but this -lrb- kuzy -rrb- is better at a much lower cost the other one was the hard candy convertible it was cloth and just ok grip when you hold it # you can see the apple for style # it fits like a tight glove around the entire mac
fits nice and snug on my laptop , i was worried it might get scratched and now i can rest easy knowing that my laptop is safe took a minute to figure out which way everything fit on correctly , but once i got it figured out it is amazing
so far so good i do n't think this cover offers much protection against breakage but it will protect the outer cover from dents and scratches it 's also less likely to slip from your hands because the cover is & # # ; rubberized & # # ; rather than plastic i like the color as well i would recommend this item but you still need a hard case for screen protection
i thought that this product was n't going to be that good for the price , but the positive customer reviews convinced me enough to buy it i am glad that i did the protection is perfect , the fit is good , but probably most pleasantly of all the <unk> of the rubber feet is wonderful
it perfectly fits my mac air with out making it look bulky i love the colour and especially the feel of it the delivery was extremely quick i received it by day two excellent and ideal
fits great , does ad a noticeable amount of weight to the air just because it is so light but it is about as sleek as you will get for a little scratch resistance
i have tried other cases , but this seems to be the best adds very little weight and retains the airs thin design provides adequate protection and fits very well overall very satisfied with the product
the color looks just like the picture . it fits perfectly and the price is very reasonable my roommate just got the same exact one i would recommend kuzy to anyone
i had a hard time deciding on the color , and probably would have been happy with any one of them i had a similar case -lrb- incase hardshell -rrb- for my macbook it kept it free from scratches , and i expect this one will do the same easy to install
exactly what is advertised - easy to put on , covers the computer , keeps it safe from scratches and minor bumps the see-through cover looks nice and also hides any damage well
i use it from first day i got my mac book air -lrb- new one -rrb- and so far no issue . sometimes i clean the top with just water and some dish detergent gently this case go well with a purple keyboard as well
looking at the reviews of similar products the kuzy seemed to be the best fit for my macbook air needs it arrived on time and was very easy to snap into place the material has a surface that has just that right amount of & # # ; grip & # # ; to avoid the air from slipping out of your hands
this product fits great and i had no problems fitting it on i really like the look and you can see through it so you can still see the apple it is perfectly described and seems to work great i like the foggy look too the color is also exactly as shown
very nice , slim case , and fast shipping easy to clip on , and looks great next time i need a case for anything i 'll look for kuzy hope to business with you guys
this is the best cover out there , hands down soft to the touch , fits perfectly , keeps the macbook cool with ventilation and protects the most vulnerable surfaces from scratches and scuff marks
i bought this to replace my speck case , which fell apart after just # months of use this case is much stronger , and much more durable than the speck case , and the venting is much
the color is super pretty the cover is very smooth to the touch i 've had it for about # weeks now and no cracks or breaks will see how it <unk> a trip to europe
the product was excellent and delivery was no problems i unfortunately ordered the wrong size i have an # inch laptop i hope to reorder for a smaller size when it 's available
this case was very easy to snap on , i 've had it on for a couple of weeks and still going strong looks awesome and the only thing i would say i might dislike a little is the smudges it gets easily from grabbing it and moving it around , but it wipes off very easily -lrb- not a big issue really -rrb- just me being
very easy to put on so far it has stayed on no problem i 'm sure it wo n't survive a drop test but if it helped to protect the computer in the fall it is worth it
this hard case made by kuzy fits my macbook air perfectly i bought a mcover hard case for it recently from ipearl that did n't quite fit it right -lrb- it would kind of snap off in the back -rrb- anyway , the cover is light and durable
this is a great addition to any macbook air i bought this for my daughter 's macbook air to protect it during transport as well as during use it seems to be rugged and elegant at the same time the color selection for this product is indeed <unk> i really like the way the apple logo shines through the transparent cover
not much to say about it , it 's a great case cover for my laptop it 's a bit see through and i thought it would be a solid gray regardless , it does what i need it to do
the package arrived in good time and no cracks or dents so packaged well . the picture matched the precise color and therefore i knew what i was getting before i opened it i was pleasantly suprised with the texture and the click tabs around arent too bad even though they do come loose at times all in all a good product for the
i bought this for my wife 's mba and it fits perfectly and serves as a good protection agains dents and dings dont expect this to protect too much if you drop it from a table its sturdy and fits tight , but its just thin plastic i do recommend anyway
the kuzy snapped on super easy and it looks great i 've been traveling with my macbook air for a few weeks with the kuzy - no dings on my macbook and the cover has stayed in place with no issues
this was a breeze to put on my # macbook air i love the color it really is tiffany blue the cover feels sturdy enough to protect my mba , but it is n't bulky by any means it 's perfect i was worried about the top rubbing on the bottom portion when opened -lrb- near the hinge -rrb- , but it does n't rub at all highly recommend !
i was pleasantly surprised it was inexpensive compared to the apple version i loved the blue aqua color and it was simple to put on my computer in addition it gripped the bottom of my computer to prevent it from sliding off the table you wont be disappointed
this case was exactly what i hoped it would be a nice material that is easy to wipe clean and snapped on well it 's protecting my mac well and i 'd buy it again
in the past two years i have gone through two speck hard cases they cracked within weeks of using them this kuzy is great so far , not a crack since i got it in january -lrb- now april -rrb- i thought it would be gel like and bendable , but it is not instead it is rubber like , but hard at the same time this is an awesome case and worth the $ # i spent
this case is everything i expected it to be it was very easy to install the fit is perfect the rubberized feel of the outside <unk> my macbook around so much easier i would order it again
this arrived on time and snapped right onto my macbook air it has a good fit and nice feel to it only had it a few days now but happy with overall quality of it i actually went back and ordered another kuzy brand product for my mac
it consists of two lightweight pieces that snap on the computer it wo n't help much if the computer is dropped , but it does a great job of preventing scratches during regular daily use the part that covers the apple logo on the computers top glows a pretty deep pink my son loves it
item arrived on date expected , no damage fit is good , texture is a little more slippery feeling than i expected but way less than the air itself has # little rubber <unk> on the bottom case i chose the gray color which looks nice & ok for business meetings has appropriate <unk> outs for all the <unk> this air has i recommend the case and seller
i bought this case for my summer # macbook air because others commented that the speck ones crack at the edges this case seems sturdy enough it fits well and does n't <unk> - it is challenging to remove , but that is a good thing when you want good protection i like how the logo glows through the case so it still looks like a macbook someone else mentioned in a review of another color that it makes a clicking sound when you open the cover i found that the part which covers the top can be put on improperly and this leads to the clicking if you reverse the top half vertically , it will fit fine and does not click the rubberized texture makes it less slippery
fits my # . # & # # ; macbook air perfectly very pleased with it , especially at this price even in a soft case , the macbook was getting light scratches this will save it from further & # # ; abuse . & # #
the color of the case is perfect it 's more of a tiffany blue than a turquoise the cover feels durable and is soft . i am very pleased with the case considering the price i will definitely be buying another case from kuzy ! ! !
i absolutely love this case it is so lightweight , but also protects the laptop its color matches the picture perfectly the bottom cover took a few tries to get on , but when it snapped in place , it fit snug for its price , this is an awesome case to buy
we purchased this case because we use the computer in the kitchen it seems durable and i love the blue color it 's not as neon as it looks and i was happy with that
kuzy case fit perfectly love the color it 's a satin finish with just enough grip to easily hold on to my apple air without fear of dropping it the apple logo shines right thru i 've already taken the case off once , with very little problem take an old credit card or i used my <unk> <unk> card because it 's a bit flexible run it next to one of the clips and case comes off easily i 'm very happy with it
sturdy , yet flexible and light weight construction color matched the photo , which is not often the case when ordering items such as this good value without a good price arrived next day with prime shipping all around good experience
feels good , not bulky , access to all ports , and the mac logo shines through wont protect your macbook in a fall but this will do the trick if you dont want ti beat up from everyday use
it came fast although i did pay a little extra for that it fit perfectly and was really easy to put on i feel like the computer has a little more protection and it 's still able to fit in the sleeve i have for it over all very satisfied
easy installation , feels great with the rubberized feel definitely feel that it will protect the computer well only downside is that for the air , it adds a decent amount of weight to the really light air this is not too distracting , just something to know about
received this package on time i had originally bought a turquoise one for my macbook pro , and got this one for my boyfriend 's computer and it fits perfectly love the rubberized case , it 's a lot less slippery than the original aluminum body
as i opened the package , i first though that this product was one of those flimsy , cheap hard cases made for laptops however , as i attached the product to my laptop , everything seemed to fall into place both the quality and appearance is great for the price , and furthermore , the weight of my mac air is barely affected
i just got my case -lrb- super fast -rrb- , earlier than expected it fits my macbook air perfectly i really like kuzy products i have a keyboard cover too highly recommend to others if you are looking at a easy way to protect your laptop
this product was great , a good price , great style and fast delivery . thanks . the skin was exactly as advertised . i will buy another so i can change my look , the price is
i purchased this case for my mid # & # # ; macbook air snaps into place easily and fits perfectly considering the amount of money one spends on a mac laptop , this product is a steal for the extra protection it offers i have also <unk> mine with the <unk> geek stickers , but will be able to pop the case off for a perfectly <unk> computer should i ever decide to resell very happy with this product
it 's a lovely case fits my mid # macbook air just right i 'm sure that over time crumbs will get under it , but that 's just life with this style of case - it 's just a matter of cleaning that thing out every now and then beyond that it 's worth noting that i thought the colour of the product itself was a bit deeper than shown , but i like the darker colour better all in all a purchase i 'm happy i made and an excellent alternative to the # $ cases offered by the apple store
has a really nice feel , and its easy to put on and take off which is a major plus . only con is it makes the mac air a little heavier .
this case is well made and light weight and offers good protection for my mbp fit is tight and look is clean not too bad of a fingerprint magnet either for late model mbp this case does not have a hole for the second microphone on the left side otherwise this case is a great value
great quality , looks great , would highly recommend delivered right on time , and the package was perfectly wrapped great case for someone for someone who does n't want a cheap topcase , but also does n't want a super expensive speck
fits my macbook air perfectly now i do n't have to worry about scratches or dings i love the color everyone at work has purples , blues and greens mine is unique
bought the aqua version for a june mid # macbook air it has the extra extra microphone hole and fits well snaps right on with no problems i was a bit nervous buying this based on the recent hit and miss reviews , but the one i got fits and works great i also like the smooth rubberized fell that this has
like others have mentioned , the color is very similar to & # # ; tiffany blue . & # # ; i think it 's really a pretty color the apple logo on the pic appears much <unk> than it actually is when this cover is on , the logo is covered you can still see it , but it 's not white at all as the photo would have you believe in short - there is no cutout for the logo
it fits perfectly , was very easy to install , the colour -lrb- red -rrb- is even brighter than i expected , and it 's so nice to touch - warm and velvety i am very happy with my new red mac
i 'm not sure if this cover will help much in a fall but i have n't dropped my computer i love the color and how easy it was to snap on
i have this case on my computer right now and have had it on for over # months i absolutely love it the color is exactly what i expected , a tiffany blue / turquoise it has a matte <unk> , not glossy , which i like it adds very little bulk to my computer it fits tightly -- so tightly that it is a pain to take off which is the only downside still , i plan on leaving it on so that 's no big deal for me i would order this again if my current one ever broke
i bought the black color of the cover , this allows the apple logo to glow through and still look cool i believe that this is a pretty wise choice if you are looking for something to stop scratches , not add weight and with minimal thickness i 'd recommend this product to my friends
the thing i love most about this case is how durable it is i had a similar one made by some generic company on ebay for # dollars that one cracked when i tried to take it off , thus my reason for buying a new one i tried to take this one off to see if it would break and it held up perfectly i also love how there is a cutout for the dual <unk> on the new mac air this case is very nice , especially for the price i 'd be willing to pay more for this for the job it does on protecting the mac <unk> , its definitely worth shelling out a few more dollars in order to protect such precious cargo
