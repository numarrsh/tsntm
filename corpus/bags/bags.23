it was a little smaller than my husbands last one the bottom was not as reinforced and the front pocket doesnt zip down very far so you have to dig to find what you are looking for on a positive note it looks great and has alot of cool spots to hang things from
i went by the picture that showed a good sized backpack and i did n't realize that this backpack is actually a `` computer backpack `` meaning it can only carry # laptop and then probably a book it does n't really have space for much else my needs were to carry a laptop , my dslr camera , a lens and probably # or # more small items , not much to ask but there is not even that much space in here the padding at the bottom is pretty thin so it does n't offer much protection but it is well built otherwise the volume inside is approximately # x # page hardcover books i had to return this one since it did n't suit my purpose , return shipping cost me # % of the price of the product <unk> ! :
what i liked the most about this product is that the backpack fits perfectly to my back , this help me to carry it for more time without getting tire i also like the design and the materials used in its production i really <unk> it
i know that this is a good product - i have a laptop bag that has lasted a long time , so i was excited to find this bag at this price it is sturdy looking , and attractive however , my new laptop , the reason i purchased this bag , is too shallow , and i can not secure my computer with the velcro strap i will still use the bag , placing my laptop in a padded sleeve
product design is excellent , but item was recommended with the # `` laptop so i purchased it nowhere did it state the size laptop it works with only after i received the shipment did i discover it would not accommodate my laptop i really like the design so am disappointed about this and now must send it back , and search for a bag that fits
backpack is nice enough decent amount of room with three compartments i nice mp # player area with the weatherproof grommet and all that 's nice my only problem is the front compartment is not easily accessible there 's like a # inch zipper that goes straight across and you ca n't see the zipper inside very easy or even reach the whole area if you could unzip more of this area it would make things a lot better overall a minor issue and for $ # vs $ # - $ # like its <unk> , i can live with it
unfortunate , but the strap ripped after a few months of <unk> use . still usable , does n't look good anymore . but i love swissgear , so my replacement will still be coming from them
despite other reviews , i think this backpack is too small for a # `` macbook pro the padding will not protect the entire laptop and you can barely zip the bag closed the macbook is pretty slim so i do n't really see this backpack being suitable for any # `` laptop the bag is also pretty small overall , but nice otherwise it would be ideal for # `` laptops or smaller
as with everything i did a lot of research before buying this backpack and relied upon these reviews before i bought it i purchased this backpack a year ago for a business trip and this review is for how it 's held up over the year the `` good `` : just enough pockets -lrb- not too many -rrb- , protects my laptop -lrb- # `` dell lattitude -rrb- , comfortable to wear for long periods of time the `` bad `` : the straps have hard plastic reinforcing ` straps ' which have punctured through the fabric on both straps ; it appears to me these were not reinforced enough for their purpose for the money i spent this is disappointing and as far as travel , i do n't travel a lot -lrb- ~ # business <unk> and a daily commute via train -rrb-
inside pocket torn upon arrival decided it was not wort the pain of <unk> and sending back this is one of several online order disappointments in recent months and over the years will pull back on my online ordering which is supporting a <unk> lifestyle looks like it is time to leave the & # # ; man <unk> & # # ; and see the world
it is a fashionable backpack with enough space for my # `` laptop , however i thought it was going to be smaller the zips are not as strong as they look like
sturdy exterior travelled thru europe with <unk> of pockets and zippered <unk> drawback the interior linings have ripped after the first month , but do not have time to <unk> still would purchase
this bag is solidly built it 's made out of a nice thick material that leads me to believe it will last my major problem with the bag is the front compartment the opening to it is very small it is very hard to get to items that are stored there
zipper access to the rear pocket is too small for how deep the pocket is , middle pouch zippers interfere with side straps , grey shoulder strap is ripping after a month of use
i 've only had this backpack for a week and it 's super comfy and sturdy so far my only complaint is that it is not roomy what so ever if you need to carry anything more than a laptop , and maybe # books or # binders , you 're out of luck the first day i put my laptop and my # -inch # ring binder in the main compartment , and it would n't zip up the side pockets are also small and tight , i do n't see how you could fit a water bottle in there
overall it 's a decent bag the biggest drawback is that none of the compartments open wide enough to get into them easily , making it frustrating if you drop anything the small pocket on the back is the worst since it has a ton of small pockets but barely opens at all , making it next to useless
i bought this for my vacation used it for couple of weeks to discover the stitches are coming off the quality of product looks very original but i doubt only because swiss is known for its strong bags
i 'm a backpack <unk> surprised at how sturdy and good this bag is the lap top section is ample & u can include some papers etc . could do with more useful front pockets for easy find of mobile , wallet , keys
i 'll be brief here - i doubt that this bag can carry a # . # `` laptop my # `` is a very tight fit - secondary storage compartment is decently sized , but it 's simply not large enough for this to be handy for travel - it 's pretty heavy when empty - zippers get caught pretty often - one of the buckles on the side does not close - it would be too much of a hassle for me to return this and get another one bag in exchange will i use this for travel
i love the padding on this backpack for my laptop only problem is the rest of the backpack the main compartment for the laptop is great with lots a room and net pockets for my charger and mouse the other two zipper compartments on the backpack feel horrible they do not feel efficient or helpful at all the area where the zipper is right above the swissgear logo is you are suppose to be able to hold pens , your phone , and other helpful stuff but it is so cramped you end up just tossing a pen or two in and close it i love it to hold my laptop but i need to hold other accessories comfortably as that is what i look for in my computer backpacks
the backpack is well padded and should be able to protect your laptop actually it did protect my laptop when one day i put it on and the straps came off because it was not sewn on correctly , -lrb- it was made in china so there should be no surprise there -rrb- it would be five stars easily if i did not now have to take it to a repair place to have it sewn correctly , too bad !
i always wanted to go for swissgear bag when i wanted to go for backpack as per the item , i thought it will fit for # `` inches screen as i bought new # `` laptop , i have <unk> this bag and this is not even close to that this is just for # `` laptop and less please do not buy this if you have # `` widescreen or above otherwise , this backpack is really good and worth for the price
i gave this product # stars because it is an awesome backpack for the price it is sturdy , compact , and vary comfortable -lrb- even when carrying heavy loads -rrb- i was surprised how much this backpack can hold i put all my school books in it , and still had room left over it seams to just stretch to however wide you need it to the straps and padding on the back work really well and are super comfortable the only thing i did n't like was the position of the ipod pouch it is far back in the second zipper and a little hard to fish headphones through the phone holder is pretty small it works for my free slid phone , but would n't work for smart phones , or iphones i would recommend this backpack to anyone in school , it would be great for camping , and motorcycle <unk>
this backpack has served me well throughout my travels it seems to be made from strong , durable materials and has held up great with no rips or damage the bag was a bit more compact than i expected but it does fit up to a # inch laptop as it states there are many compartments for passports , keys , etc . which is very nice when you need to access something quick the shoulder straps are thick and padded for better comfort one of the best features is the top handle it is very thick and sturdy despite carrying a lot of weight , whereas with many other backpacks this is a weak point
my hp pavilion dv # will not fit in the bag -lrb- was n't expecting it to because it 's so huge but was optimistic -rrb- i can fit three # & # # ; # ring binders in the bag snugly , with possibly a small text book i think the bag is just about perfect for a college student , large main pockets and decent storage in the small one the materials seem to be quality , same can be said about the zippers i 'm a little nit picky as far as what i do not like , but it 's so <unk> i wont mention anything overall it would make a great <unk> pack
i feel like i am super cool when carrying this bag biking around campus , plenty of room plus nice quality though heavy itself , but it is what this kind of pack like love it , and its style seems never
saw it on the internet among thousands - liked <unk> the reviews -lrb- many <unk> - liked it -lrb- many pockets -rrb- bought it fast and <unk> it in # days - opened it - liked <unk> sorry - strong + many pockets + good <unk> + good
this backpack is nice i like it and it has lots of compartments to store your stuff however , i think is kind of small i 'm # . # meter tall and it covers only half of my back maybe a little bit more than a half i guess i 'm used to wear bigger backpacks , but when i first saw it i just thought it was way too small it fits a # inch laptop perfectly , but i do n't think you can use it with # inch ones
i like the bag has plenty of room , but the grey strap that sits on the other strap has started to pull away and fray kinda expected a little better quality overall
it 's one of the best backpack that i bought the material is very strong and you do n't have to worry about your items -lrb- books , laptop , or etc . -rrb- when it 's raining , because <unk> is against the rain also , swiss gear 's products are high quality
this bag is very comfortable and the materials used to make the bag are of quality however , the front pocket seemed very tight and small for my liking overall the bag performs well despite my need for a little more interior space
i had a swissgear backpack , but wanted something new this backpack has a lot of pockets , but there is n't that much room in the main section of the pack i can fit about half of the items in this backpack as my old one
a good amount of padding pretty comfortable straps only thing to note is that this is pretty shallow pack , and will not hold a ton of stuff beyond your laptop i.e . , not a general purpose pack , but a computer + a little gear pack
decided to spend money on a bag that will last me a long time this bag seems like it will it has a good design for the most part the pocket designed to hold your ipod is an exception once in the pocket , it 's difficult to pull it out to change <unk> or adjust volume , and i do that often other than that , it 's a quality bag that looks good , and seems like it will last a long time the price may be a little high , but i guess you get what you pay for
sturdy , and well made large enough for a large computer -lrb- # & # # ; -rrb- lots of pockets inside and out nice sturdy straps and padded back place to put your glasses and small knife on the straps only one small complaint , the first pocket on the front is hard to access because the zipper does n't come down far enough but excellent backpack i always wanted one best back i owned
this is a great backpack that is well constructed it fits my # `` macbook pro perfectly and there is plenty of storage space for other stuff too i ordered this backpack and when it arrived a co-worker liked it so much then ordered one for themselves
love the bag - seems to be built well well , not great one of the straps has ripped at the stitching on top i am waiting to hear from swiss gear as to what they will do to repair it otherwise i will probably buy another when the time comes
this is a well made and nicely put together laptop bag ; unfortunately i was looking for one larger than my current dell laptop backpack and this one is n't i was looking for something to use as a carry-on when traveling to hold my laptop , a change of clothes or two , and my toiletries so this bag is n't going to be big enough it would be perfect for normal use though - for a student or as a work bag i 'll have to return this one for something larger , but would recommend for daily use or even for traveling if you only used it for your laptop , laptop accessories , and other electronics
i got the backup for my dell xps # ' # laptop , the backpack -lrb- black -rrb- is difficult to fit for # ' # + inch laptops , other than the product is good i would recommend for less than # ' # inch laptops
this backpack is perfect for traveling my # & # # ; laptop fits perfect there are plenty of pockets to store everything my only gripe is probably the front pocket , it is deep but hard to reach due to the small zipper opening over all it is comfortable and does the trick
to be honest , when i first bought this backpack , i was afraid that it would be too big , or heavy , or perhaps something else would not be fitting for me but now it seems to be a simply lovely backpack there 's enough room for my tablet pc to fit nice and snugly , along with about three other books and a binder it 's nice and comfortable , even with all of that weight inside there are many useful pockets , and it even looks nice from the outside
i have n't had much luck finding a backpack that could fit my laptop and # spiral notebooks but now i have many convenient pockets for other things as well i would like just a bit more padding on the straps , but other than that i am very happy with this product
this backpack is great for travel and makes everything feel very light i gave it a four because it is not very good for school and books but i made it work it really depends on what you plan to use it for overall strong and durable i would defiantly recommend this product to anyone looking for a quality backpack
the only thing i did n't like about it was the top handle being so wide makes it hard to hang on a hook otherwise , lots of space and sufficient padding
i have been trying to cut back on luggage pieces and the weight of carry-ons this pack has allowed me to comfortably carry my laptop and basic office materials onboard and stow it under the seat in front of me -lrb- hard luggage , such as computer cases , do n't always fit easily under the seat . this bag is large , not huge , and comfortable i have found it will fit across the back on my rolling carry-on luggage thereby <unk> me of having to always `` wear `` the pack it is bright and colorful it stands out in a crowd bright red and black i 'd buy this pack again
very comfortable and sufficient room with a lot of pockets/compartments the only issue i have is with the main zipper one side is longer than the other so that when it is zipped up all the way , one side gets folded over since there 's extra zipper on the one side this may be just an issue with mine since i was looking at someone else 's swiss backback -lrb- not this particular type though -rrb- and that was not an issue
good padding , well constructed sturdy and lightweight lot 's of pockets the only change i would make , and it 's not unique to this bag , is that the interior pockets and interior zipper pulls be <unk> colors to make digging through it much , much easier
nice , seemingly well made backpack i 've been using it for about # months and have n't had any of the zipper issues that some have mentioned in reviews my only issue with the backpack is that it 's not as large as i had anticipated it 's not small by any means -- it easily holds my macbook and has room for a few books and other materials however , i had hoped it would be big enough to fit a small amount of clothing into while i was traveling , to save space in my carry-on not the case but i got a pretty good deal on amazon -lrb- $ # -rrb- for the all black model all things taken into consideration , i 'm happy with the purchase
just received this computer backpack love the color the materials and stitching are first rate there is plenty of room for my dell latitude # `` widescreen laptop the pack is also roomy enough for power cables , mice , pens and a couple of books big thumbs up my only complaint - while the front pocket is deep -lrb- it goes past the red panel and all the way down to the bottom -rrb- , access to it is limited at best the zipper does not extend down the side of the pocket , only across the top for the price -lrb- $ # . # -rrb- this sucker is a steal
very beautiful and well-organized bag i like it very much the size is perfect for # inch laptop , but still a little larger and heavier for me however it is perfect for a boy
i really liked all the space in the laptop section for storing all the tech gear all it 's missing is an additional small zippered pouch on the front to hold small items needed quickly
do n't get me wrong , this is a great backpack i love the way it looks however , if you are in a major that requires you to carry larger than normal books , there is no way you can fit more than one book and a laptop in there
well , this backpack it 's just amazing , it fits my needs perfectly this backpack makes sure that your laptop is safe but there 's only a problem it 's kind of small you only can fit a laptop and probably a textbook with it aside from that the backpack is perfect , it has the look and the quality
this is a very strong bad every since i got it i 'm able to take more tools with me for my repair jobs this only con about it is that my # . # inch laptop fits very tightly and sometimes i have to take other things out to let my laptop in other than that it 's a good buy for the money
i love it although it took me a long time get it it has all the features others may not have but compare to my former bag , it 's a little bit heavy for me
item arrived quickly , and was as pictured great price as locally it costs $ # + more in stores lots of pockets and a padded area for my laptop very happy with my purchase
this bag is so nice it fits my # `` macbook pro easily and as well as enough of the essentials that short trips are so much better with this bag i do n't have to check bags when i take a short trip now , i can just take this on the plane with me the stitching is <unk> strong , even for swissgear it 's very roomy inside and yet is very comfortable strapped to your back i really liked the internal wire holes for listening to your mp # player while it can be protected form the elements the only slight complaint i would have and i have it for most all backpacks with a laptop slot is the padding always feels just a little on the light side it is n't an issue anymore now that i have a laptop sleeve , so i just put the mac in the sleeve and the whole thing in the backpack and all is good but all in all its a fantastic bag . worth the money for sure
great buy for me as a student and a professional fits my # . # vaio and # . # mac pro well has decent space and professional looks good for <unk> daily routine
the only complaint i have with this bag is that you ca n't fit many school books while your laptops in it the most you could fit -lrb- comfortably -rrb- is a couple medium sized textbooks and a four subject notebook other than that this backpack is great and like most swissgear products is made with high quality
i would have liked to have a open side pocket slit for documents , boarding passes , etc . , maybe in the back but i 'm really happy with my purchase
bought this for my husband who travels every week he is not the typical `` business man `` and wanted a backpack instead of an over the shoulder style laptop bag things fit well and pockets are adequate so far it is holding up , but we have only used it for a couple weeks color and workmanship appear great though
i 'm using this with my # `` macbook pro my laptop fits well and there 's plenty of padding , there 's also enough room for my ipad to fit i feel like it holds them securely while i 'm moving and there 's enough protection i have n't had any issue or seen any problems with the bag in the three weeks i 've had it there 's also plenty of room in the two other compartments for books or just about anything else you might need i like that you can adjust the size of the bag to keep everything from moving around
it took me a little while to find the right balance between a sturdy bag with enough room , that was both accesible in price but durable and not that bulky i 'm glad to say that this bag was all i was looking for , the price i paid was reasonable , the materials and craftsmanship are of good quality and the compartments are all but limited all in all i like the fact that a well-designed bag even offered two options in color -lrb- still do n't understand why the black bag was more expensive -rrb- , mine is red and it is simply stylish i was able to fit in - <unk> barely , my # -inch laptop kudos to me on this purchase : -rrb- <unk> :
i love all of the compartments but you ca n't stuff each to full capacity because you will reduce the capacity of others loads of features does n't have a firm base so it will lean forward if it 's not weighted down
i 'm taking # star away due to the zipper catching a little bit on one side otherwise this bag is great , light weight , and comfortable to carry plenty of room in most pockets . the far front -lrb- which has the pen holder <unk> -rrb- is a little snug regarding the # zipper catching , may have been the basis of it being a lightning deal
this has to easily be my best backpack i have ever purchased the build is solid and has so many compartments there is a laptop pocket as well the arm bands are very comfortable and if you are packing heavy weight into this backpack , the cushion inside the arm bands will definitively help you out
this is an excellent bag holds my # . # `` laptop comfortably and i can keep loads more things in addition the shoulder strap is comfortable and even a heavily loaded bag feels comfortable on shoulders my only complaint with this bag is that its bottom is not wide enough -lrb- as compared to the top -rrb- and hence tends to tip over to the front i would expect my bag to stay straight when i keep it down an excellent bag overall , none the less
i bought this bag for a crazy great price , so i am not complaining this is more of an <unk> review the bag is great , and has lots of pockets and plenty of room here is the disappointing part ; the bag i received appears to be a second one of the zippers , the main logo and and one pocket are all sewn on crooked none of these things affect the functionality of the bag , but they do decrease it 's aesthetic value again , for the price i got , it is still well worth the money but if you see these things one sale for crazy cheap , just know , there may be a reason still love the bag , though
i purchased this backpack for a high school student he selected this item for its <unk> , size , and comfort it is large enough to hold a laptop , # spiral <unk> , # -inch binders full of schoolwork , pencils , pens , and all other stuff teenagers carry after a week and a half of use , one of the straps tore off from the pack at the top amazon customer service was very helpful in sending out a replacement and providing return instructions the replacement backpack arrived in # days he 's had the replacement for # weeks now and he is happy with it . style , size and comfort : # <unk> : # <unk> : # <unk> sa # computer backpack -lrb- <unk> gray
well made , but a smaller than it looks in the photos my laptop barely fit and pushed at the seams when zippered i will use it for one of my kids for school instead
this is a pretty good back pack i would say my one issue with it is the zipper of the main compartment is curved and hard to zip if the bag is full
this backpack is fantastic it is very comfortable and has plenty of storage i went from a laptop bag , leather large <unk> , and it was a bear to wear in and out of work every day with this backpack , life is so much easier i just had yesterday , but i 've fallen in love now , for the price you do not know if $ # or $ # is reasonable for a backpack but if ever there was one that i approve of your pay that much for , it 's this one i am very happy so far
i bought this bag for my father , who uses a <unk> to get around he needed to store his notebook as well as paper work , `` manly things `` , and odds & ends i was concerned about whether his notebook would fit as the bag size is not listed , but i did n't have to his notebook fit perfectly inside and is well protected the straps fit snugly on his shoulders and the combined weight is n't too heavy for him at all he was very impressed with how stylish it was
this is the quality you 'd expect from a swissgear bag only thing of note is that the gray color is a bit darker in person than it appears in these pictures - i was expecting it to be much lighter than it turned out to be
this is a great bag to carry your laptop and files to office a quality bag for the cost only dislike is that the bag has smaller compartments and that make it not suitable for international travel otherwise it is a great bag with good looks
i bought this to replace the laptop shoulder bag my latitude d # came with i 'm glad i made the switch the backpack is very comfortable to carry it holds the laptop and cables , as well as extra stuff in the two other pockets the only thing that 's missing in my mind is the lack of a document section , in which to carry papers , folders , etc .
i was needing a replacement backpack that could hold my laptop & a lot of it 's gear i found it in the swissgear backpack plenty of room for my laptop , cables , wireless mouse , & external hd it 's sturdy , lightweight , comfortable & looks great i have gotten a lot compliments on it i am <unk> & even when it 's full of my computer stuff , there is room for my <unk> care kit the right strap has a pocket for a small folding cell ph & the left has a place to hang your sunglasses the # side pockets can each hold a # oz . drink it is used daily & it 's capacity meets my needs wonderfully
this is a multi functional bag i take it to gym for trekking even for my swimming love the media socket makes it easier to keep device safe bag has so many compartments ; it makes it perfect for organizing stuff when travelling quality is reallly good for $ # price tag i am definitely recommending to my friends
- excellent shoulder straps - very comfortable to carry - lots of storage areas for different items - padded sleeve for laptop - # ml water bottle fits in the side mesh <unk> - front pocket has storage for pens , and other small items , but is very deep but has only a narrow <unk> - a great backpack for the price which looks ok with a suit and carries everything i need including my gym
i purchased the backpack for my personal use but it happened to be a little smaller than i expected . you can not fix your standard # in ' notebooks in this bag but anything else fits perfectly i loved the design , the colors , and most importantly the comfort and durability that is offered by swiss gear products i would definitely recommend this item
the first backpack i received had a hole in the pocket i filed for a return through amazon and the next day had the replacement pack with free shipping and free ups postage to return the original this backpack is comfortable and has an enormous amount of space between it 's two main pockets my # `` laptop fits nicely and is secure i have n't had any problem accessing the front organizer pocket for the # $ sale this is a decent backpack biggest drawback are the too small mesh pockets on the side for water bottles does n't fit anything over # oz unless it 's tall
# stars because it 's a great backpack but if you have a student who is in the habit of carrying all their books , this is nowhere near big enough i could only fit about half of his books into it
the bag serves its purpose well the only reason i gave it four stars instead of five is the depth of the front zipper pouch makes it hard to get things when the rest of the bag is loaded for the price paid , i would recommend this bag for commuter travel -lrb- btw , it has a very <unk> feel to it ... it 's quite fun .
this is a nice item , as described however , it barely fits my # . # & # # ; dell xps laptop it does , but i have to try and zip it fits a couple of books too and there are a lot of pockets feels nice on my back still , spending some seconds every time i try to zip it up <unk> my laptop in it , is a little annoying perfect for smaller or thinner laptops , maybe even # . # & # # ; would be okay
great electronics bag plenty of smaller pockets to hold miscellaneous stuff -lrb- cables , usb drives , memory cards , coins , earbuds , etc -rrb- poor storage bag though , not enough room for a change of clothes -lrb- certainly not useful as a single carry-on for short travels -rrb- other than the two main compartments , it 's difficult to reach into the pockets due to small openings and short zippers the second largest compartment also allows items so settle to the bottom and behind the main laptop compartment meaning small items get lost at the very bottom and back of the bag small <unk> settle there and could be damaged from the weight of the computer storage compartment or any shock -lrb- dropping , etc -rrb- since its at the very bottom of the bag
it 's a backpack . . comfortable on my back holds my # . # & # # ; laptop in well with an elastic strap that velcros shut two netted compartments keep the essentials from bouncing around , and it seems to breathe well while strapped on my back oh - and both sides nicely fit # oz energy drink cans although i 've only tried them with <unk> energy drink brand cans , i ca n't imagine the monster energy drink brand cans will have trouble just do n't mix them , you 'll have a <unk> on your back
my son asked for a computer backpack and this is the won he chose he is a very <unk> shopper and <unk> everthing about what he buys , so i 'm sure he will love this
good backpack for carrying my laptop and associated peripherals like power cord and cordless mouse also has good pocket for ipod and space for a couple notebooks or binders some people were mad because they could n't fit their college book library into it and <unk> gave it a bad review heavily stitched and strong zippers and nicely padded back and straps as well as laptop compartment my macbook fits perfectly
got this for my wife for christmas she really likes it a lot had a cheap one before that came apart after # months hope this one holds up better
got this on gold box deal i previously had an older swiss gear backpack so i knew i already liked them fits my # & # # ; macbook pro perfectly some reviews say it does n't but it does for mine i really like how the compartments are set up would definitely recommend
pros : this thing is made with great material , and has all the compartments i need i really enjoy the straps which can compact the bag when it 's only half full -lrb- i drive a motorcycle , and it makes all the difference to not have big <unk> pack <unk> around in the wind -rrb- cons : it does not fit a # `` laptop -lrb- well , it does , but you have to stretch the material a bit too much to get it in there -rrb-
great size , fits my # . x laptop plus much more very stylish , nice colors only improvement could be to make the cell phone pocket bigger it would fit a standard old school cell phone , but most smart phones are too big for it fortunately though , there are many other handy pockets to use for the phone
very good backpack by far the best backpack i have ever bought probably can fit laptop , two books , and # # ring binders on the main pocket middle pocket fits a small text book and other things front pocket fits about # calculators and many other small things <unk> very good on your <unk> <unk> pockets # . # & # # ; laptop <unk> one con for <unk> pocket zipper makes it hard to reach things on <unk> only been having this backpack for a week bought it for college and so far so good i would definitely recommend this backpack to anyone
it is a perfect laptop bag looks extremely sturdy and nicely built after a long time i have seen a value for money laptop bag it may be a bit <unk> for a # `` laptop but otherwise it is excellent for carrying a laptop on long <unk> as well for day to day
it is a quality backpack i paid under fifty dollars and frankly it 's worth # times that if you 're going to spend your hard earned money , get quality this is a quality item i could n't recommend it more
it is a great backpack it says it is waterproof , and it is on the top and sides , but not the bottom we were caught in rain and nothing inside the backpack got wet , but we sat the backpack down <unk> , and found out the <unk> that the bottom is n't waterproof other than that , it 's a great backpack
great brand , material and <unk> , has lots of pockets , great quality and cushion i am using this for school and i had a previous swissgear backpack for more than # years , i have no doubts about buying from the same brand at anytime i know i will not be
i liked the item it is perfect what i expected bag is spacious though it is laptop bag i could not expect more seriously value for money and that too with good brand
it 's really amazing i used to carry two laptops sometimes one of my personal and another is for office apart form these two there are still lots of space to accommodate my books and all its soft back pads do let me to carry it for longer duration also i really like it very much
i bought this bag a couple of years ago it 's still like new i use it every day travel with it fill it with lots of heavy stuff and it 's not even close to worn out
