terrific bag , stylish , lots of space and durable but the exterior stains your clothes as you carry it on your shoulder i am going to oil the bag in hopes of sealing the leather and preventing any future leather staining
this bag was just as advertised great looking and very well made with all the pocket space , i ca n't run out of room a large laptop fits i was most concerned with the shoulder strap and bag hooks , but they too are very sturdy and well made worth the price as this will be a long lasting and my last briefcase
i just ca n't explain how simple yet elegant this bag is no giant logos everywhere , just a beautiful and well made piece of craftsmanship as stated in another review it is much lighter than the pictures show but i know it will <unk> with use looking forward to using this bag for a long time , and the smell of the genuine leather is <unk>
i love this bag i get compliments all the time from men and women -lrb- i am female -rrb- i work in med sales and this holds my ipad , laptop , and paperwork when i need it to it has great compartments for filing paperwork , and extra pockets for business cards and other items the quality of the leather is great , and it comes with a worn , sturdy high quality leather look to it only gripe though minor is that the top flap of the bag is reinforced with cardboard ? between the leather and does not remain straight i love this bag
this bag looks awesome in person the leather is sturdy and slightly worn , which makes it look great from day one unfortunately , i had to return it because it was too small for my gaming laptop , but if they made the same bag in a larger size , i 'd buy it
the styling is great i am <unk> from a backpack style laptop bag to this first of all , space is tight . ipad , laptop & cords will fill up this bag fast my backpack could take all that plus a good chunk of files and additional cords the shoulder strap is good , but not heavily padded if you want a basic bag to hold one or two devices and a few sheets of paper -lrb- not lots of folders -rrb- , then this is a great choice getting things in and out of the laptop area is a bit tight in the airport line , i had a few dirty looks because the laptop and ipad got stuck the main zipper got stuck once , but hopefully that was just a fluke and not a sign of poor <unk> overall , this should last me a few years
i knew before getting this brilliant <unk> that there would be staining involved , but opted to purchase it regardless because of its attractiveness it 's been several months , and i use the bag much less often than i otherwise would ; the staining , while <unk> , is a bear to get out of clothes whatever the <unk> is that 's causing the staining , it ca n't be in <unk> supply , and i look forward to it being <unk> i 'll use the bag nonstop , then
i bought this bag as a gift for my brother-in-law when it came in the mail i could n't believe that i did n't have one for myself the quality of the bag is nicer than anything i 've ever owned myself for those reviews that complain about the staining of the leather , that 's what stained leather does it will only take a little time to break it in until then , you might want to wear dark clothing when you take the bag out with you the bag makes for a great gift i 'm planning on buying one for myself
it does n't fit my macbook air # & # # ; at all the sides are exposed , the cover is very <unk> , the stitching is very off and ugly , the mouse key is extremely cut wrong
item description and what it fit were two different things i searched specifically for # inch macbook pro case and it gave me this , which apparently only fits the macbook air now i have to pay to return it thanks for nothing
good case , cheaper matte feeling material unlike i had expected and there was a folded crease in the material but i think overall it will be a good case for my expensive
i wanted a good looking cover for my # . # xps dell ultrabook and looked at this one and i took a chance love the way it looks and it fits my ultrabook very good might be a hair large , but i ca n't tell you how much i like it very good quality , at a great price
i am really enjoying the laptop cover and it is pretty nice , flashy , and handy i really like that it has cushion all around to protect the laptop from bumps and scratches
fits my brand new # mac air to a t and does a good job of protecting it from scratches and perhaps minor drops the only thing is the snap on tab which gets in the way at first -lrb- as one other reviewer mentioned -rrb- but should get used to it after an hour or so of typing overall , it 's a great value and comparable to similar items that are more expensive note : i read some reviews about overheating since this cover has no type of ventilation built in unlike some other covers . i have yet to experience this and will <unk> updates if appropriate update : i have been using the case nonstop since i bought it in august and have to say have had no problems with my laptop overheating
i love this case it has totally <unk> up my laptop and now i feel safer <unk> it around the only issue i have , is that it makes the laptop much heavier than it usually is but as i said earlier , the plus side is good protection
i feel like i am carrying around a portfolio and not a laptop the only bad thing is at the corners of the screen where the straps go , it covers up a little bit of the screen , but it is something that you can tolerate
overall great product and looks really nice -lrb- i have the black one -rrb- if they could somehow fix the magnetic strap so it was n't in the way of the mouse pad i would give it the full # stars
i bought it for protection and the ability to camouflage my laptop and it does both very well the material feels great and looks very appealing the only drawback is the step that hangs out in front when open i fix it by tucking it under
i love the feeling of it , the price and how it protects my computer the only reason i did not give it # stars is because i can not use the computer for long periods of time because it gets very hot inside this sleeve everything else is perfect , great product for a great price
i like my pink leather case the color is perfect pink the reason i gave it less one star , was because the snap is kind of in the way of me using the pad but once it <unk> i do n't have a problem other than that i am very pleased
this case perfectly fits my # -inch macbook air it looks cute , makes my macbook easier to carry without slipping , and i can still easily use all aspects of it with the cover on
this item came right on time also a lot of effort was put in its packaging to make sure it was n't damaged that was thoughtful this item fits nice and snug and is the basic amount of protection i wanted looks neat too im happy with it for the price
item is well made and looks great i purchased this thinking that it would fit my # & # # ; macbook pro that does not have a retina screen but , it does n't fit the macbook pro with retina screen is much thinner than the ones without please bare that in mind while purchasing
i was buying plastic cases , but they were always breaking i decided to go with this one because it looks very nice and it protects the top and bottom of it i get so many compliments on it i love it
sturdy , well made , great quality love it and would definitely buy another one just like it makes it easy to cart around and not worry about scratching or denting it
it actually protects very well as i dropped my laptop numerous times and thank god the cover protected it and i did n't have a problem i love the beautiful color too i liked it so much i purchased one for my son in black
it is a nice case to protect your computer fits like a glove and comfortable to the touch easy to put on and take off , if you need to do so hope you enjoy as much as i have this is a great cover
as other mentioned , and as it shown in pictures , the cover will not protect your mac especially its corner since it is exposed so if you are looking for something for protection in case you drop , this might not be what you are looking for but i purchased this product because it looks nice . and it is nice i like it and my friends like it too
the clear case had scratches within a week of putting it on my computer i do n't do anything crazy with it , just sits in my empty backpack while carrying it to class within # months , pieces had snapped off for the price , i expected much higher quality , and i was extremely disappointed you could find a similar quality macbook case for half the cost
i have looked all over trying to find a case for my new macbook pro with retina and i could n't find one that looked like a perfect fit for it most i have seen look like they cover up the speakers and in the side view photos it is not the same set up as my laptop i was willing to pay more for a quality product because i just spent $ # for this computer but just could n't find one i decided to give this one a try because i have had the laptop for a couple of weeks and really wanted to get some protection on it well i just got home and opened it up i <unk> away one edge of the plastic <unk> and the rubber foot in that corner fell out i do n't imagine the other ones would stay on much longer it also looks and feels like a cheap plastic dollar store item it is going back tomorrow this product does fit the laptop so it may be ok for some but i need a more professional look and feel to it
i have owned the speck case for over a year and it has absolutely destroyed the finish on my macbook i am a daily user of my computer and it rides along with me in my book bag over time small particles get between the case and the computer and create small scratches and <unk> where sand or dirt gets my bookbag is pretty clean so i have no idea how it built up over time and ruined the finish on my macbook the case does fit great but if you 're a student avoid at all costs or if you like the aluminum finish on the top and bottom of your macbook also the clear becomes foggy over time i would opt for something like a book book that offers more protection
this does n't fit the best and has pretty rough edges i am thinking i just got a <unk> case because i have always had really good luck with speck products but unfortunately this gets # stars from me i hate to do it , but i am honest and want to make sure you are aware not very good quality on this one the last speck laptop case i had snapped on and fit great this one you can barely tell if it is snapped on or not : -
very hard to put on and hard to remove yet , they advise to remove and clean every few months if you remove it , more than likely a part will break would not recommend
this is for a # & # # ; macbook pro however it does n't fit it is a fraction of an inch off if i try to put it on , it will break i will have to return it
the two corners of the lower case disappeared in two weeks now it 's not sticked with it well and the upper case is not easy to wear also plus , do n't buy a light color , because the dust inside the shell would drive you crazy ! !
the case was n't as big as i expected it to be and did n't even fit my lap top i bought what i was told to be the right size i returned and did get my money back
this cover i have received has rough edges they are so bad that it can cut your fingers not sure how this product has not gone through quality check it fits perfectly , i am going to order this again and see if i can get a better one
the macbook pro -lrb- with retina display -rrb- is a very lightweight laptop , which i love however , this case made it much heavier i hear the speck <unk> case is much lighter
this is a very sturdy case , but i have a couple issues with it the first issue is the weight and size it turns my # & # # ; retina into a regular # & # # ; macbook pro but what else can you expect from a case , it will definitely do it 's job however this is not the reason i gave it only # stars i ordered the clear case , and one of the rubber feet looks like it was for the yellow case it looks like i got a very old foot , that is extremely discolored , and is visually very unappealing luckily i do n't have to look at it , but i 'm a bit ocd and just knowing it 's there makes me uneasy
looks good on my mac and it 's not too bulky either however , like everyone complained , the two corners at the back of the bottom cover is so weak that you have to be very careful putting it on , otherwise they will just snap i am worried they will break off eventually because they are designed to do so until then i shall <unk> them and think hard about what i would want to do when they snap
speck almost got it right for macbook pro retina # `` unfortunately , the bottom case piece has a sharp lip that your palms run over while using the keyboard i decided to correct the manufacturing defect myself by sanding off the front edge by a few thousands and now its fine had i not picked this up as a `` open item `` , i would not have fixed the problem but rather returned it so , best results will be with a block <unk> using # grit paper and making sure to round out the outside edge of the lower case that your palms will run over
this is the fourth speck hard shell case we have purchased for various mbp 's my rating on the others would have been # stars i took one star away because , on the new , thinner # & # # ; mbp with retina display , the speck case <unk> slightly on the bottom this makes for discomfort to one 's wrists when keyboarding for long stretches at a time otherwise , it 's perfect
i got the raspberry color for my # & # # ; macbook pro retina it fits perfectly , and it 's very easy to snap on just make sure both the case and the computer are completely clean so you do n't have <unk> stuck in there it 's very difficult to remove the only other con i 've noticed is that the computer heats up a lot more with it on i 've only had it for a few days so far though , so i ca n't speak for its durability
i saw this same cover -lrb- but clear -rrb- at the apple store for $ # . # i had just bought the macbook pro from them and i show the staff at the store the cover on the amazon page and asked if they would price match it they said no anyway the case is very nice , it protects the top and the bottom of the mac and all the ports are accessible it is easy to put on the macbook but is more harder to take off and it makes the macbook a little more heavier but not by that much this cover is transparent so the apple logo is visible and make the mac look like it is actually the color of the cover
i love speck products when it comes to protecting my laptop they are sleek without being bulky looking my only complaint is the corners are not durable at all this is my second purchase and the corners on the bottom shell have snapped in the matter of # months it does not affect the shell staying on , but for the price that is a issued that needs to be fixed other than that i still recommend it just do n't be surprised if # corner falls off
case clips on like any other case and has open areas for all ports on the macbook i can <unk> usb 's and the magsafe power adapter with no problem one downfall is that dust and other particles are very visible because of the shiny finish on the case it is also thicker than i was expecting
i just got it and on first impressions , i love it i had a satin case before but the hinges broke off and so it was time for a new one it fits perfectly after forcing some of the hinges on which is why i gave it # instead of # stars it looks and feels like quality
ive had it on my macbook for a few weeks and it works well i would recomend speck covers for computers i also made the mistake of ordering the wrong cover but was able to ship it back , no charge , for this replacement thank you amazon only only problem . - is anything made in the usa
i love this case and i 'm still using it . the good thing about this case is that it wont get scratched , its perfectly made and it makes my mac looks better the only thing i hate about this case is that it gets dirty very fast and i have to clean it daily or twice a day some times ... which is n't a problem for me
good product overall , but in just two weeks the product has scratched extremely easily it adds a little bit of weight to my mac , but it is well worth it hopefully the scratching was just a & # # ; breaking in & # # ; and the product will last for a long while
overall , the case is pretty good it fits my late # & # # ; retina macbook pro it will clearly protect it and allows me to retain the sleek silver look of the rmbp it was difficult to get on but now it fits perfectly easier to take off after a few times i 'd recommend it to anyone seeking protection for their rmbp
after i put this case onto my macbook pro , it really shocked me the case fits the laptop really well and what i like most is the color , the dark blue one is really stunning the reflection on the case makes it just gorgeous however , the case is not <unk> but it is still a great case that u can find on the market
love this clear case it does add some weight , but im ok with it it has protected me so many times from little bumps or nicks that i would otherwise have a scratched up looking laptop by now i like the clear one because it looks like nothing is there i managed to keep the top of the case scratch free , but the base is pretty scratched up and that is just from setting it down on desks
i initially bought a kuzy cover for my macbook pro retina do n't waste your time with the kuzy cases the speck case is # % better it is thicker , sturdier and mounts with a tight fit both top and bottom they also provide a better protection for your macbook
i love the look of the speck cases , i think they add a nice touch i am quite certain the case wo n't last forever , and after a month there is already a small crack in the display portion -lrb- upper corner -rrb- the part that protects the rear lower corners will probably break off if you accidentally drop your computer , but this beats scratching up the case of the computer
i love this speck macbook pro case this red color is so pretty , way prettier than i thought it protects my laptop well , and does n't look thick at all which is the part i like the most
it is very good item to <unk> my note book and i like it very much , i will to buy it again if i have another note book in ther
i went to get the new macbook pro # inch at apple today they said it would n't work with the new laptop because it got thinner i called speck and they said they tested it and it works i got both the case and the new retina macbook pro # inch and it fits like glove glad i bought it i will update later once i 've had this case for few months
i have a speck for my iphone and of all the cases i have had , it is the most protective and durable so getting the macbook case was simply logical great product , will keep my macbook fresh for years to come
i love the case i have had speck products before and i was not disappointed with this purchase i would recommend buying a speck case for your mac pro or air i have friends who have purchased cheaper after market cases and have had to replace them # or # times already , but my case is still going strong and looks great i love the salmon color , its not to orange and not to pink i got the case for less then half the price due to it being an open box item and was pleased it came in the original packaging and not opened
i updated my old macbook pro to the new macbook pro with retina display as usual , i could n't stand the metallic feeling of macbook surface and bought this new version of speck hardcover like the previous version , this new version -lrb- works for the thinner macbook pro -rrb- fits into this model of macbook perfectly and i 'm loving it a little surprise compared to the previous model is that this version is shinier and has more a plastic look and feel -lrb- the previous model feels like a high-quality rubber -rrb- as a result , this new model looks & # # ; cheaper & # # ; when i opened the shipping box however , after i put them onto the macbook , it looks elegant and pretty cool
save money and protect your retina investment with this cool clear case that perfectly fits the macbook pro all edges are protected easy on off fitment and you save over $ # from the apple store w free shipping
and of course it had scratches but hello that 's what was going to happen anyways i love that i can just use this case instead of a <unk> zipping one
speck products are very costly , but this one is a good deal half of original price but the same high quality is what i needed the shell itself is easy to snap on and it stays on its place came very fast , too
i am reviewing this after a couple months of use and i can say that this case holds up great the transparency shows off the beauty of my macbook pro the most important part is that the case fits perfectly meaning plugging in any externals wo n't be a problem like i had with my last case
bought this and i 'm glad i did drop it once on accident while pulling out of my bag just barely a scratch on the cover and no problems whatsoever plus it 's great for decals if you plan on selling your macbook later
the product arrived on time and without a scratch it fits my mbp retina perfectly and looks so beautiful ! ! the only thing i must say is that it does add a <unk> bit of weight to the mbp retina , but it does n't bother me at all it also tends to heat up a bit , but after a few minutes it cools down again
i had one of these on my previous mbp and this one fits the same quality and fit as the last one i will always recommend speck products to anyone who owns any apple device
adds great look with little weight and my protection - love it i highly reccomended for anyone looking for clear cover and to add nice touch to your mac book pro
ordered another color from these guys because i was so impressed with this one this case doesnt take from the stylish look of the mbp at all , in fact , it adds to it it is very well thought out design and feels like something you 'd wrap your expensive macbook in . # out of # would recommend to anyone with a retina macbook pro
the first thing i bought for me new macbook # & # # ; retina was this it was pretty easy to snap into place and boy does it look great but not only does it look great , it feels very well built i was a little concerned about heat and that has not been a problem at all i would highly recommend this to anyone wanting protection that looks and feel good and does n't create any noticeable extra weight or even presence
i bought this for my new mac book pro it looks great and protects it - you can see the apple through it when it lights up so that looks sweet - it keeps the scratched off of your mac book - yes the case shows a little bit of scratches and finger prints but if you <unk> it down every once and a while it looks fine - would i recommend it yes , because it protects my computer and looks cool , what more do you want
i was looking for a protective case for my new macbook pro with retina display this see-through case fits perfectly and enables me to retain the original look of the laptop i only wish i bought the speck case before getting a couple of nicks on my laptop
just got a new macbook pro retina and i could n't order this fast enough i have purchased # other covers from speck for my other macbooks and i love them they look great , fit great and are easy to get on and stay on to protect my investment i would highly recommend this product to anyone who cares about their things the way i do thank you to speck for making such a reliable and beautiful case
great , simple product goes on easily , does not mar the finish on my mbp , comes off relatively easily to clear out the little particles that do get between it and the case thick enough to protect my computer and will not crack easily , thin enough to be tolerable in its added weight worth the price
purchased the clear and it fits perfectly i watched a video on youtube on the proper way to install it correctly it was very easy i 'm glad i decided to order speck and glad that the price was reasonable on amazon
this bag does exactly what everki provides in the product specifications . compared tumi t-pass and briggs & riley @ work i choose everki versa the bag is well constructed , the peripheral storage is well laid out this is a serious mobile work station bag and the storage sleeve for the device is sized appropriately well done and the price was well within my opportunity cost
after receiving my macbook pro , i was thrilled to receive a case in one of my favorite colors after opening the package , i was immediately disappointed in the product though the texture was very glossy and seemed resistant to damage , the case scratch multiple times over a <unk> time period after trying to remove the case from my computer , it snapped in three separate places a similar event occurred with a few of my friends i would not suggest purchasing this case or any case from topcase
i 've only had this case for a month , and it has already cracked and broke like the other reviews the top scratched easily , i will not purchase this product again
the color is amazing , exactly how it looks in pictures fits perfectly , the only problem comes around when you need to take the case off i literally ca n't get it off
bought this for my macbook pro . keeps it clean and scratch free , but i do n't use the keypad cover it was dirty when it came in the mail like someone with dirty shoes walked across it -lrb- i eventually threw it out -rrb- hard shell case is great though
i absolutely love this case the color is very true to description and case fits my macbook pro perfectly only con is the case has poor ventilation and macbook tends to get very hot
snaps on great and looks awesome the only thing i had a problem with is the fact that the corners of my bottom cover is cracked and there are missing pieces because of the cracks i do n't know <unk> its cracking i take really good care of my computer and do n't remember hitting the corners , so i do n't understand why they are breaking but overall a great price and well worth it
it is not at all sheer like in the photo the photo that shows the apple when computer is closed must be fake i received mine with black smudges in the plastic it is very noisy when you open your computer and very thick and heavy compared to other cases do n't waste your money
if i could give it half a star or no star rating at all i would this case came to me with the strong scent of paint or other toxic smell what ever thing is it was not worth the amount i paid for the cover the case the keyboard cover and the screen protector the case broke , the sleeve was flimsy , the keyboard cover made typing very difficult and the screen protector was bent so i couldnt even use it you suck top case
i 've had the case for # months and it is completely torn up and ripped it gets dirty quickly and it feels very cheap i would recommend this for children who tear things up easily
i love the sleeve but the case was not see thru like i thought it would be and i had gotten a sticker too so have n't used it yet also the keyboard rubber is hard to get used to
# because the sleeve came broken i had to sew a part of it back together and it also looked used but the shell came in perfect condition and i love the color the keyboard cover takes some time to adjust to i 'm just disappointed with the sleeve . :
it fits perfectly with my # inch macbook pro the only thing i did n't not like was the screen protector , i had a very hard time getting it on and eventually gave up
i loved this product and the colors ! ! i would recommend this product to everyone also the light from the keyboard shows up underneath the rubber keyboard cover the mac cover is great and adds appearance the sleeve is great and the smell people talk about went away very fast the screen protector was easy to use and the price was worth it
i totally love it ! ! arrived super quick and in good condition color is amazing and cover fit perfect sleeve was a little stinky but nothing big definitely going to order another one in a different color
absolutely lovely color it is so <unk> and feels so smooth just note that the case is matte and not glossy or transparent i 'm not crazy about the carrying case -lrb- no zipper or pockets -rrb- , and color is light , but it 's accurate overall , very good deal
this pack of : hard case , soft carrier case , keyboard protector and screen protector are both cute accessories and great protection for a # & # # ; macbook pro super cheap for what you get and i received it right away the color is very true to what the picture depicts and i 've gotten compliments on how unique and beautiful the color is
i rate this product a # star i am beyond satisfied with my purchase not only does it protect my computer , but it also has a new customized look rubberized case feels and looks great , along with the keypad cover the bag was also a great deal and has a nice material if your looking for a great bundle for a great price and fast shipping , i highly recommend this product purchased the bundle on march # , the item was shipped out on the same day and i received the product on march # , again super happy with my purchase -lrb- : thank you
the price for this was excellent for the quality i get so many compliments on it and they want to know where i bought it i get the most compliments on the keyboard protector the screen cover was too tricky to put on , only because i 've always had trouble with screen covers i also found that it could be reversible , it would be black on the outside with turquoise stitching
i ordered a case and it worked well for about # weeks before the zipper broke in two places it said there was a <unk> warranty and i 've contacted customer service through their website and facebook page , but have received no response -lrb- for another # weeks -rrb- do not by this case customer service is horrible
i got this case to protect my late # & # # ; macbook pro , it works as advertised but it 's not a snug fit , the case is too thick to really hold the macbook pro well i 'm getting a hard snap on cover as additional protection , with this it 'll fit perfect in the mean time i 've been just putting a magazine on top of the computer in the case to make sure it does n't move around in the case
this really does the job . i lug my laptop everywhere . it is one of my most valuable <unk> , and this keeps it safe in my shoulder bag . i dont have to worry about any damage used for around # year now - zero problems
i only had this case for a few months before pieces of it started chipping off i am very careful with my computer and use a sleeve when transporting it , so there 's no reason for the case to have been falling apart
one of the key aspects of a good computer case is that is covers the computer and stays there unfortunately , the bottom half of this case does n't cover the back edge of the computer and so has a tendency to fall off , which totally defeats the purpose also , i 've had this case for a couple months , and it 's now cracked and chipped in a few places from just regular use i bought this case because i loved the color , but i also expected it to work do yourself a favor and pay a little bit more for a better quality product
