meh , somehow the color looks worse in person , though i ca n't say it really differs when i look at it next to the picture on my screen it 's a little bit ugly but it dose the job
i needed a simple <unk> to protect my tablet , this was a great inexpensive choice i got it slightly larger in order for the cord to fit in as well love the color , it is not really a neon green like i thought from the photo softer apple green
the computer store said i would not find a sleeve for my new , small ultrabook they were so wrong this is perfect and the color means i 'll never leave it somewhere
this case is decently constructed and seems like it will last a long time that 's almost unfortunate , since the padding is flimsy that i do n't think it will provide any significant protection i 'll be shopping for something with higher density neoprene
but it fits my macbook air well , and the velcro is strong feels like the case would protect the surface of the computer from scratches , but i would n't want to drop it not very padded at all
fits a lenovo twist -lrb- # . # `` x # . # `` x # . # `` -rrb- <unk> `` neoprene `` , more like low density foam with a synthetic fabric stitched over it some of the velcro stitching is already blowing out i would advise spending more on a quality product , unless funds are tight and you only require light protection
i ordered this in addition to a speck hard case for my # -inch macbook pro i wanted something that i could put my laptop into to keep it safe when it is in my backpack for the money -lrb- i purchased it for $ # -rrb- , it was definitely worth it it fits the mbp perfectly , even with the additional bulk with the speck hard case my only complaint is that it does n't seem like the padding is quite thick enough it will definitely do the job for now , but i can see myself buying a thicker sleeve in the future
this sleeve is exactly what i wanted i feel my macbook is well protected in this case the velcro enclosure is well made if you want a nice , plain sleeve that does the job well for a great price then buy this item
exactly what i wanted fits my # . # & # # ; acer timelinex perfectly foam might be a little thin but i use it to keep my laptop in my bag without having it rub against my books and it works great for what i use it for
it was n't what i expected some reviewers said that it could fit an asus gaming laptop -lrb- # . # inch screen , # inch thick -rrb- , but mine did n't fit at all besides , <unk> material stinks
it fits and does what it should down graded because of really <unk> delivery that i did not learn about until a day after ordering i really wish amazon would be more upfront with delivery times from third parties and allow you to adjust them according to your need for item at a specific time had i known it would taken over two weeks for delivery , i would have adjusted the shipping option
i gave this laptop sleeve only # stars because while it does it 's job , it 's huge i have a # . # & # # ; widescreen laptop and after putting my laptop in this sleeve , i could probably add a second laptop into the sleeve and still have room it will keep my laptop <unk> free while i 'm not using it , but i 'll probably still look for something else for when i travel with my laptop
my computer is a fujitsu # . # & # # ; the positive thing is that the sleeve is big enough to fit my big notebook and the sleeve is beautiful the negative point is that the sleeve is very thin , so i am not sure if this protect from damage , i do n't think so i think it 's able to protect against the scratch and nothing else
the design of this sleeve is perfect -lrb- except for the size -rrb- the velcro enclosure is well made and holds tight the outside of the case is a <unk> fabric and the density of the material is kind of light meaning that this sleeve does not have any ability to protect from any drop damage this `` sleeve `` is described to fit a # . # `` laptop and it is way too big for that size i have a brand new pavilion dv # laptop with a # . # `` display and there was at least # inches of space on the sides of this sleeve the sleeve left enough room inside that i was afraid the lid would be able to open if jostled around enough , leaving a greater chance for damage to the screen and hinges
it 's a laptop bag it 's soft it holds my # & # # ; laptop i would n't want to drop my laptop while it was in this bag it 's not strong enough to protect it , but it is good at keeping your laptop from getting scratched and dinged while just carrying it around i actually put my laptop in this , and then put this inside of a backpack ... it works fine for that
way too baggy for my # & # # ; toshiba laptop it covers it , but offers no protection as far as padding or protection from moisture going to see if i can maybe sew it and make it tighter around my laptop
minus the <unk> : - -rrb- in other words very light spongey material that <unk> and constructed well , is hardly worth the effort to use to protect a # lb <unk> blunt force i 'll probably inserts my own sheets of protection , as there is room
i do n't know why i did n't believe the other reviews , but this sleeve is far too big i measured my laptop before ordering , just to be sure there 's about # extra inches horizontally and vertically
i bought this to use in a rolling bag i bought for taking my # . # & # # ; laptop through the airport carry it on my shoulder was killing me and i refused to pay a fortune for a dedicated rolling laptop case and most were too big for a rolling office situation i bought this sleeve to protect the laptop in the non laptop case looks as advertised
the case fits my # `` dell just fine and closes securely with the velcro flap the cover is very light and thin ; it probably wo n't provide much protection for a laptop in the event of a drop on a hard surface though the laptop fits fine in the case , there are no storage places for cord or mouse i do n't anticipate using this cosmos case more than five times a year , so it suits my needs those who frequently travel with their laptops might want to upgrade to a heavier case with more protection and some storage update - on a trip i took my laptop and in this case could fit the laptop , the power cord , and my mouse it ends up being a little lumpy , but it works
i am using this on my acer aspire # g the case is big it could probably fit an # inch laptop i was hoping for something more tight fitting however , for the price , this will do
works great for my # . # & # # ; laptop construction is sound - no fraying edges or loose threads i feel , though , that the material wo n't take much abuse like abrasion - everyday wear from removing it from my backpack but we 'll see
i bought this sleeve to protect my laptop while travelling on vacation it does the job and my # `` dell fits perfectly do n't know if it would be enough for <unk> use and has no carry straps it 's a good value for my purposes
does exactly what i need it to do - protects my laptop however , the velcro is not secured very well and the sticky <unk> that holds it to the fabric came off so i ca n't close the case properly
i purchased this for a new computer i purchased it 's just enough padding to enable you to carry inside a large tote bag , not big enough to include power supply if you 're looking for lightweight padding protection , this product will do if you 're looking for heavy duty protection , this is not it
fits my # . # & # # ; hp pavilion g # dx perfectly seems well made , with quality velcro , which i hope will last i use inside backpack for added protection when i set the bag down on solid surfaces
i have a dell inspiron # r and an asus rog # . # inch laptop and wanted something large enough to put them in when not using to keep dust , etc off after looking into several items decided to give this sleeve a try and am very glad i did - bought two of them and the fit is great for both and it does just what i need it to
for the true purpose of the the sleeve its just right i 've not had it long enough to attest to its durability , but it feels like it should last a good long time i 'm mostly pleased with the secondary purpose i came across i use my laptop in my easy chair , bed , couch , or any other comfy spot i 've always had issues with a using a mouse -lrb- i do n't like touch pads -rrb- i 've tried different materials for improvised mouse pads none picked up my laser mouse well i was set to order a new pad to mount to a stiff surface -lrb- and also be one more thing i need to carry around -rrb- then i put my mouse on this bag stick a piece of stiff cardboard in the sleeve and <unk> ! mouse pad and laptop protection all in one
i got this for my new # & # # ; hp laptop i normally use a backpack but it caused a lot of wear & tear on the cover of my last laptop over the years the new hp laptop has such an awesome finish that i wanted to protect it better this case is neoprene so it is soft and lint free i 've been using it stand alone for quick meetings with clients it will hold my laptop , mouse and a small notebook also fits in my backpack when i need to travel great product and super fast delivery !
i use this with a # . # `` lenovo ideapad it fits great , protects the laptop in my backpack from being <unk> by books and other things <unk> about it gives it a lot of cushion which makes me feel better about my laptop staying safe in the bag when it gets jostled or tossed down
i own asus rog g # <unk> , # . # inch latop because of its rear ventilation , i believe its bigger than most of # . # inch laptop and it fits <unk> with this laptop case not too big and not too small even with great price
this product is nice and well made , it 's soft but durable i use this for extra protection with my toshiba qosmio it is one of the biggest sleeves and my laptop fits very well and snug i do n't have to force my laptop to go into this sleeve and i feel confident with the protection it provides
ordered this sleeve because it was one of the largest i could find unfortunately , i does not fit my asus g # s gaming laptop the laptop will completely go in the sleeve but i can not zip it this was good enough for my purposes , but other than the size issue its a great deal for the
i ordered this for my new pc laptop which is # . # & # # ; and it does fit , but it is actually a little too big it has about a ruler length left of space and it 's also not too thick , meaning it wo n't protect your laptop very well i also have a mac laptop that i bought a sleeve for and it has a better thickness to wear i feel comfortable putting it on the table or something without having to be too careful but if you like thin sleeves , this is the one for you
i have a # . # msi gaming laptop this sleeve fit with no problems the seams , materials , look , all great the price was # bucks that 's great there are no pockets , flaps , straps just a simple nice protective sleeve great simple product
i am a proud owner of an msi gt # laptop , and following my recent purchase of a backpack to carry my investment around , i needed extra padding which this inexpensive sleeve provides i do n't expect <unk> out of it , just a little extra insurance fits well , zips smoothly and is somewhat stretchable very happy with my purchase
i got this bag to have a compact purse to carry my tablet unfortunately , it is not as compact as it looks the fabric and padding make it very bulky , and it was actually much bigger than i needed for the tablet -lrb- it was n't even a snug fit -rrb- the fabric is good quality , but does not look stylish at all i suppose this is something a guy could carry to work , or maybe even <unk> he gym , but it looks out of place paired with any nice clothes the bulk also makes it uncomfortable to carry the orange lining just looks weird , but you ca n't see it unless you flip open the cover
i was pleasantly surprised with this bag it is very well made with pockets and zippers in all the right places this bag was a perfect accessory for my macbook air i absolutely love it , however it is hard to distinguish the actual size when you see messenger , it 's actually closer to purse size so guys ... this might not be for you i love it , but ... eh ... it looks like a purse
nice bag that i use to carry essentials on a plane it is smooth , so slides right in and out wish i could take the handle out though - dont have much use for it
i would have given this # stars the bag has a lot of roomy pockets and plenty of room for <unk> , ect however , i would n't say that it was necessarily made for an # `` macbook air it 's a little snug , but it fits
fits the surface pro great , with seperate compartment for tablet seems to have adequate padding for protection lots of extra pockets convenient when carrying tablet and just a few extras
i have been searching for the perfect laptop bag that is feminine , and not bulky this bag has great compartments and i can fit my ipad it is comfortable and the strap is sturdy a must buy !
bout this for my new apple air and it fits perfect in it , just like a glove , has multiple pockets for your things this is a great buy and bi would recomend this to any one looking to buy a carrying case for there mac air
i have an # & # # ; macbook air , ipad and iphone this bag holds all of them plus cords , headphones , a book -lrb- yes i still carry one of those too -rrb- , my id and debit card my macbook fits snuggly in the inside pocket without being hard to put in or take out the rear slip pocket holds my ipad - easy access , easy to take out or put in and holds it tightly so i do n't feel like the ipad will fall out if i accidently tip the bag over i use the bag every day and it 's holding up well so far this bag holds everything i & # # ; need & # # ; and more plus it 's stylish one of the better bag purchases i 've made
my wife wanted this because the messenger bag she was using was just too big so far she thinks this one is great lots of pockets that she can fit all her tech stuff into it will carry her nook , ipad , chargers , cables , you name it one thing to note , the bag is not made of regular cloth it is some kind of heavy nylon , not ripstop but more like a heavy nylon canvas it does have a little shine to it that you can not tell from the pictures the material is a very good quality and looks like it will wear well for years
this case is compact but at the same time holds all of the extra accessories that i need like a mouse , adaptor , pens and a few more things it is lightweight yet seems to be very durable
this does not fit my surface tablet it has a lot of space and not much cushion i think the pick and pluck are better cases for a more precise fit
bought this for my netbook and works great does n't have room in there for anything else except for small usb sticks and headphones the netbook does tend to move around a lil bit if tilted on the side cuz the liner is n't very thick just add lil padding inside and that will cure the problem great case overall
this computer case will definitely keep your netbook safe , whenever mine is in the case i really do n't have to worry about it getting crushed or dropped after having my nexus # break in my backpack , i wanted to have a really sturdy case for my hp mini the only drawback is that the case is very bulky and will take up a lot of space in your bag a lot of the time when i am taking my computer somewhere , i leave this thing at home because i just do n't want to deal with having it in my
i originally bought the pelican case that had the <unk> foam in it for my ipad the only problem is that my ipad is inside of a griffin survivor case and it would n't fit i tried to modify the foam using a knife but all that did was <unk> the interior i ordered a second case that had no foam lining and it fits around my ipad perfect the only negative is that there is no room for the ipad charging adapter
this case is the perfect fit for my dell netbook , the perfect companion on a photography road trip nothing like a sturdy case when you 're out on the road to protect my image data
i recommend this product to all microsoft tablet users for school and work especially for traveling to foreign countries with the shoulder strap you keep your tablet close to you in crowded environment and weather
showed up as advertised i used it to house a google nexus # , with case/stand thing and it worked fine only complaint is that the charging cord gets in the way of closing the lid nice and durable , travels around afghanistan with me just fine
i was excited to see that pelican was finally making smaller cases for e readers and tablets the size of this case is just right for my needs i take my nook on <unk> <unk> and camping trips and wanted the best protection from the elements and from getting crushed i can fit my nook , my ipod , my portable charger , and cables all in this one case i chose this size case over the smaller e reader case so that i do n't have to take my everyday cover off my nook , and i have room for the accessory items i need while i travel i have been using pelican products for many years to protect my cameras and other gear they are the best , and now i have the best protection for my smaller electronics in a perfect size
i have the griffin survivor on my ipad # it fits perfectly inside the # cc i 've taken my ipad to every corner of the world and it does n't have a scratch love this case , you never have to worry about your gear breaking again
i have had this product for over # month working in <unk> i am us to pelican products and how durable they are this is no exception , i use this to carry my surface tablet so far i have had five drops on the corners , sides , and even one on on the screen side each time i have opened it i am surprised and grateful to find there is no damage the only negatives that i can give it are that you ca n't carry it safely when opened , and there is no place to store any extra equipment
sold as neoprene material , but it 's not if someone is interested in a sleeve made of very good quality neoprene , i bought other one that costs a little more here <unk> # <unk> #
before i ordered this product , i measured and reviewed the dimensions of my laptop however , this case was too small when i received it it was still a quality product , which is why i gave it a #
i love this sleeve i use it for my macbook pro and it fits perfectly it 's not too bulky it wo n't provide as much protection as a expensive sleeve , but it works really well for the price plus , the design is real cute
this sleeve is exactly what i wanted ! it 's unique and i 've never seen anyone else with one like it it fits my macbook like a glove and i have one of the original white ones so its a little bigger than the new macbook pros also , in the picture the design kinda looks white but its really a shiny silver which is even better in my opinion all in all , i 'm very happy with this product and the price
this case is perfect i have a # . # inch sony vaio t series and it fits perfectly i love this design , in the picture the writing and buildings look white but it 's actually silver which looks awesome to me i am very pleased with this case
i love this product ! it 's very lightweight while still protecting my computer , which fits perfectly inside the design is really cute , and it was definitely worth what i paid for it i would highly recommend it to anyone else with a # `` macbook air
i ordered this to protect my # `` macbook air i was worried about it fitting too loosely , but it fits perfectly great price for what you end up getting i wish the zipper were black instead of gray , but that 's just a personal aesthetic preference of mine this turned out to be a lot nicer than i was expecting =
this hub is not good the imac can not find devices attached to the hub most of the time port <unk> on the mac are not a good deal i would not recommend this item
i purchased this for my # mac book pro this is only a usb # . # . all mac usb are # . # usb thumb drives did not work on this unit nor did my lacie drives
do not waste your money on this hub i bought # -lrb- # for home and # for work -rrb- thinking they would look great with the macbook pro and <unk> well , that 's all they do they look nice but the build quality is <unk> in fact , one of them arrived in pieces with the bottom falling off and the usb plug white socket separated from the metal part then , the other two are just , well , crap obviously , it is not a powered hub but still , even with relatively low current draw , they just do n't work in fact , my usb thumb drives wo n't even appear on the desktop with them it really is a complete waste of money
repeating other comments here , but the cord is too short -lrb- it just sort of <unk> off the back of the computer -rrb- , and only # of the # ports work super lightweight and plastic feeling because it looked <unk> , i <unk> figured it would be imac quality even though it 's pretty , i 'd suggest choosing something else
it looks great , and that 's where the good stuff ends since i am in afghanistan and it is a pain to mail stuff back , this is prob just going in the trash when i hooked up my iphone and ipad and an external drive ... well neither of the <unk> would charge , and they kept <unk> from itunes during sync the external drive would show up , but would also just disappear causing the dreaded `` you did not eject properly `` message . tried other devices , but all had similar <unk> when using this hub going to get a not so attractive name brand one now very disappointed as it seems well built and was pretty pricey for a usb hub , save your money and get a less expensive one from a known brand
i hooked this hub to my i mac the hub 's usb cable is so short that the hub <unk> from the back of the computer had to prop it up on the box it came in to make it level
this item is billed as perfect for the imac while it is <unk> pleasing , the cord is only # inches long , far too short to plug into an imac 's port and sit flat on a desktop i had to order a usb cable extender ironically the amazon feature suggested `` customers who purchased this -lrb- the extender -rrb- also purchased `` you guessed it , this usb <unk> i hate products that are not well designed
i have a couple external hard drives and media chargers and this particular hub is constantly <unk> them because it has loose and bad connections that is the type of thing that can cause you major problems like damaging your electronics it is a low <unk> device but for some things like ipods , it does n't take much of a surge to destroy i do not recommend this product and i will find myself replacing mine as soon i say see another one
i should n't have let the <unk> look of this usb hub sucker me into buying it it just does n't get the notion that it 's supposed to make usb components visible to the imac it 's now in a drawer containing a number of my other attempts to <unk> my electronic life i do n't know why it did n't serve me well as a hub for various add-on devices it just did n't i 'm going back to basics -- plugging and unplugging various devices in the computer 's own usb slots as i need to use them but i give it two stars for being so pretty that 's worth something ... right ? ?
simply put : this nice looking usb hub works but is designed poorly insert even one usb cable into the hub , and the weight of the cable will pull the hub off its base it no longer looks so nice with the <unk> up in the air i could see this working if all you inserted were usb sticks , but would n't be just easier to plug the usb stick directly into the computer i expected to use this hub with all the peripherals -lrb- speakers , scanner -rrb- and have a single connection to my laptop i ended up <unk> the usb hub and mounting it on the underside of my desk , <unk> any benefits of having a nice looking usb hub since the cable is so short , i had to buy an extension <unk> usb cable to make it reach disappointed with the product someone <unk> <unk> port usb charging station -lrb- <unk> # -rrb- ; it looks like it would stay on the desk with usb cables plugged into it
it looks good and is well made and it does work but ... the usb ports themselves are oriented upside down the labels for the usb cables are facing toward the desk and its exactly the reverse of how you expect to plug everything in - <unk> and just plain wrong another problem - the item will never sit flat as show in all the pictures unless you do n't have anything plugged into it as soon as you do , it pops up , sitting on the edge - not terrible , but again it 's not right on the bright side , it 's still better looking than any other usb hub i 've seen
cool little usb hub that <unk> the apple aesthetic cord * is * a bit short , but is actually the perfect distance from the rear of a <unk> display to the base ... but not much -lrb- any -rrb- more one other weird <unk> ... the usbs are upside down not a deal breaker by any means , just ... odd anyhow , well worth it edit : the only thing missing is the fact that it 's not powered , which means items like an ipad wo n't charge through it
this product has the style of the imac computers but if you use many hard drives and other peripherals this ones does not have the power to move that they do n't have power adapter for traveling is ok
i would call this an impulse purchase i should have put this in my shopping cart and let it <unk> for a few days like i do now so i eliminate impulse shopping at the time it seemed like something i really needed but i really do n't use it
the usb hubs works fine the only issue i have found is that it needs a longer -lrb- at least # inches -rrb- usb cable i can not use it on my imac
not too bulky works well with my imac was uncertain about the cost but later felt it was well worth it once i got it the cord is short , i 'm thinking about using velcro to <unk> it to the base of the monitor
compared to most usb hubs , this one is very sleek looking and apple white -lrb- a close match at least -rrb- one minor issue ... the cable supplied is pretty short so the hub sits about # inches behind the imac and can not be mounted anywhere conveniently otherwise it has worked fine without issue
great extension port for any mac , looks like an apple product itself only problem the connection cable is too short for a proper use with an imac , should be at least # to # `` longer
the cable is too short for use with my imac it is not a powered usb device , so any device that needs power -lrb- usb hard drives # gb , # tb , etc -rrb- wo n't work a flash drive -lrb- # gb , # gb , etc -rrb- will work as well as iphone , ipod touch , ipod , etc . it works great if you do n't need a longer cord -lrb- # `` cord should be included -rrb- or need it for powered devices
i just received my # -port usb hub for my imac , and am very pleased not only does it work flawlessly , it looks like my wireless mouse great product , great seller
as others said , it looks like something from apple it matches my new mini perfectly and makes it a whole lot easier to access the usb ports i took the advice from other reviews and bought a # foot extension -lrb- # on amazon -rrb- it looks good , does what it is supposed to do review update : for some reason my <unk> macbook air superdrive will not work when plugged into it one of the reasons i bought it
this product matches the apple imac perfectly this way i get # more ports and they face me i always hate having to plug stuff in on the back -- always hard and have issues this hub sits nicely under the screen on the aluminum stand foot right in front of my <unk> drive which is aluminum too
hubs are hubs , right there is n't a lot that can go wrong here but what i like about this one is the color and design it matches my imac as if it was shipped out with it it 's not even noticeable on my computer desk , reducing the appearance of clutter this will work with any computer , but if you have an imac , you ca n't make a better choice than this
does the job you wanted it to do easy to use , just plug it into # onboard port and then you have # outboard ports the cord is a little short so be aware of this before you buy
using this on a macbook pro and various sound <unk> machines no problems and everything connects good and holds in place the cord is very short so make sure you 're okay with that it looks clean and simple , a definite plus for mac users
i 've been searching high and low for a sleeve that 's actually designed for the # inch retina , but it seems most manufacturers are just <unk> the name on their descriptions for regular # inch mbp cases i thought this one would be an exception because the title makes it sound like it 's only for the retina one star for misleading marketing this case fits the regular # inch macbook pro perfectly , but is too big for the retina it has plenty of room to slide around & # # ; it 's about a half-inch too wide and too deep i 'll be returning this and continuing my search if it did fit the retina , i 'd have given it three stars good price , but of course you get what you pay for ; it feels cheap all around
it worked great , until the zipper broke . everything everyone else said is true - its nice , thick , etc . . . fits the # & # # ; macbook pro beautifully problem is , the zipper is cheap , and when unzipped all the way to the end , it popped off track , and no longer zips
had case for about a week until the zipper fell right off . now it 's useless and a pain to zip look into a different product folks tons of options to be
looks good in pictures but in actual it is not if you just needs bag to cover it then it is good for u but it might not save your ipad if it drops on the contrary it is better than nothing
i liked the look and feel but the zipper is a piece of crap and it broke on me within # or # uses you get what you pay for guys
i almost got it for free its average material , does n't look too bad does n't fit a macbook pro with retina display as i would like , the case is a bit bigger than it should , but for sure it gets the laptop protected
- the case is great , except i got some water on it and it created a stain -lrb- i know that 's my fault , but i do n't think water should stain -rrb- - the zippers work well and my macbook air fits inside nicely -lrb- i do n't have a shell on mine -rrb- - great value
cant beat this case for the price , especially since i got it on sale for $ # ! with $ # shipping just came in the mail today and pretty happy with it it includes a pocket which is great but it 's not big enough for the laptop charger so i just keep a usb cable and flash drive in there padding is pretty thick , so i 'm happy with that and the case overall fits like a glove on the macbook pro only real problem is theres not enough protection from the zipper so i 'm afraid it may scratch the laptop like many of the other sleeves out there however i 'm very happy with the purchase and other than that one problem it 's perfect for my needs
a lot more padding than you imagine with something like this , so that is a good thing to keep you laptop ding free also makes it a tad thicker than other sleeves , and it is just a tad too big for my # in macbook pro , if fits well but is not super snug in the end , the extra padding this one has is worth the added thickness compared to other sleeves
perfect fit for my # ' ultra laptop plenty of cushion in the bag to protect your laptop not much room for anything else i like the subdued dark pink color
i love casecrown an so ordered this case for my macbook fits great and protects well although after about # month the zipper broke off be sure not to <unk> the front pocket because it becomes hard to close i put too much things in the front and that was my bad
i purchased this case mainly because of its price -lrb- only # cents ! ! ! -rrb- however its backed up for a great brand so i was not so skeptical about it it arrived on time and it fits perfectly well to my macbook pro # the additional pocket on the front is really usefull since it fits the charger and the extra wd external hd i totally recommend it giving it a shot
