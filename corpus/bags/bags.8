i travel a lot and <unk> in areas where it is not advisable to <unk> carry a laptop around ... or any other valuables for that matter so this case which looks more like a backpack suits me perfectly it fits laptops up to # . # inch and provides ample protection you have to <unk> a bit to get the laptop in and out but that 's ok most of your extra stuff has to go in the main compartment ; there is no extra compartment for documents or folders , but the main compartment provides lots of space for these i was a bit annoyed that , after i had bought this case for $ # , a couple of days later the price dropped to $ # but that 's life
i purchased this computer bag for my fiance and he absolutely loves it he has received several compliments on it as well because it 's just a cool looking bag it adds a little rugged flair to the standard computer bag and has tons of compartments to store different items i also received it quickly i definitely recommend it
i 've tried several different laptop bags , from over the shoulder to carry to backpack i really like this one because i can put everything in it and it does n't feel heavy it has a separate compartment for the cords which is great and also a place for my mp # and a water bottle in addition to the normal pen and paper area lots of pockets i love it
i bought this sturdy , well padded laptop case for my son it keeps his # . # inch notebook in there securely , with special pockets for all his accessories i like how the pockets have a little `` icon `` on it for instance on the bottom there is a picture of a plug-in this helps keep everything organized so he knows where everything is
so while this does protect my laptop , it does n't do it in style i have to wipe off a black residue from the front facing corners every day , and the thread has begun to fray throughout for something i bought just a year ago and use for only one thing , this points to cheap construction and poor design ca n't wait to get something better ps - what is with that <unk> flash symbol , am i the only one who finds that strange
this case worked pretty well for a couple months , but now both zippers have broken off , leaving only sharp pieces of medal in their place the material it is made with is also very thin , and does not provide very much protection i suggest you opt for a more expensive option if you 'll be using this case with any <unk>
it does what it 's supposed to do maybe it 's just mine , but it <unk> a unpleasant odor that i guess is just a <unk> of the material my macbook pro and laptop bag now reek of the scent
so , my wife -lrb- love ya <unk> . . . -rrb- accidentally dropped my mbp onto the <unk> it was in the marware sportfolio sleeve at the time , so things could have been much worse but despite being in the sleeve , the front corner was bent up pretty badly - a $ # + repair , at minimum which is the biggest flaw of this case if it had fallen on one of the back corners , it may have <unk> better as it has heavy rubber padding around the back and sides but the front corners are not nearly as protected due to the zipper i do n't know if this could be designed better , but the lack of protection on the front end is disappointing -lrb- sidenote : the little pocket is virtually worthless
i purchased the sleeve for my new macbook pro # `` laptop the design of the product is good the content is protected from the zipper it is slim enough to fit in my backpack it will be better if the material is made of some harder material to <unk> more protect from impact it is a quality product and i would recommend it for use in another bag
i would highly recommend this case to anyone it is not extremely durable , but it keeps my computer from receiving scratches or dings it is perfect for my backpack that i carry it around in often it is cushioned with a fleece like material , and it has padding around the zipper so it wo n't scratch the computer 's bezel i love the way it looks too they ship quickly and are very polite
looks a lot better than the picture - particularly the colors the slip on portion of the sleeve protects the edges of the macbook from zipper scratches , and my computer has not been scratched in about # + months of use now the smell is a little funky and has n't faded completely even after # months , but it is not a deal-breaker and it has <unk> a little quite a good value for the money would probably buy again
i really like this case the way it looks and how the bottom corners are reinforced cons - top corners are not reinforced , zipper will scratch up your laptop if you are n't
i bought this for a new # . # `` macbook pro and i really like it but it is a little tight when getting the laptop into the sleeve i need to stretch it at the corners to get it to zip closed once zipped up into the sleeve , you ca n't ask for a better match though only time will tell if the stretching will cause problems or maybe fit better
in the beginning i was debating whether i should get a laptop bag or one of these sleeves to protect my macbook i ultimately decided to go with this sleeve , and i have n't regretted since the tight , compact feel of this case allows you to carry your macbook in any bag -- it 's not restricted to one bag this is particularly useful for me as i do n't need to carry the same backpack everyday to class and it gives me more freedom in that way i also ended up getting a speck hard cover case for additional protection i would like to say that the marware case works perfectly even with a macbook pro that has a speck hard cover case it 's a tight fit , but it still works overall , i 'm impressed with this product , and i 'm happy with the protection that it gives my laptop . =
i was looking for a sleeve to protect my # `` macbook pro while in my backpack this sleeve is perfect , with many well thought-out features the lined zipper is an especially nice touch the outside pocket is great for a small calculator , the apple remote , or even a few pens
i have had incase sleeves for my mac 's in the past , but i decided to try the marware case this time for my new mbp fits like a glove and does what it 's intended to do it protects my computer while it 's in my bag
i purchased this sleeve after my second case logic sleeve fell apart compared to the case logic , this sleeve is much better designed first , the sleeve has an internal flap that stretches over the top edge of the macbook to protect it from possible scratches from the zippers second , the sleeve does not have zippers on the sides like the case logic which adds to the thickness of the sleeve and could damage the macbook when squeezed into tight places previously , i could not fit my macbook into my lowepro backpack with its case logic sleeve on , but now i can with the marware sleeve it also feels sturdier and the corners better protected
this is a very nice sleeve for my # `` macbook pro the sleeve is flexible enough that you can easily insert your laptop and zip it up , but stays form fitting for protection the padding is thick enough to provide protection in most normal situations i like the flexibility this gives me to carry the laptop in any briefcase , backpack , etc .
i originally bought a cheap laptop sleeve designed for any # . # inch laptop , however that one was way to huge and left almost an inch of wiggle room length-wise this case , which i bought from a local apple store , tightly hugs the # inch macbook pro there 's no wiggle room at all i also really like the little protective flap inside that acts as a barrier between the zipper and the edge of the laptop , it 's a nice touch the skinny blue pocket going down the front could also be useful for important notes , receipts , or even a small calculator excellent product , recommended
after i purchased my macbook pro , i tried going to best buy for a case after looking at target and staples without any luck most of the ones that these stores carry have zippers that snag and scratch the laptop putting it in or taking it out of the case after picking up a case that was too big -lrb- a # . # rather than a # because that is all they had -rrb- , i started looking online a friend suggested marware because the fit is nice and tight and you feel more secure knowing that this was specially designed for macbooks i 've had the case for about a month now and no scratches so far
the loud blue strip down the middle is definitely more understanding in real life than in the photo works very well , just be careful to fold the material over the edges of the macbook pro before you zip it up
marware sure has figured out how to make the best sleeve for the macbook pro the design is slick , and the protection is great ! though the front pocket is of little use , the case is a must-have for macbook pro owners it protects and cushions the mac when it is in your backpack , keeping it from moving around and potentially breaking something the protective rubber on the bottom is very nice , though it is sometimes hard sliding the computer into a tight backpack overall : great case/sleeve
this sleeve works great to protect my # `` macbook pro and looks great as well my notebook goes in and zips up easily , even with the snug fit the pocket on top would fit a small ipod or jump drive , but definitely not big enough to hold much more i like the slim lines of this product because it makes it easy to fit into another bag or a backpack for transport
fits very snug around my macbook pro -lrb- with a speck see-thru case -rrb- there is no room for it to move around inside and nothing to scratch the case like tags ect . inside it is snug enough that it would still fit well without the speck case on the zipper is well designed not to scratch the case i recommend the case for anyone with a mbp
very nice sleeve that fits my macbook pro -lrb- # `` -rrb- laptop like a glove others have written about the smell , but there was no more odor than any other neoprene product it dissipated within a week overall , this is a great sleeve
i 'm so glad i bought this rather than other brands it fits my macbook pro perfectly the design and material is top-notch zipper is lined with some type of padding too so that it does n't rub against your expensive investment buy it , and join the `` satisfied `` macbook owners
this sleeve fits my # `` macbook pro perfect just like reviews had said i love the flap that protects the computer from the zipper and the outer pocket is great to keep my ipod from floating around in my laptop bag the construction of the sleeve seems to be high quality and hopefully will last for some time
this sleeve with fit your # ' # macbook pro perfectly the material seems to be quite resistant and soft i had it for a month now , and i 'm constantly moving and taking the computer in and out importantly , the zipper seems resistant too , and doesnt get caught with the inner `` seal `` of the sleeve the inside of the sleeve doesnt seem too static , no risk of dust getting in there is a little outside pocket , that can be use for the computer remote . beware : this is a perfect fit if you computer has some kind of additional protection like a clear plastic shell , it will definitely be too big for the sleeve overall , very happy with the
this is a great product but do not believe the sizing information my # `` x # . # `` hp tx # barely fits and i have to force the zipper if i had known , i likely would have gone up a size i 'm am keeping and using the # `` in hopes it will eventually stretch to fit
the product looks great and i think it will serve its function however , my # inch tx # did not fit in the sleeve i bought this one because i saw several reviews specifically saying this model laptop would fit in the sleeve however , that was not the case
exactly what i needed for my lenovo x # s fit is snug but it is still easy to slip in and out then this will fit easily into any carry-on , no need for a special laptop bag
this durable sleeve fits my dell xps m # perfectly instead of carrying a thick , bulky laptop bag , i slip the xps into this laptop sleeve and put the peripherals in the matching bag -lrb- not shown here -rrb- and go the sleeve slides into my book bag and briefcase , so it does n't appear that i 'm carrying a laptop it 's made of thick , <unk> real neoprene the <unk> colors and sleek design are an added plus i recommend this to anyone looking for ease and convenience
great little computer sleeve - funky stripes and well constructed i can stop worrying about leaving my laptop on the plane in a <unk> <unk> as there 's no way i could miss it now the only drawback i encountered was an amazon issue , not a product one for reasons i ca n't understand , this product can not be mailed internationally without having to set up an international mailbox of some kind - too hard <unk> i had friends in the states who were happy to <unk> it to me
i ordered this item and received the marware sportfolio for macbook air , not the marware sportfolio max for macbook pro this amazon product description does not describe an actual product that marware currently offers the case looks like what i would want if i had a macbook air , but i have a new # `` macbook pro , and it does n't fit in this macbook air case check the marware site and then search amazon for a product description that matches the marware product name exactly
i like this case , it works well and it looks well made the only problem with it is that there is no room for a charger other than that , great case
overall a good quality bag , but offers little protection and little storage room low <unk> <unk> fit for macbook # `` cons very light protection from <unk> storage room -lrb- even for power adapters the case is a good high quality fit and finish , that is light weight and fits well -lrb- macbook # `` -rrb- , but offers very little impact protection and storage room if you do n't travel with it much , it should serve well , but i would never use this for a travel case
so far this neoprene carrying case has served me well it has been designed very well and durably there 's not a lot of excess space in which to store accessories but i think that 's the point of this particular case room for your laptop , power cord and maybe some papers but that 's about it overall , a good case that has adequate padding for an expensive computing investment
i did n't give this case a perfect score , only because i agree with other reviewers about the need for a little extra padding in the bottom other than this , i believe it is the perfect case my macbook fits perfectly and the strap is so comfortable contrary to what another reviewer stated , the fact that the pad on the strap is not adjustable is the best feature of the strap , since it holds the computer securely
i ordered the bag for my son for christmas after looking all over in stores & online i was happy to find this one at a good price and made for a mac # in my son loves it
this case is an excellent option for folks with a # `` macbook it is fairly sturdy and your computer will be protected from the zippers the outer pockets will hold your power supply , but it will have a slight bulge i am primarily using this case as a slip case to put in a larger bag , but i would be happy to carry it by itself it is lightweight and should protect your computer from bumps and scratches
i got the sportfolio for the macbook , having used their product for the ibook before everything i loved about it is still there - the neoprene texture , cushy strap , and rubberized bottom the only minus is that the case was not <unk> down for the macbook ; i wish it were more form fitting those with more papers to stuff in its interior pocket will find it perfect
this item is just perfect for my new mac book pro # `` it fits the laptop perfectly , is well padded , and has a nice handle , and shoulder strap i highly recommend this product
i bought this case for my # . # inch `` hp tx # us `` tablet pc my aim was carrying my # . # inch tablet pc with a practical use with some protection this product has # elastic compartments which enable carrying cables etc . one compartment <unk> inside also to allow more vulnerable items like cds , flash disks etc . it is made of elastic and soft material so that it can provide some protection more than expected with its hardened bottom i find this product successful and i suggest you to buy this product if you have or plan to buy a # . # inch tablet or a macbook as it was designed for
this sportfolio is undoubtedly the best case for the # inch macbook on the market i have used it as both a sleeve to protect my notebook in my backpack , as well as a stand alone case either way i would recommend this case to anyone who wants to protect their macbook
shipped quick ! ! ! ! received quick ! ! great product and durability all in all i am pleased . i suggest that those who do n't want to spend a lot of money for a macbook pro bag strongly consider this one
this is my second sportfolio case in my opinion is the only type of laptop case you need light , well armored , and the front pocket is perfect for carrying your peripherals and power cord thanks marware for making an amazing case
i saw this case at a friends house and had to have one it absolutely does the job it is made out of a neoprene material that is very soft and will not scratch your macbook in addition , it uses a neoprene cover for the zipper so it will not rub on your macbook either i feel very confident that this case will protect my investment
i 'm very satisfied with the marware sportfolio case for my macbook pro # `` my macbook fits in perfectly and there 's plenty of room to fit a charging adapter , iphone , and a usb cord + you can fit a <unk> in the front side you can also fit a <unk> in the interior pocket the case is sleek and made out of stretchy foamy material that adds protection to your macbook there 's also a strip of foam under each side of the zipper to protect your macbook from zipper scratches the case comes with a shoulder strap which come off if you want to use it as a sleeve it also fits perfectly in a backpack
i was looking for the ` perfect case ' for my new macbook , so i ordered this i was using it also , until i found a briggs and riley computer travel case -lsb- -lsb- asin : <unk> mini computer case the briggs is by far a much better computer case
nice product , but could use a bit more padding on the bottom and sides i like all the compartments and the organizer portion will hold a few things in addition to the macbook probably priced about $ # too high for what it is , but no other brand fits the macbook as well
i love it perfect laptop bag for my macbook pro i can carry all the gadget i need the max i ever carried was charger , itouch , phone , charger , macbook pro , flash drive , few pens , one folder , and # notebooks it fitted all them perfectly
this is one of the best cases i have ever owned for a laptop computer the space for the macbook pro is perfectly sized and cushioned to ensure that the laptop is extremely safe there is also a nice cover separating the computer from the zippers which prevents any scratches from the zippers the bag is extremely spacious , i can easily fit my macbook , ipod , ac power adapter , mouse and usb cables without adding any bulk what so ever the bag is also very attractive and the perfect size to carry around school with overall i am very happy with this <unk> and though this bag is a little more expensive than some of the other options , it is definitely worth it considering the quality of this laptop bag
absolutely perfect if your looking for a case and not a sleeve one pocket holds my macbook nice and snug while the other pocket has plenty of room for my mouse , ipod , chargers et cetera outer pockets -lrb- one zipped , one open -rrb- are plenty fine for some paperwork or a couple of magazines the shoulder strap has a non-slip pad so it works wonderfully well even when the case is pretty full marware did a very good job with the design and construction of this product the zippers -lrb- on the computer pocket -rrb- are lined so no need to worry about zipper scratches
i have been using the product for school honestly , i am extremely happy with it the straps are comfortable , and i do n't have to worry about my computer getting banged up
this bag is great holds everything i need a little bulge if i try to pack too much stuff in the side zipper pocket , but that 's not the bags fault i really like the pockets for a mouse and the power supply feels soft too . :
we had high hopes for the sportfolio deluxe # `` macbook pro case after reading some of the reviews and knowing that it was designed specifically for the macbook pro however , we quickly ended up with a broken zipper pull and were plagued with the extremely squeaky swivels that attach the straps because of the broken zipper pull , we 've returned the case
this case is very nice , but it has one problem with it 's workmanship inside both handles is a stabilizer that is attached inside the handle that extends down to that actual case in some cases this stabilizer will seperate from the case which causes the handles to stretch and being unusable this is a not good
this case provides a convenient way to carry the # `` mac , cords and charger , an i-pod and a <unk> folder with work papers nothing fancy , but does the job well at a very reasonable price
i was told that this case / manufacture is a good bag that 's well worth the price for the protection that it provides for your laptop i looked them all over and decided to purchase this based on seeing this at a computer store and how well the bag was made i was in boy <unk> and had my share of back packs , duffle bags , and stuff sacks so i knew good construction when i see it , that 's what helped with the decision to go with this
this is my second <unk> sportfolio laptop case i got my first six years ago and it is still is good shape -lrb- minus a broken zipper tab , the zipper still works though -rrb- i was so happy with my first that when i needed a new bag for my larger laptop , i specifically sought this bag out i am very happy with it
i love this case for my mac i looked and read and looked and <unk> and this case is perfect it is not bulky , lines are smooth , the zippers are not a problem , the material is waterproof and protective , the compartments hold just what i need for portability stop your search , this is the one
this bag is well-thought out and designed for macbook pro it has compartment for all of the cables and other accessories light , easy to carry , and very nice looking far better than any other bags in the market for macbook pro the inner protection on the zipper is great because the computer does n't get scratched this feature does n't exist in some other bags , so make sure to find one with the inner cover if you do n't want your brand new $ # computer to get scratched
perfect for carrying your laptop -lrb- # . # macbook with skin is very tight fit -rrb- , ac adapter , mouse , portable hd and thin <unk> for those who do n't carry only laptop and essentials than i thin k it 's perfect bag , but if you want to carry extra book # `` or thicker than i would n't recommend it i think it 's very well made . laptop compartment is very well protected and front and back pocket to carry mos of your essential stuff
yes , this is a great bag for the professional i just got out of college so i guess i wanted to be more professional in my appearance and not sacrifice aesthetics this bag does that well i do however miss a bit of flare my old laptop bag had and how <unk> the brenthaven metro deluxe looks compared to it at least there 's the reassuring lifetime guarantee and bullet-proof padding for the laptop this is a good purchase no doubt but if you are still in <unk> school , this might not be the coolest bag on the block for the rest of us in the real world , this bag is perfect the first time you see it you know it means business - heavy , solid construction and functional
extremely satisfied with this product it is a `` real `` computer case for real people meaning that you can fit the macbook in it safely , and still have room for a second battery , the power chord , a mouse , and a few files the other cases i have looked at simply did n't measure up plus ... the quality of this piece is outstanding i definite must for today 's business professional
this case looks good and holds up well it keeps the macbook pro secure and can withstand being jostled around there 's plenty of room for cables and chargers , as well as any paperwork you need to carry with you
i ca n't begin to <unk> how awesome this case is ! ! ! it has many compartments for various items and it has very strong handles ! ! overall the best computer case i have ever owned ! not bulky and very convenient to carry ! ! simply put , i love it ! !
this is the worst backpack i have ever used i bought this to replace my targus # years old backpack the design looks nice but the bag tends to bend towards the back this cause all my papers , <unk> , etc . are all <unk> also , the bag is pretty heavy by itself so , it is not good if you already have a heavy laptop
i have used the bag quite extensively for about # year during my last trip one side of the top handle became detached other than that , the bag still looks like it is brand new i have lots of experience with laptop bags and travel a lot and never had a handle detachment before this is very disappointing to me as i was convinced by someone that this was a quality bag and i spent about $ # more than i wanted to back to targus bags for me other than the handle detachment , this bag was quite functional for me and i agree with most of the other comments about it but do n't buy one unless you can verify that something has been done to correct the handle problem
- slim profile when not expanded ; expands to a really big size when you need the extra room - lots of storage areas : space for phones , ipods , power supplies , pens , glasses , widescreen laptop , keys , etc . - great straps durable construction -lrb- except for zippers -rrb- - zippers are n't the big , durable <unk> zippers that you find on other brenthaven bags time will tell whether this is an issue - i 'd prefer a more subdued color scheme , like black or black/grey more a taste thing
lots of space for the # . # `` notebook and plenty of room for my other work related items lots of little compartments to place eyeglasses , pens and computer related acessories the only thing i was a little disapointing was the price i felt the amount paid was higher than i would have spent on a similar item by a reputable competitor
great back pack it really has the space needed to carry a laptop and some books . the only thing i 'd like more is if the backpack was more business style black rather than the silver and black that 's just a taste issue i also had an issue with the chest connector coming off and not staying in place . that 's what stopped it from having a # star rating i 'd recommend this for anyone look for a laptop bag tons of pockets , great place to store pens and pencils , ipod , and many more compartments when it expands , it is really big , almost too big
the product was delivered quickly and unharmed ; the product itself was in perfect condition the bag is extremely durable and very large , and i have complete confidence carrying my mac with it
this backpack is great for anyone who has a laptop it has compartments for all of your accessories and is n't excessively huge and bulky to carry around the padded edges where the laptop is stored in the bag carries your laptop securely i would recommend this laptop bag for anyone who wants to carry their work with them every where they go
this case does a very poor job of satisfying its intended function the handle does not lock which means you can only pull it ; it ca n't be pushed without the handle <unk> it wo n't fit my # . # laptop the wheels are small and loud it is square and boxy - kind of ugly ; a few of my coworkers have commented on this and it 's front heavy and tips over with very little placed in the front pocket on a positive note it does appear to be solid and durable
it is a great case , and it rolls very well ... however , i bought it because it was a hanging file case , and it does not work well in that regard the folders go all over the place , they do not stay in securely as intended also , the folder do not hold very much without just falling poor design in the hanging file respect also , the front flap looks great at first , until you put anything in it then it gets front heavy , and tips over do not waste your money , i returned mine
item sent is consistent with the item number . however , the item picture is not consistent with the item number picture clearly shows <unk> type case case is actually a <unk> overnight luggage case
this bag is great , larger than i thought actually however , there is only # file folder even though it shows # and it does n't fit in there right also , the pictures clearly show a side zipper <unk> truly is n't a pouch or compartment each side is pressed in without any <unk> 'm sure i will enjoy <unk> is not what the picture shows at
the case itself is solid and well made the frame is strong and the handle is comfortable to use the <unk> version of this bag is excellent and i had hoped the same for this version with wheels , but the problems are with the handle and wheels the handle does not lock in the up position there are some spring-loaded tabs that extend when the handle is up , but they easily give way and the handle collapses this makes it impossible to push this case in front of you , as the handle will collapse you must pull this case behind you it also makes it impossible to use the handle as a place to hang your jacket or blazer the wheels are simply hard plastic wheels on steel <unk> , and not <unk> wheels with proper bearings as a result the rolling resistance is considerable even on smooth concrete , and on carpet this case is difficult to pull
out of the box , this case looks fantastic i was disappointed in the fact that the picture and description indicate that it included hanging file folders -lrb- <unk> -rrb- only one came in the case and the white label part had obviously been torn with its <unk> , <unk> edges i will see if amazon will make this right
i have a prior version of this case from about # years ago so i did a direct comparison of the old and new versions from solo sadly , it 's clear that the manufacturer tried to save some money by intentionally using thinner plastics on the top clips , and <unk> the clips to have weak break points this is classic built-in <unk> since when these clips break the entire case becomes useless and you 'll need to replace it with another one in addition , the zippers look less robust , and the <unk> handle seems cheaper and more flimsy i 'll use this case but when it breaks -lrb- and it will break sooner than the prior version -rrb- i 'll be certain buy a case from a different manufacturer this case will probably serve you ok for less than a year if you use it for light duty hauling and hold realistic medium to low expectations
bought my solo case at office depot -lrb- full retail $ # + tax -rrb- hanging file hooks are a joke , they fall off at every opportunity so take them off and forget about them the outer appearance is deceiving , not as much space as you would think zipper section is really tight after one month the steel rivet came out of the carrying handle i replaced it with a screw and nut ; but should i have had to rolls well and the telescoping handle is at a good height and easy to work with
have had this case for about a year it was used daily for about a month and <unk> on occasion the roller handel has developed a lot of play and <unk>
one other reviewer said it before - if you put anything heavy in the outside flap this thing will tip over unless you do have the laptop inside the main case to <unk> the use of the outside pockets otherwise , nice looking , sturdy , good handle length -lrb- longer i mean - i am tall -rrb- i just wish the main compartment was a little bigger - just another inch or two in width and a third <unk> under the outside pocket for the tipping problem
online it looks like it can hold more papers then it truly can the hanging file folders always fall off the laptop space is great and the bag is
i bought this because i have problems with my back and to carry my heavy laptop and my books it will work fine but the case does not fit my laptop that being said , my laptop is not a normal notebook i have a gaming computer for doing engineering work and design remember this will not fit all # inch screen laptops
i like this item it 's made of good materials , and the price point was very reasonable like others have said in their reviews , it is not balanced well , and falls over very easily it 's very annoying also , the handle does n't lock into place when expanded , so it collapses very easily ... also a very annoying <unk> i 'm not sure if i would recommend this product , unless all you 're concerned about is price i would say , spend the extra money , and get something that does n't fall over , and has a expandable handle that locks into place
i am a <unk> teacher and as such i have to carry a lot of stuff around campus and back and forth from home i needed something that would roll easy and hold a lot of stuff the bag is taller and narrower than my last one but holds as much sturdy and there 's a place for hanging files inside only problem is it 's heavy i guess you ca n't have it all
great for my traveling work needs pluses : durable , great for paperwork and laptop when i 'm going place to place in the rain . <unk> : weak hanging file <unk> use a locking extending handle .
i love this case , and all the storage compartments , but find it really too large for everyday use i alternate one day in the office and one day of <unk> , and find this case really too big and heavy for daily transport i would much prefer a streamlined case than this ` office on wheels ' this would be great for someone who must carry a lot of files with them , but i only need a folder or two with me everyday pulling it is fine , but lifting it into the truck is a struggle ; i ca n't imagine <unk> it into a car trunk i love how protected the laptop is from bangs and <unk> , so i feel that the laptop is very safe in here
we bought this for our son to take to <unk> school several days per week he hauls # pounds of books after # months it 's still holding up well the handle could be sturdier so only # stars instead of #
i needed a bag that could easily carry two laptops and this did a great job however , i found it to be just a little bit too wide , so that if i was n't paying attention my back foot would bump it as i walked , which was annoying there are removable hanging file racks on the sides of the large compartment , and lots of <unk> little compartments in the front i did not find the top to be easily accessible , as there is a latch on each side of the top , but i also did n't have to worry about anything accidentally sliding out in flight
this is a big bag it fits my school books , computer and just about anything else i 've had a mind to carry to make it last , i replaced the stock <unk> with inline skate <unk> -lrb- also from amazon -rrb- , and put rubber covers on the front feet bag is solidly constructed , so it should last at least a couple of semesters -lrb- it travels @ # miles monday through thursday -rrb- i love the flap style top , it makes everything very accessible two things : i wish it came with a rain cover and , i wish the telescope handle locked in the extended position -lrb- it collapses with only slight downward pressure -rrb- other than those two minor issues , i am very happy with solo 's product and amazon 's price
this is the type of case i was looking for i bought a scrapbooking case last year for my papers and books and it did n't last -lrb- too much weight -rrb- this case has room for file folders , separate areas for my jump drives , etc .
bought this for my wife for her new job and she absolutely loves it it is very functional for the work she does and i could n't have bought a better bag for the price
love this bag it has done wonders for my aching back it is an easy way to stay organized and i love the fact that it has a sleeve for my laptop i definitely recommend this bag
i bought this case for school which requires large and heavy resource books to carry around this case makes it a lot easier to carry those heavy books back and forth to class this case has a large storage area that is able to carry a lot of things in it i would highly recommend this for all professionals and students
i 'm a <unk> that <unk> , working from home and at the office this bag has been phenomenal in making my life easier i love that my laptop fits inside it 's own cushioned removable pouch , fitting in to it 's own pocket within the bag all my client folders fit , and the outside zipper pouch can hold alot of file folders also this bag has been fantastic i 've had this bag for years and it 's held up perfectly
this arrived ahead of the estimated delivery date i had been wanting a new briefcase and my wife talked me into this one very glad she did , it is a perfect fit my my work i often bring paperwork from one office to another this case gives me the room to do that exact thing holds all my extra stuff with room to spare
after several years of daily use and some air travel , this case looks almost new despite a lot of abuse the wheels work great , the latches still work , and the material looks great
