i bought this for my macbook pro # `` laptop , and it fits perfectly i wanted some added protection , and a bit of mystery as to the brand of laptop i was using at least two people thought i had bought a new laptop easy on and off -lrb- without slipping off -rrb- i love the feet - they have helped with the comfort of typing and keeping my laptop cool
let me tell you . i dropped my macbook pro after i bought this i was <unk> for a camping trip and when i dropped it i was <unk> the drop was # feet easy it dented right in the corner without the case im sure it would of damaged it even worse the case protects from scratches and i put a pice of paper on the bottom before i set the computer in it keeps small scratches off the bottom also buy it ... <unk> lost one of the flip out tabs <unk> ! !
this cover gives me piece of mind i do n't have to worry about <unk> my investment it looks great , its comfortable and the feet are a great addition for sitting at a desk definitely recommend it to anyone who purchases a new macbook pro
git black satin ... no fingerprint problem , not slippery , looks fantastic ! ! ! great fit ... well made , the legs are great both for typing angle and heat ventilation great investment to protect your macbook pro ! !
great little product to get the job done i paid around $ # for this item and am very pleased it 's easy to use and snaps on quick i purchased this item as i 'm going to afghanistan and want to minimize wear-and-tear to my macbook i 'm hoping to reduce bang ups , <unk> <unk> , etc . of r $ # you ca n't go wrong
after buying this one i ended up buying a leather cover that had a magnetic clasp because it was more of a question , soft cushion but this one was the same as its description the value is awesome
the <unk> macbook case arrived on schedule i was impressed with the way it makes your mac look with the apple logo shining through , it fit like a glove i like the fact that you can raise the legs in the rear of the laptop to provide a very nice keypad experience while using your computer
this order arrived the next morning and is exactly as described it did include a silicon keyboard cover which is fantastic for keeping <unk> out of your keyboard the shell snaps on easily , snug fit and looks very chic i had no problem putting it in my <unk> case even with the shell on
little feet add space to keep laptop cool has lasted despite not too gentle use my grasp sometimes lets go without <unk> this case has bee protective and kept my macbook pro virtually scratch free
i love this case looks very stylish even has feet on the bottom so you can prop the computer up or you can leave them in and it lays flat on surface
having invested in the macbook pro # i did n't want it scratched i feel much more secure with the ipearl hard case easy to install and looks good i 'm happy the apple logo shines through i did n't know which color i wanted so i bought black and aqua quick shipping too
nothing to really complain about it it looks nice , seems sturdy , and cools the laptop i would say to not include the plastic keyboard cover -lrb- as i do not use them -rrb- , but someone else might appreciate the inclusion of that
this hard shell in great it protects my macbook really good wish i would have bought this earlier to avoid some scuff and dings on my macbook , but the nice thing of this case is that it 's black and covers it all up i recently bought a clear one for my wife 's macbook air -lrb- http / / www.amazon.com/gp/product/b # bs # <unk> -rrb- to avoid the scuffs and scratches and works great
i bought this to keep my macbook pro from getting any scratches it does that i fits very well . comes on and off easily and it 's heat efficient . very very good
provides the perfect protection for his # ' mac book pro -lrb- non-retina -rrb- he loves the see-through for the apple logo when lit and it is easy to take on and off when need be i almost spend $ # + on a cover at the apple store ... glad i checked here first great value and absolutely no <unk> at all i even bought one for my <unk> ' # ' mac book in deep blue ... she loves it as well ! great product and amazing value
the cover fit snug snapped on without any hassle fit and finish was perfect # % happy i would buy again and highly recommend to anyone looking for a laptop case best bang for my
what a great fit and protector for my mac the apple shines through no problem the key cover is the best part and they do n't even tell you that is included
really not much else to say apple logo shines thru has fold out stands that prevent overheating now i can close my mbp <unk> the cat jumping on it and denting it
it 's really disappointing that the macbook pro does n't come in black , so i was determined to find a shell in black that would look good on my new laptop okay , i would have needed a shell for protection anyway this one is perfect my macbook pro now looks cool , and it was cheap ! so much better than the shells they sell at the apple store it went on very easily , no scratching of the precious aluminum casing of the computer i 'm definitely leaving finger prints on it -lrb- i 'm a lotion <unk> , so there 's no avoiding finger prints -rrb- , but they wipe away easily enough ps - this shell also came with a clear keyboard cover , which i did n't notice in the product description when i ordered it except i already sucked it up and bought the ridiculously overpriced once from the apple store because i refused to touch the keyboard with my <unk> fingers before it was protected i might return it and use the one that came with the shell
i was reading reviews of this product and was n't sure if it was going to fit on my macbook pro mid- # . # `` since it 's # years old now all i can say is that it fits perfectly and it is a great buy for your macbook pro
this item seems to be capable performing as it was designed it was easy to put on and the folding legs in the rear are perfect for the purpose they were designed for the price was reasonable compared to other similar products
i love this case it was easy to snap on just placed each cover on it 's respective part and it was done the bottom cover has two `` feet `` that stand up the computer for an elevated view it also came with a free keyboard protector so that was awesome
this is a great looking case it came out of the package , easily popped right on my macbook , and was ready to go it is sturdy with a perfect fit that offers great protection to the computer i do not routinely use the keyboard cover but am glad to have it in case the keyboard would need protection it is a great value , and the color choices are beautiful having more than one color of this case would be a fun thing
this cover is exactly how its marketed , it will protect your mac from scratches and dings from dropping or just general use and storage i also like the legs on the back that give you and ergonomic feel to it as well as clearance
this is my second macbook case from mcover the price from ipearl is very reasonable + i have the free satin upgrade from them the case is perfectly fit with the macbook pro # `` the retractable feet are also very helpful it is help to reduce the heat and <unk> better typing angle also , i love the fact that it semi translucent , so that i can see the apple logo overall , this case is very <unk> if you are looking the case for your mac , just go for it i believe you will love this case
the little <unk> feet on the bottom really help keep my mbp cooler when <unk> video or watching netflix i 've had it for about a year , and it has been very durable
this fits my macbook pro just fine . snaps right on and have had no issues all the ports line up with the case perfectly the material used is solid and makes my macbook pro protected i would recommend this
love this case , it was so easy to snap on , and it looks good it does leave fingerprints , but it 's a luster black , so that is to be expected it even came with a clear keyboard cover it 's not that easy on the eyes , but it works which is all that really matters , i still ordered a black one , because that 's what i wanted i 'd recommend the product to anyone get it ! ! ! !
you could n't ask for a better case for $ # it took less than a minute to put together and it fully protects your laptop while still letting it breathe underneath
perfect and exactly what i was looking for easy to snap on and keeps my macbook pro pretty and clean i should have bought this as soon as i had purchased my macbook
i purchased this product on august # th # and i must say that i am very happy with the product it has a good texture to the outside many slots for heat escape on the bottom is not too bulky does have a snug and tight fit my favorite feature by far would have to be the legs they leave the laptop in a perfect angle for use ! this is what sets this case apart from others
the overall construction of the product is very good i use it to avoid getting additional dents it has already saved me from a few : -rrb- the construction quality is very good and it snaps on very easily definitely worth the money to keep your macbook pro looking new it 's also a great way to differentiate your macbook while still keeping it a mac
pros : very snug fit makes the laptop feel safe you can now use it without worrying about scratching the bottom you do n't have to pay an arm and a leg to get your laptop protected cons : i feel like if i take it off and on repeatedly the snaps might scratch my laptop -lrb- but then again ... this could just be me being paranoid . overall i would highly recommend this product
this case snaps into place easily and fits perfectly for those who care about such things , the apple logo is still -lrb- albeit <unk> -rrb- visible when illuminated in short , this exceeded my expectations
i was a little <unk> about order a plastic cover for my macbook pro i am glad i did this product is excellent , very easy to install and helps with the grip on the notebook besides protecting it the shipping was prompt after my order was processed and i would definately recommend this product to anyone that has a notebook
i bought this product because i did not want to pay # $ for a cover this one is just like the brand sp ... k -lrb- i did not want to write the brand name -rrb- very qualified and very good design totally recommend it
the shipping of this cover was really fast and secure the cover fits perfectly and the color is what is shown here at amazon the apple logo is seen <unk> on the cover when the computer is on all the ports of the macbook pro are clearly seen with the cover on the great thing about the mcover is that the macbook charger can be placed perfectly in its spot without moving it around to fit in
i 'm going to make this short and sweet this case is pretty much perfect it took only a couple of seconds to snap it into place and once it was on , it was a perfect fit i hope i never actually drop my macbook pro , but if i do i 'm not sure if this case will work or not i mostly got this to protect my mac from scratches and dings also , i would like to put stickers on it and not have to worry about actually sticking them on the computer if you 're looking for a great deal on a great-looking case that fits perfect , this is the one for you
after owning several laptops , i realized the need for protection for my new macbook pro the mcover hard shell case was just what i was looking for the cover fits snug over the macbook and is lightweight and stylish i am very pleased with the purchase and would highly recommend it for protecting your investment
in search of a well constructed case for my new macbook pro lead me to search for something affordable on amazon i found this product and like the description nevertheless when i received it , it seemed like it would not protect anything guess looks are deceiving it not only gives my laptop an alternative look everything the seller spoke about was true it protects it from the elements i have accidentally drop a can of pens and my laptop did not get any dents or scratches for what its worth it does protect it i highly recommend this product
it is great to protect your mac from small scratches i have been using it for the past months and my mac look the same as the first day i bought it if you plan to sell your after some time of using it this is very usefull
i got pink one for me and this one for my boyfriend he likes it a lot , and i like mine , too convenient and do n't worry to get crash on laptop , easy to carry along
the aluminum unibody macbook pro # . # `` -lrb- black keys -rrb- was as specified it arrived so quick and the case was undamaged , i really like how it snapped into place without any gap or problems i would recommend this product to everyone who wants to protect their computers from any scratches
does n't add much weight to macbook is a form of plastic , has no tactile characteristics to it other than two feet on bottom seems to allow heat to escape sometimes charging cord does n't seat properly may be caused by hitting the case , but once you <unk> it snaps in place
this product was exactly what i was looking for and more not only does it fit snugly on the laptop but it also has standing legs and nice bumpers so it wo n't skid on slick surfaces which was a surprise because it did n't say anything about it when i ordered it also has ventilation slits the only downside was that the top piece does n't really snug up but it does exactly what its supposed to do to protect my mac book pro the black colors only fault is that it for whatever reason shows every finger mark you leave on it fantastic product ! !
i bought this cover as soon as i bought my macbook pro for school , a big perk being the little pop out <unk> built into the cover i had also previously bought a keyboard cover at a <unk> store , but it was folded in a box , and did n't fit well at all not to mention it cost me $ # but much to my surprise , when i got this case in the mail , my package also included a nice silicone keyboard cover and it 's magic the case is great and so is the keyboard cover that came with it
i have had this case on my mac ever since i bought it stays on and has been taking the scratches that otherwise would be on <unk> beautiful laptop
mcover hard shell case is one of the best case i had for my macbook pro first of all , it is very easy to install just a few snaps and that 's it second , it has great design the apple logo on the back screen is shown with your choice of colors because of the design and the bottom <unk> is designed to cope with cooling the device third , it comes with a bonus keyboard skin which also is great on protecting the keys -lrb- the only thing that i did n't like about the keyboard skin is that it has a embossed label at the space bar , but other than that it is quite good . the design fits perfectly so that it does n't cover any of the <unk> on the casing you could buy a speck casing for $ # , but this is less than half the price but has great quality
bought this years ago for my husband 's mac and he still has it i bought one for mine too and the only reason i had to replace my is because on of the feet broke -lrb- he does n't use his so his are intact -rrb-
i ordered this case not expecting much , but i was pretty pleasantly surprised by what i got it 's a nice , smooth hard shell case that still lets you see all the lights -lrb- charging , sleep , apple -rrb- on your macbook the stand is surprisingly useful and very sturdy all around it 's a great product
this cover fits perfectly and looks great note , despite reviews below , they must have done a redesign because my magsafe power cord fits just the way it 's supposed to , without blocking access to other ports also , mine came with the keyboard cover -lrb- i do n't plan to use it , but thought i 'd mention it in case someone else does -rrb-
i recently purchased the mcover hard shell case for my # `` macbook pro , i was very pleased by the fit and finish of the case it fit my macbook perfectly and was very easy to put on and remove it offers good light weight protection and i no longer use a sleeve case for my macbook it protects against the scratches , dings and dents you get from carrying around the macbook on a regular basis the mcover is a very reasonably priced accessory for a very expensive laptop i would highly recommend this case to anyone looking for cost effective protection for their macbook black mcover hard shell case for # `` a # aluminum unibody macbook pro -lrb- black keys , # . # -inch diagonal screen
i bought two of these , one for my girlfriend they fit the # `` mac book pros like a glove keeps the aluminum case from getting scratched i 'd also recommend getting the `` white silicone keyboard cover for macbook/macbook pro `` , this one worked best for me http / / www.amazon.com/gp/product/b # <unk> # _s # _i # <unk>
i have used these for the last # . # years , and the last time i brought my the genius bar at apply , the said it looked like new this says it all
i purchased the ipearl cover for my # `` macbook pro and loved it right out of the box very easy to install and looks amazing on my computer the top opens enough so that there is n't an awkward angle that comes with some other brands of cases , and i appreciate the venting along the bottom to allow the mbp to breathe all things considered this was a great purchase at an awesome price
i have to say i am very satisfied with the case i was skeptical at first because of the price and due to the fact i never ordered from this company but once the case arrived i was impressed with the packaging and free keyboard cover it came with i currently have been using it , might i add i dj throughout the city and it travels everywhere with me , and it has n't come off or gotten damaged i am very satisfied and for the price i highly recommend it
i bought this as a gift for my husband and he loved it it 's easy to put on , durable , and serves its purpose i think it 's a great alternative to the shells they sell at stores for $ # +
fits snug around the computer with no interference to the opening and closing mechanism great because unless the screen is open you could n't tell if it is a mac which can prevent it from getting
i 'm a college student studying tv in downtown chicago and i am very glad i bought this case it allows me to use the feet while getting perfect ventilation the feet are very useful in a classroom where you have a flat desk as your no longer stuck with a flat typing surface you can stand it up to slope the keyboard which is great this case also seems to be very sturdy great access to the side inputs and it even comes with a keyboard cover which i dont think they mention so i happen to have bought another one that the suggested and that has yet to arrive but for now there covers seem to be working great glad to have purchased it
i just purchased the mcover for my macbook pro and i love it it was so easy to put it on my macbook - it just took a few minutes it is a great product for exterior protection but maintains the sleek design of the macbook i really liked the sheer cut out for the apple logo on the top overall , i am very happy with this purchase !
my macbook is a bit older , w / a # . # core # duo this case fits perfectly and works as expected i specifically need this because the bottom plate of my machine does n't align correctly due to some aluminium dents typical snap cases break after a few weeks , i 'm always loosing bottom screws so my rating factor is heavily <unk> on if this cover can contain the bulging metal underneath my machine the answer is yes i 'll buy this case again before i buy another speck or incase snap case -lrb- and this sticker looks awesome illuminated through the case http / / www.amazon.com/gp/product/b # <unk> # <unk> #
i 've looked for a long time on a case for my macbook pro i checked out the usual ones from speck and found that i did not like it this is a great case and it also comes with a free keyboard cover under sellers , you can have ipearl -lrb- the company -rrb- as a seller , and the price is couple bucks cheaper , did n't find this til later , but it was ok also , if your order is fulfilled by them , you can get a free upgrade to the satin case overall , this is a great case with nifty features like the feet on the bottom that hold the laptop at an angle just a fantastic case with great customer support
i ordered this product and immediately put it on my mac i bought a black case it looks great and has held up i would recommend this cover for your mac
not only does this protective case look awesome in black , it protects and sits more ergonomically perfect case cover for such an incredible computer ! ! i love the way the apple shines through the top cover
i bought others colors because it <unk> my mac very well and we can change the color good quality and nice shipping faster and easy i am ok with my order
i bought this item because of all the positive reviews above and have not been disappointed i 'm only writing this to relate a little glitch and a fix for it i found with the cover on , the screen does not open quite as wide as it does without i like to open the top pretty wide to get the screen contrast i like i found that just a few minutes with my dremel on the corners of the back where the top hits gives you the full <unk> without any apparent <unk> effects
this is a very good case for the price it protects the computer very well and i do not regret buying it i actually dropped my computer and when i picked it up my computer was safe and scratch free i would recommend everybody to get this case
although it advertises to fit an # . # inch laptop , the asus transformer <unk> -lrb- an # . # inch tablet -rrb- does not when the tablet is inserted -lrb- and there 's a lot of shifting needed just to get it past the zippers -rrb- the zippers do not completely close and the top of the tablet sticks out if you are planning to use this as an actual commuter sleeve for the tablet portion of the <unk> , keep looking
i ended up not using this very often i purposely bought a case larger than my # & # # ; laptop so i would have room to stick the cords and such in there case does have padding along edges , though it is <unk> the awkward part is the handle and the way the case fastens in between it i would have liked a longer carrying strap , as my laptop is monstrous , but i knew what this was when i bought it it 's just not easy when you 're stuck between portability and having hands too large to comfortably use a netbook
the commute is a pretty good laptop sleeve overall , i am happy with it i expected a little more padding and protection from the memory foam be aware that the memory foam is very thin and does not offer much more protection than a typical <unk> sleeve i use it to slide down into a backpack or laptop bag to offer a little more protection and it is perfect for that the handles are a nice addition and make it a little more safe to carry by itself i gave it the # star rating simply because i expected the memory foam to be much thicker and offer more padding overall , i might buy it again , but not if i planned on carrying it around in the sleeve only you can probably get the same performance from a cheaper alternative
i bought this for my alienware m # x r # . # . # inch screen some others have reviewed this with pics and theirs fits with a little bit of room to spare when i got mine , it barely fit i had to wrestle my laptop into the case and it was way to tight after zipping it closed i ended up returning this
it is a tight squeeze around the corners the outer pocket does hold the power supply brick , but once again it is a very tight fit i went with the lowest priced item that i thought would work , but there is no room for any other accessories first impressions , i should have spent more for a piece of luggage to haul this beast of a laptop around
bought this to hold the asus g # , which it does well minus one star for not being able to completely close the sleeve while having a handle - instead one must use an odd velcro strap as shown in the picture
used for a g # sx it fits very well , and the padding seems sufficient for transporting , say , to a friends house in the car and back there 's not a lot of room for much else , and getting the g # sx power supply in the outside pocket is pushing it for air travel , anything rougher than a back n forth in the car , or when i just need to take more `` stuff `` along i use a mobile edge <unk> #
using the # . # `` <unk> for my alienware m # fit is snug given the <unk> profile of the laptop but it zips closed without issue while the <unk> handles do provide some convenience when moving from one spot to another , i 'm generally tossing the whole kit into a backback
my large # . # `` dell laptop needed an extra large case for toting the thing around and this puppy fits the bill it was n't easy finding the appropriate size , either , thus i settled for the # + ' i 'm happy with this product ; it appears well-made and it 's just what i wanted , a sleeve really and not a suitcase there is that extra space , but it 's a good compromise as i can fit other flat items along with the machine and power <unk>
the only downside to this is that it does n't have the option for a shoulder strap that would make this back # % better the pocket in the front is perfect for extra cords an mouse i 'm definitely happy with my purchase
this is an excellent laptop sleeve the fact that it has handles makes it much more convenient than other sleeves i have owned it is a nice , snug fit for my # . # `` laptop the memory foam seems convincing too
i was surprised when i <unk> this product to find a video on how to use it it turned out to be a pretty cool video , which ultimately led to my purchasing of the laptop sleeve the bag is functional and fits my # . # inch laptop it has additional room for charger , mouse , etc in a <unk> that is also quite functional i am very pleased that i purchased this laptop sleeve i have bought a few over the years , and this is the best one yet
my husband has this case for his white macbook and it is wonderful he has had it # years and it has held up extremely well he carries it to work with him and the case still looks great i thought i would save # bucks and bought myself a different sleeve by case logic , and while it 's okay , the foam is not nearly as dense as this one i highly recommend this case the handle option is also a big plus i now have a # . # `` laptop for the kids and am sad this case does n't come in that size but i am happy enough with the case logic i will get one of those
i searched through all of amazon 's laptop sleeves and this was the only one that had everything i wanted i am using this with my # inch macbook pro it fits in very nicely and the sleeve has both velcro straps and elastic corners to keep the laptop secure the secondary pouch is perfect for storing almost anything you need here is what i can fit into the pouch -lrb- tight squeeze <unk> digital passport external hard <unk> logitech usb mousemouse <unk> <unk> price , lifetime <unk> , retractable handles this is the sleeve to get if you need to travel with all your laptop accessories without crying around a clunky case
i wanted a carry case which was not too bulky but offered decent protection for my thin toshiba notebook this one fit the bill very well i ca n't quite figure out the logic of the velcro closing arrangement although it does work ok the quality is very good and i can recommend it
i read many reviews , did lots of research before deciding on this bag it arrived promptly and is absolutely quality made after reading the reviews , i hesitated purchasing a # `` <unk> - many reviewers indicated that their # `` computers were tightly <unk> and there was no room for the adapter , etc . this bag is well constructed , holds my # `` gaming computer securely and has a velcro pocket for the adapter , cords , etc . it has zipper closure and sturdy handles
that sleeve is perfect for my razer blade pro # gb , it fits well and their plenty on space to put my adapter and my external dvd writer when going to
this has been a lifesaver for my laptop i have a # . # & # # ; and it works great it keeps my surface free of scratches and is able to buffer any little bumps it <unk>
this fits my new laptop perfectly and i love the color i got it for a lot better price on amazon and they were n't out of stock like everywhere else
i purchased this laptop sleeve as a christmas gift for my daughter to go with her new laptop , a sony vaio she absolutely loved it - the quality is good , the <unk> is great , not to mention a good price and fast shipping i am very pleased with the product and would recommend it to anyone
i think i looked at every laptop sleeve offered by amazon ; a very <unk> task bought my very first computer in april and wanted something special to protect it , and i am crazy for color this could not be more perfect - the price , quality , shape , brilliant colors the # zipper pulls are a good thing my lap top is # . # `` and the fit is great i do n't use the sleeve just when away from home i leave my laptop in it when it 's not in use , on my <unk> to keep it <unk> ; and it 's just so pretty to look at extremely pleased with this product
i was so disappointed with the fit ... the bottom was too small i just bought a new macbook and i 'm trying to keep it as new as possible but i guess i 'm just going to have to keep looking ... ugh this really sucks do not buy this item
it 's not real carbon fiber , it 's a soft vinyl overlay on a thick case it does function nicely as a protective macbook case , but there are better cases out there i definitely would n't buy it again
just got the case today and after reading bad reviews i was a bit skeptical of my purchase overall the product is just as it seems on in the picture however , there are no holes on the bottom of the case to help filter the air vents on the macbook causing the computer to overheat for paying over # dollars i am not impressed this case is strictly for the look and may be damaging your computer more than protecting it i would recommend that if you are looking for a protective case that will not harm your computer buy a shell case
it blocks the venting on the back of the laptop . it is december # and only recently has the bottom started to deteriorate i threw away the top cover as it was the main <unk> blocking the ventilation in the back when the laptop was open
i love it after a year of using this product it still looks great people 's eyes pop when they see it one minor note is that the cutout for the power adapter forces you to plug in the adapter in the reverse direction which can be a pain if you need to plug in everything at once -lrb- which i do not
the carbon fiber look is sexy , and it snaps on pretty easily it 's soft on the inside , like a thin felt , but very rigid and protective against hits or scratches , but probably not drops . its a good case to have , adds a little bulk though if it were about $ # it 'd be an awesome deal , but for $ # , it 's a good case with good protection but you 'll want a protective carrying case case or back , i still feel nervous walking more than # feet with $ #
a unique excellent product i 've read reviews that the cutout for the apple logo is off it will be off if the top cover is installed upside down discovered that and set it right side up overall i 'm very satisfied and too my co-workers wished there was one made for the their non mac laptops
this notebook cover is absolutely beautiful i did n't think that i was going to like it after i heard that it felt like leather -lrb- i thought it was going to feel like hard like the carbon fiber on <unk> -rrb- however , it took me about # minutes to appreciate that feel everyone who sees it <unk> and <unk> over it i think the price is a little steep , but i 'm pretty pleased with my purchase after how much you spend for the macbook pro , i guess i should n't complain i was <unk> about covering up my macbook , because of how great looked , but it enhances and already great looking product
this was an amazing investment it looks great , feels great , easy to install , and has not slipped off my mac book this case protects without compromising my mac 's original beauty definitely an amazing product ! love it , love it , love it ! !
dsi premium shadow carbon fiber case for # . # `` aluminum macbook and # . # `` aluminum macbook proi just got my first macbook pro after finally giving up on <unk> i looked for a protective case/cover at best buy and at the apple store but decided to check what amazon had to offer i am very pleased with this case it is very well constructed , fits perfectly , is very pleasing to the touch and looks great thanks amazon for finding this wonderful product
one of the sturdiest laptop protection units that i have purchased , excellent styling , quality product and fit you will not be disapointed , i have been very pleased at the asthetics usability and durability of the xgear shadow premium carbon
