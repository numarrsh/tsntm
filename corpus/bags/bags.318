fits my # & # # ; # white macbook perfectly love the colors , they are so <unk> , and the feel is nice i feel safe carrying my labtop in it no problem they even have great customer service ca n't ask for more
i needed a durable yet cute case to bring to school with me i 've gotten so many compliments on the pattern itself and it 's done a great job at keeping my laptop safe i own an asus laptop and it fits perfectly
i love this case it 's sooo soft on the inside , and i love the pattern everyone asks me where i got it , and i tell them a week later , they had similar ones it 's an amazing laptop case
this was exactly what i was looking for to keep my new surface # the surface # slides in and out easily with just a little extra room all around the fabric is beautiful and the lining soft not a lot of padding but that 's what i wanted still padded enough to protect from jostling and bumps
i just got this case on wednesday and i love it my laptop fits perfectly with my charger included in the bag too i will be buying more from these seller
bought this sleeve for my <unk> daughter she loved the design the laptop fits snugly inside and seems to be well protected from scratching by the soft fabric on the inside of the sleeve it also is rather nicely padded to provide a nice cushion
i love this carrier i love the fabric design and the protection it offers my laptop my daughter loved it too she took mine and i ended up buying another one
i was taking my laptop back and forth from school and wanted to get a thin shell case to provide some extra protection and this sleeve was the perfect choice the colors are beautiful , it has held up to daily use for the last two months with no end in sight - stitching , zipper , inside liner , etc . the colors are n't as vibrant in person as they are on the picture , but i like it better a little bit less bright anyways it 's perfect to protect my laptop from anything i have it in my backpack with and keeps it cleaner and has saved it from a few spills i 'd buy another one if i find another pattern i like
this blue # -in- # air # -inch rubberized hard case and keyboard cover worked out fine for what i needed this is not a mac that is actively used by children i love the blue color especially on the keyboard
i originally wrote a negative review because i got the wrong item in the mail after writing the native review i got contacted by the seller and he shipped me the correct item at no additional charge the case itself fits great and i love the color the rubber keyboard cover however does not fit correctly other than that i really love the case
this thing is so darn cute ! i love the color and it was very easy to install on my macbook air the letters on the keyboard cover are slightly off but it is hardly noticeable for the price , this product is a must buy !
i bought this for my sister 's birthday and it fit perfectly it is snug-fitting and the apple shines through it is true to color the keyboard cover was good as well
i love this color my macbook air is now the color of a bright <unk> <unk> apple provides good protection against spills and bumps also , holding and carrying it with the case feels more secure since it 's not as slippery as just holding the laptop all ports are <unk> and it adds very minimal weight to my air
very shock <unk> has that nasty scent from new fibers of this type of material , its like new shoe scent but other than that , it even fits my laptop with a hardshell -lrb- acer c # -rrb- on it
got it for my # . # & # # ; samsung chromebook as replacement for my diy <unk> case fits and protects my laptop perfectly and looks nice love the front pocket for the charger and the soft inside i 'm very happy with what i received , also the shipping was quicker than i 'd expected highly recommend it
this computer case was everything we needed - great protection for computer notebook - even bubble protection inside , outside pocket for power cable , roomy enough that the zipper is n't stretched we love this case - unlike case logic laps- # - # . # - inch <unk> sleeve -lrb- black -rrb- which has no extra pockets and is so tight the zipper barely closes so , this <unk> was such a relief after struggling to make the logic case work
bought it for my # . # & # # ; asus x # ca and it fits well and has a nice texture it 's a good case if you want to stick it in a bag or something ; it 's slim but there is not much room in the pocket for anything beyond the charger it 's good for the cost , and about as protective as you could expect from a sleeve type of case
this case replaced a roocase that i returned because it was too thin and very stinky fits my samsung tab pro # . # 's width and height perfectly it ships with a piece of good quality closed cell foam which eliminates the excess depth pocket is <unk> zipper may be the weak point there is some resistance when zipping i put some dry <unk> on the <unk> with a <unk> neoprene odor was faint and dissipated in a few hours wish it came in colors or prints
it was not the same size as posted and could n't fit on to my laptop very disappointing to wait all that time to not even be able to use it
i ordered this for my new macbook pro i triple checked that it was for the right laptop , and from the photos and description this is for the newer models without the cd drive - wrong i got it and it was for an older model with the cd drive i ended up giving it to my mother-in-law because it was perfect for her computer but completely wrong for mine contact seller before ordering and <unk> check they are sending you the right case
the image appears to show a white case , while in fact , i received a clear case . it is nothing like the image and i am sorely dissapointed , upset , and frustrated
i ordered this case in yellow because it looked so cheery and because it looked fairly opaque , but it is actually more of a dried mustard color and is very see through i was expecting a bright summery yellow the picture does not look anything like the real product i order cases often because they tend to crack <unk> and need to be replaced this one seems to be no exception the quality seems poor , but it will last for a few months
order came in a timely fashion , and the color was nice the keyboard cover fit perfectly , though the laptop snap case was too big even though i am sure i ordered the correct size needless to say , the company contacted me to fix the issue for which i am <unk> i would order with them again , so long as i asked the right questions as to dimensions for different versions of the laptop size
this product does just the job , for a very low price im a college student and dont have the money to spend big bucks on a expensive case , but this one works just as good it has a nice matte finish that is soft and stylish i also got sent a green one by mistake which i ended up liking better the only problem was that it had a few cracks in it due to shipping , i contacted the company and they said i should have a new one in a few days although i have not receive the new case quiet yet , i am really happy with how the company responded to the problem and how the overall case looks
i got this for my new macbook pro a # - the case does n't fit the keyboard cover is not centered on the keys either it looks like this may fit better for the older versions of the mac pro but definitely not the newer versions , specifically model a #
the hard case is great however the keyboard cover sticks to the keys and appears to be discolored i am not sure if the material is wrinkled or so thin it ca n't sit above the keys this my honest opinion , hopefully this review will help with this problem
i liked the case . it is not expensive and it does it 's job the only issue i had was with the keyboard cover while it is good , it was n't transparent and so it was n't effective for my keyboard when backlit it made the keyboard opaque also the keyboard cover is thick , a bit , so the key impressions take a bit more of an effort to get the <unk> <unk> i just used the case without the keyboard cover
the case itself was not how i expected it to be it 's very sheer and the keyboard protector does not match with the case in the picture it is a light purple , in purple it is more of a darker purple the quality of the keyboard and case are pretty good
great service ; quick and efficient , and the product was exactly as ordered for free shipping i expected something to go wrong but all went well except , the packaging the case came in could have been a little more protected as it was a hard case and also the color is a little darker purple than the picture , which i am fine with , i still like it , however , i would suggest a different picture to advertise
i love the case the color is exactly as pictured and exactly what i wanted other sellers do not have this exact color as theirs is more tiffany blue it is slightly transparent for those who want to see decals through the case but : the bottom of my case does n't snap on perfectly it 's slightly loose on the corners , but it does n't fall off the keypad cover is a little thin my last one was a little thicker , so it 's different all in all , though , the case does the job and i love the color i wo n't be returning my product
for once , the picture is true to its color ! ! love love love the color the keyboard cover is an exact match to the laptop case the apple sign is n't cut out -lrb- which is what i wanted because dirt <unk> -rrb- , but the apple sign is still easily seen through the soft , matte , sorta see through case fits my # & # # ; macbook pro # perfectly because it has the cd cut out so this case is ** not ** for the new version macbooks with the retina display had it for about a month , doing great so far hope that helps
its to hard to get my macbookpro # -lrb- originally released february # -rrb- in there . too lazy to return it as i threw packaging away . if there was option to give # starts i would have
i purchased the grey color and liked the handy concealed handles and the overall look of the case it is a snug fit for a macbook pro -lrb- # build -rrb- ; outer dimensions # & # # ; x # / # if you like using a wireless mouse with a usb receiver -lrb- eg : logitech <unk> receiver -rrb- it gets a bit tricky using the case everyday i could have lived with that by taking the receiver out but the deal-breaker for me was the lack of storage space for the power adaptor although it has a zippered compartment on one side you pretty much have to force the adaptor in it would have been great if the pocket was <unk> ... very disappointed but back it goes btw the stated product dimensions are not quite accurate , the actual outer dimensions are # . # x #
not at all disappointed suites perfect for me just that it was n't the expected shade i expected the bag to be too slim and rigid to take in more stuff it takes in # laptop cable into the zip # cell phone and charger into one pouch -lrb- it remains sleek until this point pouch and wallet into another pouch if needed -lrb- only then it will seem bulged out handle ribbons are very comfortable to hold on the bag overall , i 'm satisfied and kept getting compliments for the bag selection
it is a good case overall had a zipper fall out once but after tightening the hook holding it , never had problem again material feels nice on the outside and the case has good cushion i feel like my rmbp # & # # ; is well protected however , inside of the case does n't look and feel as nice as the outside , and seemed a little dirty when i first got it
this bag is really great i have a # macbook pro # inch and it fits very snugly because of this the side pocket does n't really fit anything that well you could probably fit a small cable in it there are also little & # # ; pockets & # # ; that the handles go into , and you can fit something in there i am planning on keeping my hard drive in there overall , pretty great case high quality , soft inside
i really like this case it was exactly what i expected , in size and color it fits my macbook air # nicely , and the inside is very soft the handles tuck away in a little pocket , which is where i keep my jump drive
going to return it i fits my yoga # pro perfectly <unk> a little too perfect theres literally no room left over i have to even remove the usb dongle for my mouse thats pretty small and it still wont fit without anything else the the side pockets , i can somewhat remove the laptop ok from the case , but with some effort with just the power adapter , it becomes very difficult the case quality is so good and the style and everything , man if this were just a little bit bigger i would have no problem keeping it i am looking into their other models in hopes to find something that works better for my laptop so far , good company
just bought this item and like it a lot my lenovo yoga # -inch laptop fits into it well there is also a zipped pocket on the reverse side that i didnt see in the posted images . would recommend
i use this every day for work i hated carrying my mac book air in my purse or in a sleeve this way i can carry it separately and it is small enough that i can not cram all kinds of things in there the price is pretty much unbeatable
this is an attractive , well designed bag which is a good snug fit and yet easy to insert or retrieve the computer the outside zippered pocket also fits an ipad , so that both can be carried the handles provide for easy carrying i highly recommend this product , particularly for the price the seller 's service was prompt and efficient i am very happy with this purchase
looks nice and is quite protective fits my samsung # . # exactly right the pockets are a bit snug but one holds a half inch paperback manual and the smaller holds the power cord and a few other small things
fits perfectly and feels secure this looks really sleek if i could have a wish , i would add a shoulder strap but the product is fantastic as is
it may have little frays here and there , but it 's a <unk> cover , should be expected but i gave it a five star rating cuz it 's light , can fit the things i need for school and the exact fit for my laptop plus i 'm a very & # # ; <unk> & # # ; kinda gal and it fits my style
it is highly qualified i like the color and the quality i bought it for my boyfriend he was quite satisfied with this item and it is cheap , good for students
perfect size for my macbook air # ' fits snug but yet has this really soft padding in it i put it in a backpack anyway so it gets more protection there it is a bit darker than pictures but i knew that was likely the case when buying it plenty of room for chords in the front pocket and a mouse will fit where the straps go if you needed to stash one away
i ordered this case based on a picture and it was better than i expected absolutely love it so glad for the high quality inside and out of this case
i have a # & # # ; mac air that i carrying around campus i mostly take my notes on my laptop or tablet , so i carry a very small backpack that wo n't my laptop wo n't fit in one thing i always look for in a laptop case is that it needs to be protective enough that my laptop wo n't bend or break if i accidentally drop it the actually padding of the case is quite thick and foamy , it seems to do a good job of absorbing shock i had read the other reviews , and initially i was concerned with not having enough room ... but it is quite roomy , i can easily fit two a # folders with paperwork in with my laptop i do however , carry my charger in my backpack , you could technically fit it in , but it would be a little bulky over all , i love the case , and i 've received a lot of compliments on it it was definitely worth the purchase
this case is made out of a very , very cheap material i guess that 's what i get for the price do n't buy this , get something a little more expensive that is going to last longer
smells so bad that breathing in that <unk> of nail polish can not be normal do not buy trust me . i did not listen to the reviews and thought that if i washed it , the smell would leave & # # ; the smell is bad , and the case gets dirty fast
if i could give this product no stars i would i received the package within a few days and immediately upon arrival i tried to put my macbook in it and it did n't fit i requested a return immediately and a little more than a day later i received an email back requesting a picture to prove it did n't fit and my model number i was <unk> that they would ask for a photo , and did not send one i got an email back telling me i have a different model and proceeded to tell me that the case does n't fit , as if i had n't figured that part out yet they then told me to give it to a family member or a friend or send it in for an exchange with # % off i just want to return my product as the company is making this extremely difficult i had to contact amazon now amazon is very good about returns however top case is absolutely not i would not recommend this case as top case deserves absolutely no service with the way they treat customers
this product was good and matched the case when i first got it after a month though both of the zippers broke and it was <unk> thankfully amazon refunded my money even though it was past the return date this product is not a good long term case
so the handles are put inside the zipper channel , not outside - so no ability to zip it up if you use handles smell is bad , but seems to be going away after a couple days but this is n't going to work for me inquired to return , and getting a hassle so will just put in my <unk> pile nice concept if you do n't need the handles though three star for product , but lost a star cause of return hassle
when this product arrived , i was a bit worried that it would n't fit my macbook , as it looked small but ... when i put my laptop inside bingo ... like a glove my only gripe about this product is the intense chemical smell that <unk> it it smelled very strong so strong that you could smell it from several feet away i have had this case hanging outside on a <unk> for the past few days although the smell has dissipated , it is not completely gone
it looks just like the picture not much more to add , but there is a smell more like an oder , like an <unk> shop or factory oh and it cam super fast i ordered sunday night and it was here by thursday
does exactly what the description says and also fits my macbook pro # `` perfectly i bought the case in the turquoise color and it does seem like it could get dirty pretty easily but thats no big deal
i am super careful with my computer and yet , # weeks after buying these they were shattered on the corners . this is not misuse , the material is not strong enough for the
i like the case and the keyboard cover unfortunately the case cracked the first day on the sides around the corners of the laptop the rubber & # # ; feet & # # ; to keep it from sliding come off on a regular basis my least favorite part is that the keyboard cover allows such minimal light through that when in a darker room and/or at night i have to take it off to see
the white and blue chevron fit perfectly on my keyboard , though it does slow down my typing a bit i think the added resistance to the keys is what does it the hard case snapped on easily and has n't come off in the months that i 've had it it super cute as a combo
i like the product i like the idea that i have two key board covers whenever , i get bored , i can switch i like this design better , it covers the whole lap top without falling off -lrb- unlike my old one -rrb-
i ordered this for my granddaughter 's computer who 's a freshman in college she loved it the color is her favorite color fits her macbook pro perfect love the two keyboard protectors
for the price , it arrived with the google label , which appears sewn on the inside , partially lopsided upon further <unk> , it is glued on , not sewn , and completely fell off when trying to straighten it it does fit the hp chromebook # like a glove , but it is not worth the price of <unk> save yourself the trouble and get an inexpensive sub - $ # case i bought a generic case from fry 's that i am far , far happier with and cost about $ # i returned the google sleeve for a full refund
i bought this from the play store , and while it does fit the chromebook perfectly , it is very thin and would do nothing to protect the chromebook in the event of a drop there are more durable alternatives available for # of the price
it 's nice to have a custom sleeve purpose made for the form factor of the chromebook # the padding seems a little thin in comparison to other sleeves , but the fact that it fits tight to the chromebook is nice for keeping a small profile that <unk> the chromebook # i like it and the amazon price makes it much more attractive than the play price it is obviously a premium over other generic sleeves even at the amazon price , so whether it is worth it is more of a function of whether you like this sort of thing than whether it is worth it if padding were thicker i might give it another star as is , it is good but not great
very nicely made to fit the <unk> # chromebook snugly , with room to insert a chromebook manual , if desired higher in price than the others , but probably worth the additional workmanship in construction , i.e . padding protection
bought this when i purchased the hp google chromebook fits perfectly and is durable and basically does what it was designed to do this is a soft and flexible sleeve with reinforced seams at the points where zipper ends and the on one corner seems designed to last
the chromebook fits into this sleeve snugly and firmly it keeps the unit from opening while in your bag and accidentally turning on their is room to leave a bluetooth mouse adapter in place as long as your careful the case has a nice feel to it and wo n't slip from your grip definitely worth the few dollars it cost
this google sleeve case really fits my chromebook perfectly like it says and i got it light and solid in my own hand the binding seams are well sewn , the zip snugs securely and i enjoyed the soft touch <unk> a lot
not to argue <unk> , this protective sleeve is a perfect fit and nicely color coordinated with the hp chromebook # the zipper closure has proven to be effortless it is a purchase i would repeat if/when necessary bonus : if using a wireless mouse , the sleeve is an effective mousepad even on surfaces that are not flat
wanted to get a sleeve that matched the nice design of my hp chromebook - and this seemed to fit the bill it does look nice , but is a tad thin and will not provide much impact protection i really just wanted something to keep the chromebook when not in use - i 'll see how it does for travel after my next trip expect it will do okay in my laptop bag
i just purchased a chromebook a couple of weeks ago and thought that some sort of protective cover might be in order i do n't drop my electronics routinely , but it gets bumped when put away in a drawer or cabinet , or when being carried and i just wanted something to keep it relatively safe in the past , i have owned a macbook air and i purchased a similar cover for it what i liked better about the mba cover was that it was more matte and not as slippery to the touch i do n't understand why companies make things to protect the exterior of electronics and then make them of a slippery plastic substance this one is n't as bad as others , but if -lrb- like me -rrb- you lose your grip easily , i 'd prefer something more matte slippery quality aside , i do like the cover it snapped on easily -lrb- and i am about as <unk> as they come with such things -rrb- and gave a bit of color to an otherwise boring white machine the price was n't bad either , so i 'm happy with the purchase
overall , i am happy with my purchase but i have to say that the color is different than the picture its more of a light pink with an orange tint - if it was the right color i would have given it # stars
my hard shell pink lap top case is perfect i love it i did n't rate a five star only because of delivery issues but overall customer service handled the situation and <unk> me for the inconvenience
after purchasing my hp chromebook # , i wanted something to customize it so i bought the <unk> shell case from ipearl inc. not only did it arrive earlier than expected but it was also a great buy it makes me love my chromebook even more i also like the two stands on the back of the shell case which makes it able to stand up overall , a great product
great cover for my chromebook easy to snap on , fits perfectly , and has prevented my laptop from getting scratched and banged up i ordered the pink and it 's definitely true to color will be ordering more in different colors
i wanted the cover because the white can show smudges and fingerprints easily this just clicks right on with nor problem the purple one is slightly transparent and the black one is mostly opaque there are plenty of holes for the speakers and the vents the feet are a nice addition but i do n't use them much a worth addition to your chromebook
we bought a white chromebook for our daughter but as purple 's her favourite colour we were so happy to see such a great purple in the range she loves it and her friends are very envious i love these covers they look so good they snap on easily , they protect my precious hp chromebook and the colours are gorgeous the orange cover matches my new <unk> orange <unk> <unk> the white one looks great over my partner 's white chromebook and the delivery was so fast to australia
i bought this to keep my white hp chromebook clean on the outside and it 's the exact thing i needed the fit was exact and the two parts stay on perfectly it does n't add any <unk> weight or feel to the chromebook the feet make using the chromebook on a flat surface very comfortable i would recommend this item
i love my shell case for my new chromebook what a great addition amazon is my favorite place to go for things i need and i love your service have an awesome day
i love this product and the purple color it 's clearly not meant for full protection , but i noticed early that my white chromebook was getting stained yellow from the case i had this definitely has been protecting my chromebook from further stains and scratches great for <unk> , and they 're fairly cheap , so i 'm thinking about getting a second color
this is a great idea and great product , not difficult to apply , and is convenient to remove if needed colors are very cool is a great product for keeping your chrome book looking
it is a nice cover to keep your chromebook clean it will not provide any spill or drop protection it is for cosmetic change only snaps on easily comes in two pieces - one for the top and one for the bottom then bottom as two feet that can be <unk> to use on a desk or hard surface i purchased it just to keep the fingerprints off my white chromebook
this is a very nice looking cover it keeps the white , hard to keep clean chromebook protected from dirt and scratches but it is not going to be much protection if i drop it it is just a thin plastic cover so it 's great for protection from dirt and scratches , just not from drops
great cover and fits my hp # chromebook perfectly snaps into place quickly and easily this cover is not meant as protection against drops , but it provides good protection <unk> , smudges and fingerprints also love the # retractable legs on the bottom piece
i bought a chromebook and could n't find a cover for it in any store cause it 's still a fairly new model went to best buy and a couple of other reputable stores and none of them carried anything of the sort i was surprised to find them on amazon and for a <unk> # bucks i bought a blue one but they are also available in a bunch of other colors it is well made , takes only seconds to snap on and fits like a glove i loved it so i do n't have any cons to <unk> about
i bought this for my new <unk> chromebook to help keep it clean it snapped on very easily , and the places where it connects appear to be sturdy enough to last a long time it 's very thin , which is nice if you do n't want a lot of bulk probably not the most protective cover , but that remains to be seen i would definitely recommend this product
the bag is beautiful and well built , unfortunately it was a little smaller than expected i purchased it for my husband on father 's day and he loves it so far
this bag was okay for the price it 's nice leather but the quality suffers -- the bag came defective with broken zippers -lrb- internal and the back zipper -rrb- i emailed for a replacement -- it costs $ # to return the item so i figured i can fix it myself i was able to do so and the zippers work and look great i do recommend this bag for the business casual <unk> commuter
okay first and <unk> it really looks cool but it smells like a <unk> chemical bath it took about # weeks to get but it looks pretty cool i was expecting rich leather but hey it was # bucks or so im hoping for the best
this case fits my writing needs very well the leather is of great quality it is not however made for large laptops however mine fits alright , however snug great for <unk> or other documents that you may use in lectures or business
i have to admit that i had low expectations for this briefcase i expected shoddy stitching , scratched leather , and cheap parts in fact , the leather is pretty decent , not scratched , and the hardware is quality and , it smells wonderful my only complaint is the capacity at the most , you will get a macbook pro -lrb- # inch model -rrb- , charger , and a few legal pads in there that 's about it
this is a very nice case for my purpose - seems solidly built and was delivered in a timely fashion the hardware appears sturdy and better than other cases i have had recently
i really like this case i love the distressed leather look and that size is just right i am a computer technician so i typically carry a lot of equipment around with me which gets quite heavy i use this messenger bag to carry a few light grab and go items it easily holds a dell # & # # ; latitude , charger , mouse , ethernet cable , backup drive , small camera , portable battery backup , credit card reader , pens and business cards even full the weight is very manageable the interior liner is made of some type of lightweight canvas and so far has held up really well
bought this for my husband and he loves it ... the smell of the leather is awesome and so many compartments ... makes his work <unk> much easier love the two tone look perfect size for a laptop
fits my # inch ultra book well it could use more compartments inside the leather is good quality the strap is long , which i like great bag for the
this was purchased as a gift for my best friend when i saw it i said to myself `` if indiana jones had a laptop this is what he 'd carry it in . it looks like it been around the world a time or two and was just so different from the other attache cases i had looked at my friend loved it and gets compliments all the time from coworkers so happy i chose this for him
it is very well made , superior quality ; looks much more expensive than the actual cost i am always complimented on the look of the bag this product is a best buy
i love this bag i travel a lot and use this as my carry on / laptop bag it can take a lot of abuse , and scratches and dings just lend it more character you will have to invest in a good leather <unk> oil though , but trust me it 's worth it this bag just looks more and more awesome with age
while this is a good looking bag , i think it is too large on my back -lrb- and i 'm an average-sized woman -rrb- and the laptop compartment is way too hard to get to in a pinch i also feel like this thing looks like i 'm trying to hard to look young not my style and not as utilitarian as i 'd hoped i ' l stick with a cross body bag
this backpack is much larger than i thought it was going to be for me , it 's a little too large for everyday use , so i 'm going to use it just when i travel
