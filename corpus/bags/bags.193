i bought this case for my macbook pro the main thing i had read about this case was how snug fitting it is so i thought this would be the case , particularly for my last generation , slightly larger macbook pro unfortunately it 's kind of loose and the top <unk> open in a weird way ; it definitely would n't stay in without the elastic strap also , i was really hoping for the white details but they are red -lrb- this is n't really a big deal , just more information because the page is n't very clear about the color -rrb- very high quality though , not sure if i will keep this product yet
i overall like the design of this case , it fits very snugly on the macbook pro and even though it does n't have a full closing the computer stays secure in the case macbook retina will not stay in snugly
my dad has a sleeve for his computer made by acme made so i went out to find one for my new computer this one was on sale and i bought it it will fit the earlier models of the macbook pro but it is a little big with my # ' retina however , i love the material and i love the protection it gives my computer to be fair , it says with will fit a # ' macbook pro but does n't specifically say the newer ones which are thinner i guess that is more to blame on apple for <unk> everything the same none the less , great product
i bought this one because they did n't have any macbook air covers in this color its definitely a snug fit for my # inch macbook air i appreciate the wide elastic band - keeps it extra safe
i received this as a christmas gift in # and have put this product to the test i am a bike commuter and my weekly school rides -lrb- when i carry my mac -rrb- are around # miles a week and this case has kept up with all the <unk> and <unk> going on inside my bag slim design does not take up valuable bag <unk> the macbook in very <unk> material on the outside is tough and stain resistant -lrb- well proven <unk> plastic sides prevent anything with sharp corners from doing <unk> strap makes casing and <unk> the mac extremely <unk> is simple yet beautiful , red stitching on the sides provides an elegant <unk> because this case has an opening in the top there is always the back of the mind fear that something could get inside it this has never happened since i have been using the case , but it could annoy some people this case is worth every penny it will stand up to almost anything you throw at it the functionality is near perfect and the simple design is very attractive
the simplest solutions are often the best this sleeve provides protection from scratching and minor dings the elastic band does a fair job at containing the macbook stitching and construction are very high quality the design is understated and elegant works well carried on its own or used inside a bag i do wish the stitching on one side stopped short enough for access to the macbook charging port if you are mostly careful with your mac book , this sleeve provides all the extra protection you will need if your macbook is prone to falls or rough treatment , you may want something more robust i am very happy and will continue to use and recommend this product
it 's so nice and cute i love it . . it 's very good to use and nice for mac . . but the ac adapter ca n't insert to bag but really good . . # stars for
bought this for my lenovo yoga # pro fits perfectly -lrb- the y # p is slightly wider than the macbook pro , but has less depth -rrb- and it fits in this case perfectly leaves less than # inch space at the top , and elastic band <unk> it nicely no room for accessories , but the case is nice and thin and barely adds any bulk to the ultrabook -lrb- i use it in a backpack , so thickness is an issue for me -rrb- there are also very thin polycarbonate panels on the front and back which provide great protection against sharp impacts or punctures however , there is just thick padding on the side border , no polycarbonate it is a little pricey , but does the job very well as y # p cases are hard to find easy to slip in and out , and the elastic band keeps everything nice and tight if you have a # . # & # # ; <unk> that matches the dimensions of the y # p or macbook pro , this case is the way to go
very low profile and perfect for slipping in my bag adds very little weight , which is part of the reason i got the air in the first place , so i did not want something to add bulk or weight this did the trick
i love the design and materials of this laptop sleeve it truly protects macs and other pc 's from scratches , while allowing to take them in a handbag with keys and other potential scratching elements it does not add weight to the laptop , which is one of the reasons i like it the <unk> have had this sleeve for over # months and i think that the materials and colours are holding well
it 's perfect for storing your laptop in a backpack , messenger bag or just carrying around the house it 's really not thick enough to offer much drop protection but it 's ideal for protecting your laptop against bumps and scratches
- protects <unk> <unk> & <unk> <unk> even at the discounted price i bought it at -lrb- $ # . # - this does not fit retina display macbook pros the fit will be too loose and can fall out - there is still a possibility of your notebook falling out if you 're carrying the case upside down this sleeve is n't plain neoprene the outside is neoprene , the inside is felt , and sandwiched in between those is a thin plastic sheet there is also red contrast stitching around the edge overall i 'm pretty satisfied with the purchase
i 've gotten so many compliments on this laptop sleeve it 's very well made and durable the band is more teal in reality , which i actually prefer my computer has a clear case , and it fits in here snugly
i love this sleeve my macbook pro fits perfectly inside the sleeve and does n't add any bulk it has nice padding , so it is protective and it looks awesome , i get compliments all the time nice and sleek
i love the style and shape , however , the workmanship was very disappointing patent leather is not durable enough for a computer bag in addition the handle constantly got stuck i sent the bag back it cost me money to find out it was not the bag i was looking for
as others have pointed out the bag is large it is a nice weekend bag but i would n't use it for a laptop case the organization was not as described it had limited organization i ended up sending it back since it did not fit my needs as a laptop case it cost me about $ # to send back and i still have not received my refund after almost # <unk> from sending it back
i bought this bag about one year ago and have used it every work day i really like the design , but a few months ago the zipper partially broke and now it 's totally done for $ # i would expect a bag like that to last a lot longer than a year i am disappointed and not really sure what to do to fix it i searched a long time for a bag that i liked and i loved this one , but i ca n't afford to buy a new $ # every year if the zipper were still working it would get a much higher rating
i do like the bag although i had to put wd # on the wheels so it rolled , at first it felt like i was dragging the bag after i <unk> the wheels it rolled a whole lot better
i received my working cute bag about a month ago i love how it keeps me organized for work and helps me carry everything i need without breaking my back mostly , i love the way it looks ! ! everywhere i go , people tell me over and over `` cute bag ! i 've never heard that before with any of the other `` practical bags `` i 've used it 's really well made and i 'm sure it will last a long time
i love my <unk> roller bag after resisting the `` roller bag `` my shoulder could not survive another trade show thank you <unk> for making a bag thats just that , cute unlike so many of the utilitarian roller bags out there this one has the functionality but i roll it around with pride
it 's hard to find cute vegan rolling bags , and this one is great mine is peacock , and i love the color and the <unk> on the material there are plenty of pockets inside for all of my gadgets , and a lot of room for bulkier items the handle folds away and the bag zips closed over it quite nicely - it can definitely be used as a large shoulder bag if you want the service rep i worked with when i had some ordering problems was amazing - very fast and courteous responses to all questions i would definitely recommend the bag
great design but weight wise i do n't think this can hold a lot the side strap ripped off in the first few days of me using it i love samsonite bags and i think they make the best laptop bags but i was n't happy with this one
this bag was <unk> as made in usa , but it was not its a decent laptop bag , but thats about it i was on the fence about sending it back , but for the price , it was n't worth the time
i loved this bag when i bought it , it looks really sleek and high quality i 've used it for a couple months now , and the sides are beginning to tear due to daily use i do n't abuse this bag at all , but sadly it 's not the most durable i 'll upload a picture or two for reference
this is my # nd xenon tech locker bag in just # months first bag lasted a year before the main zipper came unstitched the # nd bag had a handle come unstitched after just # months of moderate use
i got this case to replace the one i got at walmart and has worked out great like the way it looks and all the storage options for the days i need to bring my laptop there is plenty of room for it and carry all my usual work stuff very durable still looks great since the day i got it
i have had this for several weeks and use it for work everyday to carry laptop , tablet , cell phone , papers , office stuff it works well , is easy to access , looks nice and seems well made i did wish that it stood up better when you set it down it tends to flop to one side easily even with the laptop in it
this is a nice bag and it holds a lot more than it looks like it can hold the only knock is that there is a little annoying squeak made by the loop and strap where it connects to the suitcase
really happy with the bag layout , great storage options , small , and fits my work life it loses a star for the weight , being a touch heavy and the straps are squeaky
i love this bag for my laptop , is really nice and functional , is easy to carry and the laptop travels safe . i love the fabric it is a high quality product
this carries my zenbook # . # `` ultrabook and ipad # -lrb- along with cables and ac adapters -rrb- as well as papers , documents , folders , pens , etc . wonderfully the only small problem i noticed is a small squeak when it is under a full load other than that , this is a tough , rugged , and professional looking bag that does what it promises
i bought this bag for my husband and he really likes it it appears to be high quality and quite sturdy the outer pockets are just the right size , and the smaller outside pocket is lined with a special material that makes it easy to get things in and out of it -lrb- i.e . cell phone -rrb- the handles are nice and strong - the inside pockets/compartments make it very versatile
worked great for the first couple of months , and just when the time frame for returns ended , the zipper broke i had been using it gently and appropriately , and am very unhappy at the wasted money
purchased this last year , well priced never go <unk> use it because my # year old liked it so he took it and made it a backback for school just recommended it to a work colleague and went to look at the bag and found it torn around hte seam most folks would think well # year old trashed it in # <unk> of school but not in this case priced right but the quality is questionable for the brand
just received my order i could not open one of the zippers samsonite should do better quality control amazon very helpful with replacement if next order is also defective , i am not buying any samsonite products ever again
got one as a gift after # months of light use , the exterior has holes and the interior is coming apart at the seams either i got a bad one , or samsonite takes no pride in the quality of this product line
i bought this backpack for an upcoming trip in hopes that it would ease the process of going through security i carry a laptop , two tablets , a plethora of chargers , and a few other gadgets this backpack had no problems holding them and keeping them organized the laptop compartment is a plus as it 's one last thing one needs to take out before passing security checkpoints the size is small enough to be considered a personal bag on nearly every <unk> a huge plus now for the bad i 've used the laptop for three short trips and the stitching is already beginning to fray the samsonite logo on the bottom front is chipping away i own a few samsonite pieces and this is not the quality i expect
i was shopping for a laptop bag for my new macbook pro retina for work the bag came as per how it looked like in photo it has many pockets which i love unfortunately , after a month , the bag is starting to fall apart the stitchings are coming off the compartment that holds the laptop and the velcro since i am an international buyer , i do not think it make sense for me to return it what a waste of money
everything looking fine until i tried the zipper for the notebook computer compartment it was broken yes , i know plastic zippers are supposed to be & # # ; <unk> & # # ; ... so i zipped and unzipped , zipped and unzipped several times it continued to pop open and would not work ... broken zipper sending it back expected so much more from samsonite had planned to order <unk> rolling carry-on from samsonite ... may as well go to local wal-mart or <unk> if this is the best samsonite has to offer would not recommend
when i opened the package , i can smell the very strong chemical smells -lrb- just like <unk> -rrb- in last # days , it was hanging in my garage , i checked # times , the smell is still and very strong we have more than one products from samsonite , none of them has this problem i went to a samsonite store checked the item they sale , i do n't smell anything i bought this for my boy , with this kind problem , i can not keep it and i need to return it
i have taken this bag on # airline trips , loaded with a laptop , battery pack , and a notepad along with a couple of pens and usually a water bottle it is already coming apart at the top where the zipper is sewn into the backpack i am very disappointed and wo n't buy this brand again there is only a # day return policy , but for most of that # days it was sitting in a closet it has been actually used for about # days out of the last # weeks and i am stuck with this thing
i really do n't understand how it started i only carried my laptop in it once to test it out , other than that i was just taking papers to and from work i was in a class yesterday and i went to put some papers in the bag and noticed that a seam on the very top had started to come undone the quality seemed very good up until that point there were actually a lot of things i liked about the bag but for it to start falling apart this early was <unk> i will be returning this item
i bought this for my wife who only occasionally brings her laptop home from work but uses it every day for her lunch and papers and a book to read on the bus she loved it initially but it started to deteriorate over the last couple months with stitching coming out and now the rigid foam pieces that give it its shape are exposed and the bag looks horrible i , like other reviewers , expected more from the samsonite name i will not likely be buying this one as a replacement
i bought this before a # day trip to hawaii it seemed too good to be true for the price , comparable to the everki versa for way , way less it was great all the way to hawaii , tsa was a breeze and all after # days in hawaii all of a sudden the main zipper stopped zipping right i thought it was # faulty zipper , but by the next day one of the front pocket zippers started the same thing : the zippers come apart and get <unk> and wo n't zip there are other reviewers with the same issue , so now you know why they are blowing this backpack out for so cheap too bad because it has some great features i returned this after i got home from my trip and i may just suck it up and spring for the everki now
i bought this in may last year and love it at first then the handle starts to crack i am disappointed as samsonite products are usually well made but i guess i just happen get a bad one off the production line
i had to change the backpack because it was ripped of from the zipper line , the good thing is it was under samsonite guarantee , so they have replaced with a new one , i recommend samsonite <unk>
i was originally very happy with this purchase as the layout and overall design of this for business travel was very good however , after about # months of light to moderate use the threads around the handle began to unravel at an increasingly rapid pace ultimately the <unk> handle became unusable i 've since replaced the bag with a more robust design
the backpack is wonderful ... until you put it on . the straps are small and makes it tough to get in and out . that 's what you get when you order something online
the bag is big enough but the tablet area is too tight for the most modern tablets -lrb- too snug -rrb- the straps are not very wide and keep falling off my shoulder when i wear it on only one side -lrb- and i have big shoulders -rrb- good quality manufacturing but i 'm not crazy about it
i bought this bag and i 'm happy at first because i have so many pockets and a huge space inside however , i realized that i dont need all these pockets and the space if i 'm just using this everyday i 'm now looking for a not too bulky backpack that has enough space for the power cable and mouse oh well , i guess i should just save this bag when i do an air travel . :
i use this unit for working i 'm a doctor and it offers some luxury to the design but definitely it 's not for travel it 's too small o bought it at first for travelling but when it came from amazon and saw the size , i used it for working
i purchased this bag for a # -day trip to italy the bag is very durable ; however , on the second day of my trip , i noticed that the top handle was not properly <unk> and was coming apart unfortunately , the # -day window to <unk> this item expired while i was on my trip what options are available for me to get a replacement bag
this product looks good and functions well but did not hold up i got it so i could have an easy time getting tsa at the airport - and it worked well for that purpose i only got to use it a few times before i noticed a rip at one of the seams by the zipper i just sent it back to samsonite because they offer a fairly good warranty program maybe i just got a defective bag i guess time will tell whatever the case the thing gets # stars
i got this back pack to use daily for college and carry computer , books and others after # months of use the short trips and the stitching started to fray definitely , not the quality i was expecting from a samsonite device
one comment here specified internal size dimensions which suggested that my laptop was compatible with this bag , but that is not true the only problem was that the laptop was too tall to fit within the zipper
i ordered this for my husband for father 's day i was very excited to give him this backpack as it looked to be very high quality however , his # & # # ; laptop would not fit i will have to return this item and continue looking for one that fits a larger laptop
the bag is a well build bag with lots of functions and useful features , for the price it is worth , it is a backpack value for money it has a dedicated slot of laptop and lots of pockets and also a pouch for keys , pens and car keys as well a great bag for traveling and to protect your equipment the inner lining is made with soft felt material that will prevent scratches to your <unk> and sunglasses etc . now for the cons , the bag is quite heavy by itself the bag is big and if are expecting a day pack to move around , this may not be a suitable bag as the dedicated pouches made it quite bulky and heavy if they could make a bag half the size , it will be good
i bought this bag for flight travel as well as daily office commute , considering all the feature it has especially that i need not remove my laptop for tsa i would say its a good sturdy built product i 'm # feet and for me its on the heavier and large built for a daily office commute on public transport
this rucksack is perfect for work , # inch laptop fits very snuggly its comfortable and the zips feel well made , its also got lots of handy pockets for the price it was a very good
it 's a nice backpack for laptop or travel but the portable part seems not strong enough to pick up when it 's heavy other details look nice and lots of things can put into the backpack
really nice for travel since overhead storage on plane is getting smaller and this holds all my travel items safely seems to have all the right pockets and padding the red liner is ok but outside stitching looks pink to my wife and she thought i bought it for her
the samsonite <unk> & <unk> ; n # backpack , is a excellent backpack , the adjustable laptop system , is so good , you can carry different sizes of laptops ! it have a pocket for an additional tablet , i recommend this one
i chose this bag because of the separate laptop compartment ease of access there is plenty of padding protecting what ever you put inside . i can put a shirt and pants for a quick change at work . i like this bag its built <unk>
i carry a macbook air and wanted something to carry extra files with good back support and <unk> design and materials are very good one design oversight is lack of a keys loop i simple removed that from my old backpack and pop riveted into the new one the back padding design is ok but not as good as some other makers found this on sale for $ # online and it was a real value after # months of # day a week use and multiple air trips it still looks new would strongly recommend
well built and nice looking backpack , good materials employed laptop goes in a secure area , there is a lot of space for a tablet , gadgets and more can be opened fully without problems seems to be a little short in lenght , but is ok then is full of stuff my only complaints are the soft material of the handle and shoulder belts , if they were of a stronger material will be an excellent idea also the little belt in the back for <unk> with luggage <unk> too short , i do n't know if samsonite luggage have that standard size , but it seems to small
i bought this for my upcoming trip to hong kong i wanted something that would protect my laptop and be able to carry a book as well as other misc items this is a big bag with substantial padding and can hold a lot the selling points for me were # the price and it 's tsa friendly no fighting to get the laptop out and back in the bag when going through screening
i picked this backpack for the price and the size i like the pockets to hold all my stuff securely i wanted something more lightweight i am very fond of the suitcase strap that can attach the backpack to my overnight bag when i am traveling
its a great backpack , well designed compartments , number of <unk> and so on just one problem : there ` s no protection under it so , probably gon na see scratches and holes if goes to the ground too often
pros : roomy , multiple compartments for storage , sleek <unk> : key fob holder would have been nice , but not a deal breaker i 'm a grad student and i recently purchased this bag to carry on days when i have a heavy load this is a very well organized bag i can carry a couple of very large plastic binders and still have room for my lunch , as well as my laptop with chargers for the laptop and cell with ease i found that the key holder would be nice , but not a deal breaker i simply use the smaller compartment at the top of the bag for keys and place my cell in the lower medium portion of the bag
i purchased this backpack -lrb- about # weeks ago -rrb- to carry my tablet , a large notebook , my facility ids , aspirin bottle , pens , paper pads , etc . this pack works well with my needs and as an added bonus , it carries my # oz <unk> travel mug perfectly in the side pocket additionally , there is still room for a laptop , should i decide to start packing that as well my last pack last over # years ; only time will tell if this one will met that standard so far however ; i am happy
actually , what i was looking for i needed a backpack to charge mi books and notebook to the university everyday fast delivery and good product samsonite is well know for its bags
this was a gift to my friend and he liked it too much as it is very attractive , comfortable and robust to keep his # ' laptop and other official stationary
yes it is definitely a very good bag with all the required space available it is big enough to carry my # & # # ; laptop and has enough space to carry other
i like this backpack because it is really spacious and has compartments which fits just fine even for my binders . everything is just exactly as shown i am now waiting for it to reveal its durability as time goes by . the quality is ok for me but the <unk> was most amazing i got my backpack within three days and its free shipping
this backpack is a perfect size with a good compartment layout overall good construction , my only complaint is that one of the zipper pulls came off , i was able to <unk> it but they really should not come off hence # stars versus # stars
able to fit my large laptop plenty of pockets and easy to get into really like the separate computer pocket so i do n't have to open that every time to get something i need mesh on inside pocket tore the second week and the mesh pockets ca n't be stressed like the zippered pockets but , still a nice value for the $
i 'm using this to replace my $ # briefcase and have really liked it plenty of space for my work documents -lrb- the file folders are nice -rrb- and all my electronics -lrb- gps , <unk> detector , ipad , laptop etc -rrb- slips easily over my tumi bag handle and has rugged material that should last it 's appearance is pretty plain and i 'm still missing the leather otherwise is make it # stars
it is a very good backpack for laptops max # . # `` , it has plenty of space for many gadgets and an extra pocket for your tablet y have kept my hp # . # `` , my logitech cooling pad , my dj 's style earphones , other gadgets , cables , etc . , and everything fits very good the backpack is it not so bulky and the <unk> are very confortable , as it back the only problem it is that it has and advertise california <unk> # warning this product <unk> chemicals known to the state of california to cause cancer , birth defects or other <unk> harm
this is a perfect backpack/laptop case that fits my budget and my laptop i bought this bag about # months ago within that time i have traveled with it as well as carried it to work every day it 's sturdy construction gives me confidence each time i pull it out or pack it in the car it easily holds my # . # `` laptop , power cord , a book , an # notebook , a # `` binder , and other small items with room to spare the only complaint i have is that the luggage band on the back is not wide enough to go around my collapsible luggage handle if it did , i would deem it the perfect bag for the price
i bought this bag to accommodate all my gadgets like laptop , ipad , ipod and headphones apart from that i was looking for a bag which i can use for multiple uses and needs also it needs to be handy and reliable as well when i received this bag it is all above my expectation - looks , feel -lrb- material quality -rrb- , size is just perfect ! ! i love this bag and its stylish reach looks always tempt me to carry this bag i will definitely recommend this bag to everyone who are having similar needs
perfect for airline travel as you do n't have to take out the computer while going through security a few missing compartments and such as compared to my old bag , but being that this is much more compact , i ca n't blame it too much overall , i am very satisfied
i had the older version of this bag the new version has more room in the main section and a zipper on the small pocket on the front the previous version had only magnets the luggage handle strap is too low , but it still works ok meaning the bag does n't fall off my carry on when strapped to the handle i do wish that the strap was adjustable since it is hard to get the bag on and off my carry on the inside of this bag has a nice soft lining , but the outside is a very light and strong material it has two drink pockets , one on each side overall i am happy with it
saw this in the denver airport for about $ # and they seemed to be what i had been looking for i travel a lot and still carry my good <unk> laptop , but the shoulder bag was getting to be quite a problem to lug around this is so much better - has plenty of room for all the accessories that i carry with me and is tsa friendly there is even room to carry a snack and water on short <unk> into the arctic <unk> like it !
first of all this is a very well made bag the quality is amazing it has the tsa checkpoint area and then a second area in the other compartment where you can store a second laptop , which is perfect as i have two laptops for work it has quite a few compartments to stash everything you need it stands up straight when you set it down which is nice also i decided it was n't how me however i did n't really like how it sits on your back it is a shorter bag so it did n't like where it went to on my back not low enough for my
this has been a great backpack for work i just bought a second one - that it was on sale for $ # . # did n't hurt i would have given it a # start rating except for one thing , it has started to fray where the handle is attached to the pack i saw that someone else referenced this problem as well i was carrying a heavy # `` laptop and i 'm not sure the handle at the top of the pack could handle it if you carry a heavy load , make sure to use the straps to lift and carry it is a little heavy but i think that is the price you pay for all the padding and protection i would definitely recommend this bag - just be careful picking it up and carrying it by the top handle
great backpack , tons of pockets and space and look professional as well , use this daily for my laptop and other items as well as when i travel has a dedicated pocket for a tablet plus the laptop
i would recommend it i wish it had a clip in one of the pockets to hold keys , but besides that it an excellent bag which holds my laptop securely
used this new backpack a week right now it is a good size , it is n't very big but large enough to fit my sporting gear and my <unk> the quality seems to be quite good
excellent bagpack , very functional and great <unk> the space is ideal for notebook and adjustable closure is very useful things to improve , the lack of an outlet for the headphone cable and the lack of a hook for keys
it 's a nice travel bag for someone who needs space for ipad , laptop , change of clothes , etc . for the business traveller who travels light my fiance loves it , it made a great gift for him
the quality of this back pack is so good that i decided to keep it for weekend trips even though it was a little small for my # . # & # # ; laptop i can get the laptop in and barely get the zipper around it , which makes it very hard to pack and unpack it but the quality of the laptop sleeve and the back pack is so good that i <unk> to keep it
nice chic bag has nice pockets for all the little things you want to organize adjustable for any size laptop lightweight as well good bag for your weekly travel
my daily work bag laptop sleeve is great at airports and just general day to day use have used for quite awhile and looks as good as the first day really like the fact it sits straight up when placed on the floor lots of useful pockets yet does n't look like a <unk> rocker from the # 's only negative is shoulder straps a bit wide or <unk> not a big deal would buy again
this backpack has met my needs for an easy to transport , great compartments , and <unk> the items inside i looked for a while and this meets what i was looking for
this is a high quality backpack that i can see lasting # + years of regular use the main compartment is very large , so large that i highly recommend bagging small items or you will never see them again the backpack is made to go over the handle of a samsonite carry-on so if you are like me with a victorinox carry-on with the single handle shaft this backpack will just swing under the handle and drag on the floor not samsonite 's fault but it does make the backpack less useful to me than it could be
this backpack was perfect for my past month of travel around the world it holds a lot of stuff and held up very well there was ample pockets and storage space to keep all of my travel stuff organized -lrb- tablet , kindle , laptop , etc -rrb- initially i thought the dividers in the main pocket were awkward , but they turned out to be very useful for me another useful feature of the backpack is that it sturdy and keeps its form , so when you set it down it will stay in a standing position i had no issues at the airport security <unk> when i <unk> the backpack to get my laptop through the xray machine it made life so much easier not having to take it out and put it away again my one complaint which another person had as well is there is no clip in any of the pockets to hook your keys so they do n't get lost this is a very minor point , but a feature like that is extremely useful
i think this will do nicely my backpack is primarily for hiking and i never liked using it on airplanes but this <unk> case is going to do very nicely
this bag is deceptively roomy you can fit a lot of things in it and it is tsa friendly so you do n't need to take your laptop out as other reviewers pointed out , it would have been nice if it had a key ring , but that is a minor nitpick great value compared to much more expensive options
looks good . very functional . loads of space , pouches , compartments all handy and useful most important aspect is laptop compartment with `` perfect fit `` and checkpoint friendly features ... this bag is awesome
this is one of my best companies i love . i like the high quality of the bag itself . i saw one like it at the outlet but more expensive than the one in the outlet
