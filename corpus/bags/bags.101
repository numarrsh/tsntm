when i first got the case in the mail i absolutely love it the color was great and the feel of the material however , nearly two months later it 's already cracked on both front bottom corners and i have n't dropped my computer once as it sits on my desk very disappointing i must say
this case lasted about # month before the case started cracking and pieces started to break off i carry it in my rolling briefcase which has a padded section , so there really is no reason that this case is cracking at all
this product was ok , but the rubber coating comes off and makes it look very smudgy and it has cracked on the bottom it is a good quick fix to keep your macbook protected but i do not recommend it for the long term also , it is extremely difficult to get the top off
beautiful deep royal purple that i thought would look nice for <unk> , and looks true to the color in the picture it fit perfectly , and was easy to put on and remove i treat my computer really roughly , and eventually -lrb- after dropping my laptop -rrb- the case did crack , but my laptop did n't my laptop still looks like new -lrb- it 's almost four years old -rrb- because of these cases , so i would highly recommend them i 'm giving it four stars because after having it for almost a year , a little bit of the rubberized coating on the edges of the case was wearing off probably wont happen if you do n't take your laptop out much
a reasonably inexpensive but good purchase so far the color on the photo is a bit more vibrant , it is a actual purple easy to clip on and off the rubberized keyboard is n't bad though the e key is already a bit worn from use
i love every part of this case except the screen protector a little hard to apply without there being air bubbles , but besides that i love the color and it does everything i need it
this was the best cover for my mac i have ever had it was so reasonably priced and it was so awesome to feel it was great : -rrb- thank you
the product arrived sooner than i expected and it looked exactly how i hoped it would the shell is not glossy it 's matte , for me that 's what i wanted . :
the case fits perfectly on my # -inch mid # mac book pro the texture is soft and the structure is solid the ventilation slits on the bottom are rather helpful since the mac tends to heat up on my lap the cd slit as well as the other outlet openings are easy to access the keyboard skin fits perfectly the package did come with a screen protector , but i did n't use it since i 'm not a fan of them it is wrapped well though to ensure it wo n't get wrinkled or dusty this product does the job perfectly
bought to replace covers i 've had for # years for starters , this keyboard cover is much nicer - fits close to the keys and sticks well the top and bottom shell was easy to get on i assume will stay on i got the clear removable screen protector , which is and improvement over <unk> i 've had in the past much easier to see the screen though i have n't been able to apply it <unk> , others with more time and <unk> , might but i did n't try that hard if i had one complaint , it would be that the cover is heavy and not easy to grip with one hand overall , an excellent product for the price
i recently got a new case for my macbook and i love the color it came in and the keyboard cover is amazing i would definitely recommend this , especially for the price
i just love this case got this in # days after i ordered the color of this case is exactly the same as shown in picture the only thing i did n't like is the keyboard color , which is not exactly like the case otherwise its a great purchase
my laptop looks slick and <unk> with this new case i am so happy about it it took so long to ship that i thought my order might have got lost : -lrb- but once i received the product i was very happy great deal for # pieces
i ordered this on sunday and received it on friday , the perfect birthday present to myself i love the color and it my mac pro looks much more colorful now seems to fit nicely and cover everything that needs to be covered it came with the purple keyboard cover which is pretty , but seems a little flimsy especially if you have long nails , be careful when you 're typing on it they also sent a cleaning cloth which is nice i rate this # out of # with my experience thus far
as soon as i got the backpack , i tried to fit my # . # inch laptop in it and it did n't fit i <unk> understood if the problem was just that the tag that was attached to the bag said the bag fits # . # inch laptop returning for false advertisement
after traveling for a month or so , the zipper that holds the laptop in the quick access area fell off it now flops around and looks ridiculous the company wants me to give up my bag for <unk> to repair it , but i can not be without a bag that long i always thought this company had a good reputation , but my case logic bag lasted # years without a problem
i originally ordered & # # ; samsonite xenon # backpack <unk> case black & # # ; pretty disappointed with that one , both look and design then i got this one which is still simple and have quite enough space and partitions
this has a ton of compartments and i was able to fit my laptop and ipad in easily it seems very well made and should last a good long time the only issue are the zippers that do n't seem to close very easily
i was a little worried this bag would n't have enough room but i was wrong only drawback would be all the zippers it get confusing sometimes which pouch you are opening , but with time it will get better
bought this on a black friday deal , so it was an awesome deal love all the storage that it offers , and is very durable , i use this everyday for work . working in the it field , im carrying this in and out of locations several times a day it is very comfortable even when its full of equipment
this has to be the nicest bag i have owned for my laptop and accessories i have only owned a couple so i am a little <unk> but it really is nice and functional no complaints so far
i just received this backpack yesterday and i am very impressed with it it seems to be very well built and is very comfortable i normally carry a decent amount of stuff with me but this bag has plenty of room for it
my husband purchased this backpack and loves it the & # # ; tsa & # # ; feature is especially nice , though not the reason we bought the backpack it seems to be great quality with lots of pockets and features that make it more than & # # ; just a backpack . & # # ; would definitely recommend
i 've owned bunches of laptop bags , and several swiss army backpacks i picked this up on one of the holiday shopping deals , and i 'm glad i did it is a very attractive bag and has all the features and qualities you come to expect from swiss army backpacks i would recommend this backpack to anyone it the market for a good looking , fully functional high quality backpack
i have had this bag since february # th # and it is already falling apart i have a large tear by the zipper and metal pieces are falling off of it this is the worst bag i have ever purchased it & # # ; s sad too because i expected so much more from a swiss army book bag
i got this backpack on a gold box deal for a great price , but i would n't recommend paying full price it not very sturdy , and the `` audio interface `` is nothing more than a small hole to stick your headphones through it has a lot of pockets which i do like , but still prefer something a little more sturdy overall , not a bad bag , just overpriced at full price
the zipper for the main compartment does not close properly , luckily there are two zippers so i just brought the second zipper to the other side to allow it to close i would have given # stars because the bag is good otherwise and i 'm not going to ship i back
i bought this from sam 's club lasted a while but the side pocket zipper is broken this bag has had zipper issues before but kind of got resolved by moving the zipper back and forth , but this time its gone for good guess what will have to dump this one i would not recommend this model as i see another reviewer also complained about the main zipper getting a swissgear bag but a different model obviously
i bought this as a lightning deal for $ # to replace my worn out carry on bag at that price it has been a great value it is well made and `` solid . i travel about # k air miles per year so need something versatile and durable it is a bit small for me and would like a few more small zippered pouches to stash my stuff i always travel w a laptop and an ipad , as well as the necessary files for the week for that its perfect i had to ditch some <unk> <unk> but have n't been too sad about it would not be too pleased if i paid $ # though
first off , i have been using this for two months now on a daily basis holds my # . # & # # ; laptop with the usual accessories like the laptop charger and your mouse etc . comfortable to wear it with all my stuff in it does n't pull on you or stick to your back and cause you to sweat has a lot of add-on features like the sunglass holder , a key ring on the front pouch , ipod holder -lrb- music player -rrb- . # highly recommended for anyone who has to carry a laptop to work and it looks good on your back i can not comment on the life of this product because i have been using it for just # months , i 'll be sure to update the review if and when it goes bad
this backpack is roomy and well build it feels comfortable on my back even with my heavy work laptop and it does n't look bulky yet it gives me enough space for all my junk including my lunch the side pockets hold my # oz coffee thermos and my water bottle perfectly after giving away my other swissgear smartscan backpack , i was concerned because i could n't find it anywhere so i decided to go with this one to be honest i like this one even better
great book bag lots of pockets and plenty of space i use it for college and for work i pretty much carry it everywhere , so far so good its been over a year and no tears or defects it fit my # inch laptop inside and i also carry my paperwork and school work too was very happy with this purchase
i 've had numerous backpacks over the years , and this one is the best one i 've ever owned yes , it 's large yes , there are tons of pockets and organization the previous reviews have listed them in detail ... what i 'd like to emphasize is the extreme comfort
the shell for the mac was slightly to big and therefore was useless the remote control is of the lowest quality and you can see it with the screen protector i had a lot of trouble getting it on to where there would be no bubbles i think that was mostly my bad the keyboard protector is not aligned correctly ... so i see double letters all in all , it was all very bad quality and i ended up spending a lot more since i ended up getting better quality things
the order came on time and arrived as expected however , the hardcase did n't fit , which confused me it did n't look big enough for a # & # # ; mac but definitely not small enough for my # & # # ; do they have some <unk> knock off size of macbooks out there who they supply for i bought it bc it seemed like a good deal , but will probably be returning
i disliked this purchase because i could only enjoy two things out of the whole bundle , the sleeve and keyboard cover the case was too big and that was the main reason why i bought it to give my macbook a new look the mouse was n't even compatible with the computer , i just put the items on the shelf that i could n't use
everything was great except my case broke the clips one the side where is should snap into your computer broke within a week or two i do n't handle my laptop roughly , so how it broke is beyond me i move it from my desk to my bed and that 's about it everything <unk> alright the mouse it comes with is pretty cheap , but i found the screen protector and key protector very effective it 's a <unk> , but you might want to buy a case separately
my friends macbook was looking dull due to scratches so i decided to buy this bundle for her birthday the case fit pretty well , not a perfect fit but it looks great still and is very secure the little bag that comes with it had a little smell at first but it wore off easily for the price , this was a great deal i did have issues with the delivery , as all of the items did not arrive but the company refunded my shipping charge and i received the replacement items very fast - three days later she loves the look of all of these items together
this is one of the best sellers i have ever dealt with i purchased a bundle pack and everything was wonderful except that the cover for the computer was a smidgen too big i contacted the seller on a friday and on monday -lrb- # days later -rrb- i received a replacement product
much better than the speck or the speck satin its actually soft and a lil bendable , so doesnt feel like acrylic no clip breaking i am not sure if the maximum opening angle is affected , but even with it on , i am guessing it goes to atleast a # <unk> this was my main concern before ordering , but now i can say that even if it had an impact on that , it wasnt much though it does make the macbook air feel a little less sleeker , but its not a bad compromise this is the first case i have actually liked for a laptop tried speck , moshi and what not all are <unk> crap imho
this case is exactly what i wanted for my macbook air it 's sleek , minimalist , fits perfectly to the notebook , and most importantly does a extremely good job of protecting it if you 're looking for a simple but extremely protective case , think about this one
its worth the money and piece of mind ... i bought similar ones off ebay and they suck . you get what you pay for and when you purchase stm you are buying the best
so far this case has been everything my research said it would be : easy to put on , fits well , protects the macbook <unk> with its light weight and snug fit i particularly like that it has an inner lining to help keep dust and particles of dirt from getting between the case and the mac very glad so far for this purchase
i love the way this looks and fits onto my # inch macbook air i am not sure it would withstand dropping on the floor , but it is nicer than i expected , and will protect it from wear and tear i have a much bulkier case that i put the covered laptop into for traveling by airplane i am an artist , and this is pleasing to my eye and my love of quality construction great for the price as well
i 've been wanting something to keep dirt from scratching my air and also something to give it a bit more grip this definitely works great and it stays on really well ; very well formed for the # & # # ; macbook air
this case is amazing i have the latest mba # and the speakers are covered however , it has not <unk> my ability to hear through the speakers or any other functionality my computer is protected and the case is stylish i 'm may order pink as well ... but for now , the blue works fine i love the ridges on the case which keep my mba from slipping out my hand , and that the case seals out dust and other rude elements it does pick up fingerprints over time , but you can easily wipe it off
i really like this case i searched high and low before i made a final decision on the case i purchased it opens fine it does cover the mic 's but the people on the other end can hear me fine you can also cut out some holes i do notice that the top case make the mba open up wide . other than that tie bit , i love it
i threw it in the trash , the case did not fit properly and fell off every time i opened my macbook the mouse its pretty but that it does not communicate with macbook . the key pad cover is ok but the lights from the macbook do not show threw the cover
this does not work with the # & # # ; mac the hard case is too small and when you tell them that and return you have to pay the shipping for the defective unit back . unacceptable so i just bought the sleeve instead what you might think is a great value might not be ! ! when i bought the sleeve your suppose to get a mouse pad for each sleeve since they shipped it together they only gave me one this is the last i will buy from this company ! ! unsatisfied customer to say the least ! !
i had this for six <unk> with all of the elements that i got with this bundle working great that is till the case broke a few weeks ago , this is not to say that this is a bad deal because its not everything <unk> works and is keeping up with my daily needs the case its self is thin cheap plastic , so needless to say i 'm not shocked that it broke in half if you switch cases a lot then try it out but if your looking for a long <unk> with this case it will let you down keypad cover and mouse work great and have had no problems with it so far
it is a plastic case the color is nice but the quality is pretty bad if it cracked within a week of purchase and i did n't even drop it or anything not sure if the mouse works i really liked the keyboard protector but even that is fading pretty quickly you get what you pay for people simple as that
the <unk> on the computer case is very cheap and began to breaking off soon after i placed it on the computer . the keyboard cover it okay . the mouse was the best part of the package
i purchased this product and liked all the items that came with it i was disappointed when the case cracked and the letters wore off the keyboard it only took three months before the case cracked and now i 'm looking for a new one i was hoping it would last longer than it did
the keyboard and the soft & hardcase for the laptop were awesome ... the mouse was poor quality i placed batteries in the mouse and turned the switch from on to off ... and ever since the mouse will not turn back on - so obviously the <unk> within the mouse was poorly constructed
the case was fine but it did n't last very long the bottom case is already cracked and i am looking for a replacement the mouse did n't work very well from the beginning i really like the keyboard cover though
i liked everything that came along with it but my mouse did not work with my macbook pro also , the sleeve is kind of each as it ripped a little within a week of me <unk> it
the screen protector was tough to put on and the silicone keyboard cover was a bit too big for the keyboard so there is a little lump in the middle of the cover when i use it
the mouse stopped working after the first day , it has a bad laser the silicone keyboard cover gives me a headache when i look at it , the letters dont match up with the back light of my keyboard , so everthing is
i got my package pretty fast after i ordered online the color is actually candy pink color , not like the light pink on the web picture the top and bottom covers are make of plastic the bottom cover has holes for letting the heat out the mouse did n't really work after few days , but i still real like this order
selected this item because of all the cool things that came with the deal also the color was very appealing to me i really like the case , sleeve , and keyboard protector however , i did not like the mouse as it gave me technical problems -lrb- getting stuck and requires hard pressure to click -rrb- , and the screen protector bubbled up other than that , it was a great buy
the color on the items were nice -lrb- i ordered orange -rrb- since the mouse is made out of plastic , it 's pretty light and it includes the use of aaa batteries the mouse works perfectly also the laptop case is difficult to take off once you put it on the keyboard cover fits perfectly though overall i like this product
this bundle has all i was looking for to protect the laptop , plus the mouse only thing i wish is to have chosen it blue instead of black , but that 's not a great deal , it fulfills its purpose
the shell for my computer fits great and i love it it gets dents and little cracks , my computer does n't the sleeve works well the color 's a bit <unk> than i 'd hoped the keyboard cover works well the mouse is not surprisingly not very great and the <unk> , i could n't keep on for more than a day or so
i love the color its true to the picture but still trying to figure out how to get the keyboard piece to stay but im getting there have n't used the mouse yet but was n't really planning on it love how snug the case clips on and the carrier is perfect im happy you will be too its not fancy but it is just
the color was exactly what i was looking for and the picture almost matches exactly to the product the keyboard pad is think so it & # # ; s a little harder to type the laptop slip though is waterproof and i love it i didn & # # ; t realize it was until i tried to <unk> it and noticed the water <unk> & # # ; t coming through the fabric it & # # ; s great
i have a new macbook pro retina display and the case fits great and the keyboard fits perfect as well as the sleeve there is one little scratchy spot on one corner , but i 'm sure i can fix that otherwise great , surprised at the complaints i have not been able to pair the mouse , but will play with that when i have more time i would have to guess that those with complaints on size of case or keyboard cover not fitting have ordered the wrong thing
this pack was a great addition to my mac i needed something to stand out and this case gets plenty of compliments the only thing i do n't like is the fact that the keyboard cover and hard shell are aquamarine but the outer case and mouse are royal blue
just received my product in the mail , i was expecting more of a matte finish on the case cover , but other than that , everything else was fine i really like the sleeve and also just a heads up , the mouse did not come with
i loved this the only thing i dont like is the sleeve because its like slippery and very i feel like my computer will fall as i grab it from my case
this product is more than expected originally had thought the product quality would be effected due to the quantity and price , but was great quality overall i 'm satisfied with the entire product
i was really impressed with the number of items that were included for the price - especially the mouse the case is a really nice blue and was easy to install hoping it offers the protection but it seems fairly sturdy
i 've ad this for about a year now and i still love it the cover really protects your mac , and the sleeve pocket as well the mouse was a little bit hard to get used to but i have no complains for this product
my package was early i am extremely happy with this bundle deal the only thing that i would like to change about this , would be the keyboard because in some places there are extra color marks and you ca n't tell when the caps lock is on other than the keyboard everything fits snug and the way you see it online
this is great for everyone the hard cover fits perfectly , the keypad cover keeps off dust/dirt and the computer case is light yet durable i love this package it 's a great bargain , too
i purchased this to protect my brand new macbook pro it definitely does the job it fits very well and the color is just beautiful when i first got it , i did n't really like the color , but as i keep looking at it , it makes your laptop look the best however , the screen protector was very difficult to put on because of the air bubbles i ended up throwing away the screen protector other than that , the laptop case , mouse , bag , and keyboard cover is amazing i think it was a good deal for the price and the quality of the product i would buy again for different colors too
what you see in the picture , you get : -rrb- always be sure about the computer size and model , the keyboard protector is for the english version of mac , do not fit for the <unk> keyboard
my wife bought this for her computer and it sure is pink i 've you 've been wanting a pink tint to your macbook pro - this might be exactly what you 've been looking for
exactly what i wanted the screen protector is a lil tricky but still all good i do n't really use the mouse but the price all together is better than buying all the items
i love , love , love , love , love this whole set the hard plastic shell for both the top and bottom snap on very easily , and the keyboard skin fits perfectly i 'm super obsessed with orange , so i had to have this set the price is definitely a great deal for all that you get with this package the orange is soooooo awesome ! !
this set came as described and on time the color is the robin egg blue seen in the picture i use the mouse often and it works well i have n't put the screen protector on yet , but the shell case fits my macbook well
i bought this mainly for the actual cover . i love the fact it is see thru so i can keep my decals on the front of the mac . . it protects from scratched and looks awesome i would purchase again
at my school the case alone is $ # so this was a much better deal the color matches perfectly to the picture and everything fits on the computer just the way it should
i was unhappy with the look and feel of this bag it looks like a cheapo <unk> messenger bag that i ca n't bear to carry the inside material pattern is ugly too i sent it back
would have given # stars but i feel shoulder strap is going to be first thing to go on this bag i bought it so i could carry my ipad which automatically makes the bag heavier and i just do n't feel the strap can take that extra weight too long
overall good bag , lots of room for all your stuff ... to get lost at the bottom lol its great for what it 's designed for , but not as a purse i feel like my nook and other gadgets are safer then in a normal bag so thats a plus
i did n't want a huge bag but with all of the devices we have today this one works perfectly can easily hold my ipad , iphone and other devices with plenty of space for other things
holds ipad in a cover snugly with room in the front pouch for personal items functions as an ipad carrying case and purse comfortable to carry -- not too big have taken it to conferences and carried daily
the case looks very nice when it first arrived . however , after two months of light use , it 's beginning to fall apart i 've never dropped the case , but it 's cracking and deteriorating
i bought this case for my boyfriend as a gift we are college students and he bought this new macbook pro several days ago as you users with macbook pro 's may know , they scratch very easily with everyday use , in and out of the backpack , it needs better protection i bought a case for my pro at local store where they are way overpriced this case is perfect the color is beautiful , you can see the lit up apple symbol through the cover -lrb- which you can not with my case from the store -rrb- and it is very easy to use snaps right on and is ready to go in seconds if you want an awesome colored case for your pro , this by far is the best investment -lrb- besides the computer -rrb- i have made in a while if i could rate it more than # stars , i would
the color is exactly as shown the macbook just looks wonderful in the case it was really easy to put and protects my macbook very well i 'm very happy with this product
just received this case cover for my # inch macbook retina the cover is just fantastic the top part fits my macbook snuggly and has a cut-out at the apple logo so that it is visible a bit different than the picture that seems to have the logo covered the bottom portion also fits snuggly both covers add minimally to the weight of the laptop overall this was very easy to install and an excellent product so far
it is a factory original bottom cover it came with new screws -lrb- which was nice -rrb- and it fit fairly well it was not a seamless fit like the original , but it matched up pretty well the corners were not as flush to the top as the old cover
my wife 's macbook only came with a # gb hard drive and # <unk> of memory what do you want for a thousand dollars , right the oem hard drive was full and a new # tb hard drive and # gb memory upgrade is not expensive , no brainer i ordered the new drive and memory and checked on online to learn how to open the case all went well except during the removal of the case bottom i pulled the rubber loose on the edges and the nice fit and finish that apple is famous for was no longer there things like this annoy me so i checked online to see how <unk> a new bottom was this is were the big surprise comes in , a new oem bottom is cheap , really cheap i ordered the new bottom , it arrived quickly and included new screws , <unk> instructions and even a nice screwdriver that fits the tiny screws perfectly the macbook looks really nice with a new bottom
replacement bottom for my old macbook white fit like a glove easy to follow directions with enclosed small phillips screwdriver and spare screws bottom now looks better than the top
love my new cover for the bottom of my macbook it comes with everything you need to attach it securely to your computer has held up very well sure does beat the warped bottom that was on there for very little cost my computer looks brand new
piece came on time and was what i needed the rubber from my old bottom was bubbling and my mac book was not sitting properly on a table now it looks like it is new again
granted i did n't spend an arm and a leg on this but i 'm a little disappointed with the quality i have treated it like glass , as it covers my ridiculously expensive macbook and somehow it has still managed to crack and split after just a few months of use i will be replacing it soon , though i wish i did n't already need to do that
i loved the color , although i was n't happy with material as it was hard plastic and not the rubberized kind like it says in the end it did n't really matter as i returned it because the size was incorrect still , its a great deal for the price way better than paying # dollars at the mac store for a piece of plastic
the case make the computer looks really sharp and it great protection for your computer just want to say that you are going to find it harder to get people to write reviews if you continue to have <unk> it is only so much you can write about certain items such as this
satin finish with a slightly rubberized coating - this fit our mbp retina like a glove no keyboard protector but we already had one it 's close to a & # # ; tiffany & # # ; <unk> we get compliments all the time
