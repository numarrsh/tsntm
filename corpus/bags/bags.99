very good hard cover for the ultrabook and it fits perfectly each corner is reinforced when the cover is on it comes in nice colors and i got the blue , which looks great it does add some weight to the ultrabook , over half a pound this is a small compromise , however , considering that it does such a good job of protecting the laptop i highly recommend this cover
using the item for # months , i have to say that the item is still intact and no cracks very happy with the item so far the item does add some ounces , but for the extra protection , i ca n't complain
my laptop is usually on the bed , couch , or my lap , so this is a good way to improve airflow , without a bulky case , fan , or special stand with the feet popped out , the back of the laptop is raised up by # inch i do n't even use the top piece as my laptop pretty much stays in the house if this could be sold with just the bottom piece , perhaps it could cost less ? . one issue i have is that the small feet have corners that can poke down into my lap or , they sink down into the blanket , in which case the bottom of the laptop does too , and any airflow improvement <unk> an improvement that would help is if it had a horizontal bar piece running along the entire back that popped up , instead of # separate feet
i wanted something that would protect my laptop from minor dings and scratches but was not bulky , since the reason i got this model ultrabook was its slim size this shell was perfect it also fit fine , which i was worried about
i was a little skeptical that this product could really fit my toshiba protege z # , since it only advertises that it fits the z # and z # but i checked the dimensions for my z # and they are the same bottom line is that it fits perfectly the quality of this product is quite high and the fold-out legs on the bottom help give my laptop a nice tilt for typing it added almost no additional weight as the material of the shell is very light i would recommend this for protection of your protege ultrabook it shipped in one day
great looking cover that does the job my last laptop got all banged up and looked bad before it died this hard shell seems to do the job of protecting the laptop
i received this item with damage to the top piece , and the bottom does not fit i was very disappointed and consider this purchase a waste i did not receive satisfaction when i contacted the seller
okay , the color , is n't even a <unk> yellow it was n't even the right size , and its not rubberized at all , it was pure hard cheap shell , do not buy i 'm waiting to see if i can return it
the bottom of the case was perfectly fine but the top part was too small for my computer not only did they send me a mid match case but they did n't send me a <unk> or a return <unk> to assess this issue i 'm very disappointed in this product if i purchase a case for a # & # # ; lap top i expect both prices to fit the # & # # ; lap
this cover is not clear it is frosted / opaque if you want a clear case , this is not the one to order when i contacted them , they offered a # % refund since i do n't want frosted , i declined , so then they said i could send it back , but i 'd have to pay the shipping -- even though their description is incorrect since that would cost almost half the original price , i took the # % refund instead i have since found a defect <unk> in the plastic -lrb- looks like someone 's small <unk> !
i have a brand new macbook pro with retina and the case does n't fit at all i completely hate it once i somewhat got the case on , it was nearly impossible to take it off worst thing ive ever spent my money on the description clearly states that it would fit my computer but thats obviously not right the top half did n't fit correctly -lrb- too small -rrb- and hard to take off as well the bottom half was too big when i picked up my computer the bottom part would pop off without even trying to take it off awesome ... glad i spent money on a case that 's worth nothing
i ordered this for my macbook pro # `` and i opened it today to discover it was about # inches too small this is ridiculous i am very unsatisfied i would rather spend # $ on an expensive case at best buy
i have had to order a topcase case cover twice the first time i ordered it and received it in the mail , the bottom portion of the case was cracked i was disappointed , but thought i 'd give topcase another try i sent the damaged product back in return for a new case that was hopefully undamaged to my dismay , i received the second case with another crack in it at a different location ... this is when i knew for certain that topcase products are poor quality they ca n't even make it to the buyer in one piece i made up my mind to not buy products from topcase again there are much better macbook case covers at cheap prices with greater quality do not waste your time and money on topcase products
did not fit my laptop and was not a good product it was very cheaply made i was just upset that it did not honestly wish i could get my money back does not look like picture
i ordered this case and was very excited the package delivered when it said it would and i loved the color right when i opened up the packaging however , when i tried to snap it on my laptop , i soon discovered that it was much too small the case was a good inch and a half too small for my macbook pro # `` and the seller says that the case is # . # ``
when i got this item it was completely cracked in half . i had to call and go through a whole process of getting my money back and the people that i contacted <unk> topcase were very rude i suggest not ordering anything from now
i bought this case because i need something to cover my macbook with retina . the top part of it fits perfectly but the bottom of it does n't fit at all -lrb- i was disappointed on this i love the color but this oder took forever to be delivered im not planning to buy any of there items anymore . : -lrb- -lrb- -lrb- dont get this ! ! ! ! this is very disappointing product
every time i order a case from this company it does not fit i thoroughly check to make sure that i am ordering the correct size for my macbook pro yet , when i receive the case there is always some kind of issue in addition , after <unk> that all i want is a refund , topcase continued asking which macbook model i have i 'm assuming they want to replace the case instead of giving me a refund , but that 's not what i want
this case did n't fit my macbook right , probably a defect i finally got it on and with broke from the sides within month i had to throw it away and buy a new one
the color in the picture is not the color of the case i received i also received a case that had two different sizes for each part i think the top part was for a # & # # ; computer i am trying to return it
it took forever to get the right thing the image in the photo and what was shipped were not the same i knew i needed exactly what was in the photo , thus choosing that item finally , after paying return shipping -lrb- always annoying -rrb- and several poor <unk> emails i was sent the correct case it 's ok , i wish it was more rubbery than plastic but it 'll do
i bout this case for my new mbp with retina display about a week and a half after i got it the bottom of the case cracked about a week later another crack <unk> and about # weeks after that a significant chunk broke off the bottom of the case so now i have two cracks and big chunk missing from the bottom corner of my computer however , other than the poor material used to make the case it does has some nice features ... nice fit , sleek design , easy to put on and did not come off i 'm still using it and probably will until it completely breaks in half but i would n't purchase again
the color is n't what i thought it would be it does n't fit well at all and scratches my arm when using it it did come quickly and it still protects the computer somewhat you get what you pay for ...
when i opened the package , it was in a plastic sleeve that had clearly been opened with either a scissor or blade which had scratched the top cover piece and still was shipped out to a customer this way i did not pay for a scratched cover , i paid for a new cover which means it should have arrived looking new what is worse is that it 's the top piece so it is visible i am going to keep it only because i want to protect my investment but i will be ordering another cover and not from this seller that said , the cover itself has a nice rubber feel not like the cheap plastic ones it 's unfortunate that the <unk> does not care about delivering what is paid for
though manufactured quite reliably , the bottom part on the inside has areas with sharp edges . his imperfection seem to have it <unk> the form the plastic was <unk> in unlikely that this will leave <unk> on the aluminium of my macbook but i cant get rid of the thought that in time this edges will leave some <unk> of use on the bottom of the notebook itself
the case feels great but the fingerprints are so noticeable they make the case change color the little pads on the bottom are like little stickers i 'm afraid they will start peeling off other than that is a very nice case
the case is pretty , but the edges where your wrists will lie are sharp and uncomfortable the outer case is a nice softer rubber , but where you actually will be coming into contact with the plastic , it hurts and it 's annoying
great but edges turn yellow quickly i 've tried to clean it with electronic wipes but they wo n't go away it 's not dirty because i keep my laptop in it 's laptop bag whenever it 's not in use
for those that say it does n't fit , check your model it fits perfectly and feels quite sturdy for its price it has great bang for your buck however , it is n't really rubberized , it still feels like hard plastic , just with a slightly rubbery surface putting it on and removing it is very simple and it does n't come off when you do n't want it to it does n't come with instructions but you can easily figure out how to put it on your macbook if you 've got half a brain overall , it gets the job done but i guess you get what you pay for
the shipping time was very fast . that i like the case was okay for the most part but the bottom part does n't fit well is a little loose everything else is good for the price
first of all , in the picture the case looks clear but it 's not you can only see the apple logo when it 's lit up the bottom piece is fragile , it cracked a little when i tried to take it off however , it looks good on my mac and i 'm still using it
the & # # ; smoke & # # ; color looks good , and the case is very low-profile & hardly noticeable it 'll protect from scratches , and fits relatively well , but the bottom cover edge can be a bit uncomfortable if you 're typing with your wrists against the laptop it 's a little slippery , so if you 're looking for something to increase your grip on the laptop , this is n't it but if you need a light , low-profile , cheap case to protect from scratches , this one is fine
the case looks fine and the color is really nice it was really easy to get on , but getting the top part off was a <unk> broke my nails taking it off and it literally took me # mins the case came really quickly , but i found some scratches on the case they are n't really noticeable , but there 's one that is the white foam on the bottom also looks really cheap and it was a little dirty , but i guess you get what you pay for
it was okay overall the actual color of the case was true to the picture but it was a little too big and there was a minor scratch on it mouse pad was fine
the covers for the front and back work fantastically , but the material seems too cheap in a way when i got it , it already had some small cracks that i noticed two days after receiving it also , the keyboard cover is just a <unk> it drastically <unk> your typing speed and you will often miss the key you are trying to press other than that , i would see recommend it but just avoid the keyboard cover
i like pink very much , i think customers who like pink would definitely like this product however , you sent me a damaged one one corner of the case cover was seriously worn out , but i do n't want to waste my time to mail it back and change a new one i am not a perfectionist i just hope that you can check the product carefully before you mail it to us
the cover came to me well packaged , but for some reason , it was already smudged when i pulled it out of the box and now , i 've had it for # months and all but one of the disks used on the bottom of the cover to <unk> the laptop have fallen off i 'm not hard on my laptop i use it at home to work while sitting on the couch and when i go to a friend 's house my kid does not touch it at all not sure why they would have fallen off to begin with in addition , the bottom cover does n't fit so well it keeps slipping off and when it 's not slipping off , it 's <unk> my wrists you might be better served purchasing a different cover
this product is very inexpensive , so i kept my expectations low the color is much lighter purple in person , but that does n't bother me i wanted to make sure the apple logo shows through , and it does you can tell this is n't the best quality , but for the price , i 'm fine with that and you ca n't really tell unless you look very closely it stays in place well and should protect against scratches i have a mac book pro # & # # ; with retina other reviewers who said it did n't fit right do n't have the retina display it fits mine perfectly
delivered one day before expected ! good color and condition ! very pretty sea green its not totally opaque as i had expected so the apple logo does show through but it does n't look bad
purchased a brand new macbook and immediately purchased this cover i can feel in some areas where it is a little scratched , but you ca n't see it from use -lrb- better the case than my macbook -rrb- and everyone compliments on the color would buy a new color for fall/winter : -
mine does n't seem to stay on the mac over on the left side of they keyboard ; it 's bending away from the computer actually i mean , the case never falls off , but it 's obnoxious that it sometimes is too easy to remove because of this piece of plastic that is n't attached
love the case received # days after purchase was unsure of how the hot blue color would come out , but it is one of the cutest colors ever case fits nice and snug also love the rubberized texture on the case the word `` hard `` in the title made me a little worried that it would come out feeling like plastic , but it 's not super happy with this purchase for the amount of money i paid
i loved the color and how matte it turned out to be it was shipped to me very quickly , surprisingly so , and it even came with a matching keyboard cover however , the bottom half was snapped , the small borders of plastic near where the speakers are , which was very disappointing i would return it but i need a case now and the hassle is n't worth it but overall , it was a good purchase considering how much i paid
great quality for a low priced product at first i was hesitant to get the case because of all the imitation products out there but i decided to get it anyway and i was n't disappointed when i got the product it fit well on my # `` retina mbp i gave it only # stars because a part under the mbp was not fully covered but besides that , great product
i would recommend this product it is a very beautiful color it fits my macbook snugly and securely it is easy to clean with a <unk> wipe however , my only complaint was that after about five months the side did crack because i got it caught on a strap in my book bag it still fits just fine i think with heavy usage and lots of transferring in and out of my book bag that something like this might be expected over time
fit <unk> , y , nice color and price was right if you are buying for a macbook pro you need to <unk> you got the new slimmer model that 's why others are noting that it doesnt fit
got here three days early not quite the same color as pictured -lrb- the pink case at least -rrb- however it is everything that i expected for the price a great investment versus the expensive name brand cases that are $ # plus love this case for the price
thank you again i placed a wrong order thinking that this was the one for my macair i emailed <unk> of the company that i wanted to cancel the order and i got a reply that the product was shipped already i was then advised to return the product once it arrived i then placed another order for my macair my friend who has a macpro liked the rubberized hard case for the mac pro and decided to buy it so it all worked out well
received my macbook for christmas and i wanted a fun and colorful case for it of course , i turned to amazon because you can find the best cases for cheap the color is exactly as pictured and it fits the laptop perfectly so far so good ca n't beat the price
should really be called tiffany blue . looks great on macbook pro # retina we had a problem with the bottom not fitting correctly -lrb- probably damaged during shipment -rrb- and they sent out a new bottom part no questions asked , or bother to have us ship back the broken bottom half i have owned a few from this company and from more expensive <unk> they all eventually crack and go bad after around # to # month use the good thing i like about top case is they actually keep their products so affordable that you can replace your case <unk> and get a new look
this was super easy to put on , and looks really good i got the clear and it had vents for the heat , the holes were in all the right places and it even had little feet to replace the ones the case covered i am very happy with it
i was looking for a new cover for my new macbook , and this is perfect the glass is not shiny so you do n't see fingerprints , and it fit the macbook perfectly
i 'm pretty rough on my electronics so when i got a new macbook my first mission was to find a case to keep it protected i 'm very happy with my decision not only is the color perfect -lrb- pink ! -rrb- but it securely stays on , keeping me from scratching and <unk> my new precious laptop and , let 's be honest , you ca n't beat the price thanks , top case
it 's cute and functional and fits my macbook pro # inch retina perfectly i traveled the world for # months with it and my computer is safe and sound and the only thing that & # # ; broke & # # ; is on the case on the side it 's not even noticeable though so happy with this purchase
they had similar cases at the apple store but i found this much cheaper from this seller i ordered and it was in within a few days and i have fell in love with it even friends who ordered different cases are jealous of the quality case i got from amazon it adds a sleek and slim look to the macbook
this was shipped out very quickly and arrived on time the packaging did n't seem to offer much protection , but there was no damage to the case it is super easy to put on and fits very securely the color is exactly as pictured , and slightly translucent - i have a decal on the back of the computer that can be seen through the case i would use a case with more padding for any kind of travel , but for day-to-day use this works great
that is why it doesnt fit your # `` macbook pros , its for retina macbook pro which is smaller and slimmer , quit # <unk> when your not smart enough to actually read a product description , k
the hot pink color matches the showed picture , although it is a little bit heavy for my mac after putting on the case but overall , i like it ! ! ps : the seller is so nice and patience for my return or exchange request # stars ! ! !
i ordered the wrong case on accident and they immediately got back to me with what i needed they even sent it as soon as i provided them with the tracking number for the one i was sending back
i literally just put this onto my new mpb with retina display and love it already the case fit perfectly not too snug , not too loose my favorite thing about it is the rubberized plastic gives it a nice matte look with a non-slippery feel so you wo n't lose your grip of it if you 're carrying it around overall , i 'm completely satisfied with my purchase
best case ever , so cute and smooth i was worried when i put it on that you would n't be able to see the apple light up , no worries clear as day
showed up a day before the estimated delivery date , which was cool fits great , nice feel , looks very sleek and cool make sure you realize that this is for the new macbook pro i will probably get another case cover in a different color from this seller , not because of anything wrong , but because i like to swap cases out from time to time
it fits perfectly on my lap top and i am i huge fan of it when i get bored with this color i will buy from this store again in a different color
i love this case i had the purple one before and it cracked on the bottom so i had to get a new one and this one fits just the same they do crack pretty easily so that is n't great , but i really like the hard plastic cases , so there really is n't a way around it if you are going to buy this case make sure you have a macbook pro # ' retina display . it is totally different from the regular pro
i ordered the hot pink case and it 's actually better than the main picture listed in reality it has a slight <unk> affect to it , which i love i paired it with the chevron keyboard cover by the same brand and i am in love with the combo
the color of this case is exactly what i expected it to be an it looks amazing on my macbook it fits perfectly and is a very nice protector to the laptop so it does n't get any scratches on it ! i love
i purchased # hard cases for my new macbbook pro at the same time , only because i could n't decide on a color i have received them both now and am very glad they were two different brands this topcase brand cover fits perfectly , gives me full access to all ports and goes on easily , but firmly enough that it stays on also i absolutely love the color , they call it pink but i would say it 's more <unk> unfortunately that was not the case with the other hard cover , it does n't stay on it goes back
this product is even better than i expected it fits like a glove , has terrific color , and feels great in my hands i bought a couple of colors at this price , and they were exactly as shown in the pics i ca n't imagine a better deal on a case for your retina mac
i was afraid this case would not fit my laptop as there were many people who had problems with it clipping on correctly well mine clipped on perfectly i was very happy the color is a little lighter than the <unk> but i think that its hard to take pictures of this item since its somewhat transparent and placing it over different colors makes it turn a slightly different shade i was very happy with this product one of the little white circle things on the back fell off , however , it may have been my own fault
great shopping experience received the case earlier than expected it was received in perfect condition and is exactly as described the quality and fit are excellent bonus ... the incredible price
this sleeve is poorly manufactured one zipper of mine was n't sewn to the end , so when i closed the zipper the first time the zipper head fall out , and it ca n't be put in place again i guess this is why it & # # ; s so cheap don & # # ; t buy it
zippers are very cheap and fall off , it 's too big for macbook pro retina it has room to move around , and pocket in the front are useless do n't purchase you will be disappointed ! !
it fits the laptop nicely and the outside pockets are convenient , but the main zipper gets caught all of the time -lrb- i 've had the case for about # months -rrb- it is to the point where i can no longer zipper up the case i will be throwing this away and buying a new one
i just received my laptop bag i ordered this one because of the handy pockets to store thumb drive and charger reviews looked great came straight online to see the product picture because i wanted to check to see if this was some kind of joke the storage pockets on the outside of my bag have no zipper pulls there are zipped up zippers , but no pulls effectively making them sewn up pockets that can not be used the price seemed too good to be true , but after reading the reviews , i was looking forward to a great bag at best , a serviceable <unk> <unk> smelling bag at worst a bag with pockets that did n't open ... now that 's something , i did n't expect
it was too big for my macbook when i put my macbook inside of the sleeve it slides around too much now i have to buy another one with a tighter fit , which means the one that i bought was a waste of money
i bought this product thinking it 'd be great to store my things in the pockets , but there were no zippers on the pockets for laptop fit , i bought this for my lenovo ideapad yoga # and it 's a tight fit lengthwise the case is a little loose <unk> i 'm looking to return this product if i can
this case is what i expected it to be it works for me lugging my mac to and from school it 's not the most amazing thing it the world , but it keeps my mac safe and works
very nice design , laptop fits snugly , and it feels extremely nice the zippers are handy to store a hard drive , chargers , pens , etc . the only issue is that the zippers have gotten caught on the fabric , and are therefore tearing it a little it 's a small design flaw but the case is only # weeks old and already shows signs of wear hopefully this lasts longer but it does n't look like it 'll hold for more than a few more months the price is excellent though
it is advertised for the mac book pro # . # & # # ; , but is at least an inch too wide and tall the case is n't bad and the zippers seem to work alright , but it is too loose i will make do and you get what you pay for in a $ # product one last point : when you first get it , the chemical smell is super strong i am going to air it out in another room for a couple days and hope it goes away
order this for my new macbook air it fits , but it 's a bit too big my daughter had different neoprene case which fit much better i do like the pockets for charger , etc . somewhere else , i saw <unk> that talked about the smell it does arrive with quite a strong chemical smell i stuffed it with newspaper and it definitely helped think i 'll got for another round of newspaper for the price , i 'd get it again
its ok , it wont hold all the accessories and the charger for my click , it does fit my click , but bought a replacement case that has handles and a bigger storage
it 's a cheep case , it gets the job done and it holds all the stuff i normally need like my charge , usb , iphone charger , papers , pencils , pens , etc . it has a <unk> texture and it stinks really bad i 've had this sleeve for a few months and the smell is finally going away but it still stinks and the stink rubs off on the computer too ... which stinks haha but i am impressed for what it 's worth its not bad i would recommend this to anyone who is look for a cheep case/sleeve to protect your computer from being scratched
very tight fit on a vaio z # th anniversary edition the padding is not as soft as i thought it would be but for the price it will serve well it does have a slight smell but nothing major and after airing it out it is fine mine was also folded but again not a big deal for the price you ca n't complain if you are looking for a tick neoprene cover this is not for you though so keep that in mind i took one star away simply b/c of the thin
ca n't beat the price for sure unpack it pretty quickly because they have it bent in half for shipping , which can cause a <unk> crease in the foam quality seems to be pretty good the real question is how it will hold up in the time to come
it does what is expected from it it works as decent sleeve for everyday use and protects the laptop from scratches for traveling i would rather make use of the laptop compartment of the backpack as an additional layer of protection as the sleeve does n't have good padding it also carries smell of & # # ; new pair of canvas shoes & # # ; as mentioned in other reviews which is a bit disturbing i hope that goes away with time
this case fits my new mac # `` laptop snugly , but with enough room to easily zip it up even with a hard case on the computer the pockets stretch to hold the charger cord and other accessories it is n't as thick as some cases , but it offers minimal protection , which would likely be fine for anyone reasonably careful with their computer for the price , this is a nice case my only suggestion would be to add handles for easier carrying
this case protects my macbook while traveling i use a padded laptop case also and this case prevents scratches when i take the macbook out the pockets are also convenient for power supply and my mouse this is not a heavily padded case , so i recommend another case if you need more protection i agree it has a strong rubber odor , but that dissipates over time
i ordered this sleeve for my macbook -lrb- the first one released -rrb- because i did n't want my laptop to bounce around inside my backpack i was a little worried about it fitting as it is listed for a macbook air now after the using it , it fits perfectly , and side compartments are perfect for flash drives and power chords , and it fits perfectly in my backpack the seller shipped it quick , and it arrived in perfect condition the only reason i did n't give it five stars , is what a lot of other reviews have said as well , is the smell it really does smell like you walked into a shoe store , but besides that if your looking for a good sleeve and a good price , you ca n't go wrong
overall the package came early and its fits my macbook pro # with its cute pink case perfectly however , there were small dent marks on the front and back of the sleeve also , it had a weird factory smell to it for the dents i guess i can just iron them away but the smell , i dont know what to do aside from the minor problems , the product works great ! i love the fact that there are sleeves from my charger and my iphone i would say the padding is thin but i already had a case on my laptop so im not too worried
arrived quickly it had a weird smell when it arrived the smell either went away or i got use to it . very nice fit for my macbook i love
i bought this case thinking it would be great to carry my # inch macbook air and that was all that i would have to put the charger and the mouse in another case but i fit my mac charger , my mouse , my phone charger , and chapstick way more than i
i got this as a gift and i have n't used it myself however , i checked it when it arrived home , and it seemed to be of good quality i did n't appreciate any defect in the zippers , sewing and fabric the # . # inch macbook fitted perfectly i know it is still in use without problems , so it was a very good purchase
ive had it for a while now still in great condition and did a great job in protecting my mac so far love the little pockets attached fit all you need great deal im saying id <unk> about it if it wasnt
like other reviews this case does smell very odd but it protects my macbook despite it not being padded the pockets are very useful to put the charger inside and other accessories also it is mailed in a envelope folded so it will cause the case to have a faded case in the middle
attention : this case does not fit with microsoft surface # i will just use it for another tablet , but i am very disappointed about the difference with the description do not buy this for surface #
i ordered this case for my microsoft surface rt and it does n't fit on top of that it took almost a month for it to get here i am very displeased ! !
i ordered this product thinking that it would fit the microsoft surface rt , but the item that came clearly looked like it was made for an ipad i still tried to put my surface tablet in the case , but it was too long for the case i do n't know if i was shipped the wrong case , but the item that i received did not match the description
when i ordered the case it didnt fir right to my surface this product is not made right the people who made it need to check to make sure it fits
while sony 's flip # & # # ; ultra-book has nearly the exact dimensions as apple 's # & # # ; air , the apple air gets slightly thinner in the front i probably could have done what other reviewers have done and used a heat gun to soften this case and stretch it a little , i chose not to because i wanted something with more protection i opted to go with this one : hard candy case for apple macbook air # -inch and thin ultrabooks the viper sleeve is a very good looking sleek and tidy case however it does n't offer very much protection other than the seams surrounding the case this is the reason i could only give three stars i do n't own an apple air so i ca n't comment on the fitment for that the viper case is n't padded inside or otherwise the lining is a smooth synthetic fabric not a soft felt or fleece this probably is n't an issue for most modern devices <unk> in aluminum but i could foresee it possibly scratching a plastic laptop lid
i purchased this for an hp <unk> book the laptop fit well i am more used to a neoprene sleeve but this is more rigid it does a good job at protecting the
