it said `` fits # inch notebooks `` , and i have an alienware m # x , which is slightly larger than # `` however , products like these should accommodate most # `` laptops easily , since most are gaming laptops and will stretch the bag a little wider and make it a bit more difficult to zip up the laptop it does fit , just , barely -lrb- i.e . do n't pack too many other things in the bag -rrb-
this bag is a really great bag i love the pockets and space provided , however it barely fits my # & # # ; asus republic of gamers laptop -lrb- which is the reason i bought this bag -rrb- it barely closes if i put the laptop directly in the back pocket instead of using the laptop sleeve provided however aside from this detail -lrb- and i realize my laptop may be bigger than the average # & # # ; since its a gaming laptop , so i let it slide -rrb- everything about the bag is great
its swiss gear so you know its well made my problem was , & # # ; fits most # & # # ; -rrb- did not hold my asus # & # # ; wide screen safely hard to zipper and the corners are too tightly packed and exposed one good bump or <unk> to one of the corners would have shattered the laptop case so i am sending mine back for an # & # # ; backpack just hope i can get one built as well as swiss
my previous wenger was a very similar design held up for approximately # years of daily use , traveling overseas , between office and home , and even on numerous vacations the stitching started to fail uniformly on the shock-absorbing shoulder straps and the material was finally showing some signs of wear after many years of use i was willing to pay more money to get another backpack of equivalent quality the new wenger ibex # inch notebook backpack arrived from amazon and i was pleased with the pockets and various <unk> of items however , the backpack felt lighter -lrb- not necessarily a bad thing if the quality and durability are the same -rrb- , and the zippers did not seem nearly as robust as my original wenger backpack after several months of the same type of use , i have concluded the material used on the new backpack is of inferior quality , as are the zippers as well i have not had any <unk> <unk> , other than a few jammed and skipped zippers , but it is annoying and disappointing to see wenger 's quality deteriorate the material is also showing signs of wear the low price does not make up for what was once a trusted name in knives and backpacks
i 've had this backpack since march and its protected my mac book pro # `` through many days trekking to school and back as well as weekend gigs just this week however the main zipper failed and that makes the main laptop compartment pretty useless it had a pretty robust warranty but i 'm not sure about how well that will work or how accessible it will be to get it fixed other than this i find the many compartments and the comfortable straps to be great
i purchased this bag because reviews led me to believe would hold any # `` laptop theoretically , my asus g # v fits , but i have to push it down into the padding and stretch the zippers to get them to close my concern is , other than how long the stitching will last , is that there is no room for any padding/protection on the corners all else seems to be as described i own other swissgear bags and have always been very satisfied with their quality this laptop is the largest # `` model that i 've seen , so anything smaller will fit i 'll add to the review after i 've owned it for a while , if i decide to keep the bag
i used this backpack for # good solid years of travel all over the world and through many airports it is a durable bag with a lot of room for your gadgets i think its demise came when i upgraded to a dell m # `` wide screen # months ago this laptop `` barely `` fits this laptop and you have to stretch the zipper over the corners of the laptop to get it to fit eventually the zipper teeth broke off and one day , my bag popped open and sent my laptop crashing to the ground i would not purchase this bag again due to it not fitting a dell m # without putting a significant strain on the zippers to close it
fits my # `` macbook pro with no issue lots of nice pockets to organize things feels comfortable to wear needs a little padding at the base of the backpack to absorb ground impact on computer i think in the end i would rather have one less pocket , a bigger area , where i can place more books
this is a great backpack , capable of holding a ton of stuff i routinely carry two laptops , work and personal my # -inch macbook pro fits with no issues , plenty of room for cables , ipads , etc . straps are comfy pros - bag stands up on its own , roomy , comfy , looks good cons - zippers seem a bit cheap , i have already had them tear open twice , luckily with no permanent damage but i wish they were a bit more heavy duty anything capable of carrying this much stuff should have strong zippers
i , personally , have one in black i hesitated about purchasing this color , but decided because of the price difference between it and the one all in black it is a gift for a friend and he is actually a very beautiful color it arrived today and i was very shocked by how good it seems the picture does not do it justice i like it better than all black other than the very elegant appearance , the backpack is very functional and practical ! a must have for all students
i bought this backpack to fit a large laptop it has proven to be very durable as well as having multiple pockets to carry all of the ancillary items i have needed as well i have used it as a business case to carry literature as well as all of my computer accessories this has been a great backpack and very comfortable to carry
had the bag for about a month and i am amazed with the capacity i have dropped it twice , with laptop inside , and no damage certainly exceeded my expectations for a bag
i bought this bag as a gift to my boyfriend as he was starting school he likes his `` electronic `` gadgets so he was very happy to fit his # `` mac , ipad , notebooks , bose headphones in the bag i have not seen it yet but he was very happy with the sturdiness of the bag in my opinion , the backpack delivered more than its value
this backpack is really nice , but a little on the small side for my laptop it 's great , really , other than the fact that i could n't fit my laptop inside my screen turned out to be # . # in and the backpack fits up to # in screens oh , well just be sure yours will fit before you buy for those of you who need a larger one , with lots of room , i would check out everki <unk> # titan laptop backpack it 's pricey , but it is worth the money
got tired and sore from the traditional laptop bag and shoulder strap this is much better for holding my laptop and all my other work related needs professional and casual looking at the same time
i ca n't say much that already has n't been said , but i will quickly <unk> my thoughts on this bag pros - sturdy - lots of pockets - well padded - comfortable to <unk> - i really would like one more smaller pocket that a lot of other swissgear bags have they could have easily put it on here , so i 'm not sure why they left it off it would have been quite useful - the handle on the top of this is made of hard plastic i 'm not sure why , since many other swissgear bags have it made of a softer material that is easier to hold overall , a very good bag that i do n't hesitate to recommend if you overlook those very minor flaws
i really like this backpack it is large enough to fit my laptop but has alot of space for an ipad , <unk> , etc . i love the convenience pocket on top for those things you need to get to quickly the zippers are sturdy , the bag is stylish -lrb- in my opinion -rrb- , and it does fit well on my shoulders i also really like the sturdy handle but i really like the other handle that is also for putting it over the handle on a roller luggage i really like being able to do that the only criticism is the side pockets are just a little too narrow for me i wanted to put in a travel plug -lrb- see my other review -rrb- but it did n't fit i really like this backpack though ! !
i previously had a pegasus model backpack from wegner and loved it i really like the colors on this one , but that 's a personal preference i 'm not overly thrilled with the way it shapes into a <unk> when it 's full but that 's my only disappointment with it it 's got plenty of space and pockets for all my stuff i can easily fit # -inch laptops and their chargers with some space to spare i 'd buy it again if the need <unk>
this back pack is very good well made , sturdy for carrying all the weight the two items missing that keep this from being a # star review are : no waist strap , with all this <unk> in the pack this would help alot . # nd is no rain flaps on the zippers i am in seattle and i am concerned over rain getting into the bag on the long daily commute # . # inch laptop -lrb- # lbs -rrb- # lb power brick . plus lunch , note book , paper work , coffee thermos , <unk> manual , reading book yep , alot fits in this while staying compact
i 've ordered this bag with my new asus # . # inc gaming laptop but my laptop does not fit in this bag my laptop is obviously larger than any # . # laptops if you plan to buy this laptop , do not order it
the inspiron # fits -lrb- very tightly -rrb- in the bag , but the zippers rub on the corners of the laptop i am afraid that it may cause cosmetic damage to the laptop
i find this product excellent because it is for a good size , many compartments and strong i can get with me all my office stuff , like my notebook , papers and even my camera and other electronic <unk>
this is really useful backpack plenty of <unk> <unk> top compartment for keeping mp # players flexible base pad which helps bag to balance on floor great laptop compartment with small pouch for the charger cons : i am not sure about the material used i checked it has good reviews saying durable . . thus purchased . but the material is little cheap then my other swiss gear <unk> all i am enjoying it . it is good overall backpack . <unk> to anyone
excellent bag with many pockets very comfortable and versatile the only thing missing is a good place for papers i would also like the main pocket zipper to go down further
i was happy with this backpack and was bummed when i had to return it it 's well built and the features are good , but it does n't fit my asus g # vx laptop , it simply is n't tall enough so overall it 's great but be sure it 'll fit the machine you have
the laptop back pack is amazing our only complaint is that our # `` laptop barely fits the bag should have been an inch longer to fit the laptop better besides that , its great
bag is very sturdy and has an <unk> number of pockets straps are very comfortable this back has been a life saver during my travels well worth the # bucks i spent on it i would recommend to anyone who wants to protect their electronics
i have had this bag for # years and after many overseas trips that included stuffing it to capacity some of the blue area stitching started to give out this was expected as the zippers were typically pulled very tight i really enjoyed the bag and never ending capacity it seems to have so i ordered the same bag again there have been some minor changes to the bag including a reduction in size of the small pocket at the top that is perfect for passport , wallet , keys , and anything you need quick access to i wish the size of the pocket had remained the same as the old version i was disappointed that within a week of receipt of the bag the black plastic rivet covers at the main handle broke it was only the black plastic between the rivets which is more aesthetic than anything but i was disappoint that it broke in such a short time i checked my old bag and they were still intact if that is all that goes wrong then i still love the bag i would recommend to anyone that travels a lot and needs to carry more than just your computer
it 's a great backpack that 's very spacious and quite well made however , it wo n't fit all # in notebooks albeit mine is <unk> large do n't get it for a gaming laptop like an asus g
i bought this because my computer bag will not fit in my motorcycle saddle bags with the cost of just getting to work and back i like to take my bike as much as possible this back pack allow me to take my computer and needed essentials like my lunch , with ease
the product came was good but my requirement to keep a # & # # ; laptop this bag is too big apart from the laptop sleeve built-in it has a very large base to fit much more items very good for travelers and for carry-ons not for those who may want to carry to office on a daily basis unless you require to carry too many documents and stuff along everyday no ipad sleeve but lot of usual pockets its a buy for the right use
i just purchased a new laptop and quite honestly , did n't realize quite how large it was i 've had my current swiss gear -lrb- who happens to also make this backpack -rrb- pack for over eight years and i love it problem was , it did n't fit my new , larger laptop anyway , the construction is top notch , there 's plenty of room to store whatever you may need , and the pack itself is comfortable to wear with padded straps and back there 's even a port -lrb- space -rrb- for your earphones the laptop <unk> is well constructed with plenty of protection the only drawback i have to this model is the side pockets - i wish they were a little deeper overall , i 'd recommend this to anyone searching for a laptop backpack for any laptop but especially a larger size laptop
i am not a backpack aficionado , but this is a seriously well made item this has pockets everywhere . # days after i started using it , i was finding hidden pockets some of the features i like : the reinforced handle at the top : perfect for when you get on the train and need to take it off this is a sturdy handle that allows easy carrying the bottom is <unk> : also perfect for winter on the train water will not get through when putting it down on the <unk> cell phone pocket on the strap : easy access when the pack is on padded laptop compartment : the padded compartment fits the laptop snugly and i do n't worry it is going to get banged around mp # player headphone pass-through : if you do n't change the song often , this is perfect to keep the headphone cords out of the way i will update this after a few months of use and <unk> but so far , i am very impressed with the quality and design
extraordinary . no competitors to it . . . . . . ... ... ... ... . . ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ...
i 'm very pleased with the quality and size of this product my hp dv # barely fit but it does fit and i do n't have any concerns of damage i ordered mine through <unk> via amazon and they had outstanding service
this backpack is excellent it does n't look too large from the outside , but it is incredibly large and spacious inside the durability of the material used is also superb the shock-absorbing padded shoulder straps are a great touch even fully loaded , it is so balanced that it seems lighter than it actually is
fits my # & # # ; thinkpad laptop with plenty of room lots of room for other things plenty of pockets and sturdy zippers straps are durable and hand carry strap on top is very strong would recommend to others

have n't used the backpack alot yet , but must say that it fits my hp widescreen laptop with ease plenty of compartments and very spacious it seems that this is wenger 's largest laptop bag for # inch widescreen laptops i read review after review of other models that fit `` most `` # `` laptops but were very tight or just would n't close with # `` widescreen laptop i would definitely recommend this bag i believe i paid about $ # , but heard of a best buy `` steal `` back earlier in the year where they went for $ # wished i could 've known back then as the bag retails in <unk> for $ # now
i bought this backpack with the intention of using it for traveling so far so good it fits my # inch notebook with no problem i read previous reviews that this backpack may or may not fit # in notebooks but in my opinion <unk> fits it well it also has excellent padding for my notebook this back pack also has plenty of other compartments for storing some clothes as well with plenty of room the price is very good as compared to prices out there on the market i recommend this backpack for anyone who wants to protect their notebook and have plenty of room for other things
i researched to find the backpack with the best features that would hold my husbands macbook pro he needed to take a public commuter service into the city and needed extra room for lunch , jacket and any materials for things he 's working on he wanted his mac to be well protected and the compartment designed for that in this backpack does a good job i found another brand where customers raved about durability and about how many years their last one lasted the problem was , there was hardly any room in that backpack my husband felt this one was very sturdy , and it has tons of room he loves it we do n't really care if it lasts # years in fact if it can stand a whole year of heavy use i 'll be happy
our grandson research this and ask for it and we were delighted to give him something so very nice it it well built and will hold many things making going to college easier
the thing i like most about the pack is the number of pockets and slots it has to organizes your stuff i carry a lot of electronics gear and i have n't had a better pack than this some people complain about the stitching , bu like with any pack , if you do n't overload it it functions fine just an overall nice pack and worth owning

this is the second one of these backpacks i have purchased my husband loves them he travels alot with his laptop and this is the only backpack he wanted his old one had a clasp break on the shoulder straps , not that it was a flaw he just uses it alot he really appreciates the heavy duty handle with the metal <unk> inside he puts alot of weight in this thing and needs to be sure the handle will hold when he picks it up his oversized laptop fits perfectly and there is plenty of room for all the cords and small tools he has to carry he is still using the old backpack to carry tools in his car
i have had this model of swissgear bag since december # and , since that one was pretty beat up after years of commuting to nyc , i was in the market for a new one well , i loved my bag so much -- and got so used to tucking items into specific pockets -- that it made sense to buy the same bag this bag is durable , has plenty of pockets and places to put items , provides good protection for a laptop and ipad , and just looks good on top of that just one caution : it 's not waterproof and not entirely water resistant , so do n't go <unk> through a <unk> without making sure it 's under your umbrella or <unk> nowhere does it say that it has those features , so this is n't a criticism -- i did give it five stars -- but a caution since it is designed to carry electronics <unk> ; dr : it 's so good that i 'll buy my third one when this wears out
this product did not disappoint i already own `` maxxum from swissgear by wenger computer backpack red `` and wanted another backpack for traveling i chose the ibex especially for traveling through the airport all compartments are closed and only accessible via zipper the ibex is extremely comfortable and i really enjoyed having so much space the straps are also very comfortable great second bag
i purchased this backpack after purchasing another backpack that really did n't work out for me i had a swiss backpack before until i completely wore it out after # + years
i bought this bag to carry my stuff and my macbook pro # inch it handles everything i 've thrown at it my two concerns , and why everything is n't # stars , are that the top corner of the laptop is less protected than i 'd like , and there is no chest strap across the shoulder straps both of these are relatively minor inconveniences , though , in an otherwise excellent product
this backpack is a beast ! it 's so tough and durable it 's lasted me two years and it 's been through a lot it is also very big and the laptop sleeve can hold my alienware m # x laptop this is one of the few backpacks that can fit a # in laptop it is very comfortable to wear even with my laptop and books in it tons of pockets , and overall a well put together backpack great for college students
swiss gear ibex backpack -lrb- for # -in notebook -rrb- really impressed with design and <unk> zippers work beautifully without any struggle many compartments for everything else for traveling while keeping your computer protected
from the first day i got this backpack i loved it i am a college student so it was a little pricey but well worth it it has room for my computer , my textbooks , and my notebooks there is plenty of padding to keep everything safe and a pocket for everything i could n't want a better backpack
bought this bag in march of this year and with lots of use it 's still in near perfect condition it has great padding for the laptop and tons of room for everything else i was able to store my # `` widescreen , school books , charger , mouse , notebooks and pens , and still had tons of unused space it is definitely a little heavy but considering what you are toting it 's normal and not too bad the straps are padded and if you wear the bag properly it sits evenly on your back thanks for a wonderful product just fyi for laptop size : hp dv # t # . # `` widescreen fits perfect with no real issues
hands down the best backpack i have ever owned i 've been a <unk> for years , in my # 's and still travel to work and just about everywhere else with a backpack this thing is sturdy , looks good , great design , plenty of well thought out pockets for various purposes <unk> awesome backpack can not speak highly enough or express how happy i am with this purchase it deserves # out of # stars
i have always been in love with the high quality materials and workmanship of the swiss gear brand i 've got a suitcase from them that has lasted for # years now , and just purchased this backpack a few months ago it 's extremely comfortable , makes the heavy # `` macbook pro feel so light when it 's balanced on my shoulders that i hardly feel it and the material is as always with swiss army , rugged while also aesthetically pleasing i can also fit my workout clothing in the pack in the large middle pocket the laptop is easy to slide in and out of the main pocket and is well-protected by padding laptop accessories fit easily into the two smaller pockets on the outside with plenty of room to spare despite all the space available , the pack is <unk> in a way that it keeps a fairly low profile when the pockets are not being used
i use this backpack for airline travel because i can fit my laptop plus my purse in this bag i notice that technically the measurements are slightly bigger than united now allows for a ` personal item ' but so far i have n't been called out on that i love all the pockets and spaces to organize my things
owned for over # months i gave the padding rating four stars because i wish it had a hard shell inside for my laptop , but i have n't had any problems this bag holds an enormous amount of gear and is extremely comfortable to wear even when fully loaded -lrb- at one point i was carrying close to # pounds of gear and it felt just fine -rrb- plus it looks great and has all kinds of interesting design elements such as the <unk> steel cable handle best bag i 've ever owned
there are a lot of great things to say about this backpack i will just point out some of the things that stood out to me large zippers are great , thick material , lots of pockets and pouches for its size i would highly recommend this backpack to anyone
lots of room i have a # inch laptop and it fits perfectly <unk> of pocket and padding straps are strong and well made does n't seem to get dirty quick either i took a bit of time looking for a reasonably priced back pack and this one was the best i found to get anything similar or better you 'd have to spend a lot more
