the bag is ok , but the telescoping handle failed on the # nd business trip it is very difficult -lrb- impossible -rrb- to put a bag with an extended handle into the overhead storage of an airplane i would like to simply disable the locking mechanism entirely , but the construction is riveted and can not be <unk> service life of this bag was less than one month , # . # business trips
this was ordered specifically because there was yellow inside shown in the pictures there is no color inside besides black very disappointed as this was a gift if you are expecting or wanting color inside , do not order
do n't buy this item this item is different than what is mailed poor quality , there is no yellow as <unk> says it 's big and bulky , with little support for laptop also forget returning the item , they will not <unk> beware of this company
i am so disappointed in the quality of this bag while it has all the space i wanted , is lightweight and easy to lift , when necessary , the underside where the wheels are located is already ripped and badly scratched i have had it a month time to contact the manufacturer
the bag is about # `` taller larger than the one i was replacing and a bit bulkier that i had expected i am a little worried about the handle because it looks like the same handle as the last bag i had where the handle just came off when i lifted the bag using the handle i guess i am not supposed to do that - so i have been careful let 's see how it holds up it does have a lot of space and holds everything i need to roll around quite well i have seen bags with handles which are sturdier and i guess i will continue to look around for something better made and slightly smaller
i got this bag as a gift from my parents it does it job , but it came with a barely functioning front zipper i tried every possible way to zip it up also , the handle 's <unk> and feels like it 's going to break if i had to choose another bag , this would not be the one
it is a good case but not exactly what i was looking for i have an older targus case for a # & # # ; laptop that i really love , but ca n't seem to find the same thing in # & # # ; so my problems with this case is more of a personal preference
i bought this based on others reviews saying it fit all their business papers i use both paper and binders and this bag does not provide a lot of space for both also i have an ipad and computer which is also does n't offer a ton of space for your computer i would buy a different one if i could
this bag is wonderful for local events and travel via car to presentations but forget bringing this on flights because it 's far too wide to roll down the aisle of airplanes i had to heft this bag , filled with computer gear , projector , batteries , cables and shoes/clothes over everyone 's head on the plane hurt my back and <unk> someone on the head terrible for flights otherwise great for car travel
this case is extremely large , but not really set up to fit more than a computer , papers , and a change of light clothing it is far too large for the storage space you get because of its size , it also must be `` gate checked `` at the airport if you are on a smaller plane since gate checking a computer is not advisable , this means you must carry the computer along with any other items you need on the flight not a great deal i 'm returning it
the bag is roomy and can hold a laptop and portable printer we also carry cables and paperwork , all without very much effort the only major issue is balance no matter how you store things it will fall forward on it own , does n't damage anything but gets the bag dirty and annoys us having to pick it up often
the case satisfied my needs to carry an alienware # inch laptop -lrb- # . # inches wide -rrb- and more the handle and wheels were sturdy but the first time the airlines handled the bag , they <unk> the zipper zippers for something designed to travel should be heavier duty
i uses it everyday so the wear and tear does n't whole up i 've already noticed the tearing on the bottom of the case , i will have to purchase a another one pretty
bought this bag right before a week long business trip and mainly because i liked all the compartments it had to organize your computer and files etc . . i also needed something i could move easily through airports unfortunately , by the time i got to the airport the pull up handle had broken i tried to fix it but it looked like a bolt inside the bag that holds it in place came off or snapped i could get it to stay in place so i could at least roll it if i was careful but spent most of my time lugging it by the straps also , it is too large to roll down the aisle or go under the seat when flying so if i wanted to work on a long flight i have to separate what i was working on from the bag and <unk> the bag up into the storage bins on the plane
i wished it was in other colors the zippers run well and it rolls quietly which is great storage is ample but i wished it was n't black inside it is hard to see and dig through so dark inside
i spent a lot of time researching before settling on this bag the major factors that influenced my decision : lightweight with a water bottle holder and enough space for a # night stay unfortunately the bag is too wide to be wheeled down the isle of an airplane so you have to carry it over all the seats , while trying not to hit anyone but besides that , its just lovely
i do n't like that you ca n't adjust the handle to any size , its either up or down , but i do like if i travel i have a all in one case
the targus citygear rolling travel case has plenty of room for my laptop , small projector , and all of the computer accessories necessary for me to provide training while on travel i always take my travel case with me on the airplane and on the larger planes the case fits easily in the overhead above the seats on smaller planes the case usually fits comfortably under the seat in front of me the price i received from amazon was fantastic compared to other places i researched
i could n't be more pleased with my rolling computer bag i have a number of targus products , and all have been really excellent and durable now , this bag is n't tiny , but rolls easily and really has plenty of room for everything - maybe even a `` change of clothes `` as advertised however , it has room for my # inch laptop , handouts for # people , small speakers if needed and cords , you wo n't be sorry
this is a good bag for traveling with lots of stuff i am a teacher so i have a lot of books and paperwork to lug around this bag is preventing me from having a bad back
i needed something for my laptop and to be able hold books it is a decent bag pro 's -- saves your back so you do n't have to have a bag on your shoulder -- seems pretty sturdy and made well -- lot 's of pockets and storage areas -- rolls smooth con 's -- doesnt fit a # & # # ; laptop well -- doesnt hold many books at one time in summary , overall a great bag had to give it # instead of # for the above con 's i would purchase again even with the con 's
had this product since january , very good and i have travelled with this product also i put everything in this when going to work , it is good it fits two laptops one is # inches laptop and other is # , very good travel case
the targus rolling travel notebook case adequately meets all of my needs the case provides ample room for my # `` notebook , with ample room for my power cord and other accessories although i have n't traveled by air with it yet , i think it will serve those purposes nicely too my only wish is that the `` cargo `` compartment would be just a bit larger i know i 'm probably trying to carry too much stuff in this case , but if i am carrying my notebook , there is not much room in the other compartment i 'm sure it would definitely hold a shirt , but not really much more than that still , overall , it 's a good case
this is a really nice bag i gave it # stars because the only missing thing i can find is a little irritating there are n't enough little pouches for flash drives , etc . you either dump them in a big bag at the bottom or they float around in a big case
just got back from my # st trip to asia with this bag it worked great i travel with several sets of # drawings , project files , laptop , power adapters , etc . . all this stuff adds up to a lot of weight that really takes a toll on my back and shoulders this bag carried it all through airports and meetings with no problems
this is definitely a great bag for an overnight traveler the reviews i read before purchasing it did say that , but i guess i did n't realize how big it would be until i got it it 's almost the size of a small carry-on suitcase there is a lot of storage room for anything you might possibly need it 's heavy , as i found out while carrying it up and down subway stairs - thankfully it comes with a nice shoulder strap the retractable handle is a nice feature and works well the wheels seemed very durable as i pulled it all over the streets of new york in february
the brief case if a nice travel bag from the office but is a little bigger then i was looking for it is more like a small suitcase great for overnight trips
no complaints to mention everything worked as expected and advertised quick shipping , arrived new in box would buy again if needed i am a pilot and use the bag daily for my flights around the country its held up to my daily use now for a year
it was so hard for me to find a computer bad that would fit my # inch computer and this did it and i still have space i am an instructor at a college and need something that will hold my books and laptop and be easy to cary around the wheels on this item help my back and have proved to be the best investment that i have made there are so many pockets and i love how it has a place for an ipad i do n't have one but i have a kindle and i put it in there and i know it will be safe because it is so padded this is something you should definitely get especially if you travel alot and have a huge computer
i travel with # laptops one of my own is a # inch dell and a smaller one for business this is the perfect fit for both boxes and cables and i also have room for all the rest of the stuff i need to do business when i 'm on the road
i love this bag it accommodates my # & # # ; laptop very well i have room for all my books i could even add in a couple of outfits if needed i look forward to traveling with this bag it is very well organized for my needs
bought this for my ten year old daughter so it 's been threw the ringer and it 's still looking great she needed it for her laptop and electronics when we went in vacation and it holds a lot and really is a nice
this is the only case i 've found that comfortably carries my <unk> asus g # s -lrb- about the size of an alienware -rrb- it also has room for my macbook , ipad , cables , mice and lots of other small items what i really like is that it does n't fall over , like all my other bags did when the bag is fully packed , it might seem like it wo n't fit in the overhead bin of a small <unk> , but it does ! -lrb- though without a <unk> to spare . and when it 's packed and heavy , the sturdy handle and wheels make life much easier however , i 'm not using the included shoulder strap because i thought it was too thin i replaced it with the victorinox comfort fit shoulder strap , which i also bought on amazon
i am a private <unk> and occasionally meet students at other locations this case provides lots of room for all of my books and <unk> as well as being easy to roll the case is study and holds a lot the material is well made and the case looks expensive but thanks to amazon , it was an excellent price you will be glad your purchased this it will serve your needs and keep all of your materials together
this is an excellent case for my # `` laptop : it fits perfectly and it still has some room on the sides is a great for traveling since you can take the laptop fast for security and it has a large compartment for clothes or other stuff the wheels roll very smoothly the handle feels a little fragile , but so far it has work well
i have had this for about a week now and i am very impressed this is a fairly large case so for those looking for something small , this is n't for you i use this for work and it is able to hold my laptop , files , cables , adapters , router , switches , etc . , with no problem i love the ease of smooth rolling and the long handle is a plus for us with long legs great case that i would definitely recommend ! !
my # inch toshiba fits it perfectly it is easy to roll and fits as a carry on there is also enough room to carry papers or a non-bulky change of clothes
strong and durrable i 'm thinking about buying another one great price and great item not like other 's similar to this product that were cheap this item is <unk> , durable , and just the right size for a busy working woman with lots to carry
i have use this product for three months now travel every week and this thing is held up nicely since i live out of the suitcase it is important that it is a quality bag should this one ever fail , i will purchase another i like all the pockets this one has
this has lived up to great expectations good quality and great space not only for laptop but room for a set of clothing , notebooks , files , and other personal items has done very well through many business trips highly recommend this product
perfect for travel i have a larger lap top and it fit perfectly i loved the pockets and slots for extra papers , cords , plugs etc . it was well worth the money and saved my back and shoulders
just received my travel case and started loading some of my accessories , the quality of construction looks to be excellent and there are so many extra features that make this case a pleasure to use i can store everything i need in one case and have room for extra items i want to keep with me and be easy to find when i need them
great bag - plenty of pockets for all the cables and accessories - well thought out by designers hp # `` laptop fits perfectly back compartment can be used for personal items such as clothing etc or for a printer or scanner . i would recommend this bag to anyone who has a large monitor laptop
i think it is very nice it has a lot of room to be organized and will be perfect for a quick trip for work , or even for play i travel a lot for work and this will be perfect it has a nice compartment for clothes and two other compartments for the laptop and any documents you may need it will make a perfect carryon item , and i wo n't have to worry about checked luggage the one thing i would change is making the clothing compartment open all the way up so that it would lay flat and be easier to pack otherwise this will fit all of my travel needs
the targus <unk> # holds my laptop safely and has plenty of room left over to tote books and papers the compartments are roomy and accessible with pockets galore because the dimensions are sized for a # `` laptop , files fit easily into the case without being forced the zipper on the computer section has the safety feature of only being top loading i have owned this computer case since # and use it daily , packed to the gills a problem developed and i hoped for a replacement part instead , the company not only honored the life time warranty , they told me about it friendly , honest , and fast customer service is so unusual that i felt compelled to <unk> that this fine product is backed by good company policy
i love targus bags anyway and this one did not disappoint very rugged but also great padding for the laptop and it 's saved my back being able to roll all my equipment instead of trying to put in a shoulder bag i would buy more if i needed
purchased this case as an `` everyday `` bag for work ... hauling large file folders and <unk> between home and multiple office sites i have been very pleased with it overall it 's large - has to be to hold a # `` laptop and legal size file folders - and has room for everything i need to have with me for the work day i think it will be great for travel as well
i travel about # % of the time , and also carry my laptop and working files between home and office the bag is large enough to carry my things , but small enough for me to <unk> if i need to climb stairs i have had this bag for about a month and i 'm very happy with it the wheels work fine -lrb- i try not to abuse them -rrb- the telescopic handle does not seem sturdy but it works well
had to return it as i needed it for my expensive mac laptop the clasps on the shoulder strap come open and the briefcase crashes to the ground -lrb- i saw this problem in other reviews but hoped that had been corrected -rrb- i really liked it overall but it was n't worth losing my mac because i liked it in general i called the company to see about getting a strap with a better clasp and got the email address of the person i spoke to she never called back or answered my email so i wound up returning the whole thing a loss for both parties
he carried it to college and now to his new job , great bag grandson seems to be enjoying it and he should since he chose it for me to buy
i got an offer to get this case at a discounted rate with the purchase of my new laptop normally , i am skeptical of offers like this , but i found this case to be exceptional it is very high quality i think i would drop it and my laptop would be just fine a couple of layers of protection and nice pockets to hold all your accessories like chords , flash drives , and whatever else you need i have has several laptop cases and this is by far the very best one i have put it through the paces and it still looks and performs great
good quality product great case with more than enough room for a # `` laptop and all the accessories that go with it i looked at several other cases that cost more before i bought this one this is a far better value , provided better protection and has a lifetime warranty
this case arrived as packaged by the manufacturer upon opening the zipper was already broke the nylon teeth would not mesh together and stay together and that was without putting anything in the case i have a dell inspiron # which is a # . # inch screen the v opening would allow the laptop to fit in one direction the handles were not well padded and carrying that large of a laptop by the case handles would be uncomfortable after a short time i was very disappointed i also got stuck paying the shipping and handling fees -lrb- almost $ # . # -rrb- to get a bad product but at least computer brain did have <unk> pick it up at no charge to me
i ca n't say it was n't as advertised , and is a solid protector of my laptop with the extra padding still , i think it would be even better if it opened so that the laptop could be used within the case other than that , a good product
a sturdy case , my computer measures # inches across and there is lots of room it does the job for me but i do n't travel much i do n't think you could carry a lot of extra stuff in this case but there is room for papers and a few things
i needed a bigger bag not for a bigger computer but for all the extra stuff i needed to carry for my job this works well i wish the side flap had a snap or zipper or something to hold it shut is my only complaint
looks & feels great i gave as a xmas gift to hubby he loves it it was made for a # `` laptop , but we have a # `` ... still works great i 'm real happy with this purchase
mobile edge <unk> # <unk> # inch select <unk> notebook case-this item was a last minute thought for christmas and was heading to iraq it was on time and the item was exactly what was asked for
very secure , really protects the laptop , i especially like the small access flap for getting to your boarding pass , make travelling with your laptop much easier has enough room for a bulky travel power adapter , usb cable , small usb mouse and still holds a folder of papers -lrb- approx . # `` -rrb-
i have a new hp pavillion # e # laptop with # . # inch display the dimensions are # . # x # . # x # . # this fits great in the mobile edge select <unk> # . # and fits perfectly in the inner pouch with some room to spare other cases that are for # inch laptops are too small for the # . # inch length but this one can hold a # inch length as stated by amazon construction is very <unk> i am pleased with this purchase <unk> case is # in wide mobile edge makes this same case # in wide
i really was impressed with this product i thought it looked kinda cheap in the pic but it turned out great it 's an awsome product and i would purchase anything from them
nice bag , lots of room for extras , has pockets for cd 's / dvd 's , business cards , pens , chargers , file folders , mouse , mobile phone etc . it is well made , lightweight , nice looking and not bulky most importantly it fits larger than # `` screen laptops my hp hdx # fits perfectly even with the included padded computer protection sleeve , and has about another quarter inch in both directions , so it should accommodate other brand # `` screens i would definitely recommend this bag for anyone with a # `` or over laptop
i 've had a targus briefcase that ive used and loved for the past # years as it is showing its age , i searched for the exact same product , however looks like targus redesigned the tote and made it much larger i liked my old targus with a carry handle and not as tall this tote is much too big for # ' # & # # ; person perhaps okay for someone taller
i did read the measurements , but i guess they did n't tell the whole story for me when this arrived , i realized i never could use it as a shoulder carry-on for my laptop -- the dimensions were just too massive the width was ok for a laptop , but the height was considerable , so it felt like i was carrying the equivalent of a garment bag it did seem sturdy though -- unfortunately i had to send it back so i can not comment on its durability
i am so surprised by all of the rave reviews this bag is just simply , ok the `` pleather `` has a cheap look and feel to it , and does not look even close to a $ # + + bag the bag however is a great size , and is comfortable to carry i think i will end up keeping it for now , and continue looking for something nicer
i purchased this to carry my laptop at conferences after carrying the bag with laptop for three days , i could barely lift my arm it looks good but is so very heavy i wish i had sacrificed looks and got a laptop backpack instead
this bag is enormous and by enormous , you can probably fit an entire <unk> in there seriously though , this is the type of bag that you use for the beach , not for work or carrying around a laptop i originally bought the bag for school and my laptop i did n't realize it would look so huge and strange it 's definitely not for walking around the city or a campus nonetheless , the bag is great and it has a cute pouch inside there are a million pockets that i 'm not sure i where to start with them the leathery quality is decent and the bag felt sturdy i eventually had to sell it because i had little use for it
i was looking for something that would take the essentials of my purse in addition to my laptop and calendar and this tote takes everything perfectly the exterior pockets make flying easy with the <unk> of my boarding pass and id
i purchased this bag mainly to carry my lap top , but it is so roomy i can get everything in it it is comfortable to carry on or off the shoulder i especially like the pink ribbon charm that came on mine nice bag and a very reasonable price
i bought this bag # years ago and use it every day it has held up very well i needed a work bag that could transport my computer , paperwork , wallet and other work necessities i also needed something that would pass for a `` personal carry-on `` for domestic flights since i often also have a <unk> bag this bag does it all , plus it looks nice i looked at numerous stores for a good work bag and came up empty handed i 'm glad i went with the online option
the bag arrived after # days , and considering i paid for # day delivery , that is very impressive it was securely shipped , and the bag is gorgeous bigger than i thought it would be , so my # `` macbook has <unk> of space but i 'm really happy with it
i am at a conference as i write this and beside me is this bag i am able to carry my laptop , some <unk> and the contents of my purse all within a very stylish bag worth the money
i wanted a bag that would carry my really thin laptop like it <unk> in it and not have the round straps that # % of the laptop bags do i was not disappointed i have owned targus bags in the past that ten years later still look new and this one looks to be up to that challenge as well months later and i am still thrilled with my purchase
she does n't even use this for computer but for books she is a <unk> teacher and she <unk> around some heavy books which tore up every purse she had and she did n't want to carry a backpack this was the perfect solution that <unk> the practical with style
bought it for my wife the quality is good , and looks like it will last she is a teacher and does lesson plans at home she is always bring books back and forth , along with her laptop , and this thing holds almost all of it ! -lrb- before she would use # or # bags every day -rrb-
i bought this for my daughter she found it at amazon and <unk> was what she wanted when it arrived it looked huge she was <unk> about it then she got out her laptop -lrb- which has an <unk> -rrb- and realized it was perfect she 's been using it every <unk> her job and is very satisfied -- very happy with it
this was a great buy and value i am a teacher and use this tote daily to carry my items back and forth it will carry all my papers as well as the laptop w / room to spare i really like the fact that it has `` feet `` on the bottom , so it stands up i would definitely recommend this product
<unk> this product is not smooth as it has no ball bearings for me it is useless it is just one disk on top of another disc , without as much as some <unk> to smooth the <unk> this is a much better one :
received product quickly and in perfect condition it 's very thin as advertised and i 'm using it for a <unk> laptop that i need to spin # degrees depending on where i 'm sitting it 's a bit more flimsy than i thought it might be , but does the job if i 'm careful spinning the machine -lrb- dell xps m # -rrb- if i 'm not careful , the machine gets knocked off the pad this happens frequently , although i 'm getting better at being more consistently careful to avoid that the rubber along the edges has separated a bit due to this , but it 's easy to 're - stick ' it back down on it 's underlying hard-plastic <unk> i would buy another one for $ # , but not $ #
the laptop does n't sit securely on the <unk> we are using the laptop between two desks at work and need to turn it between the users and the laptop does n't always stay on the <unk> we are going to have to modify the unit with velcro to keep it in place i would n't recommend this product disappointing to say the least
we purchased this product for our new # inch flat screen <unk> we had limited vertical space under a cabinet so the very small thickness of this product was a must the <unk> turns smoothly with little effort this product was exactly what we needed
this bag is not for those with a # . # `` laptop and if the intent is everyday use , it 's not for women on the smaller side , either - this is a high quality bag with a good quality ballistic <unk> zippers are of better quality than those used on targus bags at this price point there are also holes in the zipper pulls that allow you to lock your case-this bag 's strap is remarkably comfortable even when i 'm carrying a lot in it - there is too much movement on the vertical <unk> for my dell xps m # when the computer is strapped in - i would have preferred a little more storage space in the front of the bag in exchange for the extra padding - i am a relatively thin woman who is about # ' # this bag looks like it is wearing me , not the other way around - this is n't the <unk> bag out there try to find a view that shows the side as the front view shown here does not capture the substantial girth this bag has
this is a versatile and <unk> computer bag about my only knock is that the velcro closure system for the <unk> side panel needs , well , more velcro , something i 've added on my own the bag holds a laptop , all the electronic accoutrements of business travel , plus papers , magazines , etc . i had one stolen , and replaced it with the exact same bag
i recently bought this for my macbook pro , and let me just say it 's huge and heavy however , my macbook pro is very secure and seems near <unk> in it it has more pockets and zippers than i knew what to do with , but now i 've filled them all out nicely and have room for everything i usually care some work books , my power adapter , # controller , and all kinds of stuff overall , i 'm very satisfied in its build quality , i just was n't expecting it to be so bulky
i purchased this bag for my mom and the bag was just too heavy for her i had to return it if it were for me , i would 've kept it pros - almost everything from design to material lots of space cons - it is heavy , bag itself is # pounds
essentially , the bag has all the compartments you would want in a professional laptop bag it has the document organizer , space for all electronics , and the great padding for the actual laptop however , all of this convenience does not come with a price all of the features makes the bag a bit heavier and bulkier then most so if you 're looking for something much more portable or easier to manage , i would suggest something else however , if <unk> and utility are what you 're looking for then this bag is perfect
my # . # `` dell fits in very snug & secure , very well constructed of high quality materials i 'm sure it will last forever slight con : it could have a little better pocket layout -lrb- secure battery compartment -rrb- is a little on the heavy side
i searched all over for a laptop case that would give me the option of securing my laptop without just sliding it in , but found that all of them were poorly made or had no side-pockets i 'm a college student and i take my laptop everywhere i go , along with notebooks and textbooks this sturdy bag can carry it all the outside pocket is great for organizing pens , calculators , <unk> , cell phones , etc . the only gripe i have is that , while the strap is adjustable , it could be better i would like it if i could make the strap be longer than the maximum length it also should be removable if you want to carry the case extensively briefcase-style overall great bag that will perform well and protect your investment nicely
this bag is great for anyone who needs to carry a laptop plus business files it has lots of pockets and feels very durable thick padding for the laptop keeps it safe you can open you laptop without removing it from the bag i would recommend this bag to anyone
i enjoy this case for my laptop it has an elastic strap to secure & keep your laptop from sliding about it is very well made with ample padding everywhere my # . # `` toshiba notebook fits very snug in its designated compartment ; i know it will be safe and secure in there also , there are plenty of compartments for documents , cell phone , pens , keys , drivers license , etc . even has a zipper where you can use a small travel lock when traveling i knew before hand that this case was a bit bulky and a little on the large side , but it 's made to protect my computer for the cost , reputation , and wenger name it is a deal for those of you that do n't know : wenger is the maker of the genuine swiss army knife
bought this bag for myself <unk> of a very basic and mostly lightweight bag to carry computer and a few papers it is light , provides enough padding for small trips -lrb- car - home - office -rrb- the only thing that could be improved is the front flap is not really a pocket and hold very little in the direction it is positioned it would be nice to have a better outer pocket t put a few small items overall if you are looking for an overall basic lightweight computer bag it seems durable
case logic <unk> # . # -inch <unk> lightweight laptop and tablet pc case -lrb- grey nice case but outside compartment faces down so if you open it in upright position `` things `` will fall out hard to fit all accessory cords and charger
the product is indeed light and convenient , though the grey color that it was advertised under is misleading it is grey . . with a hint , in my opinion , of an olive green caught me off guard , i guess its a comfortable bag , though i 'm not sure if it was worth it for the price of # bucks
it 's a good case , it holds the laptop when you are n't using it which is what a case is supposed to do the quality of the material is fantastic , looks somewhat like a briefcase it 's by no means ' cheap ' in the quality of the materials it was made from the only thing i do n't like about it , is that it does n't open up all the way around , like some other cases this might not be important to some people , but it was to me you know , so that i would n't have to worry about resting the naked laptop on a dirty table it 's a good
i have owned this product for a couple of months and it is a good buy for the money it is light weight , compact , durable and attractive it has a padded shoulder strap and handles i was n't sure if i would like it , but i am impressed with the quality of it i would recommend this bag if you are looking for a light weight bag
i bought this product not long ago , at first i had some doubts because i wanted to see a little more than the picture showed , but when i got it i was completely pleased with it the material is resistant and the colors real nice , it is great for a # `` laptop it also has an inside zipper to put some papers that is not shown in the picture really loved it ... buy it , is worth it
the first impression of this case is that it is super light it held my dell xps # -lrb- with # . # inch screen -rrb- , an ac adapter , and a mouse without any problems moreover , the case did n't feel bulky as it does with many laptop cases which <unk> the laptop protection i suppose those bulky laptop cases are fine if you drop the case often but this case just works fine for average drops -lrb- unless you have a really fragile laptop -rrb- it is a perfect size for my needs and i highly recommend it for those who are seeking a laptop case with small form and weight factor
i am sorry , but i was so excited to have this but its not very strong material i was trying to find a cute bag for my laptop and so on i was so excited about this bag when i got it , my laptop fit in there perfectly so i tried to pack up with my laptop charger i realized that theres no place for laptop chargers so i personally dont think its worth it not the worth the money and time -lrb- upset !
i ordered for a friend who really wanted to carry her computer in it it worked great for the first month or so then one of the straps broke she liked the way it looked a lot but very poor construction
this bag 's strap broke after two weeks , and it 's now unusable was n't putting anything but the laptop in there , and it seems ridiculous that a laptop would be too heavy for a laptop bag do n't waste your money on this horrible bag
