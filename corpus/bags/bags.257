i needed a laptop bag that was n't $ # or more i looked around at local stores and could n't find anything that seemed worth the price tag this case is beyond the quality i expected thank you amazon the only thing i would 've asked for was a little bit more padding but that 's a minor thing since i do n't plan on swinging this around like a <unk> for what i paid though -lrb- $ # -rrb- , i could n't ask for a better case it has plenty of room for my hp , my power cord , and my anker wireless mouse no need to look any further people buy this laptop bag , the & # # ; name & # # ; brands are n't worth the price for the same quality
great for the price not real wide , so do n't get it if you want to carry alot of other stuff around with it add the power supply , it really bulks up the case i knew this going it , but i 'm not thrilled with plastic hooks and rings for the shoulder strap i have purchased a few for staff here and none have broken , it just worries me that its plastic it 's a good case for just being a case
holds either my ipad or netbook with no problem has a convenient outer zippered pocket for the power adapters and cables for the price , you ca n't beat this basic bag
bag holds my netbook , power supply , and wireless mouse it is a little too big , though a bag for # `` netbooks should fit a # `` snug this one is about # . # `` taller than the netbook , so there is an unnecessary amount of space left over in the main compartment not a deal breaker , but annoying imho zippers are nice and big , and feel of good quality -lrb- i would have preferred velcro , but that is a personal preference -rrb- the material feels soft and supportive handles are useful overall , i am pleased
it 's good quality for the price however , i bought it for my friend 's laptop and just an fyi for everyone out there who 's thinking of doing the same - barely fits inside the bag you have to stuff it into the bag and can barely close it the fit is so tight other than that seems to be of good material and has a shoulder strap -lrb- which is a big bonus -rrb-
it is a great little bag i especially like the handles , and the size is perfect however , the day i received it , on of the zipper `` pulls `` fell off that was annoying otherwise , a great item
ca n't beat at this price , not with a stick could use more pockets but the bags i 've seen for twice the price have more so one could always get more pockets if you do n't mind losing $ $
well made , rugged a nice value for the $ $ $ plenty of pockets and nice , thick , quality material are there fancier bags out there do they carry your laptop any better of course not
bought # of these to hold my kids ipad mini 's its a bit to big for a mini but works nonetheless the zippable pocket on the outside holds the charging cable , power block , etc . the inside of the bag is soft and orange in color the only thing that is lacking is the amount of padding it is enough for a carrying case/bag but dont expect it to protect very well from a higher fall
bought this to cart around my ipad air -lrb- in a leather case with a bluetooth keyboard -rrb- and its accessories strap handle is a nice touch pocket on one side is plenty big enough for ipad 's <unk> plus hdmi adapter and cable zippers work very well great buy for the price
i love everything amazon i especially like their basics line i 've bought a few things and they 've all been <unk> and at great prices <unk> <unk> , will you <unk> me
this is the perfect size for my mini projector and all the cables i used with it the quality to of the material is very good - it is made of a <unk> stretchy type of material that is easy to clean and slightly water resistant -lrb- not water proof -rrb- this is a great little tech bag - i highly recommend it
i keep my kindle in this bag when going out especially on very cold days ... it 's big enough also for my amazon basics keyboard and the amazon basics stand has plenty of room this is a great bag and for a great price my daughter also has one for her ipad very pleased with this purchase
great price , and good product i ordered one for external mini speakers and all those wires , and one for my kindle fire this product has a separate mini zippered storage area as well -- for more wires if you are going to watch videos or listen to music on your fire , you 'll want speakers -- that means extra wires at this price
this case is good for traveling i throw my full size ipad in its leather case into this case along with the charger take it on trips with the easy carry handles
i bought this to transport multiple items on a recent trip overseas i had my digital photo camera , my kindle , the power cords for both and some usb sticks and memory cards this case protected all my items and i could use it as a travel bag when i took them with me to use the contents away from the house
great mini laptop case for the money spent our # . # & # # ; mini fits in it perfectly ca n't beat the free # -day prime shipping plenty of room in this little case for the small portable dvd drive , laptop power supply , a few <unk> dvds , portable mouse , usb stick , phone charger , small headphones and extra cables , etc . it looks just a little stuffed after all that , but the zippers still close easily this little case has made our flight and car travel very compact and easy
it was exactly what i was looking for a well padded bag that i can carry by itself or throw in my big purse zipper front pocket is great for the charger and earphones
this works great for my hp touchpad it has excellent padding and is constructed very well there is a little more room in the case than my hp touchpad takes up so i wish it was a slight bit smaller but it 's a great universal bag
this bag is worth the price based on how well built it feels holds my ipad with the logitech ultrathin keyboard cover attached to it plus the side pocket holds all my charge cables and wall plug adaptor
i got this netbook bag for my ipad # with cover , but initially found it too big however , after using it for a while , the extra size has come in very handy the notebook bag has a front zippered pocket in which i store my usb cords , chargers , ipad pens , etc , and am now very happy with my purchase so , if you plan to put ipad accessories in addition to the ipad w / case , then this is a wonderful netbook bag
love the case and the room it provides well made and not a bad looking case at that bought this for my chromebook and it 's a great fit holds the charger and mouse and whatever other things i may need when transporting i recommend it
i also bought the incipio ipad # premium kickstand case to put on our ipad to protect it -lrb- we have # kids -rrb- and it fits nicely into this bag so it can be taken places and be extra protected
i already had a sleeve case i bought for my nexus , but there is no room for things like the power cord , key drives , reading glasses , etc . this is just exactly what i was looking for a safe case for the nexus # , as well as an extra pocket for accessories and handles make it easy to carry on airplanes , hotels , etc . well made , well priced
exactly what i needed and more this was a great price and fit my kindle # . # hd with keyboard and cords with protective case on kindle got here quickly too
this is a great case for a travel or safe storage of my new ipad i have a folio cover for everyday use but this gives extra padding for traveling especially in a day pack the large double zippers make for easy access and the padding gives me peace of mind a nice bag for the price
bought for my new asus q # e although not sure if it would fit but it did just fine this is a quality product at a bargain price look no further
i bought this for my new acer c # chromebook -lrb- # . # & # # ; -rrb- it comfortably holds what i need and the bag 's size is not bulky or too tight the canvas , zipper and stitching are good quality the inside material feels a bit ` <unk> ' - but i think this will go away as it breaks in and i think i will get used to it overall i love having a light weight bag that holds everything i need - and i am pleased about not having to pay much for this one
amazon hit a sweet spot of <unk> with this little satchel good protection , perfect -lrb- not too big , not too small -rrb- size for many devices + their accessories , simple and straightforward , and very well made <unk> <unk> * would 've been proud * -lrb- any color as long as it 's black - but that 's not a problem
this is a really nice item , and great price my husband loves it -- and he did n't want one -- thought he did n't need it it has really been a good buy to protect an expensive toy
<unk> , sturdy zipper bag is wonderful for my ipad an outer zipper compartment holds the power cord and cleaning pads very high quality product from amazon and i highly recommend it
the zipper and pulls are very sturdy the pouch on the front is just the right size to store the charger and a pen the only thing i would change is the length of the handles if they were a bit longer , i could slip them further down my arms to make carrying large loads easier
really good especially for the price it fits my nine inch portable tv just barely but it does the job , it seems very well made and i love the extra pocket the zipper and pulls are
these bags were the best investment for my grandsons they are always losing their ds games , cartridges , their kindle , ear buds , etc . . . all that techy fun stuff that kids need these days . . which they can not keep up with i had the bags monogrammed with their <unk> , and now everything they need to keep themselves <unk> is easily contained in this handsome bag nothing gets lost now we love his <unk> ... and the price was so right
it is just the right size for all my portable electronics . ipad kindle phone fits just fine it is attractive so i can take it any place and it goes with any
nice construction , and the material feels good quality i used to store my tablets accessories in my backpack that would normally rattle around without it also a great bag if i want to grab a coffee without carrying the backpack
its just a very good bag perfect size for my asus t # , materials used are very high quality and would probably survive for a long time the only thing to be improve would be to add some pockets in the outer section to hold a <unk> and <unk> cards etc .
i purchased this netbook bag for my ipad and i also have an otter case on my ipad , so i needed a case to carry both - it fits perfectly i highly recommend this item to anyone who has a netbook , <unk> or ipad
this bag is much better than it seems in the description i had just purchased a targus bag which cost $ # . # and this bag works better to hold my ipad air , mobile hotspot and the portable stand i also bought on amazon i definitely suggest people to buy this bag to carry their tablets , even ones that are # & # # ; - # & # # ; . it 's
amazon did it again , great product my macbook air fits perfectly , along with my charging cord , ipad mini with a new trent bluetooth case , headphones , and an apple magic mouse oh i also forgot about my samsung # gb external hard drive and cord and it 's not bulky at all , i give it a # out of

great value ! i wanted something for my ipad that has a handle this fits the bill . ipad fits comfortably even with the apple case on it , with outside pocket with zipper for charger etc . not sexy , but way practical and that price !
i have an ipad and it has a silicone skin i like it okay but it was n't the best fit when i bought my daughter 's ipad , i was looking for something more useful and would provide more capabilities this netbook bag was perfect it provides good protection to the unit plus has space for storing the charging accessories the handles are a good size and overall the construction is sound i am actually thinking about getting one for myself now
this is a decent case for my nook it handles the nook itself as well as the charging cord , plus has room for my ipod and it 's charging cord also , plus extra room on top of that it 's sturdy and put together
i bought this case hoping that i could put my file folders and my kindles in it and a work notebook and cell phone it is perfect ... . the zippers work well and feel like they will last i have had trouble with case zippers in the past , so this is something i definitely look at the entire case feels durable and as a bonus i found that i can also put my portable dvd player in it as well i love this case it 's perfect for me

could n't ask for more for such a great price i got this bag for my c # because i wanted something as small as it is it 's got just the right amount of space , light and small . plenty of room for a charger and probably an ipad if you wanted to shove one in there too as well as a small external hard drive , mouse , etc and few other assorted items like phone and charger for that etc .
the quality of this bag is good and it fits nicely my ipad with both it 's leather cover and a logitech bluetooth keyboard cover outside pocket is nice for cables

i sell nylon products and have for over twenty years this is a well made case at a <unk> cost i carry my new ipad and a portable blu-ray player with accessories with room to spare the separated pockets in the main compartment make this a great case for many uses

purchased for ipad # th generation nicely padded and the side pocket is very convenient when i need something now i start looking at the amazon basic brand first as they seem to be a high quality but less expensive option to more expensive choices definitely recommend if you are looking for an inexpensive way of protecting your expensive tablet
this has great pockets , very good zippers and has padding all around great stuff for the cost and lots of different uses i recommend this # % . for my uses i did not see a use for the shoulder strap on such a small case , i took it off but -- it is an excellent quality strap and i used it on something else with great results

i bought this to use with an -lrb- approximately -rrb- # inch notebook -lrb- asus transformer book t # ta -rrb- and i am pleased with its utility , construction and appearance the zippered main pocket and the smaller accessory pocket opens and closes easily and the cushioning is adequate with normally careful handling
this is a cute little basic black bag that fits my ipad and its cover nicely i also throw my keys , phone and a few papers in and i use it daily i am not quite sure about how much protection it actually provides , since i have not had any <unk> yet , but i feel the padding along with my ipad cover is adequate you ca n't beat the quality for the price

i 've purchased this bag to use it with my ipad ant it 's an excellent choice it fits the ipad very well and there 's space left to put papers or other things i just wished the bag would hold the ipad a little better , since it 's very thin but considering it 's a & # # ; one size fits all & # # ; product , i 'm very glad the smaller pocket it 's great to carry accessories and other needs the product met my expectations

i have simply been on the <unk> for a lightweight , simple carrying case for when i am taking my ipad out and about , and want a little more protection than its daily cover i wanted to be able to fit it with its cover on -lrb- the apple standard one -rrb- and not spend a lot of money for it i thought this should be easy ... well , it was n't so easy i love having the daily cover for my electronics be something great to look at , but just to transport it around , fashion was n't worth it for me anyway , i stumbled on this great little <unk> , an amazon & # # ; basic & # # ; , and it is perfect my ipad slips in great with no extra bulk , and the best part is that my kindle fits right into the front pouch now i can carry my two favorite pieces without worrying about them i also think that the basic black may be a <unk> choice for when you must leave your ipad in the car ; it just does n't draw as much attention and in case you 're wondering , the quality appears to be top-notch , also
this is a great little case for a netbook it also has an outside zipper compartment for the charger and mouse it is very light , and takes up little space it is a great buy , especially for the price

amazon came out with the best case and the best price i 'd like to see different colors so my # year old and # year old have a choice but other than that it 's a good
i got this for my son 's ipad # , for him to bring this in the <unk> he has a pretty substantial case on it , and it still fits easily in this bag , along with a notebook and a snack perfect for our needs now that we 've had this for a while , i 'd like to add that the zipper pulls keep falling off my son has compromised fine <unk> <unk> , so not having a zipper pull kind of makes this difficult to use for him i 'm not sure why it was designed with the space in between the pull and the zipper , but it makes it too easy for them to fall off
nice basic case my hp pavilion # . # with touch screen fits perfect , the dimensions of the hp is # . # & # # ; x # . # & # # ; amazon states that the internal dimensions are # . # & # # ; x # . # & # # ; x # . # & # # ; but the hp fits perfect in it also my ipad air fits in the inside pocket plus my mouse and power supply fit nice in the outer pocket amazon should address the inside dimensions of the bag on there web site
