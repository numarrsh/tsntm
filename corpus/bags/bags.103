i love this color it 's exactly what i wanted fits perfectly and looks great of course the sleeve is going to have a strange plasticy smell because it 's been wrapped up in storage but after it airs out the smell is completely gone my only advice is to make sure that you have lined the case up with your laptop pretty well before you click it into place it 's hard to take off once it 's on and that sort of mistake would drive me crazy
protects laptop greatly , color is bright price was good for all that was <unk> small issues it cracked a bit on edge but nothing damaging still <unk> laptop greatly good investment to protect a mac for years
best gift i have purchased on amazon quality is wonderful the fit is perfect ! i am so very glad i did not purchase this at the apple store besides , the colors that topcase has blows apple away this is a must buy
i 've gotten so many complements on the case and keyboard cover - i love it and it seems everyone else does too ! it does exactly what i wanted it to : keeps my macbook from getting scratched the only drawback was that it tends to pic up even the slightest grease and dirt from my fingers quite easily
if you 're wondering , it does not fit a macbook air # `` with the bookbook case i was hopefully when i put some of my school books in it at the store that it had plenty of room it did n't fit in the laptop compartment or the regular compartment i 'm sure without the case , it would be fine for my macbook and # textbook -lrb- all i need at a time for school -rrb- i 'm really disappointed as i love the bag otherwise , but i love my bookbook just too much to make the trade off
yes , this does offer great protection for my macbook air but ... considering how little i can fit in it -- one air , one folder , one charger -- it seems too <unk> to me what really got to me though is the way it hangs not a very good shoulder bag ; the slots for the clips are n't completely attached to the bag itself , so it hangs awkwardly when you wear it as you would a legit messenger best , in my opinion , as a hand held
i have a macbook pro and wanted to see if it would fit like a glove great room for laptop chargers and even a few extra goodies wish there was a way to lock in the middle of the backpack strap but non the less great backpack recommend if you dont always like carrying you bag over your shoulder
i love this case much more that ant others ive tried before what i like in this i can convert it into backpack , sling pack , or shoulder bag it fits my macbook # -inch and i also sometimes put my ipad inside at the same time i got no issue with that it contains a large external slip pocket with secure snap closure which fits my hard drive , macbook charger , and other stuff what i dislike after using it , i noticed it getting expanded inside -lrb- maybe because i put the laptop and ipad together -rrb-
i have a macbook air computer and it fits perfectly in this bag it has an orange interior and is lightly padded i fixed the strap to fit like a backpack i love it it is lightweight , looks nice and is very comfortable the strap is very easy to adjust i will recommend this bag to my coworkers who just received the same kind of computer
chose this rating because i had hoped a protective case would be thicker this is more of a keep it from getting scratched kinda deal not keep it from breaking kinda deal
i was n't expecting much the color is exactly how it looks in the picture the case itself is fairly flimsy , which i did not mind the only thing that concerns me is that my sleeve was sent with a dented crease in the middle and gets dirty pretty easily
i wanted a case for my laptop and this is exactly what it is but i wanted something that was n't as flimsy as this one i do n't know if i read the description wrong or if it did n't <unk> but i will keep it and use it of course it fits my macbook pro perfectly fine as well if you just want something to cover your laptop and are n't really looking for something fancy , get this
i was expecting a better quality neoprene case but it was kind of <unk> also , like other people have stated , this product has a really weird smell to it that wo n't go away other than that , if you 're just buying this case because you like the color , then go for it the color of the case was really cute and pretty but if you wanted a high quality case that will really protect your macbook then i would suggest looking for a different
received this product within two days for starts , the smell of this product was the first thing ive noticed it has a very strong chemical smell that seems difficult to get rid of . my hands smelled after touching that product its so soft and not very secure i wouldnt recomend this product for those who want secure protect for their macbook its more of a temporary cute protection it slides back and forth its almost like putting your macbook inside a small # `` pillow case overall if you just want something cute , than i would say go for it
i like the case , it fits my mac , nice and snug i just wish the material was more user friendly it gets dirty fairly easily , so i have to be very careful where i lay my case to keep it clean
my daughter bought this for her new mac computer to take back and forth to school it is very nice and it does protect the computer which is in her school bag the color is cute also i would recommend this item
i love my case it is exactly how it is pictured on the site the color is gorgeous and it protects my macbook pro all for a very inexpensive price it was delivered within days of my order
thank you so much it was exactly how it was described , great deal and extremely fast shipping i love my new laptop sleeve i 'll be traveling soon , so its absolutely perfect
color is a perfect tiffany blue not a whole lot of padding but that 's not why i bought this i already have a tiffany blue hard case so this is the perfect compliment to it
the color is pretty nice , the clam shell is a little plastic-like and snaps on have had for a month and it stays on well the screen protector , carrying case -lrb- great color -rrb- is perfect the keyboard cover only covers the board and is flimsy and wo n't stay on the keys i had to tape the corners down but after that it worked mouse pad is a decent size corners curl up a bit but put in under heavy textbooks and it works out great value overall
so it 's been almost # months since i bought this item it 's been a great six months , except recently my laptop slipped off the couch and hit the tile covered by carpet the good news is that the case saved my laptop the bad news is it chipped significantly on the corner and is very sharp so i 'll have to get a new case eventually the product is great but temporary i love the keyboard cover and separate cover it comes with my friends have all complemented me on the color of the case itself it 's still a good value regardless
i <unk> the crew that <unk> together this <unk> for the smaller macbook air with each <unk> inside the neoprene case , i feel that i am opening a sleek <unk> , worthy of its <unk> container the portion that snaps to my computer fits like a fine leather glove , <unk> <unk> the blemishes that had pocked their way onto my <unk> computer while another reviewer <unk> reported that the bright blue side is smudged almost immediately , i found that simply flipping the case <unk> allowed the sleek black side to take the brunt of the abuse well done , # in # bundle
the # in # bundle is worth buying it came before the posted date the case fits well and the computer fits nicely in the sleeve the keyboard cover keeps the keys clean the screen protector is helpful
i 've had this case for # + months now when i first opened it , i was a little worried because it looked flimsy , but it looks and feels much better once it is on the mbair so far no complaints it 's durable even after a # week trip to japan
this is a really good bundle the color is true to its image online i was n't able to use the screen protector , though , because it caught lint before i even applied it to the screen so i ended it up throwing it away not a major loss topcase should consider a better <unk> than a free mousepad bearing their logo , since it seems far less people are using mice with their laptops these days
i ca n't say enough great things about this bundle everything was packaged nicely , arrived early and was exactly what i was looking form i definitely recommend products like this from top case
i just bought an # & # # ; macbook air and could n't find a cover that i liked , locally so i check amazon and found this one i was n't sure about the color but once i saw it and put it on i was thrilled it even came with a matching keyboard cover that was thin and not sticky like others i 've used love it , love it , love it !
super cute ! totally functional , awesome price the keyboard cover is a little hard to get used to , but once you 're used to typing with it , it 's no big deal i have no idea if the plastic cover really protects the computer on an impact because i have yet to drop my computer , but it 's super good looking
i loved my case i received it on the day as told , and looks just as the picture it also fits perfectly and <unk> , and still had the slim look of a macbook
i 've got a few other laptop backpacks , but this has turned out to be my favorite for travel because it fits so compactly under airplane seats and keeps all my stuff organized it has pockets for both my macbook pro or air and my ipad , as well as lots of other pockets for cords and stuff you have to be careful because space is a bit limited , but i can still carry what i really need i also like how it sits on and stays close to my back the one negative i experienced is that one of the zipper pulls came off on my first trip i was able to save it and <unk> it back on with pliers when i got home , but that should n't have happened
holds all my electronics and necessary carry ons in a light weight sturdy case many separate pockets makes it easy to retrieve items will sitting in a cramped airplane seat
the backpack is well made , easy to carry , and is great for going to the library to study i like the many well-designed pockets the outside pocket for a water bottle is a welcome addition i have been through about # backpacks and this one meets my needs the best
loved this product , purchased for our vacation , great size for airplane , used during <unk> park visits , comfortable , fits all your <unk> items and more this is the best backpack that i have purchased this would also be good for college students
just the right size ; just the right number of pockets ; just the right fabric - water proof ; just the right stuff any way you measure it i am a fan ! !
i like it because it is protective but also sleek looking i think i would like a bit of velcro to seal the expansive opening or a pocket for a pen or stylus
fits like a glove granted it provides less than maximum protection if the macbook air is dropped , it is nonetheless , a great sleeve it provides full protection for the vulnerable aluminum macbook air case when in use , the hinge side of the air is the edge that is in the opening position so it creates a snug fit i like that the elastic strap works well and i like that it is so easy to stretch it into place i hope the sleeve 's neoprene surface is n't prone to wear after heavy use but then again , i 'd rather the case take the scuffs while my macbook air continues to look like new
as one who has cracked the display on a macbook , i appreciate a little extra protection this sleeve is easy to use and comes with the safety strap that keeps the world 's best notebook computer in good working order worth the price and besides , it looks cool too
this stylish sleeve for macbook air # & # # ; is amazingly good looking and functional i 've only used it on one business trip so far , but it seems to be holding up very well take note that this sleeve does not totally protect your laptop , as the top is open great design and functionality
this is a really great product , great materials , beautifully executed i am not sure how great it would be if you dropped you computer from a height in this case , it is more that it protects it from scratches , but i really love
if your macbook air has round white pads that sit in <unk> they simple will not fit the diameter is slightly larger than the socket edges and the protrusions on the bottom of the pads further make them simply not fit
these are <unk> and i 'm sure will come off soon because of the weak adhesive used on the back the only reason i did n't sent them back is not having something there was worse
i received the items and they were not as pictured totally different product and unusable for my macbook if it were ` nt more expense to return them than i paid for them , i would
these work great for about # months but if your macbook heats up even to normal <unk> levels , it really wears down the adhesive i will regularly find a foot in a different spot on the bottom , having moved if i shifted the laptop on the table or something size and feel are good , but if they do n't hold , what 's the point would not purchase again
they work ok , but all of them fell off within over the course of about # months i suppose if you bought # sets they 'd be decent , but personally i 'd feel <unk> spending that much money on feet
it is a good product - however one of the feet did n't last so long , it felt after a couple of weeks of use i had to use another one the package comes with # , fortunately i just needed two , so i could use one of the extra to to replace the one that
they fall off , but it 's not a big deal just clean them off with rubbing alcohol and use superglue to <unk> them i like the rubber feel ... it makes it so the computer does n't slide around on a desk
so , these are n't the actual replacement <unk> that snap into the bottom of the case , but rather stick on ones that look exactly the same and fit perfectly the only problem i 've come across is that they stick to surfaces too well , and will sometimes shift position , and then i have to slide them back in place either way , it beats spending the $ # on the original <unk> from <unk>
not the originals , but so far they worked good i hope they do n't fall in a couple of days it is a shame that they sell them as the mac foot replacements
i ordered these to replace the missing feet that fell off of my macbookpro i assumed they would be identical replacements , but they 're actually peel and stick rubber feet once on the laptop , they look good and work even better than the originals -lrb- hold the computer in place -rrb- the problem is months later when they fall off one by one the glue that holds them in place is n't that strong if you 're looking for something to lock in place permanently , keep looking
delivery came just as expected and application was easy not much to review about the product other than it comes in a small ziploc baggy and they are attached to two separate white pieces of adhesive paper to stick on although yes , the old macbook pro feet are also applied by sticking them on , i feel as if the adhesive on the bottom of these could be stickier as of now , i wo n't know how long they will hold up because i 've just stuck them on but i made sure i pressed down pretty hard to keep them intact hopefully this is n't just a temporary fix but permanent still a little steep in price for the product but worth the buy
i did n't really expect much from this all i needed was something to replace the missing feet these feel a little brittle and plasticky - not like the nice rubbery texture on the originals they are also a little thicker than the originals it 's up to you whether that 's a good or bad thing the adhesive has been doing just fine for me after a few months all in all , not a bad product it 's not too expensive and it works
stock feet require opening the unibody case , and it 's a job apple will keep your machine overnight and charge you $ # for , which i learned after visiting the genius bar
these are a good replacement and saved me a visit to the apple store where the <unk> is they replace the whole bottom of the laptop of course they are not as good as the real thing as they are stick ons , but they are close to it and i 'd recommend them to anyone who has their macbook feet peel off like mine did
i had # foot fall off and lost iron my # `` unibody macbook pro i saw this kit and ordered it i like that they are rubber they are the same dimensions as the originals , in other words , i replaced just the one foot and the laptop stays level it 's more grippy than the other feet it 's been on for a week or two and has not fallen off if it falls off prematurely i will update the rating
it is a very durable case my daughter loves it i just wish the <unk> was on the outside instead of the inside it makes it harder to close but i 'm very
i love this case & although the handles can go either in and out it still feels sturdy i do n't use the handles but the case is thick enough where i feel it is protecting my laptop i have a # ' # laptop and it fits fine there is a little space but not so much where it 's useless and on top of it is cute
i get a lot of compliments , i like the handle , i thought it was going to break but it 's still ok the colors are just like the picture , love it
shoulder strap is pulling away from top of pack after # weeks of light use cordura failed at seam where shoulder <unk> is attached otherwise a nice pack
if you want a big strong -lrb- cool looking -rrb- backpack to protect your tech gear this is the bag my # in game laptop fits with great protection and i can also put my # in work laptop or my # in laptop cooler as well as all the cables and fix `
this bad is everything it says it is just what i was looking for i searched for a long time to find a camera/laptop case that did not look like a lunch bag or a purse ... lol it was harder than i thought but they really came though build quality is excellent as well
thanks to this asus rog <unk> , i began looking at backpacks i did n't know existed i had been looking at camera backpacks , not laptop backpacks i found the slappa <unk> . dslr custom build backpack it works great for my asus g # and all of my camera equipment i can even slip in my ipad without any trouble the padding is not as thick as a dslr backpack but i do n't plan on rolling it down a stairwell or checking it as luggage the backpack is simply for easy transportation of all my important toys i highly recommend this backpack if you have a dslr and a big laptop -lrb- the asus g # measures over # & # # ; -rrb-
let me <unk> : a dslr , <unk> , and a few <unk> with an asus g # vw laptop are heavy as s *** but this bag carries it with ease no other bookbag allows me to fit a full frame dslr , with the extended battery , the flash , # different lenses , a laptop with charger , and other accessories build quality is superb , the bag is water repellent , and the material it 's made from is super strong all in all , get it if you need a dslr with a pouch for your laptop
i was really disappointed in this case i thought it would be bright yellow and shiny it showed up and it was completely see through it was also really flimsy i sent it back because i was disappointed with the quality
i was really excited to buy this transparent case for my new machine to my dismay i figured that the upper part of the case rubs against the lower part of the case & makes a scary breaking noise every time i open my # inch mbp its not even a perfect fit for mbp the plastic case came with a lot of scratches on it complete waste of # . # $ cant even return the product since i <unk> outside the us i have lost respect for incase products after buying this would n't recommend it to anyone unless you have cash to flush down the drain
i love the prime shipping and this is exactly what i was looking for it protects my macbook without any colored or rubberized finish it fits perfectly and much better fit than the incipio feather
came in the manufacture 's packaging , unopened glossy hardshell case , fingerprints do show up a bit but easy to wipe off with a cloth apple logo shines through the shell , fits like a glove -lrb- just make sure to go around and all the sides are pushed in completely -rrb- for basically at half the price as the newer incase hard cases - seems like a good deal so far bought this product over other cheaper options on amazon for the reputation of the company i use incase for a lot of my electronics and it has n't failed me yet note : being used on the latest macbook pro # inch - a
its great , protects my air really well clips on to my air without any problem if you do n't mind adding a bit of weight to your air with good protection , then this is the case for
i have this case in raspberry and really like it overall - the color is rich and the logo shines through really beautifully installation was quick and easy , and it seems very secure the bottom part has silicone feet that prevent the computer from slipping as well as holes to ventilate the computer the only drawback is that it does show fingerprints -lrb- but it 's easy to wipe off
this case fits my macbook air perfectly i purchased the clear one and am very happy with it i also purchased the snugg macbook air leather sleeve case and my macbook air with the hardshell fits very nicely inside the snugg sleeve at first it seemed a bit tight , but after pulling it out just a few times , it is perfect i feel that my macbook air is protected as much as possible with both of these products
i got this case in clear it is nicely constructed , was easy to put on , and has a secure fit it protects , but does not take away from the beauty and slim design of the macbook air the rubber feet on the bottom are a nice addition great case and would recommend
the case is missing the hole for the # nd mic as others have mentioned this should be on the # and newer models i was able to drill a small hole in the plastic if you need the mic and you do n't have a drill , then this is n't a good option the case fits exactly as it should except for the mic hole
i purchased this case in pink and its ok the top fits great and looks great , i was worried about the cutout for the apple and its not an obvious cut out however , the bottom does n't fit completely , it stays on but does n't fully snap on the keyboard cover is a little weird . it just lays on the keyboard , and makes it weird to type
the cover is still on my laptop , however it gets grease spots that you can see on it i do n't know what causes the oily looking spots but i live with it i have already taken off the key covers because they ended up getting dirty i 'll eventually put it back on if i can get it cleaned
pretty good product so far -lrb- not <unk> to spill liquid on to try it out though -rrb- , still getting used to typing w the keyboard cover ... no idea why they included the blue
i love the case and the keyboard protector the pink is a little darker than how it looks in the picture but i think the true color is nicer i am a little disappointed because the laptop case has a few noticeable scratches on it but other than that it 's just fine
the case is awesome it protects my mac and makes me feel comfortable while traveling or transporting my computer the keyboard cover took about a day to get used to but has come in handy , especially when spilling a little bit of fruit juice on my keyboard
nice protective cover for my wife 's macbook air she loves the color for sure fits nice and snug as it should keyboard cover she is n't to crazy about , but well ... u know ca n't beat it for the price and free shipping for us & # # ; prime members & # # ;
it keeps my new mac book air safe and i love the soft silky feel of the cover i love it all and it was so affordable too will be buying more colors
i loved it it fits perfect : -rrb- i was very skeptical to buy it because there 's some bad reviews but <unk> ppl complaint too much this case is awsome
the plastic on this item looks cheap , like it will easily crack and scratch unfortunately i am sending it back and out all of the money for shipping i do not recommend this product - try a rubberized one instead you can grip it better and it is more durable
the case has very good quality but once you put it on your macbook it is impossible to remove the top part , i have been all the day trying to remove it but i could n't do it i have to choose between breaking the case , the macbook or leaving it on the macbook forever very disappointed with the purchase by the way the color its a little bit different , it is more transparent i would n't recommend it
my case came with scratches on the top of it it seems as if the item was n't taken care of and the scratched case was just sent to me without further checking it fit right on though , but the condition of it far from acceptable
the initial impression of this hard case was very good it was an excellent fit with minimal <unk> caused by the plastic however , in about a month time i noticed a powder between the case and the top cover , which proved to be due to the friction of the plastic on the mat aluminium screen cover a couple of months later , a piece of plastic on the side was broken while the laptop was in a soft case , in a high quality laptop bag it looks as if it broke from the laptop 's weight since i am very careful with it also , at the point of <unk> , the plastic cover became sharp it 's undoubtedly a pretty case but i found it too expensive for its short lifetime
the clear plastic cover is great , but there are two issues # . the rubber feet will all eventually fall off - and before being lost they will stick to random places on the bottom of the case leaving adhesive residue # . the gap between the case and the edge of the laptop does tend to trap a lot of dust and grime it does n't seem to be a problem functionally but it looks horrible and i 'm going to have to bite the bullet and try to remove the case to clean it periodically
this case does what it should do but the fit is n't great the bottom half of the case continues to fall off and separate itself from my macbook pro i ca n't comment on the other colors but the clear shows scratches easily all in all a decent option for the price but a few dollars more might get you something that will last a lot longer and protect a lot better
the summary says all i can say about the product overall , a good purchase of the five criteria that are relevant for a cover like this , the kuzy does well with four
the kuzy crystal hard case does the job of protecting my macbook really well from scratches without breaking the bank i purchased a clear one to show off the beautiful silver color of the macbook pro , and thus the finish looks really good with the case on it one shortcoming would be the four rubber bumper feet came off within a few days too bad , because it makes the case move around a bit more that one would like when working on the laptop please put better <unk> on those rubber bumper feet next batch
the price was reasonable it fit perfectly onto my # inch macbook pro retina i chose the clear case and i am pleased the only reason that i gave it four stars instead of five is because the case is hard to remove it adds some extra weight , so at home , i tried to remove the case and it gave me some issues on the bright side , the case does not move around and fits securely around the computer for the individuals that complain about the fit , i can only <unk> that the correct case was not sent to them this is more of a <unk> matching issue and less of a <unk> issue
this seller sent me the item , i installed it , and immediately ruined the top cover by using <unk> to clean some glue residue that i got on it i asked to buy just the top , and the seller offered to send me a new item for just the cost of shipping the product is elegant and protects my macbooks elegance too by keeping dirt and scratches away , not bulking it up and making it ugly , and by allowing the computer to be fully seen -lrb- i only use the top because i have durable clear vinyl on the bottom , but my friend <unk> uses the top and bottom and his looks good . - # star is because the plastic scratches and is cheap , and being somewhat particular about the appearance of <unk> for my computer , i will likely need to buy this product again in a couple years
we are very happy with this purchase we did some research , and found this to have favorable reviews it was easy to install , but secure enough that it wo n't easily come off if dropped the fit and finish is very good we are very happy with it
fits well , thin and sleek did n't care much for big kuzy logo but whatever and the small squares where the tabs are on the case it does the job though and for the price you ca n't beat it
i love this so much i wanted a clear case to show off the decal i had bought and was worried that the case would <unk> it out this case is crystal clear and the decal showed perfectly i am <unk> to take my mac and know that i wo n't get scratched
this case fits my macbook pro like a glove i am rating this as # stars mainly due to the high quality , especially considering the inexpensive price i would definitely recommend this case
i bought this product for my macbook pro retina display -lrb- late # -rrb- it fits perfectly the product images are a bit misleading because they feature a # inch version of the computer there is a part cut out on the left side of the computer which does n't cover the microphone and there is a kuzy logo on the bottom right of the top part of the case its a good product i recommend you purchase it
pros : thin , transparent case molded specifically for my retina macbook pro # snaps on without fuss , protects from scratches and dirt , and absorbs some light shock do n't go dropping it non-slip feet have not peeled off with moderately hard use was very inexpensive and arrived earlier than promised cons : portions of the case do not seem to grip that tight when the laptop is open , but it has never come off unintentionally really minor for the price point
wish i had bought it before my macbook got all those scratches thick , clear plastic feels substantial and the rubberized feet are built into the case so they wo n't come <unk> like some other cases
after reading many many reviews for cases for my late # mb pro retina # & # # ; , i decided on this case it has a nice low profile and makes me feel better about tossing the laptop into my commuter bag and taking it with me on the road when the case is on the bright aluminum mb it does appear to be dark gray when i 'm somewhere bright i eventually plan on using the case as a canvas for stickers since it 's so reasonably priced that i would n't mind replacing it when the time comes it fits very well and does n't seem to suffer from popping off when i have the laptop at full open position i have no complaints
this plastic case cover is well made it fits to my # inch macbook pro with retina perfectly it is a bit hard to take the cover off once you put it on your macbook but that means it wo n't break away when i drop my macbook and less chance to attract dust between the case and macbook : d
fits perfectly and protects my macbook from all the scuffs of going in and out of my bag with text books , etc . it does show the scuffs in the light , but i have a photographic decal underneath and the clear cover protects it and shows it off i love it because it is so secure i barely know it 's there very little bulk or weight added
i really wanted this case and amazon had it for a good price it looks beautiful and fits very well would not hesitate to recommend this product over anything on the market ~ as possibly the best protection for your macbook i love it thank you very much kuzy ! !
