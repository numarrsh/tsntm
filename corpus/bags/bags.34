i intended to use the incase # with my # inch hp envy it barely fits , and is extremely tight if i had known that it would be this tight , i would not have purchased it the advertisement / explanation did not mention that it is intended to be used on a very thin mac the quality is ok for the price , but if you have a man size # inch laptop , look elsewhere for a neoprene sleeve
this is a good laptop sleeve no frills , a little padding , but not much as it is just a sleeve offers some protect , but not as much as a case would it does fit my # . # & # # ; laptop but it 's a tight fit
this case fits <unk> macbook pro mc # ll/a # -inch <unk> fine . nothing else really much to this case dont expect to carry anything else with it besides maybe a few papers or a magazine that you could stuff in there as well its easy to slip in and out of this case it is also padded , but i wouldnt recomend dropping your macbook in this case i doubt it would protect it much in that situation the case i purchased , the outside is black and the inside of this case is white on the inside it feels super comfortable im almost <unk> to flip it inside out and use this sucker as a pillow case . :
i bought this sleeve because of some talk on a <unk> that said this would fit an alienware m # x perfect it 's not true , but there is not doubt about the quality of this sleeve from my brief encounter with this sleeve i 'd have to say the padding felt soft , but would definitely absorb impact well the size was n't bulky and i 'd trust it in my backpack with the some books
i bought this because my macbook pro # & # # ; -lrb- late # model -rrb- would n't fit in my protective insert in my laptop bag the laptop fit perfectly and provided a nice protective padding for the inside of my old laptop bag i 've had it for # months and it is showing no signs of wear and is used several days a week
every single apple device i have , has an incase case i find it disappointing that you ca n't find this case anywhere but online apple store does n't have it , best buy did n't have it , neither did fry 's however , as usual amazon delivered on time and with perfection this case is simply amazing , and while not a hard case it offers great protection if you have your mbp in your bag
i love these incase sleeves the interior material is plush and furry - i wish i had a blanket made out of similar material the padding is thick and i feel like it would definitely protect my computer from bumps and minor falls
i actually bought this for my dell studio xps # , but it fits perfectly with a little extra room at the top the outside is nice and rigid for padded support and i love how soft the inside of the sleeve is it feels like fur makes me feel extra safe about protecting my laptop on top of that , it 's airport security friendly , so you can just leave it in the case when you go through security definitely worth the purchase
im currently deployed to the middle east and sand is a <unk> problem my hp pavillion laptop is totally protected from the elements as its stored there at all times thanks for this cover which without i would surely be forced to buy another laptop
fits the # `` macbook pro very well interior lining seems like it will keep the exterior of the macbook pro looking nice and keep it from getting scratched this sleeve is exactly what it was described as if your looking for something with extra storage pockets this is not for you it is meant to protect the macbook pro # `` without a lot of extra bulk and that 's <unk> what is does
very disappointed that i have not received this item and that i have not been contacted by amazon or casecrown after repeatedly reporting that i have got received this item i am now in the process of filing a <unk> via my bank to get my money back
i was surprised at how well-made , durable and nice-looking this case was when i received it especially , because of the low cost it also <unk> for a thin macbook pro retina it would be a # -star , if only it had a shoulder strap strapping to my body , leaves my hands free and assures that my laptop will make it home with me sitting stuff down , leaves room to leave it in a room somewhere , never to be seen again
good quality for the price only complaint as stated before , it is too long for my toshiba laptop and i ca n't keep it held with straps if anyone has a solution for that i would appreciate hearing it other than that it is great i would recommend
the memory foam provides nice padding zippers are good quality external pocket is large enough for all the necessary accessories , and some nice looking case as well my only gripe is that it is about # inches too large for my # inch macbook retina this prevents the internal straps from holding the laptop when opened in the case i am only complaining because it is almost too large in diameter to fit in my briefcase ; i have to jam it in it really is a good case , and worth the price just be aware that it will not fit the new thinner # inch macbooks snugly
exactly like it was in the description also you can stick it with the laptop so when you open the bag the laptop will be opened too it is a nice bag for my macbook pro
really worth it i mean : yo are not getting the best bag in the world ... that should be a much more expensive bag ... but for just # bucks i think you wo n't get something like this for that
this was a great purchase i can store macbook pro and ipad in that for traveling it 's light and i would refer this seller to anyone whom is interested i am <unk> , and i approve this
this was a great find for protecting and transporting my mac it has side pockets to carry additional items and is very easy to use i would definitely recommend this product to everyone
i was very hesitant to get this # -inch bag because some other reviews said it fit their # & # # ; laptops perfectly i thought the # -inch bag would have been too small , but i took a chance and got it anyway and i could n't be happier the style is very metro chic , so women or men can use it the bag itself is made of a waterproof type of cloth the fit was great the laptop area of the bag was n't too snug , there was still a little room in there , so i was n't worried about accidentally zipping the edge of my laptop and getting it scratched the front portion is also very spacious i fit the power cord , hdmi cord , wireless mouse , and phone charger in there with no issues would definitely recommend
although i read reviews that the case might be a bit snug , i went ahead and ordered it anyway the case is pretty stiff , it feels like its made of styrofoam boards covered in cloth the kind of boards students use to present projects at school or at <unk> fair other than that , it 's fine i wish it was n't $ # , though along with my intuos # small , i also have an intuos # medium , and i bought a cheap laptop sleeve for it at # below that 's a ton better than this sleeve for the price however , the little pen holder is a nice touch , though there should be enough room for the wire as well all in all , it would be a great sleeve if it were n't so <unk> and was a bit less than $ #
i bought this sleeve for the wacom intuos # the good : i like the material -- rigid yet soft the bad : could be a little wider the color is great i keep the light down when using the computer the dark outside of the sleeve keeps it from being <unk> , and the small amount of bright green helps to find it in the dark my intuos # came in a lightweight black somewhat flimsy sleeve , so you do n't really need larobe sleeve , but it is a nice protector
i ordered this case for my sister who is in art school and just got a wacom tablet the case has memory foam and looks protective one thing i noticed was that the wacom tablet fits rather snugly in the case possibly a little too snug , but this should not <unk> you from purchasing it because the case is built nicely the case even has a nice place to store the stylus the only negative per se is that it does not have a place to store the usb cable overall , a very nice case
this case does the job , its compact and neat it also has a pen holder inside it , which is very useful the only cons would be that its a little stiff and doesnt seem to have a space for the cable -lrb- though it doesnt show if you stuff the cable in there -rrb-
# stars for the bright green ... yes ... bright wasabi color - i dont even like green , and i love this color super cushy soft , wonderful case i am really happy with this purchase
when i was ordering , i didnt really read what was it made out of so i was expecting a normal , squishy material and i was shocked when i got the product it was a memory foam case ! which made me super happy i love this lime green color inside , decent interior design , and little bit of a room for cords and stuff . this is just awesome
i brought this targus accessory kit for my grandson and he has not really commented on the kit my grandson uses the kit and carries back and forth to school
i bought this case for my acer # . # `` netbook it arrived yesterday and i am perfectly happy with it it fits my netbook perfectly and the mini mouse and usb hub work perfectly i do n't agree with the other reviewer about the color , it looks perfectly fine to me although i probably would have preferred all black the case is a little lumpy with the accessories inside but it 's not a dealbreaker this is a great package deal please see the pics i uploaded above
this targus netbook case and accessory kit -lrb- including a mini optical mouse with retractable cord and a <unk> usb hub -rrb- is an excellent choice for any netbook up to # . # `` i have an asus eee pc and i travel quite a bit for business so this targus accessory kit has been a great addition the neoprene netbook case fits snuggly on my asus eee pc as if it was designed as a custom fit the optical mouse is small and probably not ideal for long term use , but is definitely easier to use than the built-in touch pad i would suggest a full size optical mouse if extensive travelling is not in your plans for the amount of traveling i do this mouse is a perfect fit to throw in the carry-on bag i have not yet used the <unk> usb hub , but i imagine that at some point it will be useful it 's a nice add-on overall i 'm a very satisfied buyer with this product
you will not be able to purchase a mini retractable mouse , # port usb drive and a netbook neoprene sleeve separately for less than what this set sells for the mouse is a perfect size and since it has a retractable cord , no more <unk> the cable for storage the usb port has # ports and the connector easily slides into the hub to keep it safe and out of the way when not in use the sleeve is just like any other neoprene sleeve made by targus unlike some others that mentioned they received a neon green and black sleeve , my sleeve was blue and black as described and pictured in the item description this is by far is an awesome deal for anyone looking these items for their netbook
i have a netbook and i took it with me on two trips the netbook sleeve and the mouse were two great accessories to have when traveling i personally prefer a mouse when clicking around on various sites and working with documents the sleeve was great for ensuring the protection of the netbook i have not used the usb hub yet , but i do plan to use it in the future since netbooks are limited in regard to the number of usb connections
i was checking prices of a sleeve for my dell mini and found this <unk> on amazon the price for all the items was $ # less than the sleeve alone at one national chain mortar and brick store all of the items were very useful for my mini and am really happy with them they perform as expected and recommend this to everyone
after reading other reviews on this product i figured i was in for a serious bad smelling first week with the product however , after receiving the product i did not find that is smelled bad or strong at all was able to start using it right away great sleeve that protects the notebook very well corners are even very protective highly recommend this sleeve
like many others , i purchased this sleeve for my macbook pro i 've used it for about two years , and the flap still snaps into place , keeping my laptop snug it 's kept my work computer safe through a few business trips , and many rides in my messenger bag the pocket is fairly useful - i 've kept dongles and smaller items that do n't need as much padding , but cracked a usb thumb drive when i placed the laptop down in the tsa bin after two years of using this , the zipper to the accessory pocket has ripped out of its stitching no big deal , but it 's stuck halfway , making it tough to get into the pocket considering i used the zipper twice every time i took my laptop out -lrb- once to take out my dongle , once to put it back in -rrb- , i 'm impressed it lasted this long now bring on the <unk> about me undoing my zipper to take out my dongle
i just received this new laptop sleeve it arrived in a timely way nicely packaged it fit my # `` macbook pro great i 've always had zippered laptop sleeves with no pockets i think i 'll enjoy this design -- no zipper , nice sleek pocket i wish there were other colors , but that 's a quibble
i have been looking for a quality sleeve with no zipper around the edges finally i found this sleeve which also comes with a storage pocket i really loved it when i saw a video on youtube for a person putting a macbook charger with the extension inside that pocket and having more space to use so it is large enough for a charger , keys , and maybe an ipod the only thing i do not like is that the pocket zipper is a too stiff maybe it would loose up after a while i would definitely buy this sleeve again amazon sells it for around $ # less than the manufacturing company
seemed to load its own drivers but would not work loaded drivers from disk still did not work extremely hard to insert also had to pull it out with <unk> pliers the <unk> usb card did work for me
i have two other pc cards that i use , but when i installed this one , everything was good until i plugged in a thumb driver or anything else , then the whole system locked up ... every time i returned it for credit
i wish i had read some other reviews before i purchased this someone else with a dell inspiron # had problems with this card as well the computer recognized something was there , but when i plugged a usb drive into it , the computer <unk> it does n't come with any written instruction , just a cd it comes with a cord but they do n't make it clear when to use it the seller shipped it fast , but i 'm just unhappy with the product
this usb cardbus adapter loads # . # drivers from the included cd , but connected usb # . # devices are unstable and frequently crash pc is a compaq presario # notebook running windows xp sp # usb # . # devices run ok using competitor 's usb cardbus adapter the <unk> occurs with or without the use of the external usb power cable the driver loading sequence does not agree with the sequence shown in the adapter 's manual after device loading has completed , the pc 's device manager 's list for usb drivers does not agree with the adapter 's manual i am returning the adapter for refund
i think the title says it best my computer <unk> my dell inspirion # fine , but when i connect an external usb hard drive , the <unk> locks up , followed by my computer locking up when the card is removed , the computer works again i do n't know if the problem is with the limited memory of the notebook computer , or some setting i need to change that is <unk>
i 've owned two of these and both after a few months of use had the plastic connector inside the port which holds the pins separate this makes that port useless i think a lot of people have reviewed this prior to long-term use
i have a sony vaio laptop and although windows xp found this device just fine , it did manage to hang the system anytime i plugged something into one of the ports seems like you need to spend $ # + to get a decent usb card and this appears to be the only one which is fully inside to my dismay for the record , i did check device manager for any <unk> and could n't find any
after installation any attempt to plug in any usb device would result in a complete system lock up , no mouse or keyboard control , until the usb device was removed gave it an honest trial and could never get it to work company refunded money minus shipping cost if something is too cheap to be true it is
just not working correctly with most of the usb devices overall not usable stay away from that item just attempted to use it with mouse and flash drives one out of # different flash drives was working pros : cheap , small , good looking cons : not working , useless
my system would n't even recognize the card even the cd could n't install the driver properly and made my pc to freeze the card does not have any serial number on the label nor any contact number for technical support
i 'd give it zero stars if that was an option anything plugged into these ports either quits working after # minutes , or causes the computer to shut down due to overheating great idea but very poor execution find another product , this one is n't worth ordering
seemed like a good deal for around $ # to add # usb ports to my laptop unfortunately the product works <unk> and locks up my computer more trouble than it 's worth to return for me
my computer has not been able to use the pcmcia cardbus possible problem the os software is too old it sounds like this would have been a good buy , but unable to get it to function in my laptop computer
the packaging was smashed and opened ! instead of a usb to coax for extra power there was a # `` to # `` audio cable ! ! ! ! ! ! <unk> is called quality control people ! ! ! come on ! ! ! works perfectly in ubuntu # .
the card as received is new , looks good , and is well marked it fits snugly into the pcmcia slot in my laptop and is flush with the outside of the slot the card is somewhat difficult to remove because it is difficult to grab when it is <unk> from the pcmcia slot the card is difficult to get working in my old ibm thinkpad i 've installed the driver , and the card is recognized when plugged in however the card fails when i plug in a usb <unk> wireless ethernet card the combination usb # . # card and usb ethernet card worked long enough to connect to my access point but then failed
sometimes it works correctly and sometimes it does n't or will start working and just stop sometimes i have to remove it and reinstall it or restart the laptop i have even tried it in two different laptops , one with windows # and one with windows xp and got the same results i even <unk> and <unk> the drivers a few times would be awesome if it worked all of the time with no issues
product arrived in a timely manner i bought it for my jornada # but it does not fit in and/or work it does work with my laptop , however , but i needed it for the jornada that does n't have a port for downloading or uploading files from a laptop i do n't have a desktop with a serial port to connect if i can use my son 's desktop to connect then i may be able to download the drivers if that works i 'll update this review then
no installation instructions in the box i received looked for any <unk> of where to find them on the box , but none i am trying to install this in a hp compaq presario # but do n't know <unk> to install please help and tell me where to find directions for installation looks like a nice product and hope it will work well for the purpose of <unk> video security on to a external hard drive attached to the # nd usb port please e-mail information to -lrb- ... -rrb- asap sorry but did n't know how to contact the seller any other way
it works ok the manufacture of the card is not very good , i have left it in the slot i would imagine installing and taking it out the card would not last very long , cheaply made
this card is easy to install , somewhat inexpensive i bought it to replace the damaged usb ports on an # year-old hp laptop like mentioned before , very easy to install , just plug it in , and let windows load the drivers the problem i found is that delivers too little power a mouse will work fine , but does n't deliver power to boot a flash drive everytime i have tried something that does n't have it 's own power supply , the system will freeze up on me i would n't recommend this product if you have more ports available you will need an external power supply to power up the usb ports , or drain power from another working usb port , via additional cable -lrb- which was n't included -rrb- i bought it , because , like i said , had no other option
this item works exactly as it promises , it adds two usb ports from one older personal computers <unk> have just one which makes adding <unk> harder to do yes i would recomend this item for that purpose
needed usb # . # ports for a # model laptop , and needed a pcmcia card unit without a huge external protrusion this unit fits flush into the cardbus slot and yet provides two usb # . # ports at first the unit would n't work properly -lrb- laptop freezing on <unk> -rrb- with my old laptop and windows # <unk> -lrb- it 's my test pc -rrb- and i intended to return the unit the manual provided on the <unk> is the <unk> for poorly written , <unk> <unk> driver installation instructions and nowhere indicates to the user the need to install the included driver for proper operation one would assume the standard windows usb drivers would suffice based on the lack of other direction , plus the installation itself seems to be installing the same windows driver again however - i took a chance and installed the owc driver and - voila ! - the card operates perfectly external hard drive , digital camera , wifi dongle - so far i have n't thrown anything at it the card ca n't handle and the laptop shuts down properly again this card is well worth the money , but the documentation kills a star
i got this for a dell c # with one # . # usb port it works well , but when i added external drives it of course needs the power adapter three of my four drivers were <unk> , one was not it would not spin this one drive up but the rest <unk> up fine so this is something to look at , was my one drive a fluke or is it # out of # work time will tell
look around for alternate usb # . # drivers when installing with xp the included drivers broke other things , and would lock up the computer definitely nice with the slim fully internal profile paired this with a tiny <unk> usb adapter -lrb- <unk> # m -rrb-
this usb pc card installed into my old compaq laptop -lrb- windows xp -rrb- without a hitch it 's nice having card that does n't stick out the side so far it works fine and have had no problems
this was a `` roll the dice `` purchase as i did n't know if it would lock up my old laptop comes with a <unk> setup disk , but you have to manually find the setup file , and the rest was easy my windows xp loaded the . <unk> files and configured the card i 've connected my ms wireless mouse <unk> , used several usb flash drives , a sdhc card reader , usb printer , and had no problems there is good space separation between the usb # . # ports ; my laptop 's usb ports are crowded together note that the adaptor does n't have the usb standard two pressure pins on the bottom the small pressure pins do n't <unk> a lot of force , but they do hold the connector a little tighter forget about tech support if it does n't work out of the box , you 're out of luck
i have an old thinkpad -lrb- t # p -rrb- on which the usb ports died after replacing the mobo which later also died , the ports worked for a while , until i plugged in two devices at the same time , and they again went poof i 'd advise anyone considering buying a t series thinkpad to look elsewhere this inexpensive card lets me leave the card plugged into the slot instead of having to remove it every time i put the machine away after use seems to do the job
this works just fine even with external hard drives there have been some reviews saying that your computer will freeze , especially with external drives it will unless you review the . <unk> docs on the disc supplied that tells you how to install the drives manually if you just let windows -lrb- in my case xp -rrb- load the drivers then you must <unk> manually the pcmcia to usb drivers when that is done then external drives work just fine my decade old laptop is a # <unk> intel , # mb ram , with a single usb # . # port and now with this card the data move very quickly all other devices such as thumb drives all worked just as well # because i needed to figure the driver
i tested this card with <unk> -lrb- ubuntu # . # -rrb- and it works well so far no need to do anything just put it into the pcmcia slot and it works immediatly i kind of hoped that it would work also with my external hard drive without a power cable , but most of these cards do n't so i was n't surprise that i needed to use the provided power cable for me the most important thing is that it is a fully inside card so i do n't need to take it off everytime i put my laptop in my bag overall nice product
got this because it was cheap and a lot easier than fixing my <unk> up usb port on my puter works fine , but seems to need to go through an install every time i insert a jump drive
it fits the slot without any problems and works well it is just the thing for most laptops with only two usb ports when three or four are needed it was reasonably priced too
the usb slots on my old t # burned up they downgrade to usb # . # it seems that the pcmcia slot can fit two usb cards it works for flash disk but for hard drive , i need to use extra power the power cable is included in the package no driver needed , both windows xp and ubuntu # .
practical for keyboard and mouse , but <unk> it would not utilize my thumb drives came with power adapter , though , just not always convenient to plug in two things at once ... quality item
it <unk> <unk> in my x # t <unk> slot , it runs a <unk> # gb usb flash and my logitech wireless mouse without the power cable included <unk> ? well , all i did was to push it inside the slot , and windows # did the rest so , now my laptop has # usb ports three full powered and the # this card added that otherwise works well with what i normally use , my mouse and usb flash <unk> it does not run my usb hard drive , it requires the included cable though what else can be asked for a product this cheap
this device works perfectly as described as soon as i plugged it in -lrb- perfectly flush with the side of my laptop -rrb- my computer recognized it and installed the drivers without needing the included cd i 've used a couple flash drives and a wireless usb mouse with it with no problems , and i have n't needed the power adapter highly recommended for people with laptops that have a limited number of usb ports , or only have usb # .
works perfectly well with my old dell latitude that only had a usb # port i 've tried it with several peripherals including a canon photo shot , big external hard drive , and a <unk> drive that supports <unk> this last one saved me many hours thanks to the increased speed of the usb # . # port unlike some other card slot usbs , this one does n't stick out and interfere with my wireless card
i <unk> a pc with a damaged usb port , so ended up with only two usable this device has allowed me to turn an unused card slot into two additional ports and has made the pc very useable works exactly as described -- and i have not needed to use the included power cord yet
i 've had the usb pcmcia card for about # week , and it 's working great i had to wonder , because the price was really inexpensive but after i installed the drivers from the disk , it plugged right in and worked right off the bat no problems at all i have n't run any performance tests or anything , but it 's fast enough to do the job for me i like it
i love the way this fits into the port of my laptop because it does not stick out , it can be left permanently in the laptop i have had excellent results with this thing and the price was very reasonable i have given away my old bus product that had to be removed each time i put my laptop away and then had to re recognize it each time i started up again thanks for the great product
plugged in unit into a several year old dell inspiron # was immediately recognized via windows xp and working i have # usb ports on existing laptop which are all shot now this saved me the cost of a new motherboard
this cardbus has added new usefulness to an old laptop that i use for standby since the original laptop had no usb installed i had a hard time hooking up peripherals , such as a printer and external dvd drive the card installed and works fine -lrb- computer uses win pro #
i bought this to replace the one that came with my laptop the old one was very flimsy and the connection would cut in and out if it was bumped i got this one , plugged it in , and my computer found it right away no need for the installation disc , and i do n't know what i would need the power cord for . all in all , it exceeded all of my expectations plus , it is flush with the edge of the laptop , a definite plus
<unk> este producto para <unk> en una hp # con windows <unk> y <unk> perfectamente <unk> <unk> <unk> una <unk> <unk> y <unk> para <unk> <unk> <unk> usb en <unk> laptop <unk> es la <unk> <unk>
the usb on my motherboard stopped working after i plugged my iphone in and i though i would need to buy a new laptop this card saved the use of that pc for me at a very low cost
consider using the external power connector for any usb device that uses even minimal power from the usb bus otherwise the card will drain the pcmcia power and a second device -lrb- e.g . an external wireless card -rrb- wo n't work it happened to me as soon as i used the external power connector , everything returned to normal i actually connected the power cord that comes with the card to an external usb charger , rather than using the laptop 's other usb port it works ! without any problems
i plugged it into an old p # dell laptop and <unk> # . # recognized it and now runs at usb # . # speeds i do n't plan on running windows on this machine so i ca n't comment on the supplied drivers shipping was via usps in a padded envelope that arrived in perfect condition and about a week
i have an old dell that came with just # usb slots , this thing was dirt cheap and worked perfectly am using it right now , have had it for # months only down side i could find , sometimes when removing a new usb item , the whole card pulls out , not often , but it happens this thing is flush with the casing of the laptop and works at usb # . # speeds would definitely buy it again
this product works as advertised based on other feedback , i just put the card into an open slot and windows xp <unk> it and installed the drivers it does come with a power cord that you need to put into one of the computers usb ports for items that draws power from the usb port however , i put in a thumbdrive without `` plugging `` in to another usb port and it worked fine i do n't think that would be the case for my scanner which draws power from the port
presario # us i had a <unk> card earlier and it would hang when a usb flash was connected unless nb was plugged in <unk> with gmyle i dont have this problem , and i dont have any problems at all would recommend it strongly
for some reason , the usb ports on my laptop <unk> <unk> my external mass storage devices -lrb- hard drive , ipod , etc . -rrb- , so i purchased this card hub i <unk> it in to my computer and it was <unk> immediately , and within minutes it was functioning and recognized all of the items my <unk> ports had been <unk> quality item at a great price
i was gifted with an older sony vaio laptop that had sb # . # . installation was a cinch it self installed and then i found the drivers on the enclosed cd things work faster including my usb n network adapter or so it seems plugged in a usb thumb drive ordered another one to fill in the other pcmcia slot i like it that much ! : -
a previous usb # adapter had been harder to install , and that in itself was a relief in use , the most welcome feature has been the <unk> `` internal `` form factor , i.e . the lack of protrusions beyond the plane of the pcmcia card i use these slots for `` <unk> `` devices and this card effectively doubles that resource by exposing the second slot
bought this hoping it would upgrade my # year old laptop and it worked perfect easy install into the only available slot , and was recognized and installed with no problems so nice having # . # usb ports
i like the idea that when installed the plug ins are flush with computer not a big bulge out side of computer like others i 've had in the past
i had borrowed a dell latitude c # laptop from my father as my computer was down it came with one usb # port this product works great just plugged it in and it was instantly recognized i use it for a <unk> # modem -lrb- verizon wireless -rrb- and a printer port next i will try it with a webcam and see how it does
i had an older card that stuck out of the side with # usb # . # ports but it would not allow the laptop to fit in the carry case i only use two of the ports , one for a webcam and the other for flash memory this card fits inside and worked without any drivers to load no problems with it at all
this product brought new life to my compaq # us laptop which only has usb # . # the <unk> slot has been empty since i purchased it this card slides all the way into the slot ending up flush with the case you would never know this is an add on - it just appears as two usb ports although it comes with an adapter cable to provide external power , i was able to drive a <unk> # tb external usb drive without any issues at & # # ; # <unk> write speed without any external power i did not even have to use the drivers that come on a cd - windows <unk> # had everything it needed to function just plugged it in and voila
absolutely no complaints fits flush with laptop completely inside the pcmcia slot -lrb- my previous <unk> card stuck out at least half an inch and eventually <unk> at the <unk> no installation issues -lrb- i let win xp find the drivers have n't needed to use the power cable for any usb peripheral -lrb- including a <unk> smartphone and a # -port usb <unk> problems attaching all of the usb peripherals i 've tried so far ca n't beat the
the last pcmcia usb card i had was damaged due to the fact that it stuck out # inches from the side of the laptop this product met my low profile requirements and works well
purchased # of these to increase the usb ports on my old nc # laptop the ports are usb # . # and are backward compatible all # ports works like a charm speed is good <unk> i 'm concerned as they perform well for my needs
great card , slim , does n't stick out allows for # nd card if your computer has a dual slot works great on my ibm t- # plenty of power to run i-pod and phone and small detachable drive
old dell # laptop a rock solid old <unk> but boots fast and had been great with word , the net and email very fast internet connection and i often <unk> # gig files do use the install disk , do n't let windows pick a driver i had used my two newer computers for <unk> ` <unk> # gig files because of usb # . # this item took a # gig transfer to a usb storage device from # minutes to # . # minutes not quite as fast as my two <unk> but now downloading big files to the old laptop is viable
no issues so far purchased two of them , # for an ibm thinkpad and the other for an <unk> go book iii both found the cards right away and were ready to use in seconds
my old ibm thinkpad x # is still a viable laptop but the usb # . # ports were very much a <unk> problem this card fit right into the wireless card port and worked immediately thus giving me back a usable netbook with docking station
due to the original design of being fully inserted without any protrusions i give this card # stars other than that it works as any other pc card out there it comes with an external usb cable i suppose for a further power boost if needed however , this would defeat the purpose of the design and so far i have not needed the extra power
