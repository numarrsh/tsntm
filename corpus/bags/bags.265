i just recently purchased this <unk> at a great cost and i am super excited to have this it came faster then estimated time the amazon company always does a fantastic job at getting the product you ordered on tim the package is great i carry it every where i also get compliments on how nice and sturdy the case is it is also a perfect snug as well great
i have had this case for over # years and it has been all over the world and it is still holding strong in great condition ! i love it & get tons of compliments !
i have a samsung # . # & # # ; laptop and it fits my laptop , charger , and my notebook just fine i have had it for awhile now and the zipper is still intact no damage to the case and i use it almost everyday
this was perfect for my # . # `` hp envy laptop ! it looks just like it does on the picture and it arrived quickly ! i love it , it is soo cute recommend ! ! -lrb-
i am very satisfied with the hello kitty laptop sleeve it 's fits my computer really well and it cushions the computer nicely the fabric also feels nice and soft everything is great i recommend this item to anyone that is looking for a laptop sleeve & if you love hello kitty ! :
this case is durable , but it only has one side pocket for the power cord and any accessories i also wish i got . one with a shoulder strap a bit inconvenient to carry without it
this product is durable and functional i can be comfortable knowing that my laptop is safe from scratches due to the material that its made of and the accessories are easily carried with it the sleeve is also attractive absolutely no regrets highly recommended product
this sleeve is not a case and only really protects the laptop from scratches and minor bumps i use it to protect the laptop when traveling and carry it in a book bag or shoulder bag for additional protection the handle and extra pocket for the cord are great features i do wish it would unzip completely -lrb- # of the way -rrb- instead of just on the one side , but i guess that would change the definition of a `` sleeve . this is the exact same sleeve they sell on <unk> for a much higher price
the sleeve is a little too big ; allowing the notebook to swing back & forth in the case i ended up keeping the foam packaging that the sleeve was sent with just to fill the case & prevent a lot of the movement when carrying
this item is not the worst i 've seen the faux fur interior is nice , and i know it wo n't scratch my laptop ; however , i was a little disappointed in the thickness -lrb- or lack <unk> -rrb- of the padding it 's probably about as thick as my fingernail the corners do feel reinforced , but it is really just the material the stitching seems <unk> , the handle is nice , and the design is what i wanted the outer pocket it `` stretchy `` and easily holds bulky power cords and a mouse to reiterate , the biggest disappointment for me was the thin neoprene i had a free laptop case that came with a backpack that was not neoprene or especially nice but had much , much thicker padding - on all sides so , basically , you are buying a brand and cheaper neoprene cases with much prettier designs will probably be just as effective -lrb- and with the same thin padding -rrb-
this is an excellent hp original case it will fit most hp laptops it looks great and will protect your product well this is no replacement for an hp original case it is made very well and is better than most of the similar items sold by competitors i woud definately recommend this
it is a good case the fact that it is a sleeve with a handle is what i love the most about it many laptop cases that are n't sleeves are big and clunky , but the sleeve is just perfect
sleeve met my expectations fits easily into my carry-on bag for travel appreciate <unk> has a handle in case i have to remove it from bag to use on board price was very <unk> well
acme made netbook sleeve -lrb- # `` -rrb- the acme made netbook sleeve -lrb- # `` netbooks -rrb- is very well made , much like its other offerings however , this one suffers from the same styling `` problem `` as the others the interior lining is purple and the outside pattern is n't exactly masculine or unisex overall , it looks more appropriate for use by a woman than a man at least this `` chevron `` styling looks a bit more masculine , however i still feel it was taken from a <unk> <unk> purse design somehow pros : strong material , well made , excellent protective padding for the netbook cons : slightly more feminine styling <unk> , a <unk> <unk> label would not be inappropriate for this design
this case is lightweight and fits my dell mini # nicely the front of the case is a rubberized type of material with a sort of chevron pattern on it the back is a <unk> material personally , i prefer the cordura and would have preferred that they skipped the rubber-like stuff on the front , but i 'm being <unk> as it 's a perfectly fine case the case seems to have reasonable padding inside , but i doubt it would hold up well to a drop from more than a few inches an optional shoulder strap is also included and the strap and attachment points look to be durable there are no pockets on the inside or outside of this case i do n't think it 's a # star case , but it 's certainly more than decent if you 're looking for a small , lightweight netbook case at a relatively inexpensive price , this is definitely worthy of consideration
this does exactly what it 's supposed to do the padding in this case is extremely thick you could drop this thing off a # foot roof and it would probably bounce right back up at you and keep its innards safe and sound i 'm not thrilled with the somewhat tacky wave design on the front it would have been better if it had just a solid color finish on the outside , but that 's small <unk> if you 're looking for a very secure and durable computer case , this does the job nicely
this is a fairly basic case with a nice appearance and good size most importantly to me , it does n't have that nasty , toxic smell that so many cases seem to have lately i do n't use this case as much as i thought i would , as i typically end up sticking to my backpack for my laptop and kindle personally , i recommend a good backpack over this case , but if you are looking for a case this size , this is a good one and it does n't smell : -
really sturdy , no more bulkier than the standard neoprene ones , but this definitely has added protection plus i love the style it comes with an arm strap -lrb- which i do n't use because i carry my laptop around in a backpack -rrb- i would recommend this to anyone - wonderful product
the mcover hard shell has a number of pros and a few , but significant , cons pros : fits extremely well , limited slack space , appears to be quite scratch resistant the top piece is a + top notch cons : the hard cover for the lower -lrb- keyboard -rrb- section feels flimsy , and flexes somewhat when moving the macbook it has extensive cut outs on the bottom , which likely <unk> this issue ; i am sure that these were designed for heat reduction , but are quite unsightly and reduce the protective value of the lower casing significantly at least for the green cover , the colour is a bit more saturated than the picture indicates the cover is a decent value for the money ; not spectacular , but certainly not poor future <unk> should <unk> on fewer cut-outs and a more rigid structure - perhaps having more vent like cuts in the lower unit vice significant cut out <unk>
i like the green color and get tons of compliments , however it does make my laptop heat up faster i try to use the little stand up legs but those will only work on a hard surface like a desk -lrb- too sharp to use when it 's on your lap -rrb- definitely protects my laptop from <unk> damage though
just got my new green mcover which is nice i would recommend the product if you are looking for a good strong cover the only thing that i could find wrong is the the top cover could fix a little better thanks amazon for the quick
it is really hard to get the case off , and there are little feet on the bottom of the case and mine broke in the first week it fits fine , and the color is great , but i am not a fan of the other aspects
i had a black `` speck `` brand case previously which was nice but the tabs broke on it so the bottom part of the case became useless got this case and i am overall happy with it , but the top half of the case does not fit my macbook pro snug -lrb- # `` <unk> # model -rrb- it was quite a bit wider than my macbooks top half so it was bubbled and just did n't work i love the bottom half but the top did n't fit , so im using my old speck top half and this for the bottom half good price but it did n't fit mine
i love the color of this case , as so far it 's been pretty durable the one downside is that the translucency of the plastic makes dust that gets trapped between the case and the computer itself visible , so i have to take it off and clean everything off once a month or so it does n't bother me too much , but it 's still a little annoying for the price , though , i ca n't complain too much
i like this case , i got it with a & # # ; the giving tree & # # ; decal to make it look like the book it 's perfect the case is very light and has saved the corners of my screen countless times i don however wish that the bottom -lrb- near keyboard area -rrb- was more protected also the keyboard cover is pointless
snaps on easy , has the little feet for ventilation my only complaint is that its already getting scratched and scuffed however , better the cover than my computer there are other cases out there that cost double the money and also get a little beat up -lrb- the softer ones get greasy -rrb- , so i 'm really happy with my purchase
this is a laptop case and that 's what it is protects the top cover from scratches the plastic seems cheap but it has n't broken on me once it comes with legs so typing is a lot easier even if you do n't need the case , the legs that are attached to it is well worth it i have a # inch non retina display macbook pro it fits perfectly
i would say this hard shell case is one of the best i orderd the green color , # ' for my macbook pro -lrb- old version -rrb- the color is right as the picture shows i can see the apple logo through the case which its great the only problem is , it seems a little bit loose for the screen part , i kinda afraid it will fell off when i grab the laptop and for the bottom part , there are too many heat remove holes which i may have to take off the case one a week to clean the dust inside the case
this cover works great and has the two <unk> at the bottom to raise the laptop from the desk some to promote ventilation the green is more bright <unk> than i anticipated , but i like the cover still
this case clipped on easy and looks just fine is it made of the highest quality materials , no , but for the price is what i expected and the little feet on the bottom are great the ` free ' keyboard was terrible and i threw it
this is my second hard shell cover from this company the first lasted about # months before it got <unk> enough that i wanted to replace it while i 'm sure there are better quality covers out there , i ca n't justify spending over $ # for just one this case does the trick for my needs
it does its job but it tends to get dirty in it in the front -lrb- dust -rrb- it is a little annoying to get off to clean and for me , it broke a little when taking it off for the first time it also cracked although i have never dropped it however , it is an excellent case and the little foot things underneath are pretty nice at time
this case is a great buy for the price especially compared with the apple store and other product prices it shipped fast , and is a nice bright green color i 'm a huge fan of the little stand that flips out at the bottom to allow the vent to get as much air as possible it also has a pleasant matte finish on it only thing is its a little flimsy ... but you get what you pay for
fast shipping and reasonable price this case gives the computer a ton of personality i like the transparent appearance over the look of a solid case i have n't use the little legs , but they seem like they would break pretty easily overall very happy with this purchase
the case snapped on easily and looks sharp i 'm going to be careful with the ` feet ' as they look fragile have n't dropped the computer , but i feel it is protected from dents and scratches
i had <unk> purchased a speck case for my macbook pro # inch that product broke in under a year the ipearl , however , fits way better , has better looking colors , and allows for more use of cd drive and other usb ports only wish that there were more # inch products overall , ipearl did a great job
i have purchased a few cases for my macbook i 've had the colored crystal clear case , which ended up scratched inside of two weeks and chipped inside of a month and i 've had a couple of the rubberized matte cases , which made any fingerprint look like a grease smudge eventually the rubberized cases looked like my macbook had been handled by a grease monster , or a fast food worker who had n't washed their hands ever however , with this case i have never experienced any of the above issues this case is a hard plastic with a matte finish , which makes it seemingly <unk> to scratches while also remaining fingerprint free at this point i have been using this case for months , and it still looks brand new - even after constant use by myself and my accident prone adult child i would by this case again long before any of the expensive and more popular branded alternatives this case does not disappoint
the case is awesome . it protects my computer perfectly , and fits it like a dream it also came quickly and without any problems overall , the product and service is great
i was pleasantly surprised when i received this cover for my macbook pro earlier than expected i love the bright green so easy to attach and it fits just right the little legs are a nice option i highly recommend this cover
this is the only macbook pro case i have found with feet , allowing one to incline your machine this is important for any laptop , and the ability to raise or lower your machine quickly and easily is a huge plus the product is exactly what i was looking for and i highly recommend it to anyone
my daughter found this on amazon , she needed it to prevent her mac from getting scratched up she is pleased , dad is pleased on to more important things then rating some $ # item
i delight in my green case from ipearl , and when after much love and a year of hard use , i broke a <unk> ... ipearl honored their warranty and sent me new feet my machine is now stable again and does not move when i type even if i happen to be on a glass desk would buy from them _ again _ to protect other computer hardware assets
this is the only bright green <unk> i found all others were mint green , <unk> , etc . this protects my computer well , and it is attractive i would recommend to everyone
the item was exactly as described , and fits my mbp perfectly the clips that & # # ; prop & # # ; the laptop up to a more comfortable <unk> are so convenient and really make my work so much easier i would definitely spend $ # again to get this item
when i first got my mbp # `` i bought a speck case from the apple store for twice as much the speck one was ok , but i like this one much better love the color on this one , fits great and the feet on the bottom are awesome i would definitely recommend this case if you 're looking to protect that big investment
this case works great to protect the metal casing of my macbook pro i noticed it was getting scuffed and scratched , so i got the hard shell case , and all is right with the world i <unk> the free keyboard cover , though it stuck the screen when i 'd open the laptop , and it did n't quite fit correctly on the keyboard it was more of an annoyance than helpful , but it was free ... so who cares
i purchased this cover for my macbook pro # . # w/out retina -lrb- june # -rrb- the case fits the top and bottom of my computer perfectly it was easy to get the top on and bottom on so far so good , no problem with overheating or cracking as long as you do not throw the thing against a wall , it should work for a long time open , close , pick up carry , it stays on you can see the apple light through the cover just wish they had a gold color
when i got this not only was i amazed at how fast it got here but also the fact that it has cooling stands that was a huge bonus for me because my old computer used to over heat and this is exactly what i needed love the fit , love the color , and , yes , i 've already almost scratched it and it did n't crack the case : -rrb- thank you lots i will be sending more people here to buy theirs as they have been asking me :
this cover was exactly what i was looking for the color is as green as it is in the picture it fits perfectly for a mac it also has slots on the back to vent the computer when it gets hot
the color not as bright as i wanted but then again i did n't want it to flashy so i ` am in love with how my macbook pro looks in green ! ! ! ! will be ordering different color cases again
i wanted a color that not everyone had it came and is just as bright and beautiful as pictured so far , so good on <unk> i 'm not rough on my mac to begin with tho
love this case ! it was easy to snap on and looks great the only tricky thing i 've found is that it 's hard to have an internet cable plugged in and also have the charger hooked up it 's not impossible but the charger has to be turned so that it 's not into the port all the way it still works it 's just inconvenient otherwise the perfect case
my son 's other cover broke in the first year we finally replaced it with this one he loves it he likes the vents on the bottom of the case and the legs that flip to angle it everything lines up perfectly snapping it on was a piece of cake
fits the new macbook air perfectly with only a little slightly extra thickness as this fits the regular # `` macbook with a little stretching i love the texture , inside and out zipper seems very sturdy and solid
i shopped for weeks looking for the `` right `` sleeve for my new macbook i knew i wanted a handle and so many sleeves do not have handles i like this sleeve for that reason and the fact that it does , indeed , fit like a glove , and the lining is like soft <unk> it 's just what i wanted - it 's still so new , but so far , so good
fits my macbook perfectly i searched for a neoprene case with a somewhat discreet handle and this one was definitely the most affordable i could find and seems like very good quality the zipper inside is covered so it does n't scratch your computer thanks for a good order arrived on time
love this case it is formfitting to the mbp even with having the speck see thru satin case on it is additional protection and is at a very reasonable price if you want to only put the mbp in without a case , the zipper will not damage it or grind on it because there a flap that keeps the zipper from resting against the macbook the lack of internal or external pockets keeps this case looking extremely sleek and less bulky it is as excellent buy
the reviewer who said this case is perfect for the macbook air # . # had it right on the money for those who just want some protection and a handle , it 's perfect adds virtually no bulk or weight very attractive and professional
there are a lot of reviews on here for the macbook air , but nothing really <unk> for the macbook pro as far as fit and compatibility this pixelsleeve is excellent for the february # release of the # `` macbook pro it is a tight fit and has a great neoprene lip to protect the pro from the zipper the handle is a nice touch that allows me to carry the computer outside of my backpack , but still small enough that it fits inside the laptop compartment of my backpack as well overall a great case and a wonderful fit for the # macbook pro
i 've had other carrying sleeves before i have an hp pavilion dv # , it fits the bag well and comfortable the little leather strap and handle came off it does have one single zipper <unk> to store a few things it 's a decent bag , nice color the thing is , is there are better bags or cases to store your laptop if you know you want a carrying sleeve and have extra protection for your laptop you know what you 're asking for i put this thing through strain and it 's endured , good enough
i am a college student and it fits my # . # `` hp perfectly the zipper was no hassle though the front pocket , at least for me , is pretty useless i only use it for usbs or small cables just a wireless mice is too big and bulky for that pocket the material of the case is soft , but feels cheap for some reasons there are some puncture <unk> on the front that could have been easily done by <unk>
i recieved this item in a timely <unk> , which was nice after opening the package i noticed that there are a lot of frayed threads , also a <unk> section of the front ... very disappointed .
i bought it at an incredibly low price expecting it to be , well ... meh . it was a pleasant surprise . only one qualm with the product which was a two minute fix the zipper handle broke from the zipper after a few times , but all i had to do was <unk> it in the clasp and clamp it down so now it stays permanently good buy all around
i have a # . # inch gateway and this sleeve fits it just fine you wo n't be able to put a lot of bulky accessories in the other compartment though , it 's a tight fit
this case will only protect the outside of your laptop do n't expect it to do much if you drop it from any height as there is very little padding it will prevent scratches , but nothing more that being said , the design is nice to look at and is comfortable for carrying
fit my hp laptop well the only downside was the main zipper pull tab broke easily that 's easily fixed , but knocks it down a star still overall happy with my purchase
this fits perfectly with my hp laptop the zipper pocket comes in handy for flash drives and dvds when on the go the only problem is that it looks a little cheap , other than that good product
bought this to fit a # . # & # # ; acer that we bought for christmas of # -lrb- # months ago -rrb- and the sleeve has been holding up well gave it # of # since after only about a month 's usage the zipper pull tab ripped apart -lrb- it was a faux leather -rrb- there is still a little bit of the metal part left , enough to hold onto , so it is still functional at least the rest of the sleeve is still looking really nice and repels dirt pretty well
this laptop case is really great it has a little pocket in the front for documents and little usbs the only downside is that the white is a dirt catcher it ends up not being so white pretty quickly but i still love it i used it when i <unk> all over the united states and it kept my laptop cool in the sun and warm in the cold it did the job i needed and continues to protect my laptop
extremely pleased with it i use it whenever i have to bring it to school for work and it works fine and fits my # . # laptop snugly you have to be careful not to get it dirty because the white and the light gray makes stains or marks really visible
i bought this for a toshiba # `` laptop it fits perfect , not a lot of wiggle room but will work nicely to protect the computer you ca n't see the design really <unk> there is an <unk> white pattern on the smaller section on the front over the silver it 's a neutral design that could work for a lot of different people the inside is soft the zipper pull itself looks like it could break over time -lrb- not the actual zipper but the pull -rrb- but for the price we 'll just have to be mindful of that great case so far
great laptop sleeve i have a # `` laptop but still fits perfectly i love the pouch on the front ; main reason i chose this over other laptop sleeves inside is softly padded to a thickness that suits me i actually did n't notice the small design on the front pouch when i purchased the sleeve , but i do n't mind it 's simple and subtle the zipper does feel a little cheap , like other reviewers stated i 'll just try to be careful so it does n't tear off overall , great and durable sleeve
i bought this for a friend of mine she selected it but i do n't think she realized how much she 'd love it in her words , ' i now have a gray for my gray . it 's a <unk> laptop sleeve
great fit with zippered <unk> big enough to hold cords , mouse and a few extras offers a little protection but not meant to protect your laptop from a drop , does a great job protecting it in my backpack
i 've had no problems with this item so far and i 've had it for about two weeks now there 's really not that much white on it at all ... just on the outer rim , so i 'm not sure why people are saying it 's almost all white i 've had no issues with any of the zippers it 's very padded which is perfect for my bulky laptop that scratches very easily it also has a nice pocket on the front where i store my charger love this product for such a cheap price
so overall i like this product style wise this is the top of the line not to mention theres a front pocket so you can put your charger in the zipper has being working great for me , do n't know what the other reviewers are talking about there is some padding for the occasionally bump and scratch protection but do n't expect much from a fall material on outside is somewhat easy to clean it fits my # & # # ; widescreen nicely
sleeve is very inexpensive it <unk> my nexus # and my kindle , and many other things the zippered side <unk> is also great for such things as earbuds , power supplies , cables , etc .
i did n't even use the sleeve much and when i did , it was mostly carried whole and not by its handle the handle connection on one side is almost totally ripped from where it should be connected
i purchased three of these in the course of a year the first worked great , but the handle wore over time and eventually -lrb- after # months -rrb- completely broke after that i purchased two more at the same time , thinking the handle issue was just a fluke turns out that both of the new ones had zippers that malfunctioned ... one right away and one after a week or two of use it was otherwise a great product very good cosmetic design but if it does n't last more than a few months , then i have to give it # star
i purchased this item in december of last year about a month ago , the zipper strap used to open and close the zipper completely tore apart and basically made the bag useless hp needs to use stronger materials for the zipper and make sure the bag zipper does not break
bought this sleeve in september and hardly used it <unk> i must have used for about # hours and one side of the carrying handle broke i really liked it but it was n't worth the money spent i hope it was just a case that my situation was unfortunate and nobody else experienced this . : -
this case was just the ticket for a slim well fitting protector for the # `` hp laptop i received as a christmas gift hp # -inch notebook sleeve - black stream
this bag is really nice it has a slick design and it has an <unk> body the only thing i did not like was that the zipper did n't make a full square around the bag the zipper is located on a side of the bag and does n't come around completely that 's the only negative for me , but it 's everything i expected with the line design on the body and the elastic material
i recently bought a new early # `` macbook pro and wanted excellent protection to protect my very expensive investment i upgraded from a # `` and had a wonderful rigid protective case that i ca n't remember the name of so i figured this hp would be good once i received it i was very pleased with the design the fact that the zipper is only on the side is fine , and the inside protects the laptop from touching the zipper , so i know my machine wo n't be scratched the fact that it also has a pocket for the charger is awesome too i did n't have that with my old computer case and love the possibility although i do n't always need to take it with me the built-in handle is comfortable and great overall it 's a wonderful case for a # `` macbook pro
this is a great sleeve , very light it 's not a traditional sleeve , it 's a cross between a sleeve and a case because it has a handle and a side pocket i use it to carry a # -inch laptop , a <unk> notepad , power supply and a mouse all this fits nicely , with room to spare one thing to keep in mind is that items like a mouse and power supply must go in the side pocket which creates a visible bulge it looks a little strange but does n't bother me
have tried several notebook sleeves , this hp # -inch is fantastic not only is it easy to use , carry around and store extra goodies in , including a ipad # - it 's attractive to look at i only wish they had more colors , i.e . red , navy , beige etc . worth the purchase !
it 's great it has a nice , soft interior , an extra compartment for anything else you want to carry around , and the best part for me is there 's a handle it 's the perfect fit a very high quality sleeve for a great price just awesome , i love it
this sleeve was just what i was looking for love the handle and the zipper pouch on the side the soft lining is a plus provides the protection i was looking for without the bulk
one side of the case looks nicely decorated , the other side is bland and rough material isnt the <unk> but the inner layer where ur computer goes is perfect if only the whole case used the material that encases ur laptop so if ur picky about ur case design this is a hit or miss for you
i bought this for my wife a few weeks ago she loved the look , i loved the price but my only gripe is that it <unk> n't really protect it 's strictly for show
this is just what i was looking for i wanted something that did not take a lot of space only thing i could have used was a handle to carry it .
this item was exactly as described and beautiful the sleeve is to protect the netbook from scratches primarily it is a very light sleeve it is perfect to protect my netbook inside by rolling backpack or inside my <unk> bag it 's just perfect for longer travel i have a case but this is perfect for my little trips and work the design is beautiful , the stitching is fine -lrb- noticed some people had problems with the stitching -rrb- and it is light weight if you are looking for a thick padded protector this is not the item to purchase if you are looking for a light weight protector to guard against scratches for light travel , then it 's perfect like i said , i transport it in my handbag and backpack
this fit the acer one # . # computer nicely exceptional quality and value for the price but does not have any space available for any cords , plugs or small ear plugs
i love the design and colors of this sleeve , but when it came the smell -lrb- that many other reviewers have mentioned -rrb- was horrible in an attempt to air it out , i left it in the garage for four days the smell diminished some but not enough and i 'm returning it today too bad , because it 's really cute and looked like it was going to work great just could n't get past that horrible chemical smell that got on your hands after touching the sleeve
this is a very nice looking sleeve as compared to the picture on the item 's page , mine does not sport a logo - which is fine with me the <unk> chemical smell of this sleeve is somewhat annoying
i bought this sleeve because i was tired of getting tiny scratches on my macbook pro i thought this sleeve was really fun and adorable my laptop fits snugly inside i like that the sleeve has a dual zipper on # of # sides , since it makes <unk> my laptop from my backpack that much easier there 's some fabric <unk> on the inside which prevents the zipper from scraping the sides of my laptop , which i really like i only wish it had an inside folder so that i could keep some of my laptop accessories -lrb- remote , projector adaptor , etc -rrb- in the same sleeve but away from my laptop but it does what i hoped it would do -- protect my laptop as for the claims from some other buyers about a strong chemical smell , i could only very faintly detect a chemical smell , and no more so than that of other neoprene laptop sleeves and the smell was gone after a couple of days so now all i have is a really cute laptop sleeve
this is a great laptop sleeve for anyone who does n't want to sacrifice style for functionality it 's not bulky , but offers good protection , and its cheery stripes always <unk> compliments a great buy
i bought this sleeve for my lenovo u # ideapad zipper is smooth # the sleeve has a really good feel better than a built ny sleeve i had earlier slightly wider for my laptop , <unk> wise , but its not really anyone 's fault it is as per dimensions specified has strong chemical smell , but i guess it will go away after a while # the logo on the sleeve was missing , although it does n't really matter to me
perfect sleeve , fits like a glove as other buyers described , there was a very strong chemical smell but i left it opened for a few days to air out , which solved the problem it 's a must buy
i was nervous this would n't fit my # `` macbook , but it fits perfectly the zipper cover on the inside is great , it keeps the edges of the computer extra protected it smelled a little bit like chemicals , but that has worn off in the first couple of days my only issue is that i also have a hard shell case for my computer , and i have found that this barely fits over the hard shell case it still zips , but it looks like it would wear out so i 've been using this instead of the hard shell - i think it is better protection
