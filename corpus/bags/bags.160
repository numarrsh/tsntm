this works fine for what i need it for i have the kind of job that would normally require a briefcase or shoulder bag -lrb- <unk> -rrb- , but my back wo n't allow me to go that way i like that this is flat against the back unlike those backpacks that stick out and look heavy the decorations are fairly minimal so it does n't scream ` backpack ' ; it just basically disappears visually , which is what i wanted also , you really ca n't put a lot in it which makes it ultimately easier on your back i would have liked a <unk> design for the laptop compartment , but those are hard to find overall , though , i am quite happy with my purchase
it 's a nice and slim design it can hold a lot : laptop , cords , portable drive , plus other misc items however ca n't handle much weight some of the sewed edges are loosened already
i purchased this bag with the <unk> of carrying a lenovo t # , along with various paper folders and general daily items this bag is small and compact , but well capable of holding the laptop , a leather bound meeting notebook , papers , a few cell phones , and a plethora of smaller items the quality appears to be in order and i am very happy so far -lrb- # month -rrb- with the bag i recommend it in the price point
this is a really good bag my # . # laptop fit perfect , as well as all the other goodies that go with it and my personal items i bought it for our vacation and it worked out <unk> however , i did n't give it # stars because the strap on the top of the pack ripped out of the seam and is now , literally , hanging by a thread that was a bummer but overall , its a very good product at a reasonable price
read the reviews and watched a video from one reviewer , he only had two minor things that he thought could have been done better by the manufacturer those two things do n't bother me and they wo n't because i do n't use the backpack the same way he does i bought the backpack to hold my gateway <unk> # u , # . # inch screen and it does the job well
this bag easily fit my # . # inch hp laptop , along with some other accessories it is not a book bag , nor does it claim to be it is perfect for safely transporting your laptop , it fits nice and snug and it feels like it is protected quite well good quality materials and a great price to boot it is pretty comfortable to carry as well
this was the best purchase i made in my recent memory do n't be fooled , this backpack may look small but it is cleverly spacious with smart compartments being a public transit commuter , <unk> <unk> me consistently which is why i gave up my fancy messenger bags for this sleek carrier it fits everything i need to and from work ... and i do n't even carry an additional purse absolutely love this and would recommend it to anyone who asks
the quality of the backpack was perfect for me ; i 've been using it to carry everything i need for my job and it 's just so much comfortable to have this i really recommend this product to anyone who has a good budget for a relatively cheap item that looks great and is in good conditions
no complaints at all about this backpack it has several pockets for storage holds my laptop secure i even carry an additional device which is used for my special needs child and it can hold my laptop and his device with ease i would suggest this product to anyone
excellent bag and it only let me put the stuff i really need because the bigger the bag , the more stuff i put in <unk> one has the right room and the price was perfect !
i love the way it feels and how slim it is , i have a macbook pro and fits perfectly and since i am in college it fits what i need :
this is a very nice lightweight backpack , not intended to carry anything large , thick , or heavy i intend to carry an acer iconia a # , a notebook , and single books to each class i go to the front pocket is pretty good to store wallet , keys , phone , pencils , etc . for # dollars , this was a pretty good deal
i like the v # , it has a professional sporty look to it i had it for a few months no flaws it holds my laptop # . # comfortably , my notebooks , business cards , internet tower , and everything else i <unk> to haul with no problem i would buy product again and from
i was definately unaware of the v # brand name , until i searched on amazon.com for a good backpack worthy of my money this v # backpack for my # . # `` dell laptop is an excellent buy in more than one way the price is definately an attention <unk> the quality of the product is excellent if you 're not looking for a backpack to put <unk> balls in it the style is fresh and smart , it is enough for a laptop and other pc accessories as well as personal items like a cell phone the color is nice and the logo is respectable the shoulder straps are strong , and again this backpack is not to be used for carrying very heavy things i would recomment it to my friends and would buy v # products again
this backpack is exactly what i was looking for i just wanted something light and comfortable to carry my laptop around it fits my # . # `` laptop perfectly and there is enough space for the charger , a <unk> mouse and some other stuff ; the headphones hole is a plus it looks really durable and i love the design and colors , and for such a reasonable price -lrb- and now it 's even cheaper -rrb- i just ordered another one for my brother
to be so well priced this bag is sturdy , has good installation and offers a secure fit ... a great buy that works well for people who need to constantly carry their laptop .
i already have a swiss gear laptop backpack that has tons of space i needed a laptop backpack that was light but durable i was a bit concerned about the quality of this product because it is priced so low , but i was pleasantly surprised i highly recommend it if you want to carry around your laptop and a few more things but do n't want a lot of weight
the bag is sleek and sexy and fulfills the purpose for which i bought it , to the full it has enough space for the things i need with me and is light and comfortable to carry
the back pack 's small compact design is perfect for on the go trips and even school it works great for me when all i need is an ipad and a binder it is surprising light weight , yet sturdy even when empty the only criticism that i have is that the side pocket are mainly for decoration : to small for real bottles
i am a wife and mother in the navy i wanted a backpack for my laptop to be hands free while i walked around foreign countries when we pulled in to ports having my laptop was important because i wanted to be able to skype if given the chance this product was aesthetically attractive yet <unk> which was appealing to me it was also pretty affordable saw some negative about seams coming apart and such but i rolled the dice and ordered it i 'm back from deployment and this bag held up quite nicely i did not experience any of the issues i had read about and have been completely satisfied it lived up to my needs and i even carried a few extra things around in it most importantly , i was able to fit some water bottles on the sides : -rrb- overall , great product
i really like this bag i used to carry a woman 's side laptop bag on the subway and started getting <unk> from lugging the ridiculously heavy laptop decided to purchase a backpack but did n't want to spend too much money this bag is great its wide straps are very comfortable and my # . # inch laptop fits very nicely into the slot there is plenty of room for my files , should i need to carry them and still looks sleek and compact i highly recommend this product
i wanted this to carry a <unk> to and from my <unk> <unk> , and i needed extra pockets for a pencil case and other manila folders , and an outer mesh pocket for a water bottle this has all that , plus it 's comfortable and cheap the # `` was overkill ; i exchanged it for the # ``
i bought this to use as an inexpensive <unk> backpack it 's ideal for that , with easily accessible separate zippered pockets that i can use for notebook , tools , maps , etc . it seems to be well made
it was used for a gift for my daughter starting college , she told me she really liked was elegant and well suited to its requirements for carrying books and school <unk> mp
i bought a laptop for a friend who lived in another country i delivered the laptop myself so i used this bag to transport it on the plane it worked great to go through airport security easy to get the laptop out and back in used the outer pocket for personal items
bag fits my # inch laptop easily also , the material allows for stretching so i 'm even able to put my <unk> gloves in there when needed for the price , this works a lot better than my tumi backpack i do agree the top handle is a not strong , but as long as you use the straps you 'll be fine i 've been using mine daily for well over a year and it 's still in great condition
this backpack is amazing , you can put a lot of stuff inside and simply feel no weight at all it is a magnificent design and in terms of comfort , it is better than your regular backpack although it is designed to hold specifically a laptop , you can put heavy books and notebooks inside without the typical <unk> resulting of carrying too much weight . # month using it and feels great
i 'm not a student , i would n't use this for a school book bag , i 'm a <unk> and carry a laptop and tablet with me daily it 's perfect to carry both and a modest size book and some papers or folders
the backpack was really nice i like that it has a slim look to it and does not over expand and look big the bag looks durable and feels strong and for only $ # it was a steal it says it is for # `` but my # `` laptop fits great i use it for school to hold notebooks , laptop , mouse , calculator , medicine , pencils , iphone wires , laptop charger , and still looks nice and small as shown in the picture the feeling of the padding is not great quality but is decent feels a bit rough without a shirt
the backpack was received in time , which is helpful for me to carry my paperwork and laptop without the bag , i have to carry the laptop by hand , which is very terrible
this is neon green ; not lime green i literally looked for hours to find a fun laptop bag and fell in love with this one ; but when i received it i was disappointed ; it 's very very bright neon green however , the bag itself is as described very nice zipper and plenty of room for my larger laptop and paperwork
bag is quite big for # & # # ; macbook and not a whole lot of padding to go around the bag bought it since last laptop was just in a sleeve and when we were on vacation travelling by car the laptop slipped out and cracked i think i would have returned the bag if i travelled extensively due to the fact that there is not a lot of padding plus the zipper & # # ; handles & # # ; already fell off so i need to get the pliers out and put them back on
this bag is not lime green it is neon ... like <unk> neon it is a decent bag for the price though my laptop is a # . # & # # ; and it takes up the entire inside
i 've been looking for a good , cheap bag to carry my laptop in for school for a while so i would n't have to carry it in my backpack this bag is definitely that it is a great price -lrb- the free shipping did n't hurt ! -rrb- and the quality is solid it 's a little big for my # . # `` hp pavilion , but it works with the inner strap to prevent my computer from moving around the color is a little brighter than i expected -lrb- its more neon green -rrb- but it 'll stand out from the rest of the black laptop bags in the library or in class at school i love the size of it my laptop will fit in it with my cord and mouse and also room for a couple books or notebooks so i can carry more to <unk> overall , i 'm pleased but i wish the picture show the actual color a little better as i thought it would be a softer green
i like this product my old laptop got stolen , replacing things one at a time and this case is inexpensive and functional i 'm not sure why my # `` does n't fit well in it -lrb- bag too big -rrb- but oh well i would 've liked the walls to have been a bit more supportive but ... it works for now so
the size and functionality could not be better fits my hp # . # inch laptop and cords , etc perfectly it is on narrow side but this is good thing for me i can still carry extras like cables and mouse but not too much more the colour is a very bright almost neon green and brighter than i thought however i get a ton of positive comments on it from strangers asking where i got it one negative and why i am not giving # stars is the smell very strong unpleasant chemical <unk> on this for few days i had to put outside in fresh air i am sure this is a packing material issue i would recommend and would buy again
i bought the case after reading the reviews because other reviewers said the case was more lime green than the picture depicted , and they were right -lrb- which i wanted -rrb- it is a very lime green -lrb- which i love -rrb- i bought this case for a # . # inch toshiba satellite , and it fits with lots of room to spare i also bought a laptop <unk> # inch laptop sleeve - black and <unk> there is enough room in this case to fit my laptop in the sleeve there is also room in this case for your laptop charger if needed -lrb- no sleeve though -rrb- the side pocket is very roomy , which fits my kindle and other items , like dvds , books , and my mouse the case also comes with a shoulder strap
this bag was a great surprise it can be used solely for my laptop or for a <unk> of other uses the zippers run down three sides and meet in the middle a zippered pouch in the back can get you to paperwork without opening the bag it has multiple sections inside with pen holders , and pouches galore the bottom of the bag also has rubber gripper <unk> to keep my laptop <unk> and is a great stabilizer when the bag is placed down a ` must have ' for travel great for travel with a sturdy handle as a bonus it has a long , wide , <unk> strap with an <unk> shoulder ` comfort ' patch for your ease what more can i say at this price
this is a fantastic bag ! ! it 's well made and is a bright color it 's been the perfect laptop bag for me i carry it back and forth to work everyday and it has been awesome
i recently upgraded to a new laptop and did not realize until i brought it home that the new laptop does not fit into my old laptop bag this laptop bag is perfect for my asus u # <unk> # laptop that has a # . # `` screen there is even extra room inside the large compartment to fit a # `` # -ring binder also the pocket on the outside is spacious enough to fit extra cords and my external hard drive as well , without becoming too bulky i love the color the slim design is an added bonus
this computer tote is so much prettier in person than the picture depicts the color is bright , but it 's beautiful , not gaudy all in all this is a sturdy , well made bag with outstanding quality lots of storage space for papers and other odds and ends the strap is also super sturdy and comfortable love it ! i think i want to buy it in pink also :
i purchased this bag for my work laptop and love it the color is brighter than the pictures , which made it even better it 's also very easy to clean with a <unk> wipe if it gets dirty the shoulder strap stays on well and the laptop remains stable inside due to the velcro straps i would recommend this bag
love the color and the case it is made well i have used it to transport my lap top to meetings and work glad i purchased it lots of room inside to put extras had it monogrammed looks nice and very
my daughter got a new laptop and needed a new case i looked around online for awhile and went to a few stores and just was n't finding what i wanted then it occurred to me to try amazon ; which has never disappointed me this laptop case is perfect she loves it
i looked quite a while before settling for this messenger bag , and was not disappointed it arrived promptly , and my new computer fits inside quite nicely there is ample external storage room in the front pocket , and the shoulder strap is comfortable i would have preferred it in bright red , but this bright lime green is a good color i can spot my bag easily and it just does n't get lost in the crowd of hundreds of black bags oh yes , the price was right too
this bag is exactly what my wife was looking for it is lightweight yet strong enough to protect her laptop roomy enough for easy access and adding extras she is extremely pleased also our baby girl spilled some tea on it and it cleaned up just fine
do n't buy this thing very poor design at the angle designed , it is impossible to use it sticked to the car windshield , unless the angle of the windshield is very steep e.g . a school bus do n't waste your money
this product es very strong and does n't <unk> . the cons that i found are # - the product is not the same as it shown on pictures # - for non vertical <unk> you have to put you camera upside down
i have this mounted on the dash of my car , have a sony <unk> mounted to it holds good , no problems it should come with the little plastic circle so you can mount it to the dash and then the mount to the disk had one that i mount the gps already on my dash then you would not have to have thing upside down from mounting to the windshield
i 'm using with a <unk> camera in my car <unk> going to and from work may record something that will be news worthy holds well with no jumping around
fantastic product , super fast shipment , i was waiting it in the middle of june , but today i found it in my mail box tried <unk> in my car , i 'm using canon <unk> # as a <unk> , it is fantastic , very secure , will update my review after test drive update : superb ! ! i need a camera with wide angle lens , but this is good product ! ! already made a video using this holder ! camera is canon <unk> # , camera holder <unk> -lsb- ...
the laptop case came in perfect condition i 've been using it for my macbook air # ' , for the first # weeks it was great i even dropped it once on a <unk> floor and it still works the bummer is that the zipper has a rip in it so it will only zip from one side
it is cute and have a smooth inside just be careful when opening and closing ; cause i always in hurry so i broke the zipper a little , still usable look out for the corner of your laptop , the zipper can scratch the <unk> off it hope they attach <unk> soft inside the zipper
i just got this and it 's great it looks soooo cute , but the stitching on the bottom is n't perfect i 'm concerned it 'll fall apart , but we 'll just have to see what happens it should be durable for the price , then again , i 'm paying for hello kitty , not the sleeve itself
i love this laptop case , it protects my laptops very well , it 's very soft and the design is great it has a very hard surrounding which is great as it does n't touch the laptop i use it with my samsung n
pros : fits a # . # in computer perfectly as described two spots for memory devices and other spots for other things cons : as a full time student , it did n't hold enough items for my liking nor did it have as much space as i would like can only fit my # . # computer , wireless mouse , portable hard drive , and # books comfortably overall : it is an excellent backpack it has slots for sd cards , miscellaneous cables and thumb drives it had enough space for an average person definitely a buy
i was very pleased with this backpack i carried my # & # # ; dell laptop in it when i walked to work and back however , once i upgraded to an asus # & # # ; rog it no longer fit keep in mind that is a gaming laptop which is larger than the average # & # # ; laptop this should be fine for a typical machine build quality seemed fine , never had any other issues my only slight complaint would be that it did n't breath well on the back i always ended up with a sweaty lower back when i wore this
since this is only day one of owning the backpack i ca n't say too much though wearing it is very comfortable , reminds me to a kata <unk> back pack i owned a couple years ago well padded everywhere , nice sturdy zipper and enough room for my school books i 'll update this if it starts falling apart anytime soon
just does not fit the computer - can barely get the computer in the bag - and it wo n't zip . have n't tried to put the power brick in the side pouch
if you want something to protect your laptop , you are better off putting a piece of paper towel over it this bag will not offer any protection when you carry it , it feels like the handles are going to break as well i would not buy this
get what you pay for . very cheaply made so cheap i wo n't even use it only can barely fit the laptop in it , no power cord , mouse nothing else
i bought this as a gift but when i looked at it the fabric was already pulling away from the sides since it was a new product i expected better quality
the overall quality of the bag is mediocre - you get what you pay for it is as i suspected and i am not disappointed in the quality the obvious concern for the wide-screen laptop is the width my asus slides in nicely , not too tight , not loose and bouncing around however , the bag is too short and my laptop rises above the zipper by about an inch
this laptop bag serves it 's purpose , and is worth how much i paid for it i bought it in a hurry , because i needed a protected way to carry my laptop around that was very cost effective this bag is that , but under normal consumer purchasing circumstances i would have rather paid more for a bit more padding , and more pockets and compartments for other accessories that i use regularly with my laptop i will eventually need to upgrade , which makes having this bag a temporary thing
i would have given this bag a four star if not for a broken zipper pull tab on the accessory zipper at the front of the bag but it 's not a total loss i just got to find a small key ring or something to fit through through the loop of the zipper overall the bag is a good deal and was n't worth sending back for the broke zipper the zipper part is n't broken so it 's still usable
i got this for my # & # # ; toshiba satellite and it fits fine i currently have an hp dv # and it also works fine the front pocket has a bit more storage than i thought and i can also stuff a few folders in with the laptop
this is a very suitable notebook bag and very handy carrying around i had one problem , the notebook bag was not issued along with the laptop , even though it arrived the same day it was indicated that the bag would arrive few days later i was told later by one of the agents that the bag was there the same day that the laptop arrived
like this case does what intended for e price can not beat it in fact , i sent back one i bought for red times the price to another merchant and kept this one
i use this laptop bag for school all the time - works great for holding my # & # # ; acer laptop and a few books only thing i dislike is the amount of space inside the bag - i could fit one textbook and my laptop inside of it , and nothing else for the price though , it 's a great laptop bag
my hp pavillion g # -lrb- # . # & # # ; -rrb- fits along with charger , mouse and flash drive someone else gave a similar review , but their review is why i bought it as that 's the laptop that i have
not the most padded case , but i wanted a thin case my laptop is kind of big , but it fits quite well the pocket is nice overall i ended up getting my sister one too
this laptop size was true and right for my laptop . the price also was n't expensive , but the bag handle was hurting my hands if i carry it with my laptop for more than half hours i will be more happy if the handle more soft anyway , this seller is still good though
the # inch laptop fits in this just right & there is a little room to <unk> its not much for the eyes but it was a great price & it definitely serves its
ok the bag is not bad for the price , but it really could be padded better no matter what the price that is really the only thing i have bad to say about it i used the air pillows from the box it came in to add extra padding so my husband could travel with it
this bag is pretty well made and light weight so no extra pounds to carry around the price was great too wish they had if for the same price in pink
bag is a good fit for my hp dv # laptop good padding to protect it i do n't do much traveling with it , if i did i would possibly want something a little sturdier and bigger the side pocket is a tight fit for the power supply and cord , and my wireless mouse but for storage at home it is good
bag is nice and light even with my # & # # ; <unk> laptop and large charger too bad it does not come with a shoulder handle/strap - but that 's my issue cause i did n't pay attention to the description when i purchased it still , bag does exactly what it 's intended for , and at a very nice price
i bought this item more for a need than anything i liked the pricing on this one so that 's really what sold me it 's a pretty good bag though , do n't get me wrong it 's roomy and the outer bag fits the charger and a mouse perfectly , and still has room left over for other small things you might need to carry like memory cards or something like that satisfied with purchase
only gets # stars because it 's just a basic laptop bag nothing to write home about , but it is exactly what i ordered does exactly what i need it to do , and the extra pocket is a bonus for accessories or your tablet
the inland pro computer tote is well constructed and sturdy i love that it has a zippered pocket for carrying the cords i only wish it had a shoulder strap
great bag fits perfectly . i am a bit disappointed though in the packaging that caused me to pay a good bit of cash to clear it when it reached my address
i am very happy with my purchase it is definitely an excellent value for the little money spent ; however , if i could change one thing it would be to add a shoulder strap
this bag is just what i wanted , great price and holds my # inc laptop just fine did not want to pay too much for a laptop bag because i dont carry it around that often just wanted something to keep my laptop in
works well for what i use it for would recommend this bag to anyone the only thing about the bag , it 's a bit thin if you wanted to use it for a laptop computer
i received this bag in # days -lrb- great service -rrb- i gave this a # only because it does not have , what i consider to be enough padding for a laptop i will also be purchasing a skin to place the laptop in and then in this bag otherwise this bag is just as described
pretty much what i expected - a light , soft case for hauling my <unk> just enough room in the single <unk> for the <unk> remote mouse i was a little disappointed that there was <unk> zip pocket -lrb- there is only a photo of one side of the case <unk> -rrb-
for the price it is a great deal bag has good amount of padding to support and protect my computer it has one pocket in from that is able to hold my power cord and wireless mouse not much room to put any extra paperwork but for this price i am not complaining
not knowing what to expect as to quality , i took a chance and purchased the notebook bag because the price was so reasonable , in fact , down right cheap , i figured i had nothing to lose <unk> , there is not a great selection of # . # inch laptop bags to my surprise , the bag is great it is made of a sturdy strong cloth a true bargain !
i wasnt too sure about this product because it look to be like the sleeve type but i was wrong it has <unk> room to hold my laptop , mouse , my cooling fan , and the plug i am truely impressed with this product also it arrived on time and was new as the seller stated actually arrived # days early great product great seller will be <unk> from them again
this case is simple and very good protection i did not need fancy i needed a good case for a good price and there it was on amazon the big cases are not so easy to find
i choose this because it is small , light weight , and my gateway fits in perfectly i can still fit in my wireless mouse and cord , not much else i would recommend this
super cheap but just what i wanted a nicely padded case that fits my # inch computer and a pocket to keep your cords or mouse or whatever in exactly what i wanted for the price
perfect if you 're looking to transport your laptop to point a to point b , but the protection and padding is n't the best you get what you pay for , though , and at this price , you ca n't go wrong
i was n't overly <unk> about this bag when i ordered it because it was inexpensive , however , when i received it i was pleasantly surprised this is a very nice bag and built well if i have a need for another bag for one of our computers , i would n't hesitate to order another one
i just needed a bag to protect my laptop during travel i do n't travel with it a lot , but just to keep it scratch-free when going thru security and carrying it from place to place , it 's perfect there 's room for my charger & wireless mouse too it 's well-made and looks sturdy could n't beat the price too
i went to several stores looking for a notebook bag for my new laptop it was hard to find a # inch one and the ones i did find were a lot more than i wanted to pay i came home and searched amazon and found the perfect bag this inland pro is a perfect fit for my laptop and protects it when i am not using it the price was more than reasonable i got a sturdy bag for a very low price and could n't be happier i would recommend this for anyone looking for a # inch notebook bag you wo n't be sorry
with my new dell # & # # ; lap top , i needed a larger bag to take all the items that go with my new dell this bag was just right for that service and more
it fits a toshiba # & # # ; portable it also carries a portable hard disk , headphones , charger , and a <unk> mouse in it 's accessory pocket it seems built durable , and it is light weight the zippers are not sticking
needed bag for vacation traveling delivery was quick and roomy enough for my laptop , my kindle and both power cords it even fell over once and i did n't worry about damages because of the padding
this fit my hp # . # laptop perfectly there 's a separate zipped section with plenty of room for the power cord and mouse nice padding , easy to carry and really fast shipping while looking for a notebook bag i found # . # `` bags hard to find and expensive this bag at $ # was a great bag ... you ca n't go wrong i could n't be more pleased with my purchase
