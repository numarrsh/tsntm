items came on time and in excellent condition i just love it protects laptop and fits perfectly i do n't think you can get a better set for this price anywhere
i just got this cover for my macbook pro # inch and honestly i <unk> gotten this a long time ago i love how smooth it feels and that it does n't look cheap at all i got the neon green color case i love it ! ! ! :
many reviews say the case does n't fit , because make sure you have the right mac , its for the mac book pro # inch , no retina the newer mac with retina is smaller and lighter , if you bought the case and it did n't fit , that because you either have a mac air , or macbook with retina if you have the right mac , this case is perfect , half the price of a case in stores , and it comes with a sleeve , keyboard cover , and screen protecter came in # days early , and i love it , came with everything . * but , make sure you do n't have a macbook with retina , it wo n't fit
this cover is nice and protects my computer i am happy with the aqua color i picked : -rrb- i am not impressed with the screen film cover , because it has bubbles that are hard to get out
this product arrived within # days , it was in perfect condition it fit perfectly on my macbook pro -lrb- late # -rrb- and it 's high quality plastic i have received several compliments and will recommend to anyone i would buy this product again
this was so worth of dime it was great everything fit wonderfully i love the case it feel great and fit perfectly on my laptop . the keyboard cover is best i 've seen the sleeve was a snug fit but in my opinion that good thing buy this my only complaint is i wish the cover was a dark shade of pink
it was inexpensive , loved the color i get a lot of compliments on this when im out it was easy to put on and i love the fact that it came with a screen protector . definitely a good deal my brother bought one right after me and he loves it
very durable and good product i recommend this product to the fullest it would be nice if the apple sign was clear on the hard case but that 's just nitpicking no problems what so ever
love the shell and the key board , took me a day or so to get use to the keyboard cover like the sleeve that came and the screen protector works great
love this case , the keyboard protector is amazing and the bag that comes with it works just great for protecting my computer when i leave it around the house . really happy with this purchase
the case and sleeve fit perfectly and the keyboard cover is great for keeping cat hair and food crumbs out of the keys : -rrb- i feel so much more stylish and cool now that i have a pretty case to differentiate myself from fellow mac users well worth the cost
protects my laptop and super pretty color which is true to the color in the photos provided . i would definitely recommend this product especially to people who are always on the go with their laptops perfect for protection -lrb- the fit is n't exact though for my model but its not horrible still i would tell you to make sure this is compatible with your model
i love this case cover set for my computer the key cover keeps dirt off the keyboard and it looks great the hard case is durable and protects my computer from scratches the cover protects the new cover i did not use the plastic screen cover because it started to bubble , due to me not placing it on properly , but the other features were worth the price i have gotten many compliments and told friends to order one from amazon i got the purple set for a friend and she loves hers too
it fit perfect on the laptop very easy to install & very fast delivery i recommend it for anyone looking for something easy to install n if you need to protect the laptop
it protects without adding a lot of weight i have had it for about a month it did not take long to get used to having the cover on the keys only bad part is that the keyboard cover blocks out the back light for the keys when working at night or in the
it came very quickly i recommend it con : the only con is that the protective screen did not work at all it was hard to apply , had a ton of air bubbles , and was just not worth it but the product was so great otherwise and affordable , that it does n't even matter
the keyboard cover is great the computer case fits great the neoprene sleeve is sweet everything is awesome i wish i had more macbooks to cover i 'd definitely use this product again ! !
everything fits perfect and looks nice the only problem was <unk> he screen protection i could n't get on without multiple bubbles did n't really buy it for that anyway so i just took it off everything else is great and the price was perfect
this is by far the best cover and sleeve i 've come across , i 'm sure there are more out there , but this one is better than the picture shows this is not a boring blue , its a metallic blue and it comes with keyboard protector and screen protector do n't hesitate , buy it today , its very inexpensive . # stars for prompt delivery and for product quality
i decided to buy this case because of the price compared to the ones sole at the apple store or other stores , this is definitely a bargain i got the case in # days which was awesome because it was delivered the same day i bought home my macbook pro the case fit perfectly on it and it was not hard to install , it came with all the items described overall it was a really good purchase and i recommend it to any one looking for well priced reliable case
very well with my macbook pro , protects and does not overheat , it is very easy to put on and remove , the <unk> of the keyboard is not in english home keyboards in
this case is wonderful there are a few sharp edges , but you ca n't feel them at all unless you really put pressure on the spot every part of this is very good the case works very well and fits really well -lrb- i had no troubles at all putting it on it might differ when you buy other colors i got the purple . the keyboard case works well , but i would n't recommend it for someone who is always on the computer for me it works great the sleeve is durable and is a strong fabric , which is helpful when traveling often and the clear cover for the screen is almost invisible after you 've put it on anyway , i hope this was helpful to you ! ! ! ! !
i absolutely love this package deal it came with everything i desired and the fact that all the colors matched was awesome no complaints here , and it came really fast too
love it ! fits the macbook pro perfectly i call it my little pillow case for my laptop i even tuck my <unk> mouse right inside to carry it along
my laptop cover , screen protector , key board cover , and sleeve for my mac book is great and exactly what i was looking for it seems like good quality so far and i love the colour shipping was extremly fast and convenient along with the best part , cheap i would for sure buy more things from amazon in the future
the case fits my laptop perfectly the color is super <unk> and true to the picture however you can not see the apple sign through it unless its lit up , this would n't be a problem if i did n't have a decal on it i really do n't mind it to be honest i love the color and everything about it
couldnt get screen cover on but that was expected good bang for your buck worth the money for all that you get no problem typing on the keyboard either ... i dont know what these other reviewers are talking about
is very nice strong and protection for the computer is amazing i will recommend it to any one the has purchased a expensive computer like apple there amazing computers so protection is the key and this product will do
the laptop sleeve i purchased is very nice , and exactly as was presented it was a very good price an extra perk i received was a matching color keyboard cover , and i really like it it fits perfectly another extra perk was the hard case ; however , it was too big for my # & # # ; macbook pro i have no complaint , as i only purchased the sleeve and did n't pay extra for the keyboard cover or hard case the products were packaged nicely and were delivered in a timely manner i would recommend this seller ! :
great case and great deal unfortunately , i ordered one for my macbook air and the bottom did not fit the company representative called me within a few hours to let me know how to return the product since they did not have one for the air i loved the cover and keypad cover so i decided to keep it and give the hard case to a colleague
at first i was disappointed because this shipment was sent out to me so late that amazon did n't even charge me , then i got it about a week later everything came in exactly as described , which i was so glad for because i thought that for this price it was definitely a scam
i really love my new case , keyboard protector , screen protector and bag that came with it they are the perfect color and fit exactly this is a really good deal as you can pay twice as much for one item as i did for all four pieces originally i did n't think that my order would be ready until # weeks after i placed it but it arrived on my doorstep just a few days later i was very impressed with the fast shipping i 've already recommended these products to my sister and friends and they are playing their orders soon
this product definitely does what it was made to do i love it because it is very easy to put on and it stays on the sleeve is amazing , protects my macbook pro from all the <unk> elements out there in the world i enjoy every single part of this product and i would by more if i could however , the one i have is amazing and i do n't need another one so buy it if you want it , because it 's awesome
i <unk> love this color i bought it for myself but my daughter loved it so much that she took it it is the nicest color i have ever seen
i just got my new macbook and i was nervous about bringing it to college without anything covering it , so when this arrived a day early i was very impressed the color is so rich -lrb- a bit darker than the picture though , but it hardly matters -rrb- and feels great to the touch ; smooth matte feeling it was easy to put on , and the included sleeve is nice and padded so i will be able to bring it in my backpack to class now without worry i will say though , that the screen protector that it came with was bent and therefore unusable but i did n't really care -lrb- i hate screen protectors anyway all in all , i 'm very happy with my purchase
love the case , i preferred a green one but this was all that was left when i ordered i 'm still using this product , never really use the envelope case , it 's a little snug i usually just throw it in my backpack laptop section works like a charm and i 've only got a tiny crack in the corner from dropping my backpack on accident , thank god i had the case got ta take it off and clean underneath the case ever so often though , accumulates particles
seriously the fastest shipping ever i ordered on a tuesday and received it on a friday i ordered the robin egg blue , and i love it everything pops on super easy i have n't tried the screen protector yet , but no complaints about the other items travel case is a little snug , but it does n't bother me
i just got this in the mail today , and i immediately opened it and put everything on my computer the case was a little tricky to put on , but i got it on after maybe two minutes of fighting with the case it feels weird typing with the keyboard protector , but nothing i ca n't get used to one other thing , the case is a solid color , but , you can see decals and stickers that were put on the computer under the case just fine and , you have to put decals on under the case they wo n't stick to the smooth rubber-like surface of the case
it was great love the texture and the pink sleeve did not use the screen cover because it causes a glare and could take the bubbles out when i tried to place it on the screen
i get great compliments about this cover i love the way the keyboard cover keeps things clean our school issues macbook pro to all of our teachers and it is nice being able to tell my computer apart from others
the gmyle -lrb- r -rrb- hard case cover has done a far better job remaining attached to the macbook pro than my previous more expensive cover the only problem i had was that the silicone keyboard protector did not match the keys , but the seller responded fast and solved the problem
i did n't know exactly what to expect from this product since the price seemed so cheap , but i was pleasantly surprised the case fit snugly , and the keyboard overlay is so nice to have -lrb- i ca n't tell you how many accidental coffee spills this is going to save me from -rrb- though the price may be inexpensive , the build and quality of materials do n't reflect it i did n't bother with the screen protector since i 'm no good at putting those on overall , a great product
this product fits great on my macbook pro laptop its a tight fit putting it into the soft case with the hard case on it but it does fit in it this is exactly what i was looking for
one if the best purchases on amazon ever the case is smooth but sturdy , comes with a keyboard protector and fits perfect , and then goes inside another high quality sleeve to protect while on the go this price is great
love the snap on cover , protects my new mac from <unk> <unk> <unk> and clumsy <unk> with their starbucks the screen protector is amazing as well i even forget it 's there , it 's so clear , and it really helps block away <unk> dust <unk> and <unk> <unk> the soft , plushy case fits like a tight sock , <unk> and <unk> the laptop and keeps dust away from the all the openings now for the fourth piece of the <unk> , the keyboard cover this guy here is nice too , fits well onto the keys unfortunately , it takes some time to get use , i hope it does n't feel the same with it on , like a rubber you do n't want to use , but you know you have to cause it 's better to be safe then sorry keeps dust away , helps protect from spills , and looks natural definitely recommend this bundle , it 's an amazing purchase and everything is <unk>
great product ! came on time and keys have not worn out like my friends key pads also , case looks wonderful and great when i pull it out of the sleeve
i love this product ! ! ! the purple is so cute it fits my brand new # & # # ; macbook pro perfectly the only tiny glitch is that the keyboard cover has a wrinkle in it over the space bar can not beat the protection for the price love , love , love
i purchased this for my son to protect his new computer it was an apple mac pro but the quality and bundle of items saved me a chunk of change over apple
this laptop case has been very durable , has lasted a lot time , and it fits my mac perfectly when i need a new one , i will definitely invest in another one of this same brand i appreciated that there were several colors to choose from so that i could choose whatever my heart desired and that it was reasonably affordable , too the cover for the keyboard works great and is very effective in keeping things from going in between my keys , and being a college student i often eat while i am studying also , the case is very easy to remove without cracking so that i can clean underneath a problem i have had in the past is my mac overheating due covers and this one has never been a problematic to my computer on the other hand , putting on the screen protector was terribly hard , and in the end , i just decided not to use it because it would n't go on smoothly overall , this product is a great buy and definitely worth the money for the case , keyboard protector , and laptop sleeve
so the product was really good i feel that it was ideal for those people that have mac book pro the only problem i had was that they gave me the wrong color , but even so it was n't that much of a big deal it still works regardless
this specific set is extremely durable and looks great many compliments have been received on it and i will definitely be recommending this to other consumers i would love to buy multiple versions of this product and fully intend to do so
this was a gift , and everything came just as described the rubberized hard case clicked right onto the laptop and fit snug the key guard correctly fit the keyboard everything fit perfectly into the soft case great value compared to what would be spent to get the same pieces at the apple store
it looks exactly as it is shown in images i love the color and the sleeve bag that comes along with it i received exactly everything that was listed it is indeed cheap and you do get what you are paying for worth the price given
i absolutely love this case it fits my computer perfectly and the keyboard cover fits just as well the case color is a little bit more pink than i was hoping for but i have no problem with it in the end the slide on cover is snug but i love how it fits everything just goes perfectly together oh and i almost forgot , the screen cover is actually a nice addition but i struggled to get that one lined up perfectly on my own best done with someone to help
the turquoise is a very beautiful color i had a very bad scratch on my macbook and i am glad that the cover is hiding it the sleeve is also very nice , it did have that weird silicon smell for a week though
love the color and all it products are very great quality fits perfectly to my laptop mac got lots of complimentary from people and especially the color the price is great
great price for a nicely coordinated set however , you ca n't use the rubberized cover and the neoprene sleeve at the same time the laptop gets stuck love the keyboard cover
this case is totally worth your money it comes with four high quality items the shell is a little hard to get on but once it is on it works perfectly when the laptop is on the apple light shows through the sleeve is perfect and it works with the hard case it is a little snug but feels safe i use the keyboard cover a lot , it muffles the clicks of the keys but it seams to muffle the audio . the screen protector went on very well but there are some bubbles on it but it is not noticeable when the laptop is on i highly recommend this product
i ordered this product & it came the very next day the `` deep purple `` is more of a magenta but def true to the advertised color love the keyboard protector as well not sure about the complaints about the case not fitting , make sure to verify the model # but it fit my brand new # inch pro perfectly not made for
my mom and i purchased these and it was the perfect deal you get more for your money compared to in store the color is exactly like it looks and it fits my mac pro like a charm and i absolutely love the colors
i love the case cover its a very unique color . two things i did n't like was the fact that the the rubber for the keys as well as the slip were two different colors from the case cover other than those things the product is great
i 'm a teacher and our school district recently purchased mac book pros for our personal use several teachers in my building ordered this set in different colors i ordered the deep purple and it 's exactly how it was described worth mentioning that this will fit the mac book pro # . # inch but not the one with retina display this is meant for the plain mac book pro and if that 's what you have , it will fit the teachers in my building are a very colorful bunch thanks to this great bundle excellent price , excellent product , and probably the fastest shipping i 've ever had on amazon
this is my daughter 's and she is very particular about computer cases it is a case that she is happy to use it is not a geeky case is the way i understand it
the color is beautiful waited a long time for delivery though . everything fits perfectly the price was great my computer with the hard cover case fits nicely into the
i had been shopping around for a while for a solid case to protect my macbook pro but i really did n't want to shell out a lot of money although i was a bit skeptical about the quality of this product , i went ahead and ordered it because it was n't too expensive i have to say that i am pleasantly surprised at how great the quality of this is for how much i paid for it the case fits my macbook perfectly , the keyboard cover is great at keeping dust from getting into the keyboard and the sleeve is a perfect fit as well on top of all that , it looks really good too in regards to the screen cover , i personally did n't want a cover on my screen , so i can not comment on the quality of it since i have not used the product overall , i would definitely recommend this product for the great value and the seller for prompt delivery and great service will definitely be buying other colors in the future
had everything that was listed in the description arrived well wrapped and in good condition the only thing that was n't good was that the keyboard cover is not the same purple as the cover but i knew it beforehand
the frustration and disappointment we anticipated its arrival ; it was for my # year old daughter due to its poor design , even a slight imperfection will cause the entire thing to simply not fit we have two samsung chromebooks here and they are identical it did not fit on either i am taking it to ups to return it immediately i hope my refund is processed just as fast they 've got a lot of nerve selling this when they must know that a percentage of them will not fit due to its poor manufacture they probably think that the customer will blame himself this is a clear example of an overpriced product of poor quality
i emailed them that the bottom piece is not a perfect fit and i never got a response now i realize the top piece is not tight enough
i liked the look of this case for my chromebook and felt i needed the extra protection for carrying my device around so much however , the shell 's bottom casing made it difficult to click via the click pad because its bottom clip was pressing it down very often if not for that issue , i would have used this casing regularly my chromebook has had no issues since removing this casing
the case protects well it is stylish , and it was funny because after i bought it my classmates all started to have ipearl cases for their school-issued chromebooks a few <unk> later the issue is that the bottom plate cut into my wrist i had to remove it or i had <unk> marks on my wrist which were red and hurt the top was fine and i kept it on , but the bottom <unk> the product my classmates did n't seem to mind because their chromebooks all had a full set of armor on , but it really annoyed me
i read all the reviews before i purchased this product my chromebook # got delayed and i just received it yesterday tried it on , i was so disappointed because the corners did n't fit the product is nice but i 'm not sure whether i got a defected one or it was not for samsung chromebook #
this product is great i love orange and you should too in a more serious note it 's everything it says it is ; the only problem with is sometimes it <unk> the clicking feature on my touch pad , but the cover stays on great it might not help you survive the <unk> <unk> , but if you are just doing normal life things , then it 's a really good buy
it 's just plain old simple plastic , but over the silver of the chromebook , it looks great and the added rigidity it provides makes the rather flimsy chromebook feel sturdier and more substantial
this case fits the # . # chromebook very well it does n't add too much bulk to the computer , and it still fits nice and snug in my backpack the range of colors available is great and i am highly pleased with my orange one the stands on the bottom of the case come in handy would recommend to any chromebook user
my sister and i recently bought two chromebook computers and needed some sort of protection she likes orange and i like red - found both colors wow , are they durable i 've dropped my computer a few times and in every case , it 's come up unscathed
i 'm not sure the cover really protects against anything it 's more of a fashion statement than anything else if not for the two little legs that make typing a dream normally , after a certain amount of time typing my wrists ca n't help but get sore but with the incline this case provides that 's no longer an issue
i have been searching for a good and cute case for this particular laptop and i 'm so happy with this one the color is true to the description and it fits like a glove
i purchased this for my son for his school-issued chromebook it 's a great way to add some <unk> without making any permanent modifications to the device the case clipped on easily , stays in place , and is very light the air gaps in the bottom cover provide adequate ventilation
i reluctantly must say that the quality of this cover was not what i had expected the bottom piece fit the laptop snug , but the top seemed to have an issue around the two hinges the top portion of the case would prevent my laptop from opening properly , almost causing me to snap off a hinge in the process sending back for a refund
i does snap on easily , but it is more of a <unk> case versus any real protection - outside of surface scratches i 've had mine less than # months and a piece has already broken off it 's still on , but
clips on easily and stays on despite lots of <unk> and movement does n't interfere with any computer functions , well designed love the bright color , makes looking for my lap top in a pile of stuff easy !
got this about a year ago for my # year old 's chromebook it has been dropped , jammed into backpacks and lost under the car seat numerous time and somehow this case has survived it all granted it looks a little scratched but hey , the chromebook still lives and works fine what more do you want from a case
this samsung chrome book cover is exactly what i was looking for it fits perfectly and gives a great amount of protection and it even has a stand that comes in handy when you want to prop up your laptop overall great product
it 's not bulky and the retractable feet are truely helpful i did not really realize that it was a bit transparent but that 's my fault for not looking at the picture carefully i 've only had it for two days and i 'm loving how personalized the color makes my chromebook seem
great color , offers protection from scratches just what i needed have n't accidentally dropped the computer yet , so hoping that will offer at least some protection if i do drop it
this cover fits my daughter 's chrome book perfect easy to fit i have not seen any of these locally the shipping was quick and the cover arrived undamaged
this is my third ipearl mcover this red model as well as the green model fit as they should i found , as others have , that the blue one hangs up and puts stress on various points of the case these are not meant to be <unk> protection , but they offer some from scratches and other light damage works as designed , fits as it should
although it has a very nice design and <unk> price , the quality of this bag is very poor all the seams inside that bag are not sown properly and two side zippers did n't <unk> well
i got this backpack in october , and the zippers broke within # days of getting it then , in late december the straps completely broke off the backpack terrible construction and basically a waste of money
this bag is not made properly the handle hand is already coming away from the seems and the tag has # of the attachment to hold it on has come out its not a good laptop bag its just pretty . have it as a backpack work out very well my # in does n't <unk> \ <unk> it for style its great i wo n't recommend it for any thing
when i received this bag one zipper kept skipping teeth and the other was completed stuck the craftsmanship on this bag is poor with the lining getting in the way of the zippers , the <unk> at the top misshapen and one shoulder strap being wider than the other it looks great in the picture and i was so excited to receive it and start using it but it turned out to be a real disappointment i 'm sending it back . :
it 's much more square than rectangle ; looking at the picture it looks kinda <unk> when worn on the top middle <unk> in while the corners protrude outwards kinda of like a puffy pillow ... it looks <unk> on a grown man
i got this backpack because its super cute and <unk> , but also because it said it was a laptop backpack i was excited when it came and used it all through my first semester , but there are no organizer pockets and no safe place for your laptop nothing is padded at all . # weeks before <unk> the straps just ripped off so i 'm left lugging my backpack around like a baby with no means of repair if you never want to carry a laptop and do n't put more than # pounds in here , by all means go for it but if you want this to last for at least a year , do yourself a favor and search elsewhere
the zipper broke very quickly and was not high quality i was happy with it for about # months , until it broke on me -lrb- the zipper : the rest of the bag is not so bad , but it is not so good either
in the picture it looked like there was a padded pocket inside the backpack to store your laptop that is not the case there is just one large compartment the backpack was for my son and it works fine for him what i would n't like is that the backpack has a zipper on each side , instead of just one zipper it 's just a little more inconvenient to open and close the material is good and heavy
i was attracted to this because it 's not made out of synthetic fibers -lrb- i mean , come on , why does everything need to be made out of plasticy petroleum products ? ! -rrb- if you are uber <unk> , please note , it does have a nylon lining on the inside otherwise , it 's great when i bought it i noticed another review mentioning that the bag is essentially one big pouch this is true for the most part there are a few tiny pockets to be found , but what you 're getting is a really basic backpack with one big pouch the only other nit picky criticism i have for the backpack is that the big flap you see covering the top held down by zippers is also held shut with velcro that is not incredibly strong if the backpack were to get tossed around , smaller items like pens or pencils could easily fall out . edit - after # months , the zippers keep coming apart i have been repairing them with pliers but i am getting fed up and am going to replace this backpack with something that 's unfortunately made out of polyester dropping the rating to # stars since it did a nice job for a few months and it is otherwise a great backpack
the backpack is as described but it is too big the backpack is big and wo n't look nice unless it is completely full which will make it look bigger it 's ok but i wish i would have known this before i did the purchase
good bag so far hopefully the zippers will hold glad i made the purchase , light on my back , sturdy and i do n't have to remove when i sit down in a subway seat
feels great on the back , easy to access to the pockets while is on your back the laptop section is good for # inches , macbook so mine that is # , was kind of hard to fit
hey <unk> bag is great , stylish , and easy for light & medium load not much space to work with , and the compartment pocket outside i fit a small notepad i saw some loose strings hanging but nothing huge overall , pleased with this bag
