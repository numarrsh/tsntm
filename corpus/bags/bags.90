my daughter loves this product , both the case and key board cover she said the key board cover needed a bit of getting used to but she has kept it on since she got it
i wanted to get a different color case and this was perfect it fit my # inch macbook pro perfectly and the silicone keyboard cover is soft while typing one downside was that the keyboard cover is slightly <unk> in some of the buttons -lrb- looked like the pink paint did n't dry too well -rrb- but it 's minor compared to the price i paid great products for the price
i bought this and i love it once you put it on , it is hard to take it off , which is good because it means that it does n't come off easily
first : the color of the case is gorgeous , and so is the keyboard cover this keyboard cover was easy to type with , which is a hard to find quality in keyboards these days the package came # days early it came # days after i ordered it , with such great shipping my only complaint is the letter `` m `` on the keyboard is ripped : -lrb- but great <unk> recommend
this hard shell skin is great it accomplishes what i wanted -lrb- to protect and minimize scratches -rrb- and i am not a huge fan of the color pink but i was very please with the color once placed on my
i purchased this and didnt think it was going to fit my macbook pro # inch properly , but to my surprise it did ... the color is absolutely beautiful its made of rubber but it is a hard shell that offers much protection the keyboard skin is amazing , it transformed my keyboard and instead of having black keys i have pink keys and it looks like my computer was purchased this way everything about it is so natural looking i love it matter of fact i love it so much i bought my husband one in red
i love the color pink and i needed the case for my macbook pro # `` i am so happy with the case and the key board cover i just got my laptop # months ago and the apple store had cases , but did n't want to spend # dollars on a case so glad i got it , so my computer wo n't get hurt i love it because it is a great case for the price
aside from the terrible shipping experience , i am pleased with this product i was very skeptical about ordering this product , but the reviews changed my mind the keyboard cover goes on nicely it took me awhile to get the case on , but it looked wonderful when i was finished my macbook pro is now pretty in pink please make this product in blue , i would be the first to purchase it i will be uploading pictures of my mac so everyone can have an idea of what it looks like before ordering
this item fits my mac book pro perfectly it resembles the one that i bought at the mac store , which was more than double the price it is a nice , soft , bubble gum pink and adds a pretty touch to my mac , while protecting it the keyboard cover also fits great would definitely reccommend this product and seller
i 'll admit , i was worried that installing this case was going to be difficult however it just snapped right on it 's really a perfect fit and is super cute too
items arrived in # days including the holiday and weekend product is as described keys fit my keyboard perfect my husband thought it was covers for each <unk> 's how sleek the cover is not hard to type once keyboard is covered i love the case and how the light shines through the pink i will do business again
i constantly take my mac to work and it helps keep my entire laptop nice and safe i will say sometimes stuff gets caught between the actual laptop and the case , if it 's loose , it could scratch it up other than that , it 's super cute
exactly how it looks in the picture perfect fit for my older apple most cases are for the retina display apples in which case the skins are about # cm too
i really like this case , fits my macbook perfectly and comes with a nice cover for the keys it was a little tough at first to type on the rubberized keyboard but i got used to it
i really like this laptop cover but it did n't fit my computer : -lrb- i was given a refund very quickly and bought a different one the color is beautiful and it 's a nice case
i love the color and the keyboard cover fits great the apple still shows , which i love the case got here in # days i 'm so happy i made this purchase
this items was a replacement for the # st one i <unk> the # st one the bottom did not fit right this time the top does not fit right and the bottom is already cracking the mac never even leaves my desk spend the little bit more cash and buy a product of better quality
i recommend this laptop case it is a great color and i am certain it will protect my laptop , because it is a tight fit so tight i will probably need a jack hammer to get it off other than the fact of <unk> it is great
the color and fit for my laptop is perfect i 've had this for # or # months and it has a tiny crack on the top cover from when my laptop fell off the couch overall , this cover has done its job my computer is nice , clean , and working great the keyboard cover is also really nice it makes the keys squishy and fun to press it also serves to muffle the clicking sound they make the one downside to the keyboard cover is that it is not completely clear , so the keys look grey instead of their usual sharp black
the case looks good and feels good i get quite a few compliments on the color the keyboard cover also fits well and feels great the only complaint i have is that the case can be difficult to get off however , if you use a credit card to slide off the case , you can get it off easily without scratching your laptop for the price that you pay , it 's an excellent value
i used this product only # times i was surprised at how limited the padding was on the bag , but it was the first one i could find that would actually fit my # . # `` hp laptop , so i decided to keep it however , on the third use -lrb- and as i 'm walking down a flight of concrete stairs -rrb- the stitching holding the plastic ring -lrb- to which the strap attaches -rrb- gives way this causes my laptop to tumble down the steps ! ! ! ! needless to say , i am not a happy camper
the product is as described however i did not like how the hidden handles prevent the bag from closing all the way around when its in use that in my opinion is a design defect they should rethink that hidden handle thing and try
i bought this bag for my new laptop i was all <unk> to find something different and not so girly when i recieved it , it did n't come with the shoulder strap as stated i used the strap off my gym bag and that worked for about a month the part where the d ring was sewn was not secured enough and came off thank goodness that i had just picked it up from the floor and did n't fall very far , so my new laptop did n't break be careful if you purchase it and decide to put a shoulder strap on it you may not be as lucky as me
this bag looks great but i can not understand why the handle would be made so that you can not carry your lap top with the bag zipped using the handles the handles can only be used with the bag open i also did not get the shoulder strap
i enjoy having this case it is very beautiful but it 's so thin i feel like my laptop wo n't be protected very well there should be more padding to it
i purchased this bag for my daughters ' laptops the price was reasonable , they have nice designs , but there really is no place for the cord also , they do n't seem that sturdy , so i do n't let them use the strap to carry the laptops ; it 's only for protection
this is a perfectly nice case , but it 's not actually # . # inches was too small to zip around a # . # & # # ; think pad could not return by usps and we live in such a <unk> place that ups does n't come here , so eventually after quite some time w / customer service , amazon said keep it and we 'll refund that was nice , but would have preferred to get a case that fit
# & # # ; roocase fits my lenovo # & # # ; twist ultrabook very well one word of caution though , the height is a hair short however , if you stretch the case while zipping it up , it fits <unk> computer literally like a glove
i bought this for my lenovo thinkpad twist based on a review that said it fit that model for others considering this case for a twist , know that it is a tight fit and requires a bit of pulling it over the laptop in order to zip otherwise , the case is very nice with the handy side pocket to hold the converter cables , etc .
we ordered this product after christmas for two new # . # inch laptops the laptops fit perfectly inside this case the quality was excellent and the additional pocket made it extremely function very please with the cushioning as it adds protection at this price , most cases do not have the extra cushion love this product - - one of my best <unk> buys
this case is the perfect size and fit for my # inch hp the cord and mouse fit in the front pocket as well this allows for convenient access to the laptop and accessories
great looking case , feels well made price is awesome , the shipping was ridiculously fast i ordered it friday and somehow they delivered it on sunday i got it for a different laptop but it fit anyways it stretches a
this case did not meet my expectations this product is only made to be aesthetically pleasing even then it does not perform well at all considering how easily it scratches under the very <unk> use -lrb- i use a <unk> sleeve as well -rrb- if you dont want your macbook to be all scratched up this i going to create the same affect the case causes my # month old macbook pro to overheat at an alarming rate if you want to turn your $ # mac into a heated blanket by all means purchase this case , hope you have room in your junk drawer
i had high hopes for this case , as most reviews were very good the bottom piece was just a tad too short for me to hook the tabs onto the front and back of my mac i ended up having to force them for it to click into place , causing the corner to crack the fit is poor -- corners and curves have odd gaps the top piece now also has a crack in the corner , and i 've had the case on for about a week without ever dropping it overall the case is `` chunkier `` and less streamlined than the speck cases as a cheaper alternative , it 's passable i should mention the case i received did not have the `` osaka `` brand on the top piece as shown in the picture did not arrive as shown , and did not come in a box
for the price it was fine but the bottom of the case does n't fit very well the <unk> fits perfectly i would buy again at a reasonable price but it is not a high quality case
this deal was proceeded as expected , the date for delivery was good , the esthetic is very good i was expecting more about the durability on the product some little impact cracked the corner of it , which i expected to be more resistant
i bought this case for my sister for a gift with the intention of splatter <unk> it it was a great buy it was n't too pricey and was just what i was looking for i splatter painted it and she loved it
this osaka airy series clear case / cover for # & # # ; a # aluminum unibody macbook it fits and protect my macbook pro # `` and i can see my dj stickers and the apple light on the back i love it
i really have to say that this clear case is worth it it tops off my laptop since my mbp is sticker <unk> i love how it came with a nice micro fiber cloth so you can wipe your screen and case with it totally worth getting it i still wish it came in a box though but overall the case is nice and the shipping was fast
purchased this for my daughter so that she can personalize her mac it readily accepts stickers , permanent markers , glue and some kind of paint it also provides some level of protection for the computer i love it because she can personalize the pc without <unk> it for resale or use by others in the future
this does n't scratch my macbook at all and i love how it clips on the clear case is very chic and i have received several compliments i do n't like the product label on the top but for $ # feel much better about how well protected my new investment is i would n't expect this case to hold up if i dropped the computer or dropped something on it , but it keeps from getting scratched
i was very optimistic with this case as i thought all cases are created equal that could n't be farther from the truth it started cracking in the corners right away despite my being very delicate with my macbook i took it off and now i just hope i can <unk> it it was a waste of money do not let the pink fool you , do not buy this you will regret it
it is just ok for the price it is good , but my case already had a blemish out of the box pink color is not as bright as i had hoped
the plastic of the case does its job , but is not the most durable case i would recommend however , combining durable and fun colors is tough , especially when you know you 're not going to be putting the computer through too much <unk>
this is a great case that offers excellent protection for my macbook pro for a lot less money than the cases sold by apple the translucent pink color allows the apple logo to shine through it was a bit hard to get the top half of the case on but once i snapped it into place , it fit great and was nice and snug
ordered it and it shipped like lighting it has cracked after having it for a few months but i have # children and # under # so that 's no <unk> i may be ordering another one really soon : -
i quit using mine after a couple of weeks my concern was less ventilation and heat build up i have n't found what i like to protect , so i 've done without do n't want to take a chance of burning <unk> pro out
this case is what it is it protects you mac i have one on my other mbp as well and find them worth the money in terms of protecting your mac against little dents or scratches i actually dropped my mbp onto a hard surface once and the case helped to not damage my mbp i am not <unk> that it will always protect it from falling , but if you in doubt as to whether this is a good product or not , i would give it a thumbs up
i got this for the apple # `` macpro laptop it basically just snaps into place there is an issue on the lower piece where the openings for all of the usb , power connections , etc are this area of the case does n't even try to do all of the cutouts and instead the whole area is cut out the issue is it makes the corner somewhat flimsy and the tab that hold that corner to the computer does not hold on to the computer everything else seems to fit well the only other issue is the case is bulky and heavy the case seems to protect well against scratches but it is yet to be seen whether it would protect the computer in the event it was dropped
this acrylic snap on cover works well so far and makes the notebook a bit more comfortable to use on one 's lap protect it prior to snapping it on by using <unk> on both sides
i was frustrated at first because the # inch macbookpro is the only size that does n't have colorful cases for it i had the black case first , but after that broke -lrb- where the dvd drive is -rrb- , i wanted to try the clear the nice thing about this one is that it allows me to put fun decals using the apple sign i used the decal : tree macbook decal mac apple skin <unk> <unk> , and still professional enough to use during my meetings with clients
this case is great it makes the laptop `` bulletproof . `` : -rrb- mine fell of a moving car , and with the additional protection from a foam envelope and bicycle bag , there was no sign of damage also , i am a bit rough with my laptops , and this case takes all the beating i can dish out the downside is that it is heavy it is lighter than the laptop itself , but the laptop feels almost twice as heavy with the case on it could be because of the weight and increased thickness adding up especially when holding the laptop by the edge in a vertical position one can really feel the added weight i did get a # `` laptop however , so weight was never my primary concern i am happy with the case , but one should know about the added weight when deciding to get one
this was the second case i purchased for my # & # # ; macbook pro since apple has discontinued the # & # # ; , this case is a bit hard to find in stock , so the second has been placed in storage in the event the original needs replacing overall the case installed easy and tightly my wife -lrb- the user of this computer -rrb- is extremely happy with it , and has protected the computer from wear and scratches in the four months of daily use it has been in service
i had to return this model for an older version of macbook pro , nonetheless i am confident this is as good as the model i have this is for the newer models of # inch ... the super drive is on the right side and not the front the cover i have fits like a high quality hide glove , and it is very durable it is easy to remove and replace when you want to wipe or clean the laptop i would recommend speck covers for all laptops ... also , i would recommend to my friends and family members
this is a very good cover just what i wanted at a good price easy to put on and gives me peace of mind that my mac book will be protected from wear and tear and ordinary bumps and bruises
i have no complaints since it gives the laptop support and <unk> the only potential issue is overheating the computer , but if you use an external fan like cooler master you are fine
i wanted to keep my brand new # `` macbook clean , safe and <unk> the options for # `` models are far greater , and i had considered `` skins `` which offered protection of the top or the bottom this product supplies protection for both , allowing full functionality and access to all of the ports and drives , revealing the great look of the classic design it has a nice feel , is very sturdy , comes off easily but stays put as needed the computer still fits in its sleeve with the case on it was exactly the solution i sought for this device and i 'm very pleased with it
the back lining its very rough to the point that it can even damage your clothes , specially the fabrics with a high percentage of cotton the cotton fiber sticks to the back lining and you can even see the lint from your <unk> or t-shirt on the rough sticky lining fabric returning it asap
i had this bag only in nov # and it is now # march # , the bag already has the seams coming apart in # areas at the top i do not have heavy things in the bag and it is not carried around a lot because i have a car mainly , i just walk with it from the house to the car to work and back i really needed a sturdy bag but this is not it and i would not recommend anyone buying this
this backpack did n't meet my expectation b/c it did n't have enough pockets and zippers i am picky when it comes to my backpack i 'd like to have as many pockets and zippers as they could fit them those # side pockets and the front one do n't have any zipper whatever you put in may fall out and get lost and that 's not acceptable to me they also do n't have places to put a bottle of water it does n't feel as solid as my targus drifter ii backpack other than that , everything is good
over the years , we bought many backpacks for the kids it has many compartments , protects the laptop and very comfortable to wear better than any store bought -lrb- ie target or <unk> sporting goods -rrb- definitely try a targus !
i wanted a backpack which can hold my office laptop and my personal laptop -lrb- # . # inch -rrb- and this was perfect it has a pocket to hold tablets also over all very happy with this
overall a nice bag with some drawbacks i 've encountered over the years - lots of <unk> laptop compartment -lrb- fits series # `` ultrabook fine - good back support and <unk> <unk> - shoulder straps are starting to <unk> much room to store stuff as in competing <unk> laptop bottom
fits my laptop with no problem and many books has various compartments that are great for electronics , mobile , mp # , etc . it 's very easy on the shoulders and is perfectly reinforced overall its great would def . recommend it will be using it as a carry on for a trip to scotland
lots of room , and i like how long the zippers are i have used one like this for two years and love it the zipper wore out on the old one
such a great bag i take mine wherever i go and i travel a lot it has stood the test of time and is still going i love this bag so much i bought another one so if the first should ever start to go on me i will not have to worry about replacing it
i 've only had my backpack for a few weeks but so far i really like it and am very satisfied it is comfortable , all the little pockets are handy , zippers work well , straps stay adjusted and it feels durable i was skeptical as i 'd never heard of the brand but it seems to be a good deal
i got compliments all the time on this laptop sleeve that was until it fell apart in less than a month the shoulder strap broke off , then i was carrying it with the handles and then they broke off i really loved this laptop sleeve so i 'm really disappointed that it is n't higher quality . :
i ordered this exact laptop carrying case for my sony laptop , and i love the way it looks the carrying strap is very comfortable my problem is it was n't as durable as i thought it would be just from putting my laptop in the case , the bottom corners started to get holes in them where the fabric was worn away from the inside within the first month and a half it 's very pretty and comfortable , but i wish it would last longer
the design is pretty , but it 's just a basic bag i would recommend buying a woman 's <unk> carrier instead this does little to protect any item placed inside of it
i did n't want a plain old black laptop bag , i wanted something more artsy so , i ordered this bag but i was a bit disappointed because even though the design is very nice , the size of the bag is definitely a <unk> it 's very snug the neoprene material is nice , the handle is somewhat secure , but i also wanted to put my other hand under the bag just in case the handle breaks off there 's an outside pocket with a zipper but it is very small you ca n't really fit much in it , maybe squeeze in the power cord it 's a challenge trying to squeeze in my mac power cords , flash drives , pens and a small notebook the bag is not lined so there 's no structure ; the shape holds but it 's <unk> this bag will only fit the macbook pro # `` if that 's all you want to bring otherwise , you have to take your power cords and other small items in a separate bag
strap is comfortable and stays put i wanted something minimalist for just transporting a small laptop , a few papers/folders , and the power supply to and from work this fits that purpose fine
originally it did have a funny new smell however it faded in a few days otherwise the bag is perfect roomie enough for my computer it 's cords and my wallet and
not thickly padded but it does the job ... not recommended for protection against drops ... i bought this for my gf macbook # model so it was an ok investment ... she love it
i 'm writing not just about the product but the vendor this was an item i sorely needed but <unk> offered so many design alternatives that i had trouble deciding however , i 'm absolutely thrilled with my purchase and the fact that the products arrived earlier than anticipated
i bought this for my mac book air because i wanted extra space for the cord and an appointment book it is a great fit , soft fabric and a comfortable strap for my shoulder
pros : the padding is nice and thick , the handles are durable and strong and the extra pouch is huge ! the <unk> are very bright and <unk> , better then in the pic cons : it smells ... not terribly but there 's an order to it i would buy this case
i love this bag tremendously ! ! ! ! it 's gorgeous and i love the material just the right size for notes etc and my chrome book will be getting the larger version for my laptop i have other bags but this is the one i use
the colors of this case are great , it looks exactly as shown in the photo i can fit my macbook # inch and my ipad -lrb- case included , about an inch in width -rrb- it does not have a hard shell , which it states in the description , but all i needed was for transport
it 's beautiful , soft , light , and i use it every single day the handles are sturdy and the outside pocket super useful for <unk> i can really stretch this thing if i want to shove my laptop and some folders and my ipad and <unk> it goes right back to its shape after i take the things out i get compliments on this bag wherever i take it and it 's so light and easy to grab , i take it everywhere
i got this for my macbook pro back in january the laptop fits perfectly into the case and the case itself is small enough to fit into the laptop compartment of my backpack i also like how there 's a side compartment for your charger , which is very convenient since i always take it with me i would definitely recommend this to anyone that needs a case for their laptop plus there 's alot of <unk> you can choose from
i purchased the # . # & # # ; laptop sleeve with extra side pocket for my new macbook air the sleeve is well made , attractive , and affordable i have n't used it often , but it appears to be very sturdy
i bought this bag for my daughter to transport her laptop computer to school and from class to class it broke at the grommet that holds the shoulder strap the very first week she had it her computer was dented up , but thankfully , the neoprene sleeve did protect it we returned it for a refund and the company was great about that , but that would have been little <unk> if we 'd had to replace her brand new laptop
this is a very pretty sleeve for a laptop but provides no protection at all the material is thin and very stretchy i do use this on occasion but u always worry about my laptop and am extra careful not to bump it or set it down to hard i wish they would consider making this in a more protective manner
the laptop sleeve was exactly what i wanted it shipped fast also , however , there is an industrial smell to it , that i do n't care for i will be keeping it just wanted to let you know it smells
holds both the laptop and a narrow portable lap desk very snug fit , and no compartment large enough to accommodate the charging cord or a small mouse ; it would be great if they offered a bag that hooked on to accommodate these items
i purchased this product for my daughters new laptop so she can carry it to school protected she has had another case that she had almost never used and every time i see her transporting her laptop it is in this case and that tells me she likes this one
as many others have written in their reviews , the color is more purple than blue i was a little upset about this because i ordered the skin and mouse to match other than that , my # . # inch laptop fits perfectly inside and my charger fits in the outside pocket it came with the strap as well the sleeve with computer inside fits into my other bag that i have when i want to carry other things , such as notebook
nice case for travel , protects well for casual use , but the color is n't as pretty pictured and does n't match the skin cover i purchased to match the actual case is more on the <unk> side rather than the bright blue shown
my daughter just got a new laptop and requested a sleeve with a handle for christmas - i looked at many different ones and ended up getting her the same one that i have the print is very nice - feminine but not over the top frilly - i think she will like it - it has all the options she wanted
this item fit my laptop perfectly . the color is rich and as pretty as the picture i am able to carry my mouse and power cord in the zippered pocket
i gave this sleeve # stars because not only did i think it was beautiful but it is also very well made i also think the price was good so i would recommend this laptop sleeve to anyone looking for a good product that is priced just right !
this is a wonderful carry case for my laptop it fits snugly and has the side zippered pocket for the charger and mouse it 's attractive as well i like the shoulder strap so it 's hands-free which allows for carrying other luggage my daughter saw it and is going to order one
this is a great laptop sleeve it is lightweight yet seemingly quite durable - and comes with the optional shoulder strap , unlike other laptop <unk> being sold on amazon -lrb- i viewed a lot that made you purchase the shoulder strap separately . this perfect fits the # . # `` lenovo i 'm sending to my mother-in-law it 's a nice snug fit that will keep the laptop secure as she travels from her car to her office , and then back again
this sleeve is very pretty and fits my # . # `` compaq perfectly it 's a little darker than the picture makes it seem , but still bright and vibrant everything seems well stitched and stood up to some tugging no problem the handles and shoulder strap are nicely padded and comfortable i like that the shoulder strap is removable and easily adjustable please bear in mind that this is a sleeve , not a true ` bag ' . there 's not much room in the main compartment for anything other than your laptop the additional front pocket provides <unk> of room for your charger and mouse , and maybe a couple other small things if you want to cart books or purse essentials , this is n't the right bag for you
loved the layout , pockets , etc . , and black and white design was feminine yet professional but the bag was a beast more suitable as a weekender suitcase ca n't imagine it full and toting it around on a daily basis i was bummed the next size down is too small for my needs
this bag is very pretty i bought this bag in both the <unk> and <unk> the <unk> is the best looking these bags are nice , but i have to complain about the price . $ # is too high i think $ # - $ # would be more appropriate also , i read somewhere that someone said they got a larger laptop in it than what was listed as the max well , i can definitely say that the listed specs are correct , and the opening does not accommodate laptops bigger than # ``
bought this for school but has plenty of room for pc , books and even your lunch it has alot of space and is very cute has several pockets in the front compartment
dakine never fails to impress me this is a great quality bag with lots of little extras if i had one problem it would be that the strap is a bit too short though i am # & # # ; # and as far as <unk> go it is longer then most love the back slot to fit over luggage more colours please amazon one for every outfit
perfect size , extremely functional , exactly what i was looking for hold everything i need , is not too big or small , securely closes i will only ever buy dakine bags from now on
