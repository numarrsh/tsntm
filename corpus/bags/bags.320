you get what you pay for the felt string fell off after a couple weeks the cover looks good and provides the amount of protection i need for my macbook air
first , some context - this is a cheap cover for your macbook air the material feels cheap , the little strip of velcro is cheap - nothing about this screams ` quality ' ! ! ! having said that , it 's good for the price the little red string fell off of mine after a few weeks of use , but it 's fairly pointless anyway - the velcro underneath does more to hold the flap closed than the string does anyway the macbook air is protected nicely in the case , which is the most important point and it 's absolutely as slim as it could be - there is n't any <unk> space or unnecessary bulk so - # stars if the string had stayed on it would get # stars the review is price based - for the price , it 's a good deal
i really like this case and would definitely buy a new one but keep in mind this is n't a hight quality case that will last forever it is a good looking sleeve that is n't that expensive and will last a few months the string gets caught on the velcro from time to time and starts to fray the red button toggle to wrap the <unk> around starts to fold over and get floppy that being said i 've had mine for a couple of months and still really like it
provides just enough protection for the computer without being too <unk> in a backpack for traveling very easily the product is put together well with the seams and velcro but the string to wrap around the button came off quickly all in all though , great product
i was unable to get my # . # notebook all the way in which is such a shame i would love it if i can find this in a slightly larger size
i ordered this case for my daughters new computer it was too small so , instead of returning it i have found another use for it : -rrb- the color is just beautiful i should have read the dimensions more closely if they make a larger size , i surely purchase another for the price
i bought this based on the great reviews i 'm so surprised how many positive reviews there are now that i 've seen the product it is poorly made and of very bad quality the zipper barely works you have to pull so extremely hard to get the zipper to move , basically make it unusable
my daughter 's # & # # ; macbook air does not fit well in this at all it is a struggle to get it to fit the construction is not so great either the zipper gets stuck would not buy again
both zips failed immediately i nearly had to tear the thing apart just to <unk> my laptop from inside so i could return this piece of crap for refund if you 're going to cheap out , get the amazonbasics sleeve superior in every way
the case is a good fit and seems to be decent quality , but the zipper broke almost immediately it 's now just a fancy sleeve to protect the laptop when i put it in another bag skip this one and keep looking
it was nice until my zipper got all messed up . . it 's a real pain to deal with like if i move the zipper halfway both ends will be unzipped it 's nice looking though . i have one side which does n't get caught when i
i bought this for my # in ultrabook laptop and wish the fit was a little more snug i like the front zipper but it is n't really big enough for the charger it works just fine but i will probably buy another one once i find a better one
the color of this sleeve is more of neon green in person the zipper got stuck on the second day of use also it is very hard to fit my macbook air # . # -lrb- with cover from the same company -rrb- in the sleeve
very satisfied with the exception of hand held straps one immediately broke , so am doing so home repair great value for the money would like a pink option for girlie girls
purchased hoping for something less & # # ; business <unk> & # # ; for my home ultrabook fits the lenovo yoga # . # & # # ; - just barely the color is much more obnoxious in real life however ; good quality , sturdy
the case does not properly fit the white macbook while it does accomodate the width of the unit , you are not able to zip the case as the height of the case is lacking outside of that seems to be a great value and quality seems comparable to other brands
the color is great , and i love that it has a pocket in the front that fits my laptop charger and other odds and ends like several other reviewers mentioned , it does have a strange odor when you take it out of the package but this eventually goes away
i bought this for my # . # `` macbook air the item arrived * early * and as described fits my computer -lrb- which has a plastic case on it , also from ipearl -rrb- well , with a little wiggle room but nothing that feels insecure the front pocket fits both the charger and the external cd drive -lrb- an apple usb superdrive -rrb- well color matches the image , and the pouch has an interior `` lip `` to protect my precious baby from zipper scratches -lrb- i 've never had that actually happen but it 's a nice detail -rrb- the whole thing keeps my laptop safe in my backpack or carry-on and keeps the peripherals bundled with it - no more <unk> for the charger and outlet adapter in airports my order also included a silicon keyboard protector which was a nice touch a great deal on what thus far seems to be a great product
fits my lenovo yoga # really well and i can put the charger and mouse in the side pocket the material is not the best quality , its smell is not very pleasant but hopefully it will stop soon
i looked through stores trying to find something for my macbook air that was n't # or more dollars i finally found this on amazon it works great easy to use and its a nice color it did arrive with a crease in the sleeve that i 'm not sure will go away , but i could n't care less it also has this new car smell with a tinge of headache <unk> chemical smell i could n't be in the same room with it for the first few days i had it it smells better now though
it is n't the thickest padding available , but still good for the price the color is very bright and eye catching the extra sleeve pocket on the outside is handy for small items
i shopped around a lot before settling on this case it has a little more room in it than i thought -lrb- it 's not super snug -rrb- , but that 's okay b/c i will be using the front pocket to transport my charger sometimes i did n't know that the case had handles that are hidden inside the bag , which i really like so i can carry the macbook in my arms , or i can use the handles i like the option the color i got is a bright green ... and is exactly as it appeared in the photo
this sleeve is exactly what i was looking for to use for travel this summer i like the extra pocket on the outside ; however , i doubt i use it for the cords as my cords are way too bulky for this
i bought this case and placed in another case acase faux leather book cover clip on case for apple macbook air mc # ll/a and # . # -inch laptop , black -lrb- <unk> # -lrb- i really love and recommend this case by the way however , the second case does not protect the corner edges within a month , the corners of the first case have all cracked , broke or shattered i <unk> # -in- # purple rubberized hard shell case cover for # . # `` a # apple macbook air and keyboard cover -lrb- a # <unk>
this case was delivered on time but was horrible looking it came looking like it was used when i ordered it new the top cover had little smears on it that made it look dirty and it was almost impossible to get on i would not recommend this case at all
the shipping was super fast , which is the only <unk> thing i can say about this product the product <unk> is super cheap quality and it came chipped all over , specially in the corners i live outside the <unk> so i couldnt return it the case comes with a screen protector that fits -lrb- also good -rrb- and a keyboard protector that does not fit i gave this product to a friend as a present and it was the worst decision i 've ever made dont buy this product better quality at top case
it was good for about three four months , but eventually it started to break apart which pissed me off the bottom piece of the case cracked and broke so i was left only with the keyboard cover and the hard case top and of course now the top part has started to crack the keyboard cover however is okay i still use it it 's started to curl up on the sides i guess because its getting old but it has n't effected the ability to not use my key board in anywhere the purple color is pretty but after using it for a while some of the letters start to fade out but i guess i should not have expected too much being that it 's just plastic eh , no i say just splurge on a case that will keep you going long run
the case itself is nice but it was very hard to get on i felt like i was going to break my computer trying to snap the thing on once i actually got it on it looked nice and does it 's job
i was disappointed in the color of the case ... as on the photo it looks like a neon purple , which is what i was wanting , but it 's more of a pastel lavender color
i ordered along with the laptop and got it faster than expected it looks exactly like the picture it snaps on easily the key board cover fits perfectly but a few rows of keys letters do n't match up overall i 'm satisfied with my purchase
the color and case were exactly what i ordered , except the clear screen protector was very difficult to put on without bubbles -lrb- perhaps there is a trick i do n't know ? -rrb- and , a big thing : the hard case was broken when i opened it the bottom back of the hard case , to be specific , was chipped in a very obvious manner , and i could not find the pieces in the mail at all it did however still fit , and i ended up not using the screen protector at all
the case is well made , the zipper is on half the case and the other half is sewn together , making it easy to get the slide and tripod very easy to get into the case
should fit any make # `` portable screen fyi if your screen is # `` you should be fine i bout an <unk> screen which was total size of # `` and it fit fine
good quality , very durable i am very happy with the purchase fits my # inch screen perfect what can i say it 's from <unk> their products have always been good
this is a really neat product i is very travel friendly it is easy to set up also i travel around doing presentation and it is a great companion to my projector i use it in very small spaces as well as much larger rooms i even set it up in my living room for the kids to watch home videos
i have been an <unk> boy all my professional life , and i carried screens around all the time without a bag -- when they <unk> to my <unk> now that i 'm <unk> and bought my own screen , i like to protect it in the bag heck , i can even strap it to my car roof rack and not worry about it getting damaged this one folds out of the way when you are using the screen and appears to be well-constructed
this bag is a must have for those that travel it really covers and protects your projector screen especially those that use this screen for private functions where the screen is suppose to look nice and new for <unk> elegant <unk> it will definitely keep your screen from scratches or dents i highly recommend you to get this note : though this zipper bag states it is for a # inch screen , mine is a # inch screen and it fit perfectly , plus enough room to spare
this screen was in perfect condition it was easy to set up and the picture was crystal clear i would recommend this product to anyone looking for a <unk> screen easy storage as well this seller got the screen to us in the promised time frame we use this in our teaching series , conferences and church activities
this bag is made of good material it does the job to put the projector screen in place you need to have this one is you are going to travel with your screen it just makes life easier and <unk>
i was n't sure i wanted , or needed the screen bag , until i used it the first time , and since my screen stays clean and dust free , and protected from minor scratches
i bought this but still debating if i should keep this or not i like the overall design , but i do n't like the weight # . # lbs is too heavy vs others for instance , their same bland <unk> # weight only # . # lbs i only paid $ # plus tax but i am still not sure if i should keep this or not
the bag is good quality and has plenty of room for my son to carry his macbook with cords and his notebooks , pens , etc . to college it is easy to carry and light enough to lug around campus all day
the <unk> from wenger is the best laptop case available in today 's market it is quality <unk> the extra space and compartments are functional the outside is exceptionally durable and the inside affords may options quality all the way
i love the bag i got for my daughter it was a christmas gift to go along with her new laptop my aunt saw the bag last weekend and liked it so much , she ordered one too
<unk> guys , though the estimated time of delivery was # working days but i got it on # rd day i love this bag for it 's practicality with good space & pockets the design is good one attribute that i liked the most , this bag is very durable & strong trust me most good branded bags are not competitors in this aspect i love this bag and quite happy to have it
this really is a very well-constructed bag the interior and exterior materials seem as if they will be very durable , as do the zippers and handle i consider the fact that it 's a little heavier -lrb- noted by a previous reviewer -rrb- than other choices kind of obvious , because it is more durably made i 'm not buying a <unk> here the contents are going to weigh much more than the bag the main area is completely taken for length by a # . # , and there are # other pouches in that compartment opposite the <unk> strap the expanding front pocket has # smaller organizational pockets of varying sizes , and there is also a lined zipper slot between the two main compartments the non-slip material on the shoulder strap is nice the only negative i can see is that the strap is not <unk> nor removable
the case is a perfect fit , but after a couple months of use , it is beginning to fall a part specifically , the liner , cover , and padding are all separating from one another around the the top
i like the product design , but i did n't realize it would leave a red stain on the <unk> it wo n't rub off and i have tried everything so this $ # cover ruined my $ # shield it probably would have stained my macbook were it not for the film protection
this was great for the first few months of use , but now the entire lining is coming apart with very modest usage therefore , this is a waste of money a cheaply built product
i bought black and love it until the cover peeled off the both ends are stitched well but the mouth of it is just glued . . and after a few month , i guess the glue is <unk> .
i love this case at first glance simple , light , protective after about # months , however , the case started falling apart where the inner lining separated from the outer lining i do n't beat this thing up either , it largely is protected in my bag , yet it still is coming apart at the internal seams
edit : after only a few months , while staying in my messenger bag for the most part , is falling apart the internal fabric is peeling off and threads are fraying the outside material is also very easy to damage it has annoying knicks and scrapes from light use i would no longer recommend this sleeve unless you only need it for one month i got this for my mid- # `` macbook air , and i am loving it looks awesome , feels awesome , provides plenty of protection , wipes off the outside of my air when i remove it , and it 's just generally awesome the macbook air is extremely sexy and this sleeve does not <unk> the air 's <unk> , but rather <unk> it
i do n't know if my case was unusual , but it has an extremely unpleasant odor i have been trying to air it out for the past two weeks , and the odor is still very strong -- a very strong sort of <unk> smell i assume it 's something that is used in <unk> the leather i took it with me on the train , and when i took out my laptop , i felt embarrassed that someone might think it was me personally giving off this nasty scent and the smell continues to <unk> in my backpack , long after the case itself has been removed apart from this smell -lrb- and i am still considering returning it if it does not go away in the next week -rrb- , the case is nice i love the color -lrb- orange -rrb- , and it fits my macbook air perfectly
bought this last year for my new air fits well and adds protection without bulk or weight , but the top part is already coming apart the rest of the case is fine and can probably last much longer , so that 's the one serious design flaw
this is the most compact sleeve for a macbook air # & # # ; the best for <unk> need , not <unk> the volume like other pc cases looks ok , fits good , easy to put in and out not much complain , but the material is little <unk>
i have used this case for almost exactly a year -lrb- purchased feb # , # -rrb- and it now need to be replaced the liner is separating from the exterior in the <unk> area in the middle of the rear half other than that it has been a great case i like the fact that i can slide my air in and out without having to open anything and it offers reasonable protection while remaining slim i just wish it had lasted longer on to the next case i guess
i loved this sleeve ! it was just what i was looking for ... then i saw it was starting to come apart at the corners from being in my backpack
i like this sleeve but it smells horrible when you get it -lrb- like chemicals -rrb- i put a bounce sheet inside it for # months to try to help over come that smell now the stitching is coming apart in one corner the <unk> is i see they have raised the price from $ # to $ # or a # % rise i do n't think it 's worth it
i got an orange one , which it still has the funny smell that comes with it i do n't know if it only applies to some specific colors or every single one
great case from all the other ones i 've seen for the air love the simple design and it fits the new # rd gen # `` macbook air perfectly its made of synthetic leather but the material does n't look cheap it 's thin but also has enough cushion to protect your laptop from being banged around in a <unk> gave it one start down because the color is n't exactly like the one in the picture it is not pastel pink like the other reviewer says , its more of a bubble gum pink i think i would 've like it better if it was lighter overall , i 'm very pleased with the product
it will protect your laptop from debris and direct impact but not indestructible of course i use it in my messenger bag and has done what i expected of it completely the inside seam has only minimally worn -lrb- ~ # cm -rrb- and its hardly noticeable i use it for my samsung ativ book # plus which was designed almost <unk> to the mac air and works great for either the cover is pretty padded so i 'm not really worried if it dropped # ' or less while in it , plus it not too padded and takes up about the same amount of room as the labtop the padded cover has a perforated texture -lrb- feels nice -rrb- but does n't continue to this inside easy to take out laptop and inside texture does n't allow it to slip right out i 'd recommend this to anyone just wanting a pocket for their device in a bag
fits the air well , snug enough to be assured it wo n't slip out inadvertently simple clean design , nice quality , all it has to be to protect the air , at a reasonable
i use this with the first generation macbook air -lrb- mba -rrb- and it works well i have to slide it in front side first since the hinge slide of the the mba is a little too think to fit comfortably i like the convenience of a sleeve as compared to zippered pouches i have used on my macbook pro this sleeve will at least protect the unit on three edges and both the top and bottom which is all i was looking for it fits the bill for me of providing basic protection with little bulk or weight which is why i bought the mba to begin with i did not given it # starts because small defect on the open edge of the sleeve which i would not expect for this price
just got this love the color , it 's a really pretty pastel pink , i 'll try to keep it clean ! it was abit thicker than expected , my macbook air seemed alittle cramped inside and i kept trying to push it to the end of the sleeve but i guess it 's made that way so that the laptop wo n't slip out all in all , it 's well made , good quality , and great color
this was the least expensive , best looking case i could find for a mac air i 've been using it for over two months on a daily basis and it looks like its in good condition it has n't stained , scratched or been marked up at a couple of places where the leather meets leather its looking like it might start to separate a bit of crazy glue should fix that in no time frankly , for the price , the quality is surprisingly good
i have # of these . my first one as it started wearing down and fraying i <unk> up with electric tape and use it for my macbook pro retina # . then i got a new sleeve for my old macbook air its stiff and snug very minimal and makes a good mat to put the macbooks on when i work . pricey , but best thing ive found so far , sleek and
i am leaving this review to address what other reviewers said , namely that this sleeve does not fit late # -lrb- # nd gen -rrb- # `` macbook airs this sleeve fits my air just fine seems like a nice product overall , too
this sleeve is a perfect fit for my # -inch macbook air -- like a glove the felt inside protects very well if i had purchased from apple or another retailer , it would have been twice the price i could n't be more pleased
looks great , and is a perfect fit for the new # `` mac air -lrb- # -rrb- though , be aware that there is n't room for the charger this is only for the laptop , but it fits perfectly quality seems good , with just enough padding
the sleeve is great , fits the air perfectly and lets me carry it in another bag without problems lovely , happy pink color bubble gum is a good description for the pink as it reminds me of the color of <unk> gum - sans <unk> coating my only complaint -lrb- and it is not a big deal -rrb- is that the pink can get dirty fast or rather , it shows the dirt quite well as for quality , the sleeve is well made , has good basic protection -lrb- a bit thicker than i originally though it would be -rrb- , and the stitching is even and strong also , the air is easy to take in and out of the case without having to grab the computer too hard , but the textured inside ensures that the air does not slide out well thought out design i will definitely buy one again if needed
this fits my # macbook air nicely the computer does n't slip out , and the cover protects the finish it 's especially useful for air travel , since it allows me to throw my computer in a security screening bin with keys , coins , and other items that would otherwise scratch up my laptop further , the stitching looks to be of very high quality , and i expect it to last for the lifetime of my computer two -lrb- very minor -rrb- things to note : first , the lime green is a lighter shade than what is depicted in the pictures second : my cover is a little bit smelly inside whatever the interior suede was treated with seems to have <unk> around it 's hardly <unk> , because i do not spend much time with my nose in my laptop sleeve
the sleeve is perfect for my laptop since i often need to throw my macbook air in my bag and run it looks nice and gets the job done i also use it when i need to carry my laptop around the office i do find that the butter <unk> color gets dirty very quickly , but i like the sleeve so much i may just get a second one in a new color it protects my laptop from the junk in my bag , and it 's cute & classic looking
this is a great looking sleeve for the macbook air the orange looks great and does a decent job of protecting the exterior of the laptop from scratches the only minor issue i have , is that i ca n't keep the mba plugged in while in the sleeve i love to have the laptop in the sleeve while its sitting on my desk , but i ca n't have it charging at the same time its a minor annoyance , but definitely something to think about
... my wife stole mine . : d i guess she likes it protects but at the same time is not bulky slips into her briefcase w/o problem looks good when she pulls it out and lays it on the conference table colors are pleasant and it 's easy to wipe clean i will try again
this is a great case i 'm using the # mba and the case fits it like a glove it is a nice slip case to keep your mba safe from your other gadgets if you put it in a bag , backpack , or anything else it might <unk> a fall a bit , but this is more of a case for protecting minor bumps and contact with other devices as a college student this is perfect for my backpack as other reviewers said , it does smell a little weird when you first get it , but so do new shoes it 's not a bad smell , and it did n't rub off on my backpack or the mba overall , it 's been a great case it 's a lot like a pouch or sleeve case , but with extra padding to make it the only case you need -lrb- without adding bulk ! -rrb- definitely worth the price
excellent product ; a minimal sleeve for my macbook air it hardly takes up additional space and holds the laptop firmly without additional closure while offering sufficient protection it is convenient to take the laptop out of my bike bag without taking out the sleeve , for example , at airport security checkpoints
i was looking for something lightweight , fashionable and sleek , and this fit the bill and then some unlike fabric or neoprene , this sleeve has an <unk> exterior , does n't snag , and feels sturdy i like the <unk> lining , too my macbook air fits in snugly , without any chance of slipping out of the case
considered getting the burnt orange model - i read reviews that stated it had a horrible smell and i looked a the incipio website and the color was too bright - it was n't consistent with the color on amazon i did n't want to take a chance , so i got the green it has a soft inside that keeps the laptop from getting scratched up i really like the color , and looks good in my leather briefcase no weird smell
early reviews of this sleeve were all about how the case did n't fit properly more recent reviews seem to show that this has been worked out my sleeve just arrived today and it fits like a glove looks like something <unk> 's gloves would be made from , <unk> , black and bad @ $ $ exactly what i wanted : lightweight , ultra thin , minimum features -lrb- no buttons , straps , pockets -rrb- only way it could improve is by allowing the opening to flare a bit more to allow for charging while in the case but not really an issue for $ # this is a terrific sleeve that will keep nuisance knicks and scratches from happening not sturdy enough to prevent damage from a major drop or accident
i was looking for a cover to avoid any type of <unk> on mba this one was definitely the best i would not help you if you drop it , however if you tossed on you backpack as myself , it will avoid any damage it also have a great look and fit perfectly with the mac i highly recommended
really cute way to protect your macbook air like in the pictures , there is one side of the laptop exposed , so if you are prone to dropping things ... you may want to look for one that zips up do n't put any other cover on this -lrb- unless it 's a <unk> -rrb- because the air fits perfectly as is -lrb- does n't slip out -rrb- nice padding and really cute -lrb- looks like a organizing folder -rrb- would recommend to <unk> friends
i 've had this sleeve -lrb- grey -rrb- for a week it fits the # `` mba perfectly the material appears to be good and build quality looks excellent i would highly recommend
i was worried that my mba might slip out of it easily but apparently it never happened even once after these # months looks good , does what it does and it 's really slim
what a great sleeve for my new macbook air ! it just fits like a glove and it does n't add much weight to it kind of like carrying around a note pad binder i will attempt to use this sleeve to protect the air going through tsa security i hope it works i do n't see why it would n't as it has no zipper , metal parts , etc . and it will make my life easier this is a great sleeve for the macbook air
i 've only had this backpack for about a month and i 've been very gentle with it -lrb- as it houses my new macbook -rrb- its tearing at the bottom corners at the seems i like how the backpack looks , but i 'm pretty disappointed in the build i might be able to fix it , but i 'm probably going to end up replacing it soon
i 'm # ' # & # # ; and # pounds based on other reviews , i thought i should have ordered a large size well , the large was way too loose on me it did n't feel secure on my back at all , and the chest strap did n't come close to tightening up the slack even worse , it arrived rolled up tightly and packaged in what appeared to be a cheap trash bag seriously , i thought it was used merchandise though the medium may have worked better for me , i decided that i 'd start over in my search instead
everyone comments on how awesome this back pack is fits my samsung series # inch ultrabook perfectly along with accessories back pack is constructed reasonably well one of the # zippers on the main pocket shipped stuck and can not get unstuck , but there 's another zipper so i was n't too worried about it
i live in a dangerous city and laptops are stolen often when someone goes out with a backpack since most of the time the weather is cold , i use a coat i put only my macbook in the back pack and i wear it inside the jacket and no one notices that i am carring a laptop i wish i had bought a black one since it does not look good with my formal clothes , but everyone liked the back
it is just what i expected if your looking to just carry a laptop and a few small items then this is just the bag fits tight against your back if you wear under a baggy shirt or jacket you ca n't even tell you have it on great if your going through rough parts of the city
this is the perfect laptop carrier neopreme material offer just the correct amount of stretch to fit <unk> , & notepad in main compartment the side compartment hold power cord , mouse , and usb <unk> adapter the pocket in the shoulder strap is perfect for mp # player and earphones choice of size is important to understand that it 's your size in addition to laptop whatever shirt size you wear choose same size back pack my husband , main carrier of unit . is # ' # # s and the large fits best to give him a little wiggle room for the straps we also have a medium and although it fits him he prefers the comfort level of the large size well worth ever penny we paid for it consider any of this product line for quality products
i read reviews before i got this product so i somewhat figured that i would have to use the lint roller when i first got it i repeatedly lint rolled this <unk> and it would continue to shed i decided to use the product anyways for the last month when i decided to upgrade the ram on my macbook i <unk> the innner components and there was black fuzz everywhere from this product the idea of all th fuzz being trapped inside the cpu fan and other components makes it difficult for me to justify using it i do like the uniqueness of the sleeve but if there was another material used for the inner part of the bag i would he perfect
i thought that this case would be cute and functional that it is , but the fuzzy lining <unk> little bits go into all crevices of the laptop perhaps they do n't do any harm , but i suspect that there are better choices
the <unk> is a great option for your # `` macbook - if you do n't mind a little extra cleaning with it 's burlap appearance , the applesac is definitely one of the more unique and <unk> case options around the outer burlap and inner <unk> has held up very nicely and after # + years of use , it still looks new the flap at the top is held closed by a strong velcro strip , which has collected some fuzz and dust over time , but remains secure a large pocket on the rear side offers some storage for a limited selection of wires and accessories it 's enough to hold your power cable and maybe one more similarly sized item my main gripe is that the inner fleece , while providing a soft <unk> of protection , will inevitably shed you 'll probably find yourself cleaning stray <unk> off your hardware more than you 'd like however , in my experience , almost all of any `` shedding `` remains on the outside of the closed notebook
i really liked the cover it was easy to get my computer in and out i do n't know how well it would stand up to everyday use because my dog ate it the second week i had it
this is a great sleeve for my macbook pro , and i do n't regret buying it , but it has a little bit less padding than i had imagined if i were to drop the sleeve with the computer in it , it would surely damage my laptop the appearance is unique and fantastic ; i love the ruggedness of it and the fact that i 've yet to see anything like it it 's great for carrying the computer around by itself or as extra padding while carrying it in my backpack the pocket is small and not large enough to carry the power source with extension i often use it for a cd , small notebook , or my cell phone the only other drawback is that the sleeve itself has stretched a little now -lrb- a few months after buying the applesac -rrb- and no longer fits like a glove nonetheless , i remain pleased and think that this was well worth the money spent -- for aesthetic , as well as practical , reasons
when i first took this out of the package i thought : `` <unk> ... i spent how much on this ? but i have used it for over a month now and i love it it 's very nice looking and it 's doing a great job of protecting my mac and its cord in my backpack many people have remarked on how cool it is , and i love it enough to keep it on the desk even when it 's not in use a very nice product that i would recommend to anyone
i love the case i get comments on it all the time , and it 's something that stands out in the world of limited apple accessories , so you really can `` think different `` from the rest of the crowd the soft inside did shed a little at first , but not to the point of being problematic now that i 've had it for a while , the durability is proven , and even the outer pocket is durable i use it to carry everything from notebooks and pens , to my phone and ipod
i got this for my white # `` macbook -lrb- # -rrb- and it fits really nicely i was a bit skeptical at first when i got it , but i love it more and more each day the bumpers are very useful , i feel that they do in fact help to protect the edges of my macbook when bumped also , the zippers are very smooth and do not scratch laptop thick , sturdy , cool , no regrets in getting this case
i 've had this case for over # years now , and its still in great condition , and my laptop still looks new it protects it nicely with a nice squishy foam . and its in my fave colour
this product is great if you are looking to fit your mac into it the design of the bumper sleeve helps absorb a lot of bumps and bruises from daily accidents i bought the sleeve in purple which catches people 's attention it fits my # inch mac perfectly and is light a plus is that you do n't have to take your laptop out when your going through airport security
