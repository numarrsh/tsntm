even though this is an older style it still works just fine for me i love the small pocket on the top for carry a mouse and a phone charger , extra batteries , etc . an there is a zip up pouch inside the main compartment for small items as well rock solid , you ca n't wear it out i travel # - # weeks per year and this makes every one of those trips fits under airplane seats and in the overhead bins
this is my second swissgear computer backpack i had purchased a very similar one for myself a year ago , which i loved , and i ordered this one for my spouse it is very well constructed , especially top handle , which stands up well to abuse it has great and well-organized space
great product , great price and great service from amazon and <unk> the synergy swissgear backpack is a quality product that retails for as much as $ # in common retail outlets why pay high retail when you can save $ $ from a quality merchant like <unk> this backpack really rocks i compared it to another backpack of the same brand but different series at a local discount warehouse that was selling for the same price the difference in quality was incredible turns out the local `` club `` was selling a cheaper made import that just did n't measure up to the quality in the synergy made with lots of useful pockets and high quality zippers that will keep you organized a very important feature is the padded suspension notebook pocket to protect that valuable investment you wo n't be disappointed with the synergy and the price you 'll find at amazon
this backpack is amazing it very comfortably fits my standard dell laptop plus # big books , with a ton of space to spare it has several pockets in clever places that make it extremely practical to carry around a wide variety of things the straps are heavy duty , the padding is solid , and everything has a purpose -- there is nothing useless involved the back support is by far the best feature for a while i needed to carry # laptops for work , but even filled to the brim with these and other <unk> i felt like i was wearing nothing on my back when i had it on the fact that it stands up by itself is also very practical plus , the handle on the top is extremely sturdy and is just another great addition that makes this backpack super practical , user-friendly , and versatile
i read a <unk> backpack reviews before deciding on this one i wanted # . that fit my # . # dell xps laptop , # . also fit a notebook and a book or two , # . looked stylish , and # . comfortable this one fits the bill when i took it out of the box it looked <unk> -- but it 's really quite light weight considering how big it is it 's very comfortable even when fully loaded up tons of pockets , compartments - i can not imagine using all of them i also really like the look of it i had considered the belkin one - but based on reviews i was afraid it would be too small to fit <unk> beyond the laptop
at first i was dubious when i heard that this laptop had a pocket for whatever you desired i was definitely sold on both it 's usefulness and durability i have had this backpack for several weeks now and i still do n't know where all the pockets are these pockets are immensely useful and i have found spots for my charger , laptop , mouse and mousepad , notebook cooler , a book , and a folder will definitely buy from wenger again
i researched many bags i am in it and need to carry a laptop , accessories , everyday supplies , limited tools , and paperwork this seemed to fit the bill i also own other swiss gear and find it to be very well constructed and durable this bag is no exception the zippers are very well constructed and do not hang the bottom of the bag has a durable liner that protects it from wear and tear i have used this bag everyday for almost two years and it still looks new i would highly recommend this for any mobile worker
the synergy bookbag from swissgear is truly an astounding product i bought it for # $ from amazon , and that was a great deal i was looking for a bookbag for college for a while , and at <unk> city they had a bookbag similar to this one for $ # i am not sure if it is the exact same one or not but they were similar , and i liked it but it was a little pricey then on amazon i saw the swissgear for # $ so i just grabbed it immediately the backpack is very sturdy , i 've had it through rain and nothing happened to anything inside there is a lot of space inside , at least more than enough for my needs my macbook fits snugly inside , along with a compartment for my ipod and all my various chargers . btw it is also your perfect carry-on for a plane my only complaint about this bookbag is that it has too many pockets , theres more than you know what to do with but it is still worth # stars
this baby is still going strong after a year and a half of touring i 've even checked this bag on flights and it 's come back to me in one piece
well designed and durable fits my day to day , sporting and travelling needs priceless ! ! ! this had been my choice for past decade and with this purchase will continue to be brand
overall a great bag , it makes all the other similar bags that i 've owned before look like poor <unk> i like the styling and was amazed by the number of functional compartments it has this was definitely money well spent
i bought this backpack # years ago when i started traveling for work since then , it has gone on the road with me whether i 'm visiting a client office locally or traveling overseas for fun it 's roomy - it has lots of pockets - a place for everything i use the top zippered pocket like a mini purse when i travel i keep everything i need in there so that i do n't have carry around my purse i like it so much that i bought one for my husband as well
i travel a lot and i see a lot of this backpack the quality is superb and the design -lrb- compartments , etc . -rrb- is really well thought of for everyday use as well as for travelling
i bought this bag when i was going off to college i had a laptop so i wanted a way to protect it from when i went off to class this bag worked great for that it has a ton of pockets , tons of space , and tons of padding i almost took off one star because it gets kind of bulky with all of this but it would be hard for a bag not to with all of the space the quality of it is amazing as well nothing is even showing signs of wear swissgear knows how to make a backpack
my son had this backpack for two years and overstuffed it regularly with numerous high school textbooks the pocket in the front ripped at the seam as a result i sent the back pack in for warranty replacement on a thursday and had a new backpack on tuesday that 's amazing customer service ! !
the reason i bought this backpack was to put my laptop and my lunch in one bag i use it for work because i got tired of carrying multiple things to work everyday now i fit my lunch inside the main compartment , my laptop in the laptop pocket , and my water bottles on either side of the pack there is also room for many other items to be carried inside now i just have to carry one thing out the door to go to work ... my backpack
i bought this backpack as a replacement for one that i have had for several years and was a smaller one and different brand i was impressed with all the favorable ratings , and comments from those who were already owners of this pack it is loaded with various size compartments , and my dell inspiron # `` fits fine in the section for a laptop my main purpose for using this backpack is for my personal carry-on for travel i can put my nikon d # , two to three extra lenses , in the bottom of the main compartment and still have room for a light jacket and collapsible umbrella the two outside pockets with the netting will handle a bottle of water easily and there is still plenty of other pockets to use for various other items i could see where a person could just fill this thing up with all kinds of gear and possibly get it so loaded that it would be quite heavy lots of room now i just need to try and find a rain cover that will fit over the pack for extra weather protection pack is very well built , you ca n't go wrong with this one
i got a synergy bag in # after not quite # years of fairly rugged use , one of the zippers on front outer pocket separated where a few of the teeth had pulled out of the binding i contacted wenger customer service and sent them photos and a copy of original <unk> within a few hours , they responded that they would honor this under warranty and ship a replacement for a $ # . # charge i am quite satisfied with <unk> 's customer service on this interaction this is the best daily use backpack i have ever owned
this is a great bag - tons of storage space , comfortable , well thought out , quality build , comfortable , excellent protection one reviewer wrote that he dropped the bag and cracked his laptop because there is no padding on the bottom well , he must not have had it in the notebook pocket , which <unk> the laptop well above the bottom of the bag perhaps he had a real big laptop that would not fit in that sleeve i have a macbook , which fits with lots of room left over , yet the <unk> strap , which opens and closes easily with the press of a button , secures it great if you have a real large notebook , you might just want to check to make sure your computer fits in that sleeve - otherwise i ca n't imagine any problem anyone could have with this
i shopped very carefully for the right backpack i take a motorcycle most of the time so i needed a flexible durable pack also have a widescreen work laptop that needs plenty of room this pack has lots of compartments and plenty of room i 've had it a few weeks , but it appears to be made well and is a decent value looked at lots of others , but this was a bargain at amazon.com
i bought this for my college back back and i wanted something to carry my extra expensive laptop in and this did the job excellent i have had it for two years and i have put it through hell , it defiantly does it job
very nice with lots of pockets , a little heavy , but makes up for it with good deep pockets and padding for computer and tablets this also had no problem fitting under the seat of a plane with a netbook , # tablets , folders , and lots of other stuff
very well constructed bag has space for everything the straps are awesome they are designed to distribute the weight and not to put pressure on any given spot on the shoulders no more back pain my cat <unk> everything she literally <unk> my previous bag this one is holding up
i have one of these for work for several years now and purchased this for my son when he went away to college about the only thing i 'd change is put some elastic or something on the end of the straps so they do n't dangle . the fact that the backpack stays upright when you put it down is great
this arrived quickly -lrb- about # days earlier than <unk> -rrb- and it is the best back pack i have ever purchased i am extremely happy with it the only downside is that the back pack itself has substantial weight even when empty this is only a problem when carrying it for a long period of time -lrb- such as a hike or long trip -rrb- i recommend this brand <unk>
the wenger synergy pack is tough , well designed and absolutely everything a traveler needs the little extras like the small , easy access zippered pocket on the top gives a person space to do a last minute storing of those items that will set off the metal detector at the airport also , the computer pocket itself allows quick access to the computer when it has to come out extra organized storage <unk> reports and books and numerous other pockets allow for maximum organization it is light to carry and is a <unk> product which should last for years
i had this bag for # years the zipper broke on one of the pockets contacted the warranty department and they gave me a brand new bag . <unk> @ <unk> in <unk> wenger warranty claims # hope <unk> falls , <unk>
ive had this backpack for over a year now it is very durable and strong i use it everyday for many purposes has enough space to fit clothes , laptop , shoes if you are looking for an everyday backpack , gym bag , or a carry on , this is the way to go
i love this bag the many compartments available help me organize my things well and i do n't have to go digging around to search for my stuff would recommend it to everyone
plenty of room and durable a place for everything and some nooks for <unk> things padding on the back and straps to make it easier on the body cleans up nicely if backpack style carry-ons are you , this is the bag you want fits under airline seats or above
very nice backpack - the specifications always state the irrelevant computer screen diagonal size as the specification here are the dimensions of the computer pocket # `` depth x # `` width x # . # `` height and my # . # `` diagonal / # . # `` actual width laptop just fits in the pocket i thought i had plenty of room to spare because it said `` fits # to # . # computers `` in the end , it works though
i have been using this product for a month now and i must say it is really wonderful one best thing i liked about the bag is that even though you keep lot of stuff in your bag when you carry it on your shoulders you do n't really feel the weight of it i am very happy with product and it 's quality
looking for backpack for son to carry laptop , books , etc . , while away at college synergy is perfect , my son raves about its ' functionality and amazon had the lowest price it shipped quickly and in great shape i highly recommend the synergy and
this is a very practical , stylish product , the quality is outstanding , any person with half a brain cell will avoid buying the lesser quality brands , it pays in the long run i have bought # various makes lap top bags with one or two trips life span , max now this product , fit for any <unk> , and # trips later , and still going strong
as a conventional backpack for school or daily use , synergy has lots of compartments to carry many items from water bottles , stationary , a laptop up to # . # `` , cellphone , keys , camera , ipod , cds , notebooks , mini umbrella and more -lrb- including mesh net pouches inside larger compartments -rrb- each compartment is set so the total weight is distributed away from the bottom of the backpack when it 's crowded in public places , synergy is easy to carry using the handle there 's a a thick , plastic coated wire attached to the backpack running through the handle , so it will never <unk> or break off there 's also a carry-on handle between the shoulder straps should you need to set the backpack in an airport trolley i 've grown to appreciate everything the synergy backpack offers , this is really one of the best packs i 've owned in my lifetime
my son who is # loves this backpack he is forced to carry all of his books all of the time and this back pack holds alot and definitely helps in the weight on his shoulders factor he loves it great deal online alot more in the store
it works exactly what it says very durable & safe for precious laptops inside i used it as a day backpack some times it 's functional pockets r perfect for storage in travel time
you can read the item description and other reviews for the specific features of this laptop backpack it 's everything advertised , and better than i expected the top pocket for keys , cell phone or whatever is inspired clearly swiss gear products are the standard by which others manufacturers should measure themselves i ordered this backpack on # , went with the * free shipping * offer and received it today , on # ! big thanks to swiss gear and beach camera
bought another brand backpack back in # , in # weeks the straps had started ripping apart right after bought one of these swissgear backpacks , and i 'm still using it my brother was also in the market so we just bought him the same one the build quality is outstanding great cushioning on the back side , lots of pockets holes and accessory pouches , it expands out a lot also so lots of space inside if there is one complain i have its the cushioning on the bottom , although i feel its not big enough to knock off a star if i ever need a backpack again , buying this . # would buy
i enjoy having this backpack for my daily # mile hike to and from my <unk> job there is room for everything with pockets for things that you do n't want to collect in the bottom of a large compartment of a backpack -lrb- your ipod , mouse , keys , fragile items -rrb- it will hold more than you probably want to carry , and you do n't have to worry about it breaking down it is really strong and has a fold-down element inside that will keep it from falling over the only thing that i would like that it does n't have is a waist strap to shift the weight to the wearer 's hip area even inspite of that , i could not bear to return it
i was looking for a large backpack for my son to carry to school that would hold lots of books this is the largest one i could find and it is really deep - it holds a lot for a kid in high school great construction and design also absolutely love it
i use it everyday , walking to and from work , about # mile storage and organization , top notch , and i love the top pockets , accessible without digging through all the other stuff i carry nice spots for my lunch , newspaper , electronics , etc , i have owned many backpacks and this is the best
best knapsack i 've owned and i 've been around the world with quite a few this is roomier than the usual <unk> bags , but not oversized this bag is super for the macbook pro # . # `` model there is a port for the ipod phones tons of pockets great padding and strap system very sturdy and well crafted
i have to say , this bag is the best i 've ever used its tough , its sturdy , can hold heavy stuff my laptop is always safe in it all in all , perfect for everyday use
i looked around for a lot of different packs , and previously <unk> a similar bag at rei but the synergy bag is superb very high quality feel . great protection for laptop . and looks very professional . highly
great product and <unk> get the typical high quality and durability you expect from swiss <unk> backpack is much larger than it appears in the photo lots of storage space the only issue i have had is the laptop holder has no cushioning on the top to protect the corners of the laptop but that might be just because of my computer overall great product would recommend to any friend for any
bought this as an all round <unk> bag which would n't break after a few flights well it may be a tad expensive , but well worth the money laptop is held in it 's own pocket at the back of the bag leaving <unk> space for pretty much anything you need if there was one criticism is that there are too many different pockets and storage areas unless you are an <unk> who is <unk> organised then sooner or later you 'll be in an airport digging through a multitude of pockets for your missing passport or mp # player which will turn up three weeks later it 's probably not an ideal daily bag if you are just doing a basic commute because it is a fair sized item to be lugging around still build quality is top class - in fact i have a samsonite hand carry case which is n't any better and that 's about as good as you get
out of the # or # packs that i was picking from , i kept this one , as it was just a little bit bigger than the older swiss gear pack i was replacing it with swiss gear makes really sturdy packs this is my second one i also like the feature that allows the pack to sit by itself straight up it may seem like a minor thing , but when i place it down , for example , on a step , it stays where i put it ! lol the features are great , the quality and workmanship of these packs is wonderful i use it every day to and from work , and i am hard on things i would highly recommend this pack to anyone
i bought this backpack about # months ago for graduate school , and it has performed superbly it has plenty of space to store everything you might need , securely protects your laptop , is very comfortable to wear even when it 's heavy , is amazingly durable , and it looks sleek the finest backpack i have ever owned or seen for a laptop highly recommend -- the best
this bag is great fits my # . # widescreen laptop perfectly comfort level is great it is a little bit big but has lots of pockets and spaces for all kinds of things pen holders business card holder the whole nine
after seeing a friend with a similar pack i was suffering from an <unk> case of `` backpack envy `` i did a number of searches and came up with this one best feature is the laptop cradle that keeps my new macbook safe i ca n't get over the multitude of compartments that allow me to <unk> business from personal stuff
i had this backpack for over four years until <unk> when some piece of s *** broke into my car and stole it it has plenty of room and compartments for everyday use you can also use it for camping purposes on the weekend and for the office on monday my bag took a beating and still looked sharp after four years i will be purchasing another one today
this backpack fits my # . # `` dell perfectly as well as a couple binders and textbooks for when i load up for the library i really like the little zippered pocket on top replaced my purse hold my keys , cell , day planner , etc . it 's great
i used an eastpak laptop backpack for over # years and i was very happy with it unfortunately eastpak backpacks are not available in the usa anymore this is a great backpack , feels very sturdy with strong zipper , has a lot of pockets and room for many other things i definitely recommend this
bought this one after returning a cheap-looking and poorly manufactured backpack this one has everything - plenty of storage space and compartments , excellent hardware -lrb- zippers , straps -rrb- and it looks rugged yet professional it appears that it will fit under an airline seat with no problem , i 'll find out this week i transferred everything from my bulky laptop bag with ease swiss army has made a quality product , just what you would expect from them
space and pockets are great but it 's not at all durable my first pack ripped out a seam on my first trip using it i returned it hoping it was just a defect the replacement lasted a couple months i 'll return this one too , but not for another wenger
the back pack was everything i was looking for in a commuter pack document compartments spaces for other equipment and fit my laptops -lrb- varying sizes -rrb- reliably the bad with this thing is that the left strap broke like other have <unk> within a month the shock absorbing <unk> <unk> in there forever but the nylon strap will rip away quickly it didnt take long for the right one to follow suit i have had this pack for # months and the shock absorbing straps are frayed to the point where i just dont trust the bag to stay together if it <unk> for the straps i would recommend this in a minute though
i am a student in a technology high school , and when i saw that this bag would fit my laptop , and what looked like room for my books , i was in for a shock initially , it was fine , but after a month or so of use , a small hole began to form , which recently formed into a large hole now , the whole handle part of the bag is coming off it is a good bag , but it is poorly designed for any student , in my opinion , who needs to carry both a laptop and a large number of text books
i owned the older version without the shock absorbing <unk> it lasted me for years i recently purchased this bag with the `` shock `` absorbing straps and it ripped in less than a month at this time the bag is over at the shoe maker to see if he can sew it up other than that this bag has all the compartments you will ever need to keep you organized
i purchased this backpack after seeing it in person the first time i took it out on a business call , the stitching between the backpack and the shock absorbing part of the strap -lrb- where it stretches -rrb- tore and popped on both sides i was <unk> , all i did was pick up the backpack by one of the shoulder straps to put it on and i heard a popping noise . i did n't realize what it was until i took a close look at the bag and saw the stitches had broken in multiple places on the edges of the shoulder straps the layout and design of the backpack overall is great , it 's just too bad the straps were poorly designed had to send it back due to concerns re : durability
it looks pretty good and my expectation is extremely high however , on the first time it is on my back , on tiny string broke no further destroy after that , and now it is more than one month , generally works nicely for wenger , i could only give # stars , for other brand , it would be #
i bought this backpack as a gift for my brother and he really likes it the only negative is the computer pouch is very tight on his # . # `` wide screen dell since he will not store the laptop in that area except when in transit , i do not feel it will be a problem just be aware that if your computer is larger than a # `` size you will have <unk> it into the pouch when closing the pack other wise great pack with lots of good storage smooth line styling
beautiful bag , barely fits my hp dv # us # . # laptop being that i am a pretty big guy , the straps barely fit and hold very tight when on in addition , with nothing in the bag , it is very heavy i still like the bag i work in a office , so it does look professional there is plenty of space inside the bag and has many different pockets . * * *
good backpack , seems sturdy and it looks good i 'm not a big person . . # ' # `` and i found the bag a little small and the straps were not the greatest in terms of convenience for putting on the backpack and getting it off the top handle however is well constructed , and i wish my messenger type case had a handle like it the cell phone pouch is awkwardly placed , it will do , but it sort of gets in the way if the bag was an inch , or two taller , it would 've been great it could 've fit much more , and it would 've been a little more comfortable to wear for those looking for a compact computer backpack , i think this is a good option
it 's every thing i expected . i had seen one on the job . . <unk> n't have a chance to handle it ... weather tough , really <unk> laptop , lots of room left over for attachments etc .
i purchase this backpack in early february i take it to work # days a weeks it carries all the things i need , checkbook , keys , file folders of work , lunch , <unk> , and many other odds and ends it looks great , fits over my should well and is very comfortable to carry the handle on the top is great and very useful it looks professional and i have had several complements on it already it has the right number of pockets and they are positioned perfect for what i need all my things are easily accessable and easy to put in and out of the pockets <unk> recommend this product
i had been looking for a good computer backpack for quite a while and this one really served all of my needs very <unk> to carry , spacious pockets , good padding for my laptop i 've only had it for a few weeks , but so far i really love it
i have owned this backpack for years , and it 's still solid , no fraying of any kind perfect for my # `` powerbook , and i always carry all sorts of books and journal articles if you ride the bus , though , folks behind you might be <unk> off - the bag does extend farther than your average backpack
this is a great backpack plenty of room and easy to put things in , take things out that means it goes through airport security very well i am just a little mad that i paid a little more # . # because i got it from office depot if you are looking for a <unk> bag ... this is the one
love the design and orientation of the pockets comfortable to carry in hand as well as on back i use all the pockets and they work perfectly for me computer in its slot , with main compartment holding extra battery , power supply , books , discs and headphone bag middle pocket for my paper notebooks outer pocket has my ziploc for lights and my misc stuff like <unk> , <unk> , pens , usb <unk> , etc . top access pocket has spare batteries for my mp # players and my <unk> passes side zip pocket great for loose change , etc . it holds it all while not looking <unk>
i am very pleased with this bagpack it has a lot of space , useful pockets and wears easily the only disadvantage is that it is a little heavy even when it 's empty it 's made of fine materials , very good quality
this bag looks solid and it is indeed made of strong materials on the outside -lrb- which also makes it a bit on the heavier side -rrb- the inside , though , looks like cheap nylon none of the inner compartments have elastic <unk> , so they just kind of sag if they 're empty interior space design needs to be more efficient the # <unk> concept makes this bag very poor on storage space i can barely fit any more than my laptop and gym gear i used to get a ton more stuff in my old ebags backpack -lrb- which is actually smaller and lighter -rrb- no , i do n't think i would go for this next time around problem is that there are n't that many backpacks for a # inch laptop
if i can find a way to get a replacement , i <unk> upgrade my review the bag itself is not bad i like the compartments for organization but with very little weight the connector broke while at the airport i will try and attach a photo to be <unk>
i returned this pack after buying it as a replacement for my targus <unk> # the targus is wearing too quickly but it has way more space than this pack so , i 'll just complain and order another targus it would be nice if swissgear quality came with a pack having sufficient space also , the zipper barely closed on my dell e #
have owned this bag for about a year now use mostly for carrying my laptop , and it 's holding up well only drawback is the bag is kinda heavy , even <unk> guess i 'm used to my <unk> hiking <unk> , which this back is not intended to be
i had to return this backpack because it was too small i could barely fit three one inch binders and two textbooks it would be great for someone with just a couple notebooks , but would be a poor choice for a student that needs lots of room
i have a very large and heavy laptop also the laptop power supply 's weight is considerable the company gave me a leather carrying case i really could n't fit much else in the case and it was very heavy with the laptop and power supply in it the backpack makes it easier it also has alot of extra room for other stuff the backpack is cushioned it does make my back hot when wearing it
while the bag is very durable , and has lots of useful compartments , i 'm looking at replacing it the chest strap is the major disadvantage for me it is placed to be very uncomfortable for women a waist strap would have been much preferable with all the places the chest strap could be fastened , i 'm surprised they did n't make the placement adjustable it 's not possible , as the plastic fasteners holding the chest straps to the shoulder straps are solid pieces
this is a very well constructed bag , but the odd design of the diagonal separation between the larger back and middle compartments , and their equal depth , really limits what you can put into the bag if you want to carry lots of legal pads , this would be a great bag i want one large section for all of my books , etc . , and a thinner section for the computer i exchanged this for the maxxum -lrb- also wenger -rrb- , which is perfect for me , as well as cheaper the maxxum also adds an adjustable <unk> pouch on the front which is very handy <unk> , i should also note that both of these packs have an <unk> chest strap that is placed too high i still use it because it really helps with weight distribution
generally , this is a good bag , except for the zippers , which do not close properly , skipping `` teeth `` , and eventually breaking for that reason this happens on the angled section all the time , unless you make an effort , <unk> the zippers ' sections -lrb- it takes several attempts for it to work -rrb- so , for the bag to be perfect , the zippers should be more heavy-duty
i have to admit , i had it for about a year now solid solid quality build ; tons of room and support though the sides for like a water bottle is quite stiff , you actually have to force it in there i mostly love it for the look and functionality and use it primarily for traveling , work and school
this is my second swissgear laptop bag and i am loving it lots of pockets to your geeky stuff in , but a little heavy in the picture it seems that parts of the bag is blue , but it is actually gray
overall this is an excellent product , typical of swiss as a brand this particular model is great for laptop carrying , but is not expandable for other uses -- such as clothing , books , <unk> of things that require space anything delicate or not wanted to be crushed is at risk just know your purpose in buying it
this bag was nice right when i got it unfortunately a few months after using it , it began to have some issues it no longer stands if it has a laptop in it , it just flops over i have tried <unk> the insides a little , but still to no luck the overall build quality of the bag is nice , but i do n't have much use for any of the other pockets i probably should have gotten a smaller laptop , but it fits my # `` hp dv # very well overall , it is a great bag , but due to it falling over a lot i do n't think it deserves a # star rating
i ordered this bag a little over # months ago and i love it i use it every day i 'm a college student and this bag fits my lifestyle it holds my books , laptop and much more it 's got a neat little compartment that you can store your ipod , calculator , snacks and other little things in the suspension system works great and helps a lot with distributing the load evenly across my back and <unk> my back pain the only downside on this bag is it is a little bit smaller than i had hoped for while i still can fit all my books in it , my laptop gets way too much pressure on it , so instead i carry some of them overall i 'd give it # out of # stars
reviewing my new swissgear pegasus laptop backpack for # `` laptops i love the many pockets and roomy interior this is definitely one of the most protective and comfortable laptop bags out there made by a quality brand sure , it 's somewhat pricey but worth it to protect a nice laptop such as my dell precision m # workstation check out my youtube video review by searching for : swissgear pegasus laptop backpack
comfy while wearing pockets nicely sized for laptops especially like the fact that this pack is streamlined on the exterior other backpacks have loose <unk> hanging all over them that get caught while turning in tight spaces
the reason that i bought this backpack was because its predecessor had almost fallen to pieces this was -lrb- of course -rrb- a marked improvement over something that was currently breaking the storage was great , the compartment even fit my massive # . # inch notebook plus several various attachments and it has several pockets which are very convenient for easy access the molded plastic base keeps the bag upright -lrb- in most cases -rrb- which makes it especially waterproof -lrb- no tipping over into a puddle -rrb- the padding makes me feel incredibly confident of all my belongings and feels very comfortable on my back however , all of this padding is a <unk> <unk> and cuts down on the bag 's interior packing space if you are just going from class to class this bag is amazing , however , packing for a weekend trip somewhere will push the limits of your packing <unk> and the bag 's internal volume overall , however , for a college kid i would give it <unk> stars for everyday use and three for travel use
does not fit a dell m # & # # ; laptop without stretching the zipper perfect for any slightly smaller laptop other colleagues ' backpacks have failed their pegasus at the point where the corner of the laptop forces the zipper to bulge out
this is a very sturdy laptop backpack and protects my laptop well the backpack stays upright rather well the materials in this are very good the only small downside to this backpack is that after carrying it around for awhile , my back starts to hurt i think it 's because the backpack has a very firm shape and is n't as flexible i 've carried my fiance 's swissgear backpack before that 's a different model and it 's more comfortable to carry around , but i still really love this backpack there is n't a whole lot of room for school books or notebooks in the laptop section or the other large sized section in the backpack it may work better if the laptop portion had less room for books and the # nd large section had it 's space increased
this backpack has adequate room to carry a great deal of printed material as well as a well designed padded section for a laptop the only shortcoming , and it 's not a major issue , is the design and <unk> of the shoulder straps the shoulder straps are not designed nearly as well as the jansport odyssey # for example still and all i am happy with the performance of the pegasus
i was having a hard time finding a backpack large enough for my toshiba qosmio the laptop is thicker than most # `` models , so it is real snug in the designed pocket also , since the notebook is thicker , the zippers rub the corners i do n't travel alot , so i am using the main compartment instead as there are plenty of other pockets for accessories i think a thinner notebook would fit very well in the bag and it offers more <unk> than my other option .
this is a super bag it holds my huge laptop no problem sometimes the zipper catches in the fabric around the computer pouch and that is a little annoying , but i would still get this bag if you are carrying one of the big laptops
my son -lrb- # -rrb- wanted a new pack for his birthday for school he had always <unk> by pegasus that i 've used for years as my mobile office for work and <unk> he has been very pleased with the new pack and its pretty rugged the zippers sometimes seperate during use when a lot of books are in the pack but they are self <unk> they could be a little more rugged for school use given the demands on carrying lots of books
i owned a different swissgear model for my old # & # # ; laptop that was great this one is as well built , but i miss the extra storage of my old bag my new laptop , like many # & # # ; has a huge power brick and there is no good place to carry it except in the main compartment which leaves little space of other items other than that , i would recommend one
what you gain in strength -lrb- and , presumably , durability -rrb- , you also gain in weight the pegasus is made of strong materials , clearly assembled to protect and to last however , with all that extra thickness and padding , you need strong shoulders with laptop , accessories , # books , a few papers , and my lunch stowed within the abundant compartments and pockets , this is the heaviest little number i 've ever carried but who 's complaining even the zippers feel like they 'd withstand a nuclear blast and , since zippers are usually the weakest link in the backpack chain , that alone puts the pegasus in a class of its own
i really liked this bag for many reasons first of all it has many compartments to organize my books accessories and other things it feels good as the weight is evenly distributed when there are many heavy stuff in it the bag is real sturdy and holds my laptop really well overall a good buy
this item is a quality backpack that i would purchase again there are a couple of different models that have different pocket types , etc . . but this one would have gotten a # rating if it had a support in the front
very pleased with the usability of this backpack the number of pockets is a little confusing at first , but you get used to them and find yourself filling most of them plenty of room to carry a typical days work load a college student trying to carry all of their <unk> may have problems , but the average user will have plenty of room laptop is well protected very sturdy bag worth the money
great bag , very comfortable with heavy loads i keep my ipad in one main zippered pocket and my laptop in the padded area the straps are well padded as well as the back the ability to stand up when empty makes it easy to load the large pocket at the front is larger than it looks overall it 's well built and comfortable
