fits my boyfriend 's macbook pro # & # # ; very nicely snaps right on the apple symbol shows through when the computer is on laptop is able to breathe underneath with the slits
for awhile i was getting really frustrated - i kept ordering covers for my mac and none of them would fit but i contacted kuzy right after from their main website asking why none of them had fit - and they explained depending on the laptop depends on a code so if you are having trouble finding the size for your laptop - contact the actual brand you are buying from and they 'll direct you besides that , i love the black sleek look , it 's a matted finish so it 's really nice no finger marks and the apple shows through as a gray and <unk> - it 's so nice
the price is awesome for the quality of product you get the case is thin and light but has a nice <unk> texture that allows the apple logo to shine through i purchased the black case for my # inch macbook pro and was happy with the product until i noticed that it had a few scratches and parts of the rubberized portion peeling off i thought perhaps i received a case that was used and then returned by someone else i notified the company and they immediately shipped a replacement case to me free of charge , and i had my beautiful brand new case on my laptop within # days awesome product , awesome customer service keep it up kuzy
this cover is wonderful i was a little worried that the little clips where it snaps on would bother my wrists because it 's right where they rest but i do n't noticed them at all the case feels awesome and looks really nice no complaints at all
love it . i have three kids and their always on my mac so i needed something to keep it from getting <unk> and this does the job keep up the good
i love this little fellow it is great for someone who takes his mac around a lot , between classes and so on it is the perfect protection inside my backpack
i love this case it 's a perfect fit and does n't block any of the plug-in areas , it protects from smudges , and you can see the apple logo light glowing through it very happy with it
i have a # & # # ; macbook pro mid- # model and this seemed to fit it perfectly i like that the apple logo is still able to shine through the case so far so good with this case
i just recently ordered this case along with the keyboard cover it is amazing very simple install , and fits like a glove the color looks exactly the same in the picture and looks great i purchased the light purple and i 'm so glad i did i searched around for other cases but i saw the reviews and was turned off i saw the kuzy reviews and boy , did they help i 'm very satisfied with my purchase and would definitely recommend their products to all of my friends
exactly as described cover protects outside aluminum , everything is accessible without any problems i find it easier to get the macbook pro out of my bag having the kuzy cover on it
it was difficult finding a black cover for my old macbook so i felt lucky when my search found this kuzy only had it for about a month but no complaints looks great and fits perfectly
i was concerned about getting a rubberized cover for my new laptop but this is different it 's a fuzzy kind of plastic the hard shell touches against the laptop but the outer surface is <unk> either way , i love it i never feel like i may drop my computer due to slippery or sweaty hands and a slick finish plus , even though i chose black , the apple logo still glows though and it looks awesome i will definitely look to kuzy for future covers
this is a great bag it is a very good size , the straps are long enough to fit over a bulky coat and they are padded which makes it very comfortable to carry an added bonus is that it looks great too
i love deep , vibrant purple -- more blue than red this is definitely more pink and gray , and the inside is almost all hot pink all that said , i love this bag so cute and practical wish there were a few more mid-sized pockets inside for things like a mouse and power cable -lrb- and sunglasses and other stuff -rrb- but overall i love it
i love this bag i use it as my purse when i need to carry my laptop for work ... there is a special place for it there are also compartments for make-up , wallet , accessories , pens , etc . definately ... money well spent
i did a lot of research on laptop bags before purchasing this and i am so happy with my purchase the bag is beautiful , lightweight but sturdy the straps are a little longer than i expected but it is so much easier to carry than the generic bags that came with my laptop from work
i 've had and abused this bag for about a month now with no complaints and lots of compliments i was concerned about the amount of weight stress i 'd be putting on it but it is showing no signs of wear so far , great product
well made and fits my mac air perfectly however , it is a bit small -- you could add only a few pages of paper also , it would be much better with a simple handle on the top - so one could pick it up easily
i have the mid # macbook air # `` and this bag is the perfect fit not too loose that the laptop slides around , and not too tight as to make the laptop hard to insert or put stress on it i can even leave my logitech usb <unk> plugged in - just have to be careful when sliding the laptop in
item delivered ahead of time -lrb- by one day -rrb- and was exactly as described bought this case for my wife she works out of her car a lot and needs something to protect the laptop and carry all the accessories this is perfect
i received this case and it was clearly damaged there were multiple scratches on each of the two pieces and one scratch deep enough that it appeared to be a crack
the color of this case is more of an ugly pale pink , than a hot pink i 'm sending it back and will not pay return shipping because i definitely did not receive what was shown
this item was terrible it broke within # months of having it the seller was not very helpful with the problem i would not waste your money on this product buy something else
so i 've had this case for almost a year now and it does its job so do n't get me wrong there on the bottom of the case there are # little bumper <unk> things -lrb- one in each corner -rrb- but those slide around and come off like no one 's business i 've found them in the bottom of my bookbag , stuck to my desk etc . also once they come off there 's a sticky residue so crumbs , dust all that fun stuff end up sticking to it as well which is kinda <unk> but other than that it 's a good case i definitely get a lot of compliments on it when i 'm out and about
the shipping was really fast , so that was nice however , the color did not match the one in the picture the one i got was way lighter it 's nice too but it was not the one i thought i ordered
i like the pink color , the cheap price was nice , and it shipped in a timely manner by looking at it , you can tell it is a cheap case the edges are rough and look chipped i only wanted something to keep my macbook from getting scratches when i take it to <unk> , so its fine if you want good protection , it 's probably worth it to spend the extra and get an incase
i work in an electronics store and we sell cases for macbook pros but we do n't have any colors that i really like nothing in pink , and i love hot pink this is really pink it 's a lot more vibrant in person than what it shows in the picture , but i am personally just fine with that the only thing i do n't like about it is the tabs that hold the bottom onto the computer are right wear you set your wrists to type they stick up a little bit and are kind of sharp my boyfriend -lrb- being the handy guy he is -rrb- filed and <unk> it down just enough to take the sharpness away without ruining the clip if i ever decide i do n't want hot pink anymore , i will order this style again
i bought this case for my macbook pro over a year ago and have been pleased with it i did just have to buy another case because the corners have broken off and it was snagging me and everything else for the price it 's a great case
this product arrived in less than a week and the color was really nice the pink is true to the color on the image and the feel to it is nice fits perfectly and gives the macbook a cute look and protection good product for a good price
the case was delivered so fast i placed the order at night and it was here within # days ! i love the color is hot pink just like i wanted super easy , just snaps on and im good to go
i 'm disappointed with this product and am returning it its fits quite well but there are # major problems : the color and the hole there is a hole about # / # inches in diameter cut in the top its supposed to be over where the apple logo is on my computer but its not even right over the apple so it looks very strange the color is also not even close to the photo its so light its clear with a slight purple tint i 'm not happy i would not recommend , unless i got the wrong product
this piece is ok for the money i feel that i got the quality that i paid for -lrb- i paid about $ # -rrb- the color is not even close to the attractive , deep purple in the advertised pictures the color is a lavender , and the quality -- well , it is an inexpensive cover for the computer i would not consider this cover a protective cover , but merely a way in which to distinguish my macbook pro from others i do n't know that the plastic would really protect the computer
this is a great case , not true to color though it 's pretty durable , maybe a little too durable ; i ca n't get the case off of my computer , it 's way too tight for my pro # '
this product seemed really great at first it fits my macbook pro like a glove , and stays put however , after about a month of use the corners on the bottom portion have cracked and fallen off it has left sharp edges on the case around the cracked areas , and exposed corners on my laptop i will sadly need to purchase another case
i purchased this in august , put it on my macbook in early september , and the bottom piece already has # cracks on the corners and in the middle -- significant enough that i have to buy another wo n't be a topcase
it fits perfectly and the top gives me a sense of comfort knowing it is giving an extra layer of protection the back doesnt seem to fit as well because there are always almost pockets of air caught between the lap top and the case
this arrived on time , but i would say that the color was very different from what was advertised on here it is a much <unk> purple does n't <unk> do n't buy it if you do n't want a pale purple look at customer pictures available to see it that 's the color you want
i wasnt expecting the color to be so light , the picture makes it seem so dark like a deep purple its not a bad product i just wasnt excited about it when i got it the plastic cover is kinda flimsy but i think im just going to make this like a <unk> of stickers instead cuz it looks so plain <unk> compared to the matte finish covers i wouldnt buy this again just because i was expecting something else
the case is much lighter than in the picture , as others have mentioned it 's still a pretty purple though , just a much <unk> purple the case went on easily , and looks great
i love this case it is not a dark as the purple in the picture , but it looks really good my only complaint is the fit the top fits perfectly fine , but the bottom tends to slide off sometimes , but other than that i like it oh the shipping was perfect as well , got here sooner than expected
when i got this i expected it to be more deep purple then it was and not so transparent , but i still like it it looks better on the laptop then just looking at it alone
it would have been perfect had i ordered the correct one for me lol , sorry it would not work however , it was all my fault so i gave it to a friend whose computer it would fit ad they love it
this is a great product it looks great on my laptop , and its lasted me # years now with no damages its very durable and stylish , i would definitely purchase another
love how this looks on my mac although the color is lighter in real life than in the picture . it fits <unk> it from <unk> to put on and take off
the picture shows the case as much darker than it really is it is much lighter but i still love the color also it does n't say that there is a cut out where the apple is ... so there 's a cut out where the apple is but it looks good overall i love the case and would recommend it to purple lovers
i bought this and then a month later i decided to sell my laptop it was nearly impossible to remove eventually i got a wire cutters and was able to use that to bite into the cover to remove it it 's good that it does n't just fall off but that was ridiculous if you 've got a scratched up macbook and do n't ever want to remove the case , then i 'd consider getting this one , the price was right
i 've used this case for the past two years and only now am i thinking of replacing it if you get it , make sure you clean your computer well before applying if you have dirt or anything else on your computer that should n't be there those <unk> will scratch your mac when trapped between the computer and case it 's easily prevented , just make sure to regularly clean under the cover ever so often i like to clean mine about once every two months the grips came off the bottom about a month after i got it , but it has n't affected the case negatively the case has gotten some minor cracks in it over the past two years and the corners have chipped from hauling my laptop everywhere every day i 'm very pleased with my purchase and highly recommend this product it 's extremely durable
for $ # , this is probably the best case for the money . it snaps on easily and protects like it should my only two issues it shows nearly every fingerprint and scuff mark two of the little hooks that snap on are where my wrists lie when i type you can feel them and they 're a little irritating
just love this cover searched amazon and read all reviews which took hours to do this cover is exactly as described , hard cover with a satin rubber feel yet see thru goes on without a problem it not only came with a mouse pad it also came with a keyboard cover that was a pleasant surprise definitely worth the money my macpro looks sleek
this case is great it fits my mac book pro # . # laptop very well and i love the color i thought the color was a little blue but it is black this is very affordable and very durable i want the best for my laptop and i believe this product will protect my laptop very well great product and reasonable price compared to the retailers that sell for # or # dollars for the same exact thing
this case is perfect i read a ton of reviews on a bunch of cases and decided to go with this one because of price and reviews it is totally worth it it has a great look i got the black , which i personally feel helps the macbook maintain its sleek , professional look
the description perfectly describes this case the outside is see through which allows the apple logo to shine through it is also <unk> finish on the outside that makes it look and feel great definitely the best hard cover case i 've ever bought
definitely too big for the chrome book also , it 's not a <unk> silver as pictured , but more of a dull <unk> color the shipping packaging was flimsy and ripped when it arrived with large creases on this thin , much too big case
i ordered this guy for my white chromebook , first of all this is not white , its a silver color its also not very firm and is entirely too big for this # `` notebook this would probably fit a # `` notebook fine but is not usable on a # `` chromebook
i just received this today , and it 's far too big for my chromebook -lrb- series # -rrb- there 's almost # . # `` of clearance width-wise , and almost an inch front to back in addition , in terms of height , i could fit two or more chromebooks in here in fact , my wife 's # `` macbook pro fits in here with room to spare as well as far as looks , it 's silver like it says , and <unk> it seems like it would be very well protected from a drop but , even though the interior does n't seem like it would scratch the chromebook itself , i still do n't want it `` sloshing around `` in here , which it will do because of all the extra room i 'm returning the item and will be looking for something with a snugger fit if you have an older -lrb- <unk> -rrb- # `` laptop this case will probably be great for you
i bought this for my samsung series # chromebook and i was surprised to find that i could n't close the case all the way the corners on the case are too rounded to be able to zip up the last side beyond that , i would n't really deem this as impact resistant , it 's simply a neoprene case that is reinforced with wire around the edges i 'm not sure how well that would really protect the laptop
i was hoping this product would be made thicker than it was it is super thin and i wish i had n't gotten it once it arrived i ended up ordering something better and wish i had n't wasted money on something that would n't really protect my computer
i highly doubt this case would protect against impact this size did not fit the chromebook in the first place -lrb- too small -rrb- and the company sent me a new one that is , ironically , too large i could see it protecting against some dust and water but not impact
priced about twice what the other two black covers i bought for my son 's chrome books , this item was pretty much as expected made from wetsuit material , great fit , good zipper quality and construction be careful though because it seems to be quite slippery and the item you bought to protect , may cause you to drop your cb
the fit was not great the product is as promised , but the zipper did n't open and close easily color was true to picture in the end i got a hard case that would stay on the laptop , for my kids who are taking them in and out of their backpack every class
my wife selected this based upon the color shown in the picture instead of the light purple one shown , we received a dark blue one instead other than that , it works fine
i have not yet experienced the water resistance but i did drop it and my chromebook survived the impact i was impressed with the quick delivery time , price , and quality of this product . i would purchase from this vendor
i bought this bag based upon the previous review of it , and i love it the inside is extremely soft and i feel comfortable putting my laptop inside of it to transport it the handle thing on the side is very helpful and makes me feel more secure while carrying it would definitely recommend this product
i have only had this case for a few weeks now but so far i am very pleased i cary around my laptop in my backpack to my classes and this case seems very nice and sturdy the inside if super soft and cushioning and it is very well made
i do wish there was a bigger pocket but still , this is the best laptop case i 've had i feel my computer is very secure in it and my computer runs my life
this case is great it 's cheaper than a lot of other options , but definitely a quality item it 's durable and protective a little roomy for my # -inch macbook air , but much cheaper than other options specifically tailored for the airbook the side pocket is great , and fits my iphone # perfectly even with a speck <unk> case on , despite reviews which stated otherwise and which had me worried the inside is made of this really soft , almost furry material - like the <unk> fleece they use on the <unk> north face <unk> the pocket is lined with this <unk> fleece material too , which is great , and makes me feel really comfortable putting anything in it and not worrying about the inside scratching my devices
i read several reviews and the <unk> was this is a great product so i received mine a couple of weeks ago and i can confirm that this is a great sleeve it is very well padded , the exterior is a great cordura material it has a handle on the strap that makes carrying easier the interior is incredible to the touch its like a really soft fur coat you will love this case ... i do ! !
fits lenovo yoga # pro perfectly , you can even charge it in the sleeve if you leave the zipper cracked open slightly materials are of good quality inside liner is very soft , handle is nice if you hold it like you would a clipboard cellphone pocket is small made for average size phones only con is no room for a power adapter but that 's not what i bought this for i have a backpack for that
the only case i could find that might fit my dell xps # `` ultrabook i looked in stores in vain and <unk> the internet <unk> with some cases looking promising but then given the outside measurements i figured the inside ones would be too tight beware , most cases are given outside measurements only which do not guarantee your laptop will fit the brenthaven website had the inside measurements for this case and it looked like my dell would just about fit when my amazon order arrived i was nervous but thankfully i got an exact fit it is a glove fit with no room left and the additional outside pocket is not usable because the laptop inside takes up all the depth the case has to offer very good looking case with perfect craftsmanship may not be the cheapest one around but well worth it if you need a slim case for your ultrabook
i ordered this sleeve because i love the color - but was very happy with the quality of it the soft lining protects my macbook air from scratches & fits the air perfectly i would highly recommend this sleeve the company shipped quickly & the quality of the purchase was as expected very happy with my purchase
i bought the brenthaven prostyle sleeve for my macbook air based on other amazon reviews , and it is a very nice piece the quality of materials and workmanship appear to be excellent throughout -- definitely a cut above cases found in office supply stores one should understand that this sleeve is a simple product to protect your computer the pocket for a cell phone is sufficient for that purpose , but trying to use it for anything bulkier like a portable mouse , is pushing it -lrb- whenever i need the mouse , charger , and documents , i use another case with shoulder straps and pockets . there 's an honest video representation of this case at -lsb- ... -rsb- i 'm very pleased with it the next time i need any type of case , i 'll definitely check brenthaven 's products
the tote i received had scratches in the front when i received it and the close magnets do not work well to keep your stuff secure not sure it was worth the money would not buy another item made by this company
i love it so much the color of the bag there is also a vintage feel but does not close the bag support there is a risk of the contents spill out
i really like this bag it 's a perfect mid-sized bag : a bit smaller some of the giant messenger bags , yet big enough for a small laptop or a big book <unk> seems solid good pockets inside and on the outside i 'm very happy with it
bought our son a lap top for xmas and this was the perfect accessory not a super thick case , but good for keeping the compute <unk> at home and in the car
i bought this for my new laptop a # . # inch acer aspire nice sleeve that i use inside a laptop bag as extra protection it is well made , but too thin as a stand alone
i really like this alot , but its not super protective , more like a light neoprene cover , exactly as its described lol i put this in my chrome backpack in the laptop sleeve and its perfect but just dont expect a firm solid bag , its very foldable and light
this item is exactly as described and fits the new tsa approved laptop sleeve standards it does not have any metal what-so-ever to be confused with the inner <unk> of a laptop on an xray machine the neoprene is soft the velcro holds the flap shut as it should it can even support a thicker laptop or a laptop and folder if needed i read other reviews of different sleeves saying they smelled like gasoline , this does not have any smell
when i first opened this i was amazed and though there was no way my laptop would ever fill it out but i 'm surprised to post that my system # <unk> professional fits great protects from minor <unk> snug -lrb- for me
i was looking for something to ` carry ' my laptop inside , it 's a good product even being a little thin , but worth the price and do it 's job i 'm really satisfied
this is a nice looking backpack , but it is advertised to fit a # `` laptop this is not true i own a toshiba qosmio # `` laptop , and it does n't even come * close * to fitting it sticks out over an inch at the corners , and almost a half inch at the center in the pocket or out , it will not fit at all the only # `` anything i could see fitting in here is some kind of tablet disappointing , and one star only because it does n't fit what it says otherwise it seems nice
so this is why i do n't like to purchase items online you ca n't get them in your hands to see if it 's what you really want and if it will work i bought these for my company to use with the big asus laptops supposed to be able to fit a # . # & # # ; laptop well if you 're a gamer look elsewhere if you have a big system ca n't zip it all the way up so i 'm using it for smaller # & # # ; laptops we have here and they work fine
i have had this backpack now for about # year it has flown with me for # miles , # <unk> and multiple countries with a # `` laptop which is heavy and all my gear this bag gets to be very heavy the right should strap is now coming apart , the stitching did n't hold up to the # lbs i have in it the very front of this bag is not that well designed , stuff drops to the bottom and can be hard to find no really good place for a passport and boarding pass that you want to keep hidden when in a not so great part of the world the large pocket holds all the electronics needed and a change of clothes for those long flights or the one <unk> very fast through security , not taking out the laptop is a help overall i would buy it again , -lrb- actually have to go buy another since the strap is coming apart on me
great space , love the scan smart feature and the ipad holder lots of zipper pockets -lrb- mostly good -rrb- pockets toward the top of the pack flop downward with anything slightly heavy -lrb- like my glasses -rrb- , causing them to fall out if you are n't paying attention overall though , it & # # ; s a great pack with lots of room in the middle compartment for things like cold weather clothing or purchases
this bag is great the price is affordable and it has plenty of storage the material is not the best , but then again your not paying top dollar i had an extensive search for bags with the size of my laptop , and i 'm glad i chose this one i recommend this product to friends and family
i 'm very happy with this backpack lots of pockets and a large main storage compartment the scansmart feature is really helpful for the airport , i travel a lot with my laptop and appreciate saving the hassle bag looks great and feels comfortable to carry it is a little heavy when empty but that may be the price for a sturdy bag
swissgear scansmart laptop backpack has seven compartments that are user friendly there are four compartments that can be locked with a luggage lock i use the tsa approved locks the durability of the back will require at least another seven months with the laptop inside to assess how it holds it form after removing the notebook
i bought this for my son to carry a new computer and he absolutely loves it he has plenty of pockets to carry everything needed for classes and its easy to carry
this backpack is good and sturdy its been more than a year i bought this bag and have no complaints about its quality its swissgear man ! ! but the bag is heavy by itself and when u start stuffing in more things along with the laptop also then it becomes too bulky . this is meant for office purpose just put in a few things and <unk> <unk> office . thats all i read couple of reviews which said its too spacious but i bet it is not it is sufficient but not too spacious finally a good one ! !
these bags last for a couple of years , have a lot of great pockets , and the scansmart is great for going through security at the airport my only issue is that sometimes the stitching comes undone after a year or so mostly cosmetic , but for the price of the bag , i ca n't expect these things to last forever there 's some elastic that also gets a little weird , but i think that 's just the nature of the beast this is a wonderful , highly protective laptop case with the cushioning inside , if you secure the laptop properly , you can just throw the bag on your front seat , or in the trunk , and it 'll be protected i do n't recommend throwing laptops around , in a case or out , but sometimes you just want to throw a bag in the car , you know quality product , good brand name , lots of features
finally got my bag after issues with the post office lots of room wish the padding for the laptop went all the way around it and not just on one side
i 've been using this backpack for work for the past month , and now i do n't use anything else i originally bought it for the smartscan feature , which i have n't tried at an airport yet but as an everyday backpack - this is the most versatile piece of luggage equipment i 've ever own - tons of storage space : middle section is great for notebooks and/or a change of clothes a lot of little pockets to keep small items - adequate laptop compartment -lrb- # & # # ; lenovo laptop - smartscan w / ipad pocket - seems sturdy : have two friends who have had their bags for a year + , and still looks new - none at this point , but i 'm hard on bags , so we 'll see how well it holds up
i have a bad habit of leaving granola bars in my bags which is <unk> by having several <unk> <unk> dogs with a real <unk> for ... granola bars they 've eaten through two bags - this was the second - this year including a <unk> ogio that i 'd <unk> for years after this one , i moved on to a cheap rosewill bag i do n't care too much about bags with tons of bells and whistles , so this pretty much suited my needs until it was , well , eaten
this backpack was given to me as a gift and i love it plenty of pockets and lots of space i was on call and i was able to carry two laptops -lrb- one # `` and one # `` -rrb- plus chargers , ipad , two cell phones , <unk> , headphones and pens it was heavy but , i still had room for keys and a wallet well padded and it did not strain my back i was able to travel through the airport without much issue the scanners did very well on the side with the laptop however they did search the bag because i placed too many items in the other pockets i corrected the issue on my return trip and <unk> through security perfect backpack for someone in the it field or always on the go
this backpack has plenty of pockets and space to fit just about any of your electronic needs i store my # inch computer , my pad , my flash drives , books , drink containers , and just about anything i would need throughout a normal work day the only complaint i have is the lack of , somewhat <unk> , padding on the bottom of the bag when your computer is in the bag and you place your bag on the ground the only thing protecting the edge of the computer is the thin layer of bag material so be careful of this if you purchase the bag other than that i do not have any complaints great bag , just wish it was a little more padded
i use the back pack more like a purse so it is always with me i can fit so much into this bag , folders , note pad , laptop , lunch , shoes , wallet , and several other necessities that i may need and then some it has many pockets to keep me organized i have had this for almost a year now and has not shown any signs of wear and tear yet and i definitely use it a lot this back pack is great
this product is perfect for the college student ample interior space to lug everything around in great pocket storage and very sturdy this is my second swiss gear purchase i will continue to support this company
this backpack is extremely sturdy and works well with a # `` laptop it is well made and has enough pockets to carry everything needed it has cushion to protect the laptop should it get banged around no issues with this purchase and would recommend to anyone in the market for a backpack
my son uses this backpack for high school it fits a ton of stuff this is his first year with it so i can not say how long it will last , but swiss gear products tend to be very strong and well made so far he is very happy
just received it in the mail as a gift from my brother it is quite the backpack it holds my computer -lrb- a # / # inch screen -rrb- and all of my textbooks and folders my roommate also owns a swissgear backpack and said she 's had it since her college freshman year -lrb- she is now a junior -rrb- it is still in good shape , and she literally carries all she has the backpack does the job it 's just what i needed
