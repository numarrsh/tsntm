very fine leather , sturdy bag a little heavy , but expected given the quality of the product the inner zippered section is small as per the other reviews and a standard # / # x # notepad will not fit front pocket has nice small slots for cell phone , etc . , but a gusset would have been a good idea to enable better access love the feel of it love the drop -lrb- good for shoulder carrying -rrb- love the look lots of compliments
my # year-old daughter needed a professional bag/briefcase to carry her mac and hard drive in , along with sheet music and the like i got this for her birthday and she absolutely loved it -lrb- and she 's a bit hard to please -rrb- it is well made , looks very nice , and suits the purpose
i too found the bag to be too small to carry the cables and power cord the carrying bag that came with the infocus in # <unk> projector is adequate and has plenty of room for the cables do n't waste your money on this accessory it is n't worth it
i purchased an infocus in # nice bag to store and protect the projector , but has no extra room for cables i returned and purchased another bag amazon was excellent in handling this return
this is a very nice carrying case for the projector with one major fault the bad is too small i can not use all the fancy packing that came with it nor can i carry a light weight extension cord in it i need to use a second bag however , it is much better than the paper thin bag which came with the projector itself
i brought this along with my infocus in # + dlp projector so i could have a the convenience of a carrying case the description claimed it would fit this particular unit in it the issue i had was the in # fit with little room to play , but now include the remote , cables and power cords and you see the case is too small not what i expect
the bag design is very sleek space in the bag is very limited , a tight fit with cord attachments the custom packing <unk> than likely for extra protection could not be used
i 'm not sure why , but amazon does not list the vendor of this case as infocus this model is made to house many of the infocus <unk> it looks to be a quality case with decent padding my model in # fits fine into it overall a fine case
the vertical style is so much easier to move down train aisles and hallways it 's roomy enough for my large work pc , but not bulky there are lots of storage compartments and pockets to stay organized the wheels and handle work very smoothly my only complaint is the lack of color choices black is just so boring
i was looking for a high quality product for my travels , i was sick of carrying my backpack with the computer , this bag has plenty of room for all my business needs and fits well in the overhead
i purchased this case after having another <unk> for # years that case was ok but this one exceeds all of my requirements and more the handle is strong , computer is protected and it fits all of my electronics -lrb- computer stuff , ipod , backup hard drive , various cables and enough pockets for papers all in all , an excellent case
targus vertical rolling laptop case exactly what a traveler needs have had other more expensive cases they were too bulky or too wide to fit easily down narrow airplane aisles or had too many useless pockets and zippers just the right open space good front pocket for phone , airport <unk> , keys and other quick access essentials also has ergonomically correct carry strap so , you can roll it , strap it across your chest or carry it by handle like a briefcase the thick , high quality canvas can take a beating and still look good wheels roll great and center of gravity and sturdy front platform makes it stand up without tipping over love it !
extremely functional and <unk> to all my tech equipment - cables , tablets , phone , ipods , external memory shoulder strap seems sturdy as well as rollers i have given up at trying to size the latest tech equipment sizes to carrying case sizing get me close is all i ask this product offers many storage areas of different size i think i am set for a while
i bought this for my wife within a month i had it replaced because the feet on the bottom popped off within a week of the replacement the feet fell off again i 've now had it a couple months and the stitching from leather to suede is torn
i actually ended up returning this bag the style is very cute but i thought the materials used to make the bag look cheap it is not made of suede and i did n't think the material really looked like suede i should have read the description more carefully i think the materials made it look a little more casual style than something i could use for business the brown `` suede `` part is also lighter than it appears in the picture i was hoping for a deep , rich chocolate brown
i got this bag to carry my laptop and a few <unk> books to classes in college it is a really nice-looking bag it looks way more expensive than it is my laptop fits perfectly and there is plenty of room for # or # <unk> books in the bag
love , love , love this tote for my laptop and padfolio i also bought i was able to get it all in there and i have a rather large laptop it also zips close for travel
my wife is absolutely happy with this computer tote she loves the color of the bag -lrb- brown -rrb- and the materials with it 's made the computer , a <unk> inches one , fits perfectly , and other stuff that my wife needs in a daily basis for her work can be easily carry in into the bag i am very happy with this purchase
the bag holds my # `` laptop with no problem there is still room for books , files and the power cord in the other compartment if you fill the extra <unk> it is a little harder to get things in the smaller pouches for pda and cell phone the front pocket is small and will not hold a lot it is light weight and easy to carry the only thing i noticed is that the strap twists under the shoulder pad sleeve but this is not a big deal is not a lot of padding but did not expect much with this type of bag it was only $ # when i got mine this <unk> reasonable compared to others i looked at not sure i would spend a lot more on it
it fits my dell studio # perfectly it has plenty of room for all the extra 's for the laptop , a couple of note books , files and my lunch it 's very comfortable to carry around , it looks good and is a quality product if you have a # `` laptop then this is the bag
excellent and ergonomic bag fits my # inch hp with neoprene sleeve perfectly plenty of pockets and slots for whatever you need i absolutely love this bag at a great price and worth every penny item also shipped fast
for such a nicely designed bag , it has a light weight and poorly attached carrying handle i gave this to my son for christmas this year , and within one week of light use -lrb- carried his laptop , notebook and a paperback -rrb- , one side of the carrying handle ripped off he can still use it with the shoulder strap , but this kind of workmanship is not up to the multiple other lowepro bags i use primarily for cameras thumbs down on this one
note # / # : this review no longer applies this was originally written for their # . # `` bag , but it somehow ended up here with a # `` bag not sure what happened i have a # . # `` widescreen dell latitude d # , a fairly common business laptop , which does n't fit in this bag -lrb- it 's about half an inch too wide -rrb- other than that , the bag seemed well-constructed except for the shoulder straps and top handle , which seemed rather narrow on the positive side , the bag is lightweight , has a lot of pockets , looks pretty decent , has a cushioned back , and <unk> zippers i would 've kept it if not for the size issue guess i had to learn the hard way that `` most `` does n't mean `` all ``
summary - it 's really a good bag for the money you 'll pay it 's not the most sturdiest of the bags but gets the job done i like that there 's not a huge space to carry around junk my last bag used be # lbs cuz it could carry stuff overall - i 'll recommend this bag if you understand you 're getting the best bag for the money but not the best bag - light - sturdy - attractive design - <unk> - limited space - limited compartmentalization -lrb- is this a word - is not travel friendly ca n't tie it against to travel
i bought it a month ago works pretty well for me i can put my # `` notebook without a problem there is another pocket to put your ac power adapter , a mouse and some small items like cell phone , pens , notepads etc . it feels quite comfortable on my shoulder when loaded the materials seem like in a good quality except the two plastic locking devices that keep the cover close they are a little flimsy and seem that can break easily if they break you can not close the bag anymore because there is no zipper to close the inside pockets other than that it is a good buy for the low price i like the black and orange color too , looks great
bought this bag to travel on a bus to and from work with carrying my macbook pro # `` it fits -lrb- barely -rrb- and allows me room for a few basic items without being too bulky it was a great price and is a great item it 's the only bag i need for my daily travels
it definitely gets the job done ! # inch notebook fits perfectly as well as one book and a binder wish it could hold more and i wish that this could <unk> into a backpack and the it really would be perfect
perfect for my # . # `` macbook and plenty of room for the charger and accessories it has many features like backpacks , such as an elastic pocket , other velcro <unk> pockets nice area to put your id with a see through windows very well crafted , very light , very satisfied with this bag it looks so nice , i get compliments on it all the time
for the price it 's hard to beat this for smaller laptops . it could use a few more smaller compartments to organize things , but it 's good enough for the price i paid
i just got this bag because of the low price , but will be returning it due to a cosmetic defect on the front flap stitching i wanted to keep it but it just bothered me too much i 'll be buying another one though ... hopefully the new one wo n't have the same issue the bag is nice and i do like lowepro products it has good padding and plenty of pockets for all your extra stuff it 's not as roomy as i thought it would be i can fit my # . # `` textbook and binder in the main compartment ... more and you 're pushing it i 'm wondering if the reason it 's so cheap is because of the defect in the stitching
nice bag , with good construction and a comfortable shoulder strap my # `` laptop fits perfectly in the computer section , but the rest of the bag is much larger than i expected had i seen the bag before buying it , i would have skipped it and bought something a little smaller -lrb- it 's easier to see the size by looking at other colors -rrb- on the plus side , the extra space allows plenty of room for my external speakers , mouse , and any paperwork i might need
a great bag at a great price i did n't want something that was too big but then i did n't want just a sleeve either as such , this bag is the perfect compromise it fits my laptop , my business magazines and my notebook it 's a tiny bit cramped when i add my power cords but not so much so that it makes a big difference at least not to me anyway , i love it
ok , the bag does have some issues , but for $ # it 's tough to beat it 's very light , the laptop padding is adequate , and the pockets are well-placed and good size my main problem is with the strap i like to use the bag a bit as a messenger bag , strapped to my back unfortunately , the strap is too long , and it 's also stitched to the bag so it 's not easy to swap out
bought two of these for both my laptops fits the macbook pro # `` like a glove and does a great job with my # `` mac as well used to have a more <unk> laptop bag , but i like how this one is a little less rigid and is more comfortable to carry like others have said in their reviews , this bag will hold a lot of stuff i find it attractive , inexpensive , and an all around quality item
i recently picked up an acer # . # `` notebook and the fit is snug , but not too hard to slide in and out - and at the price , i had no way of going wrong holds my charging cord and a couple of books just fine - not a huge bag , but just the right size for what i need and i like the smaller form factor and less weight than some other bags also quite a few small accessory pockets to store keys , <unk> , etc . great lowepro quality for an unbelievable price
i have a small dell latitude d # and this bag was a great for for it lots of storage room , small zippered compartments were a big plus wonderful for business travel the bag was obviously well-constructed and is perfect for my needs
i <unk> looking for a new carry bag for my laptop and this was shown as a `` special `` on amazon since it was less than $ # i was n't expecting much i was pleasantly surprised the bag is high quality with a snug and protective slot for my laptop further , it has pockets galore and just where you need them i 'm very impressed and quite happy with the purchase
this is my first messenger bag , and i am very happy with my purchase fits a # `` laptop really well in the padded pocket + a book or two or a couple notebooks great for college or work quality is awesome the orange color on the inside actually looks really good in person would buy again if i need to easily worth the price
great case , just what i was looking for quality is excellent i highly recommend this company has a compartment that fits a laptop perfect the # nd compartment holds all my attachments and note pad
this computer bag is an excellent value it has a well padded pocket for a smaller sized computer as well as an additional full size pocket there are also multiple small compartments for smaller accessories the handle is a bit on the small size but feels sturdy the shoulder strap is well padded and comfortable the only slight drawback is the orange colored interior and a small amount of exterior stitching but for the price the whole bag could be <unk> <unk> green and i 'd be satisfied
i bought this messenger bag for $ # with shipping , so meeting my expectations was n't difficult and this bag has done that i have an ultraportable -lrb- dell e # -rrb- , so i was looking for a smaller bag and this suits me nicely it has quite a few small compartments for its size , including # zippered compartments for coins , etc . , # compartments for <unk> # <unk> devices , and room for notebooks or other <unk> items besides the laptop two nice features for an inexpensive bag are a webbed drink holder and a stabilizer strap for load stability
could n't have been more pleased with this product my previous messenger bag broke after a good # years of use and i was looking to replace it my price range was about $ # , but when i saw the $ # price tag and good reviews i thought i would give the lowepro bag a shot first day of use , it started pouring rain i thought i would give put the `` water resistance `` claim to the test all of the rain beaded right off of the surface , and after a decent amount of exposure ... everything inside was <unk> dry the bag is very well ergonomically designed , having many <unk> and pockets my # inch macbook pro rests inside and is well protected with padding on all sides
i 've used this bag daily for almost # years and it still looks like new very well made and durable not overly large , but big enough to carry a small laptop and a few other items i highly recommend it
this is a great laptop bag -lrb- from the maker of some of the best camera bags -rrb- it looks nice and decent even in an office environment the pads are placed on all sides except the top where it is more unlikely to hit the ground if you drop it nice adjustable shoulder strap with comfortable padding lots of pockets , some with velcros and some zippered feels really sturdy enough i love some of the small details like the zipper handles , rubberized grip , etc . my macbook # . # `` sits perfectly i do not have a # `` notebook but i could understand why some of the # `` notebooks would not fit my macbook is smaller and it just have a little wee room to spare
this bag is ok the color is totally different -- much darker than it appears in the photo and it 's a <unk> i bought it for a # . # inch laptop it had plenty of room for my computer and more , but it was just too huge for my frame i looked silly carrying it it 's a very casual bag and is very big
i 'm a fan of lowepro brand having cameras and video . . so i bought this bag originally based on the reviews , brand satisfaction and cost i have been satisfied with the bag and no regrets for the cost i have # `` mac the pockets are great my only disappointment , which is minor , is the bag does n't stand on it 's own well and leans towards the front but that 's very minor - great pockets , material , very roomy , affordable , stylish , and you have lowepro quality my coworker wants one
i love my bag , fits great tons of space and compartments for all my computer `` stuff `` and then my `` stuff . i only wish the colors were more true to the pic not as light of a color as i would have liked
i was looking for a laptop bag that would fit my lunch , a water bottle , # `` macbook pro and misc . papers , folders , etc . that was not black or bulky this fits the bill , and after several months of use still looks brand new reminds me of a timbuk # bag , but this bag is less expensive
a very well made computer bag good for school or light travel lots of room for books , note pads , pens , cell phone , ect will not protect computer from a big fall but will keep it safe from the normal bumps of a school campus overall , a very good bag for the price
i like this bag because it is n't the traditional drab black computer bag it fits my # `` hp snugly and i still have room for a ton of other things , including wires power cables , a mouse and a bunch of other things if you stuff it full , it can get a bit bulky , but you can put an entire office in this thing the strap is comfortable and comes with an optional strap to wear around your waist
i bought this bag for my big interview day i thought that it looks professional and would be what i was looking for unfortunately , this bag is a huge disappointment its to sturdy , uncomfortable to wear , heavy even when empty and the smell is awful it smells like plastic and no matter what i do i ca n't get rid of the smell i thought smell would subside by time , but no i feel it all around me when i am wearing this bag i wore it only at one of my interviews and felt embarrassed by the smell i was leaving behind i am so disappointed i would not recommend this bag to anyone
it 's a beautiful , expensive looking bag ; however , i am a teacher and carry a lot of papers to and from work this is not the back for me i need something more flexible so i can throw whatever in there this bag is very stiff - it requires careful organization of my items and i just ca n't do it back it goes
advertised as fitting a # inch laptop not even close -lrb- well kinda close -rrb- , i would have torn the corners if i forced it in it did slide into the part next to the padded sleeve even that was tight nice bag otherwise
this is an attractive bag but not in the least bit practical there is hardly any room inside , and it is difficult to get your hands in to find something small items slide down into the corners and simply disappear additionally , the handle covers the exterior zipper pocket making it hard to get to ; this defeats the purpose of having an exterior pocket , as they are intended for easy access not to mention that you have to fight the handle just to unzip that pocket the shoulder pad on the carrying strap moves frequently so i constantly have to adjust it i purchased this to for work but find that it is so inconvenient to get to my files and other essentials when in meetings that i would rather carry things in my hand i am truly disappointed
the picture is misleading the actual color is more pastel -lrb- baby aspirin orange -rrb- the leather is very stiff and the opening is very slight definitely not enough room to hold over a one inch
i had only <unk> using this bag for two weeks when the stitching in the strap pad came out it 's a pretty bag and i get a lot of complements on it but it is n't top quality leather
this bag is perfect for what i was looking for - a professional looking laptop bag with plenty of pockets and space to hold everything , while not looking bulky or manly two complaints : first , i commute over an hour each way to work on a train , and the bag is a little bit heavy definitely lighter than my bulky cloth targus bag that my company provided with the pc , but it becomes a little cumbersome after standing with it on my shoulder for an hour secondly , it may just be because the bag is new , but it is pretty stiff once you put the laptop in , it 's hard to get your hands all the way in -lrb- granted , i have pretty big hands -rrb- to reach in for a mouse , charger , etc . the separate pocket for <unk> <unk> . is less stiff and accessable from the outside
well made , solid construction very nice styling and design lots of pockets inside to organize only gripe is that it stinks of <unk> balls , even after owning it for a month and a half
this is a <unk> review i have n't used it yet as his is supposed to be my birthday present and i just <unk> inside the box to see if my laptop will fit in it it will not -lrb- by about half inch -rrb- but it 's not a problem , i will fix it somehow my appointment book and my leather binder fit in the bag perfectly , there is a space for my big wallet also what i liked the most is the front pocket easy access to the pocket where i will hold phone , keys and some make-up items is very important sturdy , should hold the shape will and beautiful color
i really like this bag very stylish with a lot of secure pockets for keys , cell phones , pens , and other small accessories i will echo most of the other reviews by saying that it is well made and classy , however i have two small gripes about it first , it 's a bit heavy i did not see this mentioned in the other reviews so i thought i 'd mention it for those concerned with having a heavy bag second , there is not much room for anything but a laptop i was hoping to use this as more of a book bag , but i can only comfortably fit my laptop , a small notebook , and a couple of folders still , it 's a great bag all around !
i have been stopped on two occasions asking where i purchased the bag - one person noted how expensive it appeared i use this everyday - good storage - high quality - great looking
happily it was larger than expected but very stylish and lots of compartments i bought it for my daughter-in-law who is a new school teacher she should look very polished and professional with her new tote
this is a great bag i get so many compliments on it i love that the front zipper opens all the way and the pockets are a perfect size . the lap top case is an extra bonus that makes this bag a must have
this is to be a gift for our daughter , who is a social worker -lrb- very few <unk> require more <unk> than her 's . this leather case is roomy enough for her laptop , files , and much more the addition of a removable shoulder-strap is what sold me on this particular case the red color is a <unk> , not <unk> it has a stylish , classic look would look just as great with a pair of jeans , as it would with business attire the leather is pretty stiff right now , but i <unk> it <unk> up , with time and wear , into a <unk> comfortable <unk>
i bought this for mothers ' day for my mom and she loved it i kind of got jealous because it really was very classy and nice i 'd recommend this for all the professional women its also not too flashy and shiny , its just right
my wife got this to accessorize for a job interview , she got the job really what more do you want out of it its a very nice bag and the quality is just top notch
i love this briefcase the color is perfect for my <unk> <unk> custom jewelry independent designer position i received many compliments on it as well it is a little stiff , but good quality i can fit a # ring binder and other folders and catalogs inside the side zipper compartment is nice for organizing pens , a calculator and business cards i am very happy with this purchase it was a great buy at an amazing price
i finally gave up a # year old computer <unk> that was really getting worn instead of just getting something cheap that will wear out i decided to invest in this one and i was not disappointed it fits my computer plus a few books and has nice pockets for whatever else you would need at a business meeting or just to travel with your i pad , computer and books it does have a shoulder strap the color is <unk> like shown and i think i will get many good years out of this one
this briefcase is gorgeous and very sturdy pleased with the quality and appearance it is a bit small - with my laptop -lrb- it is a dell and a tad chunky -rrb- and bulky power cord in it there is barely room for a small notebook without the laptop there would be room for carrying quite a lot of paper , but you have to pick and choose
i love this bag it 's well made and has plenty of room for my laptop , ipad , and marketing materials the color is fresh and <unk> i just bought a second one for my daughter
when i needed a new briefcase i looked on amazon and there were so many but this one is <unk> color , short and long straps , many compartments , all the features you need
i would recommend this beautiful bag to anyone who is looking for a unique briefcase i have had several coworkers comment on how much they love it incredibly spacious and the handles and strap make it easy to carry
this case seems like it would be great except there is no protection on the inside from the zipper to prevent your computer from getting scratched also , the pocket on the outside is too small to fit anything other than maybe a couple cds -lrb- but no jewel cases -rrb- this is an example of a product with good materials and good intentions but seriously bad design they dropped the ball
the product delivered looks like it had been left in the sun for months it looks faded and <unk> it is also very light and has a sloppy feel not sure it will get used
fits my # & # # ; macbook air quite well i also like the front pocket that holds the power cord and a few other accessories it did have a bit of an odor when i first received it , but it has since dissipated all in all , i like it
i got this because of the side storage pocket , and this has worked out well i can keep jump drives and the power cord in there it is slightly small for my # . # `` macbook , therefore best suited for the # `` i was confused by the labeling on the product at the time , as the same product in different colors was all for # . #
i have two of these one i use with a acer aspire timeline as # t- # and another that 's smaller that is used with a msi wind u # the pocket on the side i usually use for small cables -lrb- headphones , zune connection cable , android phone cable , etc -rrb- i 've had the # . # `` case for awhile and it 's held up very good i 'm giving the case a # because as someone mentioned there is nothing to keep the zipper from scratching the computer from the inside with that said i have n't really noticed any scratching but definitely see how its very possible others have mentioned using the pocket to hold their power plugs ... the pocket stretches so i can see doing that however i have n't tried it as it would seem to be quite bulky
- the sleeve holds my # -inch macbook pro snugly - the pocket on front holds my charger and my usb wireless <unk> - i ca n't leave my usb mouse dongle in my computer and put it in the sleeve even though the dongle sticks out about an <unk> of an inch - even though it holds my mouse and charger , it does n't have enough room for my portable external hard drive overall a great product it does what it 's supposed to do and does it well i feel as though the cons that i suggested were a bit & # # ; <unk> & # # ; and not real problems with the product
i bought this for my macbook pro , and it fits perfectly my laptop is snug inside , and seems well-protected i also like the outside pocket it 's not very wide , but offers enough space for the charger , a flash drive , and usb cord the material on the interior is great padding for the laptop my only complaint is the handle it 's kind of awkward to hold the laptop with that short handle i would either prefer it to have no handle at all , or something longer that could at least be strapped on your shoulder or something
works great for our lenovo yoga pro # it is a little tight on the corners , but the pocket in front is large enough to hold the charger and headphones
i use this on my toshiba ultrabook the case is a bit too tall , but the toshiba fits in snugly if it had a shoulder strap , i would have given it # stars
i gave it to my wife for her macbook and it was perfect however , she still managed to wedge it between something a crack the screen so if possible , a neoprene sleeve with molded hard resin made for notebooks would be a dream this way the book would not get crushed so easy
i purchased this case for my toshiba satellite t # -s # <unk> # . # -inch ultrathin laptop -lrb- black -rrb- its a slim case that i place in my backpack when traveling my # . # inch computer is a near perfect fit , with a little room left , which is fine its built well the zippers seem strong and the extra compartment holds a few cords and my mouse but the power cord may not fit in the pouch with a mouse it does not have a strong odor like the caselogic case i had to return
this sleeve is a very snug fit , which is what i wanted for my macbook the zippered front pocket is nice to have i really like the fact that it has a carrying strap also , the logo is <unk> just enough on one side so that you can grab the case out of your bag without having it slip out of your hand the designers seem to have thought this one through very well
got this laptop case for my macbook pro and it works great the fit is a bit snug -lrb- and may be tough to get the laptop in and out -rrb- , but it protects it extremely well the front pocket is nice for papers and small things the charger is a bit too bulky to fit in the pocket -lrb- in my opinion -rrb- overall , great product though
i ordered this case because i did n't want to spend $ # - $ # for a case in the mac store it 's a great case fits perfect , very well made , would highly recommend
i had to return the first one because the zipper clamp was too loose and the zipper tab would fall off amazon was very good about replacing it at no charge and no shipping the # nd one was fine fit and quality are good and i was even able to attach a shoulder strap that i had from a larger bag i highly recommend i got this one <unk> it had an external pocket which is handy
this sleeve seems to fit my asus ul # a pretty good it is a tight enough fit from side to side i had to remove my mouse dongle which is only about a half an inch long the package it comes in says it is made for the mac # in . but it works with mine so thats not a problem it also has a nice little zipper compartment to hold extra stuff the strap is big enough to slide up around your wrist and carry it like that
i bought this item recently and like it very much i like the neoprene construction and the design very well and it seemed like good overall protection for my valuable computer investment for the small amount of money that it cost me i also like the color of the sleeve -lrb- black -rrb- i also like the full length style of external zippered storage for my extra items very much it even has a strong strap to grab on to while the sleeve is carried outside of my computer backpack -lrb- <unk> maxxum -rrb- it seems very well constructed with high quality zippers and should last a long time in my opinion
this sleeve works perfectly with my macbook pro , which has a # inch screen i love the color , the size , the handle , and even how it feels great deal to <unk> a minimalist way to transport a laptop
this has good protection for the macbook air and is exactly the right size i like the handles that <unk> you to easily carry the case and laptop most of these types of cases do not have handles and so you have to carry them under your arm the front pocket is just large enough for a charger and a couple cables , but do n't expect to fit much in it
the case logic nylon laptop backpack -lrb- <unk> # <unk> -rrb- is a small to medium sized backpack and seems to be well made i wish it had many more pockets and that i would have immediately returned this backpack as soon as i had received it it falls forward no matter what -lrb- if anything -rrb- is inside the backpack the design is horrible and it drives me crazy i just wanted a backpack for the gym & travel - this is not the one ! ! i have <unk> the shoulder straps in every way possible to offset the toppling but the base is not large enough to support backpack i can not take it anymore ... today i bought another this case logic backpack will be dropped off at goodwill
the design is definitely comfortable on my back and shoulders - great padding and weight distribution my dell is happily <unk> in the downside - not much room for anything else but the basics - pda , a file or two , phone i 'm used to being able to get a change of clothes and shoes into my bag with my laptop of course that might be why my last screen did n't live long
for the price , this backpack is great it 's perfect for what i needed it for -lrb- laptop and misc office needs -rrb- and is much more fuctional than the computer case that i had it makes lugging my computer on business trips much less cumbersome and trying on my back great service and fast shipping as always
bought this for transporting my lap-top as i was touring europe and needed something practical and not too big to protect my lap-top good quality , lightweight , perfect size for someone who does n't want a huge heavy backpack to carry around good compartments , everything you need still looks new and has been well used
the backpack is well designed , and perfect for a laptop and several books it is comfortable even with heavy staff it is not as big as it seems in the picture
i had a different laptop backpack that i 've owned for over a year , but i never had a laptop to put in it i just used it as a regular backpack but when i finally got my # `` laptop , it did n't fit in my old bag well , it fit , but you had to pull the zipper pretty tight and it felt like it was going to snap so i did a lot of research , skeptical if i was going to find a backpack that my laptop would fit comfortably in after reading good reviews on this bag - and happy with the price -lrb- compared to the $ # + bags best buy sells -rrb- , i gave it a shot it does n't look much bigger than my old bag , but i was pleasantly surprised to see my laptop fit in it perfectly not only that , but it has a very `` skinny `` profile , so you do n't look like the <unk> of <unk> <unk> with this on your back that said , even with the skinny profile , everything i had in my old bag fits perfectly in this one very satisfied - and i 'll be testing it out on a business trip soon , so i 'm anxious to see how well it holds up on the plane and carrying it to and from hotels
i have a really nice heavier duty one by targus , but prefer this one my laptop is only # `` and fits easily into this backpack this one , while having less storage space , fits easily under the seat of a commercial <unk> ... my heavier duty targus does not very light weight , durable , and has adjustable straps just get it if you have a small laptop and fly great design and a joy to carry if you are backpacking in the <unk> and want to carry everything for a day trip , the targus is superior if you are flying coast to coast , this is the one you want
i found that with the dvd on one side and the <unk> on the other side i had a very hard time <unk> the zipper i threw out the box and material or i would have sent it back
a # `` player barely fits with no room at all the pocket is simply not big enough for the power cord , headphones , and remote i struggle to get the zipper closed and the seams are bulging i think no bigger than a # `` player would be best i 'm buying the # `` bag for the extra space
