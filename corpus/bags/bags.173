the sleeve is roomy , i have a belkin hard case and smart cover on my ipad and it fits comfortably in the sleeve without me having to remove the protective case i can also keep my headphones and usb cable in it as well i feel more secure carrying my ipad around , i am glad i bought it the wrist band is n't very trustworthy but i personally would n't feel comfortable dangling it from the wrist band
product came within a week , regular delivery i was excited to get it so fast . ipad case is better than i thought it 's got a soft feel to it reminds me of a wetsuit material high quality zipper
this would not protect my tablet from a fall but it does protect it from scratches in my bag good enough for me since i put a rubber protective cover on it
the black and white butterflies floral netbook laptop sleeve looks exactly like the picture , is pretty , and will hide dirt that accumulates from travelling and throwing it in my tote it is not as padded as the one i had to replace , but will sufficiently protect from scratches , which is why i bought it it is somewhat bigger than my ipad , even with a smart cover on it although i would have liked a little bit more snug fit , the roomier fit makes it easy to pull on my ipad and leaves room for small items such earphones , some gum or money
i bought this for my new ipad # rd generation the quality of the material is ok when you compare with the price however its a bit bigger for the ipad on both sides -lrb- ~ # inch top and # . # inch side -rrb- however , this might be <unk> sometimes if you <unk> to use a ipad smart cover and also want to carry your charging cable , stylus , camera connection kit etc with your ipad during travel
i bought this last minute for my # . # in asus netbook before going backpacking and hiking it 's nothing special but it was perfect for what i needed - a cover for my computer so it would not get scratched when tossed in my backpack i think it 's a `` fits most `` style there is no side pocket at anything for extra stuff you might want near your computer at all times however there is extra room inside in the case -lrb- with my # . # in asus -rrb- so i actually had space to keep the power cord in there with the computer , as to not loose it
i purchased this sleeve for <unk> mini # nr netbook -lrb- red -rrb- so that it would n't get scratched or banged around so much inside my tote bag i carry my netbook with me pretty often and i generally just toss it in my bag on my way out the door this sleeve slides on and off easily and is the perfect fit for the hp mini i did get a little over <unk> with the sipper and tore a little hole near the carrying handle , but it was easily <unk> and totally my fault for being in a hurry i also got lots of compliments on the sleeve while i was traveling recently for a business conference , even the airport attendant who checked my items at the scanner said it was a pretty nice design :
this netbook sleeve is great it fits my hp # . # inch netbook perfectly and looks really sharp too i 'd highly recommend one of these to any looking for a sleeve to keep their netbook looking great and easy to carry around with them
i needed something to protect my ipad # from getting scratched in my purse this cover works perfectly for that purpose but i am very careful about not dropping it as this cover provides no drop or bump protection for the ipad i love that is zips shut , good product for the price
this is a nice case for a little money do n't expect a hardshell style with this ... it is a <unk> , neoprene case that does the job well if you are looking for something light weight to <unk> your portable dvd or similar size item great color for my lady 's dvd player , a white toshiba . -rcb- : o
i was afraid it would be too roomy for my # rd generation ipad because it says it fits notebooks , but it fits my ipad well just a little room in there in case you want to put the data cable or something -lrb- or if you have your ipad already in a <unk> case , like mine -rrb- you could fit the whole <unk> in there if you wanted , but i like to keep mine flat and put it in my purse
i was looking for an ipad cover for weeks and finally came across this one for a great price it fits perfect and for the price i got it for it ca n't be beat
i bought for my <unk> tablet this is very pretty and very girlie i love that it has a strap to it and i can put it in my purse
i bought this a little over a year ago after about # months one of the corners on the lower piece cracked i wrote to speck and they shipping me another one right away . # months later now , the replacement one similarly cracked i 'm not hard on the case at all . # % of the time my machine is sitting on my desk the fit is great it looks great but they have n't figured out how to get plastic this thin to withstand the forces involved with such a tight fit for more than # months i may try one more time with the warrantee to get another # months out of the purchase
the plastic tabs that <unk> clip over the sides of the laptop chipped within a matter of months -lrb- and i 'm not <unk> this airbook around ; i carry it in a padded case -rrb- the bottom stays on if i 'm careful , and the case still protects the computer i like the color enough to put up with the cracking case , but i 'm not sure i 'd buy this product again
i bought the speck case for my air when i got it it 's very sleek looking , but not particularly sturdy one of the little clip parts that holds the case on the computer snapped off after a couple weeks of use , and the case has been slowly but steadily falling apart since now -lrb- a year and a half later -rrb- half of the clip things are gone and the case has cracked in several places it still stays on and protects the surface of the computer , but given how expensive these cases are i would have expected it to hold up better
i got this case less than # months ago it looks nice , lightweight , great feel but the corners are cracking already one corner has broken and now has a sharp edge to it just sent a complaint email to speck it 's a great case i just wish it would last a lot longer !
i like the cover , and feel a lot more comfortable about taking my macbook air out and about it 's attached pretty well and does n't want to come off easily , yet it does come off if i need to clean underneath the heat transfer seem so to be pretty good too , so overall it 's a worthwhile investment
i have had the laptop protectors on my # inch mba since mid november i put a snow white decal on <unk> front , she is holding up the lit up apple sign i got the red case so that she can be <unk> holding a red apple , it looks amazing even though i treat my laptop like a <unk> , there are about four very tiny cracks running down the edges of the <unk> case in my opinion , they are not too <unk> i plan on keeping the case for a bit longer because it continues to do its job of protecting the laptop i 'm thinking of getting the green case next and putting a big <unk> sticker decal on the front about to eat the lit up apple sign , you can imagine how awesome that would look :
i was not sure what to expect when i bought this product and i was really leery about ordering it i decided that i would bite the bullet and purchase it i was very happy i did it fits my # inch macbook air like a glove it gives it protection and adds a wonderful element of color to my macbook i am very satisfied with my purchase and if you 're looking to add a little color to your macbook you should really consider this product
i returned this incase sleeve which i purchased on amazon it was advertised as being for the macbook air # inch , but fact it was much too tight a fit i could barely get the end flap to cover the computer and when it did , there was a gap between the flap and the rest of the sleeve i think this sleeve was made to be a tight fit for a notebook , not the # inch air when i returned it , i sent j & r a note explaining the problem the returns department was helpful in explaining how to return it i have purchased other items from j & r and found them to be reliable my <unk> was with the sleeve not with j & r
was not what i expected i was looking for a zip around sleeve and this <unk> of an envelope sleeve which has a gap at the opening that you can not close up i would return it but it would cost me $ # to return it of the $ # i paid
the slip over closure is <unk> too tight to allow easy coverage of the open end of the computer you have to stretch it to almost the ripping point before you can have complete closure of the sleeve several times , i hurt my fingers while pulling hard on the cover to close up the sleeve it is only a matter of time before the <unk> cover eventually rips a very bad design indeed lesson learned - next time pay more to buy one with a real zipper closure
very thin construction i was never able to get my macbook air into it - i stretched it to its limit and was afraid i would never get it out so i packed it up and returned it
it does its job of protecting my apple air , but a pain to get it in and out ... would much rather have something that i can zip or fasten then fold , like this one has
this is not what i expected it is covered with a wax that turns white there is large white marks all over this case and it looks a real
this case started to break within a few months after one year , the case is completely unusable extreme rip off for this company paid $ # for a piece of flimsy plastic that does n't protect my computer
i loved the way this case looked out of the box - very sleek and the see through satin looked nice it worked great after the first few months , but now , # months later i have cracks in every corner of the product and the bottom shell no longer stays on well i am careful with my laptop in general , so seeing this case literally disintegrate before my eyes has been disappointing this was my first interaction with a speck product and unfortunately i ca n't give it a great review great props to the design team , but hopefully they can find more a more durable plastic for future <unk> of this case
i bought this about # months ago when i bought my macbook air a few weeks after , the pieces that clip onto the laptop started chipping and eventually fell off now , i have to shop for a new case because the corners are chipped off and the case no longer stays in place
i love the way this case looks but after only a couple of months this case is cracking in multiple places on both the top and bottom i am so careful with my laptop , and just with normal use this case is falling apart i would totally recommend not buying this product
i 've had this for a while and think it 's a lousy product after a short time the back cover began falling off all the time the front cover stays on fine but the back cover will never stay on nothing on it is broken it just wo n't stay on only two adults use this computer so not abused by children
it 's a beautiful case i 'd love to say it was a fluke that it broke but i ca n't because i 'm unable to exchange it for a new case i 've had it for just under a month on a computer that gets used # x per week and the snaps that hold the bottom in place are broken if i could exchange it maybe i could <unk> its praises but for now i 'd have to recommend that anyone that wants a durable product that lasts look elsewhere
this case broke within two months of use and i am not someone who is rough with my things i always carry my computer in a laptop bag and the case still cracked very disappointed in the cost of this product and how much use i actually got out of it
this is my second time buying this product i made the same mistake twice because i loved the sleekness of the product however if you move your laptop around alot between your daily activities the bottom cover will eventually come off frequently
very hopeful for this product but alas , the speck is clearly designed only to reduce scratches not to protect well from bumps <unk> the <unk> of the cover allows for an elegant apple logo transparency but at a cost - sturdy protection after a few months , side tabs broke resulting in poor fit opening the laptop cover catches the back tabs on the base , requiring constant adjustments love the look but not the fit or meager protection for my needs , too flimsy
there was part of the case that did n't really snap-on to the computer too well i was constantly worried it would catch on something and break the case is good but not great others available are better designed to avoid the & # # ; <unk> & # # ; area
first off , i love speck products i have been a fan since purchasing my first similar soft touch shell for my macbook pro # & # # ; several years ago - perfect fit and it stays on however , the macbook air shell , specifically the bottom piece , keeps slipping off when i carry the laptop i am not sure if there is much that speck or any other mfg can do about this , due to how thin the macbook air is just a little disappointing
love the color , but the bottom piece was problematic -- it made my macbook run really hot and the tabs broke off after a couple weeks anyway i still use the top piece , but i expected more from speck
i actually dropped my macbook air the other day , and it came through just fine however , this is the second one of these i 've had to buy , because bottom piece of the first one cracked , and it kept slipping off the computer
dh loves this case on his macbook air he takes his air a lot of different places and did n't want to risk getting it scratched up - this case is lightweight and fits the bill
i 've had speck for my past three macbooks : macbook , mb pro , and now mb air i 've always been fond for the & # # ; feel & # # ; of speck on my macbooks and it really does it jobs the only con i could think of is having to clean out the inside of the casing every few months as dirt and dust naturally accumulates through the crevices
i had one of these on my macbook air previously but as with all things used for protection after awhile they tend to wear out and look shoddy i bought this one to replace my old shell and must say that speck has improved the overall quality of the see-thru satin soft touch shell great looking way to protect your macbook
its a great case overall the only downside to this case is when you set the screen to a specific angle , it may lean back without you touching it the case adds weight to the screen other than that i recommend this case to anyone that wants to protect from a few <unk> and scratches
after browsing on the internet and directly on the stores , i finally decided for the satin touch cover for my macbook air # & # # ; i ordered in black color at amazon but received it in green color , i sent it back with no problem because i really needed it , i went to the apple store and purchased it there -lrb- $ # more dollars than in amazon -rrb- the installation was easy , just press and clip the # covers , then press the edges all around an that 's it it was installed in # minutes my computer looks great , and the & # # ; <unk> mixed with hard-plastic & # # ; feeling is also great , it never slips from my hand i definitively would recommend this product to any one
i love the color & the material the only complaint i truly have is that i wish there would have been maybe a little pocket inside for my charge cord to stash away in i am now looking at purchasing a cord holder so it will be neat & tidy if you are not in need of storage for a charge cord , then this will be perfect for you hopefully they will come up with a design like i have mentioned i do like it though :
we purchased this cover for a gift to go with the gift of the kindle -lrb- plain kindle -rrb- we purchased however , it was a lot bigger than the kindle itself it is definitely not for the newer versions of the kindle
my ipad mini fits into this sleeve with any of the covers i have some more snugly then others but not too tight it provides a decent amount of protection and is great to carry around it has a small pocket for an id card or similar inside wish it had a pocket on the outside that would make it a # for me
got the for my kindle i . the same pattern as my purse & i have gotten tons of compliments on the bag & this case ! i love it ! i see many more vera 's in my future since vera 's r a my # year old will carry !
i actually purchased this sleeve for my nook e-reader and yes it has some room left over however i 'm really particular with my electronics and probably a little over protective with them , so my nook has a hard cover on it as well i normally use this sleeve when i travel with the nook and there is enough room to put my clip on light as well as the power cord in there the colors are fun and happy looking i absolutely love it and have no complaints about it at all its perfect for my needs and definitely a great buy
i love the color of this tablet cover my samsung galaxy tablet # . # fits perfect inside this cover and i dont need to take the case off to put inside this . so glad it is zip close
i bought this case to hold my kindle paperwhite the case is a little big for the device but i do n't mind because it allows me to fit in a few pieces of paper or other items the padding of the case provides great protection for the kindle and the design is lovely very happy with my purchase
i purchased this for my kindle -lrb- just the basic kindle -rrb- it is slightly too big -lrb- meaning no snug fit -rrb- , but i wanted something just to hold the kindle during transport to protect it i prefer to read without a case on the kindle i love lime 's up - it 's fun , vibrant colors i also have the matching light this sleeve has a nice cushioning and the zipper opening is half of the sleeve -lrb- as shown in the picture -rrb-
this is a beautiful cover and a very handy way to carry my kindle around i 've been doing a lot of traveling back and forth to the hospital for my husband , and i can read wherever i go delivered quickly and in perfect condition
i loveeee me some vera bradley and any reason to get more , and this was a deal i could n't pass up after i got my kindle , i started looking right away for a case in a vera <unk> print that was n't too pricey , and this case does the job i love it it fits perfectly you actually have some breathing room , which i did n't think i 'd like , but i do and because of this , i keep my charger right in the case i 'm a little worried about it stretching , but id rather have it right in the case , then end up losing it and the color was just too cute , and the price was awesome ! i could n't say no
yeah , it 's a big plastic snap on accessory looks cool , feels really cool , worth it as i found it on sale white one is ok , i would of preferred the black one makes it a little heavier but protective and does n't look too silly
this case is great it snaps onto the laptop easily and stays secure the only drawback is that the bottom of the case is very slick and does not stay in place if the laptop is on an angle not too big of a issue , just a bit annoying overall this is a great product
high quality product , nice grip looks awesome too , especially when the apple logo is lit up there are no defects as far as i can see , really an exceptional product , did n't expect that though the clips look fragile i have n't experienced a problem yet and have put quite a bit of strain on the case
incase <unk> hard-shell -lrb- black -rrb- is tops , easy to install , looks great and provides excellent protection for my macpro from working in <unk> <unk> , to using in class , and working from home <unk> shipped fast , and totally recommend
if you want a slim , tight fitting , durable , and sleek <unk> is it strong , yet adds virtually no weight -- fits the # `` macbook pro perfectly and provides very good protection i think the perforations are important to heat <unk> <unk> <unk> other covers and add a <unk> `` <unk> `` look
this is the second cover like this one that i have bought and i will say that i would keep buying them in the future not only is it sturdy and keeps the laptop from getting scratched , but my kids actually think it 's a cool looking cover and their friends also like it it snaps on in seconds and it has a perfect fit both of my mac books look and feel great with the covers on i would highly recommend this cover
albeit i 've only just put the case on my initial thoughts are it 's pretty well built and has a really snug fit there is a opening for everything also really easy to assemble
replacing a hard clear plastic cover after # / # years the clear plastic cover cracked , i am hard on laptop computers so i have no complaints had the battery and the track pad replaced , added this cover just like having a new computer looks good and fixes the power connection interference that i had on the old clear plastic cover
# years ago i bought one incase hard shell case and it fitted my macbook # `` just <unk> perfect and after # years it still fits great and i love it this new hard shell is very good quality product and looks great , but i can say i expected a little bit more than i get it 's only # % perfect - sometimes my macbook pro # `` desktop part -lrb- with keyboard -rrb- gets out of case and i have to fix it it 's ok , i can live with this
love the case so far , had it for a week now and it looks really cool on the mbp # `` the material quality has a nice rubbery finish and weighs in at # grams -lrb- i couldnt find this info anywhere prior to actually getting the case -rrb- the fit on the bottom piece is perfectly flush with the shape of my mac , but on the top piece it bulges slightly outward this case does provide better grip than the original mbp rubber feet and does n't seem to make my macbook run hotter overall i really like the case for my purpose which is protecting my mbp in a backpack instead of sticking it in a sleeve to avoid scratches
i got this to replace my speck case for my macbook pro it protects the exterior of the laptop exactly as expected and looks good provides access to all key parts of the laptop and is lightweight
well it wo n't change your life but it looks awesome its made of plastic with a thin rubber like coating on it which gives it a little grip the coating will come off in places that get wear and tear mine is coming off on the bottom corners from rubbing against the zipper of my backpack you ca n't really see it unless your really close because the plastic underneath is black as well it 's perforated so there is holes in it these holes wo n't protect from spills and can get crumbs in them , but i 'm pretty messy and have only had to pick out two crumbs in a month so it 's not that big of a deal the case fits great and does n't move around the main reason you need this case is it just looks cool you will probably sit there and stare at your computer closed for # minutes and just think about how <unk> awesome your `` new `` macbook pro looks
just got the case today , have to say i absolutely love it matte finish is visually smooth but provides excellent grip the overall look is better than the macbook on it 's own fits extremely well , very snug nothing but props to incase on this one
this is a great shell i thought i would only use it sometimes , but now that it is on there , i like the way it looks so much that i never take it off it was easy to install , it shipped fast , and it looks , acts , and feels like it is of high quality my only complaint is that it does add quite a bit of weight to my # `` mbp still , # stars
i love this case it is sleek cool and keeps my macbook # `` looking great this is a truly awesome case it keeps my macbook cool because of the perforated holes which is great i highly recommend this case
while i like the look of the bag , it has a few problems the strap is very cheap looking and shiny the metal loop holding the strap in place bent within a day of normal use -lrb- my laptop is heavy , but not that heavy -rrb- , making the strap useless the laptop sleeve is also not padded at all i was very disappointed in this , and am returning it
very cool looking but within a few months the stitching started coming apart , the skull on the front fell off and and gold clips that close the front pocket fell off also i do not recommend this if you plan to hold a laptop in it everyday , it is definitely just for style
when i read the review left before me , i was a bit scared to place the order , but it looked good online , so i thought i would give it a shot i received it in a very timely manner and was pleased to see that it is all that the picture shows it as i bought it as a christmas present for my boyfriend and he loved it even more than i did this is a great bag
i use this as my large camera bag and it is perfect it has a skull and <unk> on it which is so cool i love a pirate theme and really am into the skull designs that seem so popular these days the clasps are really nice and the bag is super stellar
i am a freshman in <unk> and this bag has fit most of my books but at times it could n't be closed i normally carry about # pounds and this bag could do it but after ten weeks of school the zipper has broken , it has ripped in some places , the ribbons are fraying , and the pirate fell of this is a very nice bag if you do n't use it as much as i have my one complaint is that it does n't have any shoulder padding which would have been nice
the graphic is cute , but the item arrived with an unbearable stench which gave me a serious headache it was still there for a while , up until i returned it because i could n't stand it anymore
i purchased this to act as added insulation inside my laptop backpack so the zipper had to be on the side . i could n't beat the price and did n't care about the graphic on its outside which is a touch feminine for my tastes and will never be seen in a perfect world the case would have been made with memory foam for more impact protection and would have had carrying loops that folded back just like my <unk> cover/sleeve for my # `` mbp too bad they do n't make a # `` version
i love this item the most , got it for the picture , reminds me of my girlfriend . its just a little too big ... right size but a little <unk> ... i still use it and its cool item ... . . wish i would have the size <unk>
good quality and looks just like the picture slightly loose for my laptop but it is a # `` one so expected it anyway but has some cushioning effect to make it better
this is a <unk> case the gray color helps with the clean look it 's different and it 's very feminine my <unk> is using it with her toshiba # . # inch laptop and it has the perfect size
after having used the product for about # months on a daily basis , the left bottom corner is starting to wear quite heavily , although it is still holding up so far and the laptop remains fully covered also in one corner the stitching of the upper ` flap ' is starting to let loose it seems to me the product was not designed or manufactured to last feels like a cheap ` made in china ' just after a few months , while it looked really neat when i first got it i think something like this should last for years , and certainly not start to tear just after a few months the tear is entirely due to normal use , it <unk> up gradually
i 'm surprised not a single review <unk> this but lint is a serious problem with this case the fit is great and i love that it does n't have any zippers but the plush like material inside creates so much lint it 's unbelievable just sliding the computer in and out of the case a few times caused lint to build up and stick to the black material at the opening of the case computers get filled with lint over time on there own ; i do n't need a case to help it along this process quicker i will be returning this item
this sleeve is very well made , but the fit for my macbook air # . # was too tight it was very hard to remove the computer once you squeezed it inside the sleeve i can just imagine trying to get it out of the sleeve and then put it back at the airport ... not good i sent it back
for me , not as good as the incase neoprene sleeve this one is coming apart where the flap meets the main part does n't feel as nice after long use and the ` design ' is n't very attractive to me it has been protecting my macbook air well for a year though
macbook air -lrb- # . # `` -rrb- fits just right and tight in this case the case has proper cushioning to avoid any scratches on the surface but is no better than that unfortunately , i dropped my air from a two feet height and it landed on the thin edge i was shocked to see that it <unk> a hole in the case was expecting it to be better than that
good fit for my asus zenbook prime # . # `` it will definitely protect against scratches and provide just a tad bit of cushioning beyond that , but sleeve material is very soft the sleeve is `` floppy `` if that makes sense so do n't expect this to pull serious duty also , slightly heavier than i had hoped
used on travels for mac air no case on laptop and it fits this sleve with ease i even have one of those tiny usb drive sticking out one of the ports and it will fit in this case without removing it
after reading the other reviews , i decided this was the case to buy , but it does have one major downside it only opens from the one side pictured , so you can not slide your computer into and out of the case while keeping it in a backpack the flap that you use to cover the edge of the computer where the case opens is also somewhat tight , so it does n't just slide in like i imagined it would this is a great case and the inside is padded so your computer does not get scratched , but it does have drawbacks to its opening design
this sleeve provides good protection and is very lightweight but i find that it is a little difficult to slide the macbook air into the sleeve because of the design of the closing flap i am not sure how long the flap cover will last from the wear caused by sliding the laptop into the sleeve
this product was just delivered and upon opening it i was mildly disappointed it is advertised as having a zipper free design but i did n't realize that it would n't have any mechanism for keeping it closed besides the tension of a tight fit and the fit is tight , which hopefully means that after it stretches out a bit from use that it will continue to stay closed i also had hoped for a little bit more padding as this feels a bit like a scratch protector not a laptop case all that said build quality is good , it keeps the macbook air slim and is one of the better looking cases i have been able to find i may return this due to the lack of closure and padding but if you want something that provides simple scratch protection with simple styling this would be a great product for you
i really like this case , i am just kinda bummed out that it does n't fit my macbook air with a cover on it it is very very snug it 's one or the other
i wanted an affordable protective case for my # `` macbook air . so far this has been perfect . i feel much better when putting my laptop in my backpack while it has this cover on
overall , this case provides great protection for my air , and is easy to switch between bags there 's just one small problem after using the case for # months , i 've noticed that the thicker border of the fabric at the flap rubs into my computer , and left a light mark it 's not really noticeable , and only from a certain angle , but you may want to consider this before buying
i needed something to protect my new macbook air -lrb- summer # model -rrb- from getting scratched up while in my bag this sleeve did the trick as another reviewer mentioned , it 's a snug fit but i consider that a good thing the only thing i worry about is that the little flap at the top is n't fastened to the rest of the case so it 's possible that something could sneak up through that fold and get in the case it 's a relatively minor quibble but just beware if you are somewhat careless when throwing this in your bag
after the usual online research , i selected this product to protect my new macbook air # . # while it 's in my larger carrying case used for other stuff as well i was aware that it is sized for the macbook air # , so i expected it to fit loosely for a sleeve within another case , it 's fine it 's just another layer of protection the fold-over top is easy to open to remove my macbook without the need to remove the sleeve from the larger case too in a perfect world they would have a smaller version for the macbook air # . # , and it would fit more snugly
i ordered this cover for my acer aspire s # this case has a very snug fit the inside material is very soft , if only this company made sleeping bags the only downside is that there are no pouches to store additional accessories , but since it is a form-fitting sleeve , you should n't expect it to anyways very light weight and easy to tug around by itself or alongside a note pad
i got this for my dell xps and it fits like a glove very simple and offers great protection i only got it so i could throw it in whatever bag i choose and not worry about the computer i figure i will carry the charger and/or mouse in the bag and all i really want to protect is the computer this system works out great the product is high quality and i ca n't think of anything wrong with it
it does exactly what it 's supposed to it provides enough cushion to give it some extra protection without taking up too much space made out of quality materials , and works great i definitely recommend this one
very good case for the macbook air - close fitting , lots of padding downfall is probably how to insert the macbook air into the case - best way to describe it is a sort of pillow in a <unk> entry , but otherwise - excellent product
this fits my # `` mba just great it is easy to remove it and put it back in , and if you leave the flap behind the laptop , you can still charge it it 's not too snug ; there 's enough room to use this case if you `` permanently `` mount a sd card
having just bought a brand spanking new macbook air , i wanted to keep this thing in great condition for as long as i could this sleeve fits the bill fairly priced , and does a much better job than any incase neoprene sleeve i agree that inserting the macbook air into the sleeve takes a little getting used to , but definitely a much better solution than sleeves with zippers that might scratch your precious computer around the corners this case also fits perfectly into my swissgear ibex backpack , and i feel safe lugging this thing around anywhere i would definitely buy it again
