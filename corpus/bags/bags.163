i use this item to display earrings at promotional sales the bags are clear so the customer can see them clearly , plus the bag is thick so the customer is not stuck by the <unk> post i would recommend this item to others
it is a great design , but it is not very sturdy there is not enough padding in the bag itself to protect from accidental falls also , the carrying handle -lrb- not the strap is attached to the inside of the bag , making it useless because you have to keep the bag open to access it
the picture on the bag is great and unique that 's the only good thing about this its made cheap and is very thin with cheap stitching unable to use handles because you cant zip the bag closed and access the handles it will not protect from drop damage you can fit some other items with lap top but it <unk> the bag which cause problems with storage in the car highly suggest that you shop for a different bag than this
my laptop has a few scratches but this is overall great the strap feels soft and i get complimented on the design each time i take my laptop somewhere in it by the way , i use a smaller laptop and i could fit my charger in it too , so it 's not only for ` huge ' laptops -lrb- it might look weird
i use this for my hp envy dv # it fits just fine with it and my logitech lap desk i can also fit my mouse , headphones , and charging cables in there easily , it just <unk> the bag since it does n't have firm sides it serves its purpose and looks just like the picture i do agree that the handles on the inside are silly , but i knew that before i bought it so i did n't count off for that
i really liked this product , it looks exactly like the photo showed it i have had no problem with it so far i would seriously consider buying another one if something happened to this one . the carrying strap is comfortable it does not cut in your shoulder or <unk> . the fabric is soft be protects my laptop very well
i like the look of it it fits my lenovo w # it does n't look super sturdy i would not carry it by the handles the seams do n't feel super strong i think it 's ok to keep your notebook from getting scratched in a more sturdy case i think i paid like $ # , for that i think it should have been made a little bit sturdier the printing is nice tho i 'm editing a year later cause i felt looking at it at first it would n't be study a year later it 's still great so yay
buyer beware because if it does n't fit or you do n't like it , you will have to pay about half the price of the item to return it they do not pay for the return at all
i thought this was going to be a little more substantial it was very floppy and i wanted something that would stand up by its self and could not be folded up and placed into a bag i 'm sure this would work for some , but not for me
it 's cute but it does n't wash well and the zipper already broke and i can not fix it it you just want it to slide you computer in , then it 's fine but , do n't get it if you need to zip and unzip it often and want it to be mobile with your computer
the picture that is shown is n't anything like what showed up i bought all # products as a bundle because they all matched , no they do n't the case does not look like the picture it was supposed to be blue and bright ! it was faded and a dull purple this was a gift and i was a little <unk> , do n't think i will be taking a chance again buying on-line
this bag looks well-made and strong enough , for the price but i 'm giving it # stars because my wife wanted the blue bag that appears on the pictures , and instead we got a <unk> bag color not exactly as depicted other than that , this bag is a good
the material is very cheap but so far it has n't come apart there is not separate area for your computer cord , you just have to kind of stuff everything into it
it fits the laptop fine , but there is no room for the charger or the mouse without stretching the bag to fit around them the company that makes these should have taken those things in consideration ; a back pocket for peripherals
i 've had this for a little over a year not and it has been working very well the rubber at the end of the zipper broke off at some point -lrb- after a few months of use -rrb- but the zipper is still functional it is nicely padded and fits my laptop snugly and there was also a little space for assignments while in college
this is a really nice case with a really pretty design on it the only thing is that it only comes with the one compartment normally there is another compartment other than the one that the laptop fits into and that is really the only disappointment with this case
the bag is as nice when i received as it looked in the picture i am really satisfied with this bag and my lap top fit perfect along with a few other items
my laptop bag was a great purchase it arrived a day early and came exactly as it was described by the seller my laptop fits perfectly with just enough room for my charger and a folder for class as well im very pleased with my purchase and will i will do business with the seller again if your looking for a bag dont miss out with this <unk> items , you will be pleased . : -
this is a great sleeve if you do n't need any storage with it it is perfect for <unk> my laptop around and i love the design my cat likes to sleep on it too ! :
this bag is excellent it repels slight water -lrb- think a little <unk> outside -rrb- , is easy to carry , and very cute the only downfall being the extreme stink the first week or so of owning it
i wanted a laptop case that did n't look like a business case i am retired and wanted something that matched my luggage so when i take it on a trip , it blends right in
i love my laptop case , i can put everything i need in it it 's so light-weight and i do n't have a heavy item to carry great price and very well packaged and delivery was very fast # . # `` laptop sleeve neoprene case bag with hidden handle handbag for # # . # `` # ``
it has space for all my things like my laptop , stylus and even my tablet i dropped my case containing all this & more i was so afraid but a quick inspection revealed everything 's undamaged now i even keep my phone in it all my precious devices are kept in one place as much as i use it , it still looks new yes ! ! <unk> , i wonder what else will fit in it there 's nothing wrong with it & i do n't work for the company i recommend you buy
this product is exactly what i needed and i am very pleased it arrived super fast , the company told me exactly when to expect it and the bag fits my laptop perfectly it is good quality and looks just like the picture online . # stars
while the product arrived a day earlier than was initially stated i 'm very disappointed in the case itself it 's just so so flimsy i doubt it well offer my laptop any protection against bumps these 's extremely minimal amount of <unk> in this case would never recommend this case to anyone every so sorry i bought this for so much money
i originally ordered this neoprene bag for my # `` sony vaio since it said that it would fit that size when the bag got to me , it could have fit my old # `` laptop it was so big that it was n't going to help me protect the computer if you are going to order this item and are skeptical on size , make sure you check neoprene stretches , my advice would be to go smaller if you are on the line between two sizes
i have been using this case for # months and although it 's design is beautiful , there are already some flaws the side handles are meant to attach a strap to , and after using a strap to carry my pc around for # months ... it has already begun to rip the stitching on the side now the case is n't entirely water-proof where the stitching came apart fortunately , there are inner handles which i use to carry my pc around now , but the zipper has to be open to expose the inner handles there 's nothing i can do now when it rains except try to keep my pc from getting wet i do love the design on the outside though , it gives more of a personal aspect to show it 's mine
the sleeve itself is cute , it fits my laptop perfectly however , the handles are on the inside , so if you want to use them you have to leave the very top part unzipped , which is annoying there 's no pocket for any wires etc , which if thats not what you were looking for - <unk> matter over all - pretty good
i received shipment quickly , product as shown i purchased a new laptop for my mother and bought matching skin and case she loved it and it was an inexpensive fun little touch that really made the gift over the top the case is good for putting inside other <unk> and a safe way to store the laptop at home
i ordered this item for my daughter who is attending college when she received the item , she said that it looked much better than the picture she was very pleased this particular sleeve also has a handle which makes it much easier to carry on trips and for traveling on the plane great buy !
this bag was exactly what i was looking for except for one fairly significant flaw : all three zippers were of the lowest quality and broke within # days it 's something that can be fixed by your local tailor but not something you want to be doing # days after the purchase
this fits my # inch laptop well and has nice outer pockets it 's very stylish however , once you put in your charger , wireless mouse and anything else you want to take it gets a little to heavy for the neoprene handles and feels <unk> if all you are carrying around is the laptop itself it will suit you very well the price here is way less than retail also
just got the case today . i liked it but it would 've been better if it also had a shoulder strap . something is wrong with zippers . sometimes they get stuck otherwise its alright
it fits my laptop perfectly , has handles that fold down out of the way when not needed the side slot for accessories such as power cord and/or mouse is stretchy and zippered on the sides so nothing will fall out not at all bulky unless you put something in the side slot exactly what i need
fits like a glove on my asus laptop zipper seems to be good quality despite negative reviews holds the cord and the mouse in the side pocket easily very happy with it ... so far will see how it wears
i bought this because i was looking for a large portable desk to fit my oversize laptop the product is built strong and holds the computer fine , however , this product simply does not work at cooling my laptop i found it to be worse then the laptop by itself the laptop almost never overheats , but when using the desk twice , it overheated both time since then , i bought a different portable desk with a built in fan for $ # more and it works much better if your buying this to stop overheating hope you have better luck then i did
i have a # . # & # # ; hp laptop and this did not work at all for me laptop was too wide vertically for desk and made it awkward to use it was even worse trying to use on my lap has no cushion for lap -lrb- which i knew about -rrb- , but strips did not work for computer not to slip off this was the most uncomfortable product to use
purchased one of these years ago and when it broke -lrb- my fault -rrb- i decided to try a lighter one although this is a little heavy , it is sturdy , stable and big enough to handle my # `` toshiba as well as an external mouse i can pick it up by the ends with the laptop on it and not wonder if it is going to break in the middle very well made !
several years ago , i bought one of the <unk> laptop desks and loved it recently i bought two more , but one was a gift my sister liked the one i gave her for when she travels it is a great stand for use in a <unk> i also use mine on my lap for my laptop computer a great product
i returned this bag because it is terribly made i <unk> so much with the zipper just to open and close it also there is some kind of velcro attachment inside the bag that i could n't really figure out the other side of the velcro pieces were sown into the bag but the attachment would n't stretch across to fit i honestly think they <unk> the pieces on wrong i am not sure but either way it is a cheap bag and you get what you pay for
good quality messenger bag i used this as a portfolio case only con is that it gets dirty very easily , but that is in no way the seller 's fault it 's white , so it 's unavoidable for it to get dirty still a great buy though , looks clean , and exactly as pictured
bought this bag for my # . # inch laptop and it fit perfectly the shoulder strap is great and it has a lot of room although , there were two tears . on the inside of the bag and the other was on the little strap that keeps the laptop down it was completely torn , hanging on by thread but other than that it 's pretty nice
crisp white color is washable size is great , big enough to hold all my computer accessories bought it for myself for my new # & # # ; laptop made my boyfriend , a computer engineer jealous ; will be ordering one for him before long
i had been looking for a white laptop bag for sometime for my new mac book pro , i saw this one and right away i wanted it unfortunately , in my excitement i ordered a larger size by mistake and the sides were wider than i expected -lrb- would prefer thinner sides -rrb- had to send it back
i bought this bag for my sister as a christmas gift unfortunately i had to return since her hubby bought her a different laptop bag for christmas as well it looked and felt very well made , study , and very fashionable wish i could have kept it for myself
bought another one after using the first one for a week it 's roomy enough for # `` mac laptop , ipad , cords , etc . the shoulder strap could be a bit more sturdy , but it 's just my <unk> shoulders that wish it were wider anyway , great product , fast <unk> go for it
this was the perfect fit for my # inch screen lap top i had looked everywhere and nothing was stylish or what i needed it roomy and it also has an adjustable strap inside if i wanted to use for a smaller laptop or dvd player when traveling great purchase very happy and very <unk> you have come through
price to value is great did not think i would be able to find such a solid item at this price my <unk> were price and practicality and this filled both those requirements nicely fits my dell inspiron handily with room for charger , -lrb- paper -rrb- notebooks , external drive , and can still fit my ipad too not as sleek as other cases but plenty of room , which was more important to me
this product does the job i purchased it for - carrying my laptop , but it really looks far better in the picture the pattern had more resolution than it did in real life , as were the colors more brilliant if i knew what it actually looked like i would have chose another product aside from that it does the job
this bag matched the cover i got it 's very thin and there is practically no padding at all to protect your laptop so if you are looking for a bag that has no chance of hitting a corner or a table , then this is it i would suggest a different bag
nice enough case , good price but seemed much too big for the typical laptop maybe we read it wrong maybe it was listed wrong but we ended up returning -lrb- which was also easy -rrb- because of the size
i wasnt sure if this case would be large enough to hold my # `` laptop , i was wrong it was not only large enough , there was extra room did not use the `` hidden handles `` as i was afraid that they would n't hold up -lrb- which were noted before purchase from other buyers -rrb- so far , this product is great
i had already covered my dell laptop with a skin with this pattern , that is why i bought it i love it because i carry my laptop to work , and this really helps protect my investment
i purchased this for my new macbook pro # `` the case fits fine , although a single zipper on the long side to one of the short sides -lrb- `` l `` shape -rrb- is more convenient instead of a double zipper on a short side this product product is potentially a health hazard as the <unk> <unk> are readily apparent as i discovered perhaps it needs to air out after manufacturing before packaging or make use of <unk> and <unk> materials if you must buy this product , consider opening the package outside , letting it air out for approximately # days before use
brought this as a cover for my mac book pro and it does its job only thing i would recommend is a way . to carry it such as handles making it less easy to drop it
i like the design of this sleeve , but unfortunately it does n't fits my # inches macbook pro tight i do n't like sleeves roomy and this one fits pretty loose on my mbp
this sleeve bag is quite stylish to me . fits macbook pro # perfectly but there is not much protection it certainly protects from scratch if you put it in your school bag , but it just does n't help if you drop it
fits nicely on my macbook pro . easy transaction the printing was not perfect , had two symbol of `` x `` on the word a and e of the cafe , white in color , barely noticeable about an inch overall , everything is good , zipper is sturdy
i bought this for my macbook air # inch and it fits perfectly . . ! i like the fact that it has elastic bands inside to secure the laptop great laptop sleeve . . !
everything was as described , and the quality is good there was no smell when i opened the packaged -lrb- as some others have said there have been -rrb- , and the design is nice it is a very snug fit for a # `` mac , so no room for extra items also , the padding is somewhat minimal but i like it overall , and it works to add just a little extra protection
i picked this case because it reminded me of paris it fit my macbook perfectly although the interior is soft , i wish it were even more soft like other cases i have seen nevertheless , recommend it to everybody
i was looking for a carrying case for my macbook air and apple doesnt offer anything thats worth the price ... i found this i loved it its girly and worth the price the one thing is that its half zip on the side
i 've gotten so many compliments on it my only issue is that there are two little white ` x ' in the middle of the word ` cafe ' on either side of the case not quite sure what that is but it takes away from the beauty of the overall case but otherwise , it 's a great case that fits my # `` macbook perfectly
arrived on time , nice as described , a soft cushiony zipped case for my # . # `` macbook air since the air is slimmer than the standard macbook pro , there 's room inside for additional items , as in my case , the power cord you could easily slip in your cell phone or even your ipad if you have both like i do does have a slight plastic foam smell to it , but i had to hold it up to my nose to sniff it typical for a plastic product thats been packaged it will dissipate zipper works fine , it opens from the short side top for easy access a good value for the money spent exactly what i was looking
i have a # `` toshiba laptop and it fits perfectly in this sleeve the design is quite nice and i receive a lot of complements about it i did wish it had a small handle though , for those days when i do not want to carry a large purse or bag to tuck it into that would just make toting it around that much easier unlike other reviewers , mine did not <unk> any smell when received it was perfect right out of the packaging
did n't smell bad , just small off order seems to be good quality for some reason i thought it was a white background , but it is gray i think it look lighter in the picture , but it 's still good
i was very happy when i received my paris case it 's designed well and definitely fits the price , whereas other cases tend to be around $ # my macbook pro # -inch fits perfectly , even with a snap-on plastic case around it one thing - the case does smell a little strange when it first arrives , so i plan on airing it out for a few days before using it it 's also a darker shade of gray -lrb- just a bit -rrb- than it shows in the picture , but it 's still beautiful overall , very happy with the design , style , and functionality of this product
looks nice , fits well , be careful not to scratch your mac since zip is on the short side five colleagues of mine told me they wanted to order the same one and now they envy me read a review before ordering about the smell - that is truth , but after leaving the sleeve for few days in the fresh air on balcony everything smells good
this case is made for a # in . laptop i have my # . # laptop with a speck case on it and it still fits - perfectly i love it it 's so pretty and will add that little bit of extra protection for my laptop the only thing is that it smells a little but i think it 's just <unk> not having a chance to air out bottom line - one very happy customer !
i chose this case for the price and the zipper location i needed a case that zipped on `` the short side of the l `` and this was the cheapest one on amazon it 's perfect for protecting my # `` mb pro and feels exactly the same as the $ # incase brand at the apple store
did not fit my acer # . # inch laptop because the corners of this are rounded and my laptop is very square shaped it also does not have a shoulder strap or a side
this is a well made product i purchased to speed up the security process at airports well , while my dell xps -lrb- m # -rrb- will squeeze into this , there are still a full # & # # ; of the laptop sticking out of the top tried it on an older inspiron # and same problem so , unlike many other laptop sleeves , where it tells you the screen size it will fit , the measurements for this sleeve are apparently for overall dimensions , not the screen size i 've bought about a dozen laptop sleeves over the past decade and this is the only one that does not indicate size according to screen size , but to dimension size it 's working , but just barely if i did n't have a rolling tech bag to put it in , it would have been returned my laptop dimensions are # & # # ; x # & # # ; x # . # & # # ; so it should have fit
i got this for my asus g # vw and it is too tight to fit i could see a samsung series # , macbook pro , or razer laptop fitting but do n't expect a bigger gaming one to fit the bag being poor quality is n't the issue and i 'm currently using it for my # in macbook pro
it is a nice sleeve however , my former sleeve for my # inch had an outside pocket for the charging cord and mouse i wrongly assumed that this did as well
i bought it for my alienware m # x , with is # `` laptop , but it did n't fit , but i think that the quality of the sleeve is good , and it looks nice also
this is a nice sleeve for going through airports , but only if you are going to put it in another bag that has shoulder straps or better handles i actually wish this sleeve did n't have the handles because they are so small and uncomfortable to use
the product arrived on time and in excellent condition so far it has done a good job of protecting my laptop from dust and damage it would be helpful to have an outside pocket to hold flash drives or other small items
very protective , the bubble cells are very effective at protecting it and this case definitely does the job the water resistance is also a very nice feature and makes it more usable the only thing i think could be improved is that there is not a single pocket for the price , this is an overall great case
i love this carrying case for my laptop as it is easy to carry and not bulky it 's great for gentle use but you have to be careful as it is thin which is why i gave it four stars instead of five also , there is no additional space for the cord so you will need an extra bag for the cord
this was a great purchase to protect my laptop as i traveled to india , china , japan , vietnam , and thailand the case protected my laptop while in my backpack and it was easy to remove and place on the screening belt for airport security as advertised i was able to leave the laptop in the case and was not <unk> by airport security if you are looking to store wires or a wireless mouse look else where
i could not find a right size sleeve for my # & # # ; # inch toshiba pc for a long time this one fits perfectly and seem to protect well too can ` t wait to test it
this sleeve just barely covers my new # . # `` laptop it is a tight fit and does n't allow for peripherals , but i have a tote i use for my power cord , mouse , and extra items i got this mainly to protect the laptop it 's well made and a good value
this is a near perfect bag , and i 'm even able to squeeze my power cord into it -lrb- a little tight , but it 's in -rrb- i wish i was n't advertising microsoft -lrb- or any vendor -rrb- , but it was n't easy to find a neoprene bag with handles it fits the bill
this case is the perfect size for my # inch hp laptop it fits snugly , but my laptop goes in easily plus , the case slips easily into my bag the handles are very handy
i purchased this for my husbands new lap top we had been looking for a case and could not find on <unk> for a man the bag has great padding and is good for a # . # computer screen made very well
more is less well designed , minimal materials , but strong , and perfect fit all carry handles should wrap around item , and not rely on thin line of stiching exactly what i desired
perfect christmas present very high quality i love the color combo and it is the perfect size with the handle for on the go laptop fans very happy with my purchase well worth it
just what i was looking for a simple padded neoprene sleeve for my # dell inspiron # laptop <unk> zipper that unzips about halfway down the sides , no pockets , no shoulder strap just double handles and bubbled type padding on the inside
bought this for travel , it is perfect case is nicely insulated keep in mind the carrying case is made just for the laptop and nothing else just keep your power cord etc in you carry on and you 're good to go
item arrived fast and i really like it hard to get one of these for a # `` computer but this one fits just nicely and i know i will enjoy it for a long time i really like the handles instead of having none because i can just grab it fast and go being in college
the headline reads it is a sleeve , bag , and carrying case i thought when i ordered it that it might have a strap tucked inside or something ... but no i figured oh well , i would just use it as a sleeve and carry it with my charger in a backpack well even as a laptop sleeve this item fails <unk> its supposed to be for # inch laptops but it 's way too big for my # inch toshiba ... it slides all over the place plus you ca n't even use the extra room for cords or a mouse because the bag just becomes bulky looking and leaves your laptop more vulnerable to damage the only reason why i even gave this item two stars is because it really is a very beautiful case ... even in person the padding is actually decent too but it sort of ruins the point if the laptop does n't fit snug i have n't tried this with a # . # inch laptop but maybe it would fit in this better would have been much happier if the title had n't been so misleading
the laptop sleeve i requested was supposed to be # `` but when i received it the sleeve said it was # `` but looked like it was # `` my laptop did not fit snug , instead it was moving all around because of the size not to mention it is so thin with no padding to protect at all the return shipping was so expensive and i had no use for it so it was a <unk> situation
the material this sleeve is made out of is like a dust magnet it very quickly ends up with hand prints and even dust sticking to it i could n't find a quick way to clean it since i was using this case to take the class and the library , it just would ' t stay clean a different material choice would make this much better ; an awesome design though
i have a hp g # t laptop with a # inch screen , the width is perfect for it but the height is about # . # inches too tall however , since there is no side pouch for my mouse and power cord , i will get a small cloth bag for them and store them inside the sleeve as well that should take up the extra room otherwise it is a very nice sleeve with a beautiful design on it
i got this for my sister 's # `` hp it does the job of protecting the laptop , but i feel like its too big i like cases to fit the laptops snug , instead of the laptop <unk> around in its case the case itself is cute but i would say to get the case maybe a size smaller
the neoprene is of good quality the zipper looks good as well the design looks nice and bright . it might be able to last long enough it is too wide for my asus t # but i suspected that in fact , this # . # & # # ; laptop length is longer than the average of this category then , it has a smaller width -lrb- or depth , depending on how you look at it -rrb- at the end , i need to take an oversize sleeve to fit it in because one side is bigger than average
very nice and chick sleeve to protect your laptop from scratches the sleeve has very little padding however , so if you 're looking for something with thicker padding , this sleeve is not it also , the background white color shown on the picture is much brighter than the actual sleeve itself it is true to its size my laptop is # . # inches in width , so it fits perfectly well with some space remaining for the mouse and charger overall , i like it because it does what i wanted it to do which was to hold my laptop with primary accessories and it protects my laptop from scratches
i love this laptop sleeve it 's really nice and finished on the inside , the fabric is soft and `` cushy `` and the design is absolutely gorgeous worth every penny ! ! ! i am using this sleeve for my asus n # <unk> # `` laptop it 's a tad bit larger than the laptop , which is fine i looked all over online and in the stores for a nice sleeve , but they <unk> at around $ # a pop and it was difficult to find many options for a # `` most were for # . # . # , which i did n't want cuz i do n't plan on putting the adapter or mouse in there with it i do n't want to scratch the lid : - -rrb- oh and the free shipping with prime is great ! $ # . # is a great price , almost a steal
i purchased this for my brand new sony vaio # inch laptop since i have a habit of placing my laptop anywhere since i bought the white <unk> color i wanted something to help protect it from normal wear and tear it fits perfectly and i have no complaints i did n't really notice that strong of an odor when i received it it just smelled new like everything that is new does it 's nice and girly looking too ! the price is great considering what they are charging at the sony website
arrived earlier than expected and was packaged very well reasonable price however , i would imagine something like this to be # instead of # it had a `` new bag `` scent that wasnt pleasant but faded quickly the outside of the sleeve can get dirty fairly easily if you set it on a dirty surface -lrb- it is mostly white -rrb-
