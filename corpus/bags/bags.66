this product was wrongly suggested for my new laptop , is too small i need your help to return it or get a larger one instead , but this one is <unk> useless and a waste of money if you 'll like to correct it , please let me know
it 's soft stretchy and fits my netbook quite nicely , no complaints here i do like the zippered part of it since it does n't seem like it will mess up like many zippers do
its so pretty & helpful its easier to carry around because you dont want some people to know what you have so this case is very useful , strong , and can fit in small places
bought it for my asus transformer book t # great fit , and pocket great for holding a small bluetooth mouse does n't replace a full size carry bag , but i was looking for something small and light
i do n't think there 's anything all that special about this particular product but it has perfectly met my expectation it provides the protection i was wanting for my laptop without bulk it has a small external pocket for a few items - does n't hold the power cord for my laptop but it would probably be fine for thin cords , earbuds , etc . laptop has a big power cord so it does n't fit in the pocket but that 's fine for me - i did n't want anything bulky
it does not match the # . # laptop size it is made about two inches too big unfortunately i ca n't return because the seller took too long to answer my mail and now i am out of the country i guess i 'll use it as a pillow cover , lol if you need a sleeve case for an apple macbook air # . # ... do n't buy , it wont feed
the description should be fits from an # inch to # inch macbook airs this is not made to for the # , which was disappointing , but over all it is useable and good quality
the case is simply too big it is specifically described as for the macbook air , but it is # inches too deep it has a pocket inside to keep the mac in place , but i would prefer a more snug fit the material and the construction are fine
its cute , fits my computer well i wish my cord fit in the front pocket but it does not but its a lot smaller and easier to carry around then what i was using
an ok product i was expecting a lil more padding on the inside tho , given that a laptop was being stored inside it also came with a lil mould on the surface too seems like it was packed down somewhere for a long time all in all its ok for the price if ur looking for something to offer protection i wont recommend this however , if its just for keeping ur laptop free from dust and possibly moisture , this this <unk> do
pretty color and fits the laptop like a glove i really like the little pocket in the front to hold her mouse and wires although it looks a little bulky when you do that , it still stretches out to fit it snugly
the description says it is for an # . # inch laptop , but when it arrived it is actually for a # . # inch laptop while the difference is not huge , it is not what i ordered i am definitely sending it back
dimensions were considerably larger than the computer so it <unk> around inside i sent it back yeah , i know the description included the dimensions , but it also said & # # ; ... for apple macbook air # . # & # # ; , so i assumed it would fit live and learn otherwise i really liked the case if they ever introduce one that fits properly , i 'll order it in a heartbeat
i should have read the reviews before buying this product online it states it is for mba # -inch and it 's not instead it is a general case for netbooks # . # `` there is a lot of space left <unk> when you put your mba in it kinda frustrating to see the reviews after the product was already on it 's way the case itself if decent but the marketing for the item is <unk> the pocket space is nice but again , if you are looking for something that fits the macbook air # -inch this is not likely to make you happy
i 've been in afghanistan for four months now and i am so thankful i have this case to protect my # `` macbook air i saw others complain that the sleeve is too big and it may be slightly too big if you are looking for a tight fit , but i think it has been just about perfect for my needs the sand here is terrible and this case has completely protected my laptop i also carry the case in my backpack with all of my other gear and the soft neoprene has done a great job of helping me get through this deployment with a computer that is still in new condition as far as the complaints about the sleeve being too big , i 've found it very convenient when i need to slide a couple of pieces of paper in the sleeve with the laptop i 've never done an on-line review before , but i was happy enough with this product that i decided to do one i would n't hesitate to buy another one of these
great laptop case i 've used this for a variety of <unk> , right now i 'm using it for my macbook air its light weight , with enough pockets to sort your chargers and papers
the first thing i love about this sleeve is that there is a lot more padding than what i am used to in a laptop sleeve usually , i carry a lot of things in my handbag and have always used a sleeve but my old macbook pro does have a few random scratches i 've recently picked up the early # macbook pro and i feel a lot more comfortable with this sleeve than the one i was using prior the design is clean and sleek , except for two outside pockets , <unk> the main compartment does have a great zipper and a nice inner guard so that if crumbs or something gets through the teeth the inner guard gives a little bit more security it 's a great sleeve , mainly due to its <unk> , but still feels thin enough to carry and fit into most <unk>
this sleeve is very well constructed it is semi-rigid in its construction and offers some degree of protection for the device you place in it do be sure to measure your device if it is not an apple # `` macbook i like the material on the inside , nothing scratchy in there
this is a very nice laptop sleeve - the material is very cushy and soft i 've taken several netbooks for trips in this case and they have n't come back with a scratch on them
it smells like human blood or dead fish very strong i had to prop it open on my balcony in the winter for # months before the smell was bearable
it feels a bit cheaper than it looks online it 's pretty light which tells me maybe the leather is fake i would have given this a higher rating but the fuzzy lining inside smells terrible , kind of a fishy smell really its a bit gross and embarrassing even other than that , it 'll protect your laptop , maybe even a bit more than regular sleeves because of the edges , which might provide a buffer if dropped it looks pretty cool too but not as sleek as i thought it would
very satisfied with this macbook sleeve it fits perfectly , and although not leather , it seems sturdy and well made i gave it only # stars and not five , because i wish it had a little pocket for cd 's or flash drive
sleeve is nice but make sure you measure your laptop before purchase i have a samsung series # & # # ; and it was too small for my laptop but it fit my wife 's # & # # ; toshiba ultrabook perfectly
samsonite makes good products this is well made but does n't give much protection , it 's just a cover i knew this going in so i 'm not disappointed if you just want a cover for your tablet for you tablet this is as good or better than most if you want true protection put it in a padded laptop bag
the polyester material is not static <unk> proof , look for material which can avoid static , which is good for laptop particularly if have a ssd i think neoprene sleeves are better in this regard
i bought this product when it was on sale for less than $ # it is not particularly attractive , but it does the job right i use it to encase my # `` hp envy the cushion is good and fit is good for an universal unit
this sleeve works great with my asus laptop i throw my laptop inside and throw this thing in my backpack in the time that i 've had it , there 's been no damage whatsoever to my laptop , and i even ride a scooter to school
this sleeve perfectly fits the # `` mac pro with no slack it offers descent protection against scratchs , but i still need to use a laptop bag to avoid major damages one warning i have to give is that mac pros are made of aluminum and they can easily get scratched with the zippers of the sleeve the samsonite has placed a flap inside the sleeve to act as a barrier and prevent friction from happening if you forget to place it even once you 'll probably end up with a scratch , but if you do you 're probable better protected than any other sleeve
this sleeve is made of neoprene and is well-designed the zipper is covered on the inside so it wo n't scratch your mac but it is larger than a # inch macbook air i wish they made it fit better reasonably satisfied with it so far
all i needed was a basic , but somewhat substantial sleeve for my new macbook pro # for when i had to throw it in my backpack and go -lrb- and i 'm on the move a lot -rrb- this nifty little samsonite does just that , and for a pretty good price i love the the inner zipper has a little lip to ensure that the teeth of the zipper do n't scrape the sides of my macbook overall a great buy
the neoprene on this case may be slightly less thick than the built sleeves the macbook air is protected from the zipper by neoprene the best part about this case is that it is half the cost of the other ones out there
i was looking for a neoprene sleeve that would n't add much bulk and still offer protection when i place my # & # # ; macbook pro into a backpack or messenger bag i have a non-retina model and this fits snugly i also like how the zipper is n't just for the top of the case the zipper actually goes down to one of the sides which makes it easier to put in and take out the macbook and not worry about scratching great purchase overall
it 's a wonderful deal the price is surprising the produce fits macpro # inch steadily , its material is soft but provide a solid protection for my laptop . i like this one
within a week of getting the cover , it started falling apart there were keys that were hanging on by a sliver of silicon the fit was okay , but the labels and letters on the cover did n't line up at all it also kept sliding off my keyboard it does n't stay put at all
for the price , its doable , but the letters on the skin do not match at all with the letters of the keyboard leaving a lot to want good if you want it to just cover , but like i said , you get what you pay for
there are a few things that bug me about this cover i hate how the letters on the cover do n't match the letters on the keyboard i also do n't like that after it is on well , you can see the black coming through from the keyboard and it makes it look like the cover is dirty but it does fit perfect and i have n't had any problems typing
great product , super cute and just what i expected the letters , numbers , and symbols dont exactly match up if you have the light on your keys on , but its not a big deal ! still super cute
the case seems to be used , it has some dents and marks on them it does n't close completely the <unk> logo is too big and i do n't care for it i do n't think it 's work $ # with shipping the color it way too yellow , it looks nothing like the picture
this case is falling apart the string ripped off within a week both of my bottom seams have ripped and the fabric is ripped on the top i like the way it looks and i have had it for awhile but it certainly has not held up to wear and tear
i really love the design of this case , its very cute but within the first week of having it ink had transferred from books and magazines onto the vinyl outside of the case , by simply setting it on top of the books after a few days the case was covered in black and blue ink impressions if you want a case that is going to stay its color this is not it
got this for my new # . # inch macbook air fits perfectly and provides good padding as others have described , it looks like a manilla envelope in form , but item is very yellow in person wo n't fool many , and i 'm a little worried that the velcro might separate over time only had it a few days , but seems to work just fine
my reason for buying this sleeve was to conceal my macbook air , not to do the steve jobs trick i think that at first glance , this sleeve probably does well to at least not attract the attention of a potential thief however , the black rubber macvelope insignia kind of sticks out like a sore thumb you do n't usually see a black thing on manila envelopes , so i wish grantwood had n't put it there i used a <unk> <unk> and pulled the thing off this , and the shiny and <unk> appearance both make the sleeve look less realistic all-in-all , this is a well-made product if grantwood had gone a little further toward a realistic appearance , i would give it # stars it seems to me they should have anticipated that <unk> would be more important than novelty to some potential buyers
if you are looking for a sleek case to fit your macbook air , this could be it if you are looking for an attractive case that resembles a manilla office folder , this does n't cut it the yellow vinyl on this <unk> is bright yellow and resembles a yellow rain jacket , rather than an office envelope i am returning mine , not because of the product 's quality , but because this is not something i want to be seen carrying around
the padding on this case is perfect , not too bulky and not too slim my only real complaint is that the string is not <unk> to use on a daily bases it looks really nice , and has a sort of elegance to it
this is hands down my favorite grantwood technology product first of all , it 's original -- the <unk> in the design is fun , it 's colorful , it 's <unk> yet savvy and smart secondly -- and maybe most importantly -- it protects the device wonderfully the padding is protective but not bulky , so you can easily slip it into your bag or briefcase i receive more compliments about the case than the computer itself
there really is n't much to review about a sleeve case but this one is great so far i have used it for a few months every day and so far so good i have had no problems with quality , no loosening stitching , no broken string , or anything like that and at airports it is very handy as you ca n't miss it it also gives decent protection if you put it in a bag with other items there are no pockets for any other items but it really was n't designed for that in addition to the string which mimics the string on a typical interoffice envelope it has a very large and strong velcro strip the string is more for decoration as the velcro keeps the flap very securely shut if you want a cool looking sleeve for the macbook air that will last , this clever case may fit your bill
item is sleek , quality construction : edges turned under prior to stitching , sturdy velcro closure fits the # `` air perfectly , with just a bit of room to accommodate a hard case
i bought this product at amazon.com because two main reasons : firstly , because is a working tool i need , and secondly , because this netbook is easy to carry everywhere and also i like the brand of it
thanks to <unk> day for his very useful review it 's too bad that on this model acer eliminated easy access to the ram module from the underside , which was a nice feature of its d # and # h <unk> i had recommended this model sight unseen , along with the # gb replacement module , to another person she bought it and was dismayed to find that she had to remove the keyboard and a metal cover underneath , then push the `` door `` out the bottom i can confirm , though , that the # gb module she ordered from amazon is working in the aod # e- # , * despite * having a part number ending in . # <unk>
this is the perfect size to take with when we go on short trips it has enough storage space for my itunes and although it is not as fast as my laptop or desktop it is not so slow that you feel you are waiting for christmas
we have two the only negative i have found is the battery does not last # hours as advertised . # to # / # is about the maximum i bought this model for the battery charge length we can cope otherwise , the weight , the memory , the speed , the bright screen all work for me
this bag is not entirely what i expected , but it is sufficient i thought it had # sections , but it actually only has one section with enough room for the laptop and # pockets on the front of the bag under the flap the pockets have just enough room for the booklets that came with the computer and the power cords i like the pattern , the long strap and the slim profile of the bag i would n't necessarily recommend this product , but i would n't tell someone not to buy it , either
it 's great except for the # pockets under the front flap they are too small to store the cords after ripping out the stitching in the center , it has become one larger functional pocket ridiculous design as it was
i bought this for my # . # asus tablet i really liked the looks of it there is the main section for a laptop/tablet and two pockets in the front for additional storage my tablet is swimming in it , but i knew it would be bigger and wanted to have room for my kindle , wallet , cell phone , charging cord , etc . it is perfect for traveling with all of my gadgets ! i like the looks of it and it is lightweight as well i ended up buying a sleeve for my tablet for extra protection as put more than just my tablet in this bag
i did n't expect much from this bag because it 's pretty inexpensive but i was pleasantly surprised it 's the perfect bag for a small laptop i have my macbook air in a protective sleeve and i can fit the whole thing into this bag with room to spare and believe me , it 's protected i think i could drop it off a building and the computer would survive the bag has semi-hard bottoms and corners , which add protection when it 's dropped this is in addition to the substantial <unk> material that forms the bag itself the shoulder strap is sturdy and the two inner pockets are stretchy enough to hold my iphone , the computer 's power cord , earphones , etc . after seeing how good it was , i bought another for my nephew
there are # similarly built # -inch laptop bags which are this size . # x # . # x # . # <unk> bag is much larger i double checked these sizes with built and this bag is indeed # . # x # . # x # inches quite a difference
i love built products this does n't disappoint it 's a beautiful design some of the stitching came off a little i only wish they did n't sew the middle pocket to the bag i could use it as a tote bag instead of a laptop tote bag
i already have the smaller laptop tote but when i got a new work laptop it was thinner but did not fit in the sleeve this bag fits the laptop in the sleeve with room to spare , it could even be a bit smaller to fit my hp model the laptop sleeve on this one does not have the & # # ; furry & # # ; lining that the other one did which i loved but the stretchy fabric is fine there are two deep inside pockets where i put sunglasses , , cell phones , keys and id power cords would easily fit there too plenty of room on both sides of the laptop sleeve i put flat items like <unk> and notebooks on one side and bulky things like my wallet , make-up bag and <unk> shopping bag on the other a pair of shoes , a folded jacket and <unk> can be tucked in here if needed the one <unk> is the great print does show dirt and stains much more than the black/grey bag i was using i use public transportation and am just going to have to wash it more often
i recieved this product as a gift last year it is the perfect brief case to haul my computer and <unk> back and forth to work each day the bag is light weight so there is no extra weight of the bag it has some give so can be `` stuffed `` on those <unk> when to much has to be brought home the shoulder strap stays put and does n't slide down my arm walking into the office with full arms the pockets are deep and hold all the <unk> it is also well cushioned and does a great job protecting my computer all of this and it is very stylish i am constantly getting compliments i would definately recomend this bag and would buy another one
i have had several different bags to use for work over the years but this is finally the one ! ! it is light and fits everything even a little umbrella outstanding <unk> to detail this bag is great ! !
what was supposed to be the <unk> version of this bag was actually closely resembled more of the `` sling sleeve `` type version of this bag it still looks like a great bag , but it is not what is pictured first off , there is not flap cover it has a zipper on top opening also , it has the handles on top so you can actually hold the bag like a briefcase either way , i 'm super disappointed that it is not what i ordered i thought i was getting what was pictured , but it was n't . =
this bag is much more like cheap vinyl than it is canvas i know they said it 's `` coated `` but still , i was very disappointed with the look and texture much worse however is the tiny and very weak button clasp that keeps the main pocket closed this comes undone with only the smallest force and is difficult to notice as a result , i once bent over to pick up a dropped letter , unaware that the button had <unk> , and my macbook came flying out and smashed on the floor inside the bag there is no extra way to secure a laptop ; most other bags i 've owned have had an extra little stap to prevent exactly this accident from happening
had this bag for a year now , and it looks like i have been using it for the past # years . bag stretches and loses its clean lines for which i bought it for quickly
i purchased this product in april # and by around <unk> # the seams attaching the shoulder strap to the bag had begun to separate from the canvas there was no undue wear or tear , just a # `` mbp and a couple of notebooks the strap also lacks stitching down near the buckle to prevent the strap from bunching and forcing the buckle sideways i would check out some of the other available shoulder bags
i had the previous model which was sold in apple stores i loved that one it eventually ripped out where the strap attached to the bag , so i bought this one to replace it same company , same bag quality is lower the strap seems thinner , and the coating seems to be less it is hard to say if it will hold up as well as the first , but it just does n't feel as well made on the other hand , i spent # % more for the previous one in the apple store , so maybe there are actually two models without a visual <unk> one physical difference is that this one has a snap for the front flap , instead of velcro i prefer the snap , but would n't choose that over the difference in quality
i originally bought this with hopes of proving to myself that shoulder bags are better than backpacks -- turns out this is n't the case -lrb- which is the only reason i gave this # stars -rrb- this bag is still a great bag , however like some others have said , it does not have a lot of space for anything really except a laptop , tablet , and a few accessories , but the plus side is that it looks extremely stylish i still prefer backpacks over shoulder bags any day because they allow for more mobility and are more comfortable
this bag was a christmas present to me last year i use it every day as my main laptop bag for work , and it still looks brand new i ca n't speak highly enough on the quality after over a year of use , there no signs of wear or fraying i also get a lot of complements on it so that 's nice too
this bag is awesome it 's all that i needed to transport my macbook pro # `` , ipad and a few peripherals -lrb- mouse , charger , etc -rrb- the quality is great and it is good looking i recommend this item
the top part keeps falling off , it snaps on but does n't stay on it is <unk> and now i have to find a new case so there went $ # out the
it is very thin plastic that would not protect your computer in any way it changes the appearance by adding a color and does nothing more i like that it vents the bottom of the computer a bit , and has two small legs for propping the angle in theory -lrb- but they are really too small to change the angle at all -rrb- i went to the apple store and they confirmed that in no way would this prevent damage to your computer this case probably costs about # cents to make not sure how they get away with charging $ # for it
its cheaply and will not last before it breaks my bottom shell keeps coming off and will not click back into place because the little plastic support things broke too
the color is great on this product , but the top portion failed to snap on my macbook air # the bottom snapped on but still felt like it would fall off easily
more purple than pink not pearly at all its clear very hard plastic fits macair # `` snug but slippery in your hands so it may fall to floor ordered a topcase matte finish one instead and its <unk> is safe and secure in my hand and beautiful
this case was a low cost solution to protect my new mac air from scratches it 's hard plastic and difficult to install and remove but i got it on next time i will spend more and get a better quality with some cushioning <unk> , i bought an incase brand perforated case for my # `` macbook pro that was high quality , cushioned and easy to install and remove and triple the price we get what we pay for
i purchased a purple one from here , and it is pretty decent and cute i really like the color and how it protects my air completely however , the top case was really hard to put it in i almost thought that my macbook might broke while putting it in , cuz it wouldnt just get in i had to struggle so much to put it in , and i dont even know how i would be able to take it out later besides being so hard to put it in , it is a nice case . :
this case is pretty good i like the fact that it is hard cover and i really like the color it fits fairly decent , although it does make a clicking sound if i try to open the macbook too quickly all-in-all it is worth the price
although the cover took atleast ten minutes to get to fit on , it is very cute and beware , the colors pictured are n't exact , i ordered purple and its closer to pink .
i bought this case as a birthday present for a friend i went back and forth a lot before deciding to purchase this particular cover , weighing other reviews , cost , durability and appearance my friend has been pleased with it and the cover seems to be doing its job protecting the macbook air from any scratches or damage the laptop was dropped by a younger kid -lrb- onto carpet -rrb- but there was no damage to the cover or the macbook air the one negative so far is that the rubber feet for gripping came off and needed to be <unk> overall a very solid case for a more reasonable price than other cases out there
i purchased this cover for my daughter for her new macair . . she 's loving it the color is beautiful but the only problem i see in this cover that it made the macbook air a bit heavier especially the screen cover made the screen a bit loose . . i wish it was made with a lighter material
i purchased this after i purchased as speck seethru satin cover which cracked horribly this cover has stayed in tact through the same usage patterns sometimes the top falls off if you move it a certain way -lrb- which is why only # stars -rrb- , but it snaps right back on
i purchased this hard shell cover case for my macbook air i like the color and it does provide good protection to my laptop you can also see the apple logo through the case so it looks like a purple tinted apple the only negative is that i can not for the life of me get the top shell to snap on all # sides there is always one side that barely grips the corner of the laptop screen no matter how hard i try to get it to stay snapped on the only reason i am not considering this a major negative is because it stays on just enough that it seems to be completely snapped on it does n't hang off or feel loose , the only time i can tell it is not snapped on tightly is if i feel the corner with my fingers and i can tell it is not completely tight this small issue does not effect the effectiveness of the product in my opinion and i still like it that is why i gave it # stars , but not # , because it should snap on perfectly , it does n't , but you ca n't really tell if this is something you are worried about you have to weigh how badly you want the product over the possibility of this small <unk> issue
the product is neat , clean and bright it snapped neatly into place the macbook air is a delicate piece of equipment , and i 'm glad to have this extra bit of security
as described . pictures on website suggest flexible like hard rubber but to touch it feels like hard plastic . current first hour with free silicone keypad in place . no problems typing . the rest will be
this cover is exactly as advertised , it comes with good directions on how to install , the purple color featured is true to the actual color there are feet on the bottom that prop up your laptop and it comes with a clear keyboard protector
i wanted to protect my trusty little mac air i find this product works great , looks great and protects my mac air # `` though it was a bit difficult to get it on the firs time , i am happy with this product
gives good general protection i have never dropped my computer so i 'm not sure how well it will work for that i took case off one time and it seemed to leave dirt smudges and a few minute scratches
the bottom cover slides on with little effort and we absolutely love the flip out feet the top cover took a great deal of effort to get the # th of # tabs snapped into place <unk> # star it was n't until my fingers were aching from the force i was using to try and get the little plastic <unk> over the edge that it <unk> on me to add a little heat hot <unk> , so to speak i heated the area around the troublesome tab with a hair dryer until it was more pliable then squeezed again it popped over with little effort overall this is a great cover for the air you ca n't go wrong
i love this cover i will admit when i first got it out of the box i could n't figure out how to get it to fit but after a few minutes i got it to work the color is awesome and it really adds to the beauty of my macbook air
the case protects my macbook and made it look awesome ! ! though it does take some effort to put it on - . - the purple case shines whenever i turn on my macbook :
i received the cover in the mail today it was easy to snap on , and it looks great the color is as pictured , and it includes a matching keyboard cover i feel much more secure knowing my macbook air is protected
i love this case the only complaint i have is that it sometimes comes unsnapped from the computer love that it is see through so it glows when the computer is on
absolutely love my case took a second for me to snap the cover on because i was worried if i forced the cover to snap on , it might break one of the tabs after i `` put a little man into it `` , it snapped right on : -- rrb- once i get sick of purple , i def will buy another one of these covers in a different color
i was looking for something that would n't add much , if any , bulk for the macbook air this is it when i took it out of the packaging , i thought it would be too light , actually -- but it attached easily to the macbook , and it adds just the right amount of protection it looks great -- and has done exactly what it 's supposed to do i love that there are different color options -- i chose the purple because it 's different the cover is great , and i 'm glad that i bought it it 's a small investment for a lot of protection
this cover snapped on easily even with this cover my macbook air fits in my soft case i orginally bought so i have double protection the <unk> cover fits perfect as well
this is such a great looking case for the macbook air i was looking for a matte finish since i did n't want to have scratches very obvious as if it was a glossy one of course i love that it has two feet to have a more comfortable alignment of the macbook air the fit was a little too snug when i was putting the top cover so i was scared to push it in but i got it to fit i noticed it attracts some dust on the surface though but that ; s just minor the color is what is pictured and is gorgeous ! overall a great case for cheap price
bought for daughter to replace her old broken cover she loves the shade of purple and she loves the rear legs fits her # macbook air # inch perfectly if it gets damaged or she gets tired of the color , it is inexpensive to replace plus it came with a very thin frosted keyboard cover really nice cover , great price
ordered this product for my macbook # `` air because i was having trouble finding a cover for it in stores this product arrived promptly the color is not very different than the picture on the page , and i like it it appears to be a true purple and it looks great the cover was a bit difficult to put on at first , but i finally figured out that it just snaps on and i was good to go overall , i am very pleased with the functionality and appearance of this item i get many compliments on it , especially since i also added a purple keyboard cover my mb air looks very cool and i am confident that it is well protected the feet are great when typing love this cover
i love it it 's very easy to put on although i had to sort of play around with it i also did n't know that it will arrive with a keyboard cover if i had known , i would not have ordered my keyboard cover separately and the cover is purple too the color looks very nice on the mac air i love it i recommend this if you want some good protection for the fragile mac air .
good quality case i bought it for my # macbook air i travel a lot with my macbook , always in this case , i just put it in my tote bag no additional sleeve or laptop carrying case needed
<unk> : when this package first arrived , i took one look and concluded i 'd be sending it back it <unk> , well , cheesy , and the color was too different from the picture here a few days passed , and i decided i 'd try it turns out , it looks tons better once on the case , than sitting in the amazon box it fits perfectly , adds no girth , and offers great protection and , the color is a dead ringer for what is depicted on the product page -- looking very rich and elegant indeed so , if you 're disappointed initially when you open the package , hang in there and follow through odds are high that you too will be extremely pleased with your purchase -lsb- purchased out of pocket no vine <unk>
