this is a great , sturdy laptop case my only complaint is that the photo is slightly deceptive i expected it to be a thicker case , with more pockets for papers and such , but it only has one section that will fit a laptop and maybe a few sheets of paper i was expecting something in between the actual size and a full briefcase size bag
i bought this case for my husband he really likes it i think that the zippered pocket is too shallow but he is the one who uses it every day , not me if you do n't have a need for deep side pockets , this is a good buy at this price point
this samsonite computer bag is nice as a computer bag material used is pretty good too it fits in a # . # `` notebook well however if you want to also put in some <unk> it is not going to fit in
this bag is kinda small and cramped for a full sized laptop very nice quality materials and very durable though originally bought for my laptop because of its sized i later decided to use it for my tablet can not recommend for use as a laptop case but as a tablet case it is perfect
it was thinner than i thought it would be but for the purpose that i purchased it , it is an excellent fit depending on it 's intended use , i would recommend this item to anyone
first , the pictures for this bag are not correct and show a larger model this item does not have two zippers on top and just has one large main compartment do n't expect to carry much more than your laptop , charger , mouse , phone , pens and a flat pad it will not hold a # `` # ring binder with the laptop my # . # `` toshiba fits snugly and i 'm happy with the bag if you 're looking for a sturdy bag to basically just carry your laptop you ca n't go wrong with samsonite quality
my laptop fits inside the bag with just a tad more room for accessories i did n't want a huge bag with lots of additional <unk> i would put more stuff in and bag gets heavy this way it limits me to carry the charger chords , and <unk> material like several magazines , and a cell phone shipping took a while though
very high quality bag however ; it is very slim i use this bag to carry a dell xps # z which in size is similar to a macbook pro if you 're carrying anything this size or larger and you plan on bringing your charging brick you 'll have difficulty storing much more than a couple of pens and a couple documents if recommend this bag for a macbook air or any tablet
this is a very simple bag there is nothing much to say as it is that simple does the job i have a thinkpad with extended battery which most # . # bags can not fit but this one does it is not at all bulky and has # zips in the front and one in the back it provides adequate protection to the laptop the best think i like about it is it 's lightweight and simplicity
the bag suits my needs perfectly i already take my books , folders and documents to school and work in my backpack and adding my laptop added a significant amount of weight all i needed was a small bag that could accommodate my # . # inch laptop without being too bulky but still being able to hold the charger and wireless mouse in addition to the laptop this case fit my needs perfectly it holds my laptop snugly , and although the mouse and charger do bulge out a little bit on the front , i 'm still completely happy with it if you 're looking for a no frills , sturdy bag to hold primarily your laptop and charger -lrb- and maybe a wireless mouse and a thin folder or notepad -rrb- then this is the bag for you if you 're looking to hold your laptop and maybe some files along with it , i.e . a backpack or messenger bag replacement , look for something more deep oh , and the price -lrb- i paid only $ # -rrb- simply can not be beat oh , and it should be noted that i use a windows based laptop mac users will have a bit more leftover room in the bag than pc users will
the design is handsome and the price is fantastic on this bag i 've had it for almost a year now ; i carry it daily and it 's still in great shape
this small brief case is ideal for <unk> a laptop computer , a tablet and a few other small items between home and office it is well constructed and sturdy i do n't yet know how well it will hold up , but i have had no problems to date
bought this to leave in the vehicle when i only needed to take my laptop in a place looks nice even though it was not expensive but if you want to carry your laptop and files , etc . this would n't be the case for you
i bought this for my gf who is always on the go she is happy so i am happy product is sound and sleek for a person who travels a lot but does n't need extra pockets for extra baggage
this bag is n't showy or fancy , it does n't say look at how how much money i have or anything it just works , which is exactly what i think a bag should do surprisingly good amount of space in a smaller bag i carry books and binders and my ipad in it and they all fit great would recommend this economical bag that simply works great
i purchased this laptop case for my girlfriend whose laptop case was worn down badly very sturdy and designed well she puts her laptop charger in the second pocket and it does n't look bulky at all i may get one for myself at # something dollars
received item on time actually did not order to use as a lap-top carrier , i do a lot of work for my church and needed something like this to carry paperwork - it is awesome lots of room , with three outside zipper pockets highly recommend this product
i use this for travel for a # . # & # # ; dell ultrabook . plenty of space for accessories and still is slim i like the fact it has a shoulder strap i have a smaller version of this for my ipad + apple bluetooth keyboard that is also great very durable and not cheap looking
i was looking for a bag that allowed me to store my ipad and other miscellaneous items including a <unk> i live in a state where concealed carry is still a right afforded to law <unk> <unk> this bag allows me to do that if i choose to the secondary pocket on the one side is perfect to hold any size pistol and it 's outline is not noticeable at all it 's very durable and seems to be well made
i love this i use it to bring my laptop to work it 's very stylish and gets the job done i keep a wireless mouse , and an xbox # controller in it as well does n't add a whole lot of bulk overall , i would recommend this product
be sure to carefully measure your laptop great bang for the buck side pockets are great for a flash drive or papers , but not for a charger -lrb- too <unk> -rrb- , and no velcro to keep handles together better for a mac -lrb- small version -rrb- , but when spending that kind of cash , just go out and shop for one keep that in mind i found one for my new mac for $ # , but that was for a # & # # ; -lrb- <unk> -rrb- i 'd shop personally , but this is a quality case and ca n't say anything bad about it really
bought this for my macbook pro retina # & # # ; and it fits like a glove in this simple but sturdy laptop bag it has good zippers and unlike some other reviews , i think it is thick enough and provides enough protection for my laptop it nicely fits my laptop , the charger , mouse and my kindle plus it fits a few documents too in the front and back pocket i highly recommend this bag if you 're looking for a slim and light laptop bag to keep the essentials
this is the perfect , simple and classic computer bag it 's samsonite , so you know it is a quality product i would recommend this product to anyone wanting a durable carrying case
i had a larger clunky unit , made of cheap looking vinyl , so i needed an upgrade my laptop fits in here perfect , albeit , not much room to spare , but i can still put other things in like checkbooks , papers , etc . the size is perfect for me the quality is # % i do n't know why i did n't get this sooner
for $ # this case can not be beat it is small and can only carry a laptop and some papers and other small items , but if that is what you are looking for then look no further
love this bag , good quality this is definitely a slim bag , only enough room for a computer and papers , and this is exactly what i was looking for good price for this quality
economical , handsome , practical -lrb- shoulder strap and handles -rrb- what 's not to like my retina has a skin as opposed to a <unk> cover ca n't vouch for the fit with a thicker encasement room for charger , portable external hd , etc .
this laptop bag is perfect for my # & # # ; macbook pro laptop but if your planning to carry other items like school books and or other bulky items this bag is not for you i do have a little more space to fit my ipad and # plugs , -lrb- mac , ipad and cell phone -rrb- other then those don & # # ; t expect to carry much more i do recommend having a laptop sleeve place in the bag for a little softest this is juts extra protection for your laptop but this is the kind of bag i was looking for , to have my basic plugs and my laptop
purchased for an hp envy # nr spectre ultrabook wanted some extra room this samsonite tote worked out great and provides room for the <unk> adapter , a mouse , a mouse pad and other small desktop items plenty of easily zippered closures
the bag has ripped at the seams in two locations within one month of purchasing it this bag is ` gently used ' strictly for traveling to and from work
although the price on this item is great and i received it <unk> , the stitching between two of the compartments came apart after only two days of use with the bag being this inexpensive , yet with the cost of repair being incredibly high , it simply does n't make sense to get it repaired it would seem samsonite has lowered their prices -lrb- and their quality -rrb- since if you break it , you can just buy a new one very disappointed considering i 've used other samsonite products in the past and have written nothing but rave reviews about them this one was a real <unk> and of course , it was past the return time frame so i could not return it either again , disappointing
i had this bag for about # months before it broke i regularly carried a # & # # ; laptop , power <unk> , mouse , lock , pens , notebook and a textbook everything fit ok , but it was tight squeeze the fabric at the point where the shoulder strap loops are stitched to the bag started tearing and pulling way from the bag , resulting in a hole i can still use the bag without the shoulder strap , but now there is a big hole in the laptop compartment i expected more from samsonite , very disappointed
considering that i only carry my laptop , a portfolio and my cellphone <unk> i can not believe that this bag is already tearing at the seams and that the carrying strap is ripping off the body i have had the bag for less than # days please buy something that will last longer , i would n't pay $ # for a bag with this kind of durability
my husband had a briefcase similar to this one for over # years and i finally bought him this briefcase bag for christmas he loved it and all the filing compartments , but now after # months the seams are coming apart i will be refunded partially and must pay to ship it back as i understand what the refund policy i am sorry that this is not well made because the design is great
i am an older college student and do n't have hundreds of dollars to spend on a bag to carry all of my books and laptop in i just got this bag last week and thought that i made a great purchase until it poured yesterday and my stuff got wet from the rain going through the zippers , which were zipped shut i would not recommend this bag unless you live in a dry area the only thing that is leather on this bag are the handles , so that description is misleading it holds everything i need it to
this was overall a good purchase however it is a very tight space for so many pockets when i put my lap top in there is n't much room for anything else it seems to be constructed well
bought this to replace a <unk> backpack i had used for many years does n't hold nearly as much and the quality is not as good as i expected since a couple of seam threads were already loose because of that i do n't hold too much hope it will last very long but since i have significantly reduced my travel i 'm hoping it will be ` good enough '
the strap snapped off the bag in less then a year i fixed it numerous times but the problem just seems to get worse it is a nice bag but the strap could have been designed better
it is a good product seems to be well made but it did not fit our needs i wanted it to carry a new laptop computer but it was too small
it 's a great all-around bag for work this real <unk> is that the bottom is not reinforced with any protective material that means that over time the part of the bag that takes all the punishment is too exposed to unnecessary wear and tear my targus bag , for example , has a hard plastic piece at the bottom to address this obvious problem i expected more from samsonite
i have a # `` hp notebook and this case is barely big enough it really is more suited to a # `` storage space is great if it was just a little taller and a little wider , it would be perfect
i do n't travel as much any more , but so far this has been nice i would like an extra divider and slightly wider area for papers and folders and maybe some slightly larger pockets some of the small narrow business card size & # # ; pockets & # # ; are a waste -lrb- in my opinion -rrb- things i have liked are the light gray interior it is hard to find stuff in a black interior -lrb- especially in a hotel room or rental car etc . -rrb- and so far , the shoulder strap has not got all twisted -lrb- like my previous bag did - that was annoying -rrb-
it is a great bag and i use it every day to carry my laptop , a few folders , and whatever else i may need the only issue i have had is that after # months of admittedly heavy , daily use , the seam where the strap attaches to the bag has started to fray it still appears to be structurally intact , and i plan on using it until it breaks , but i was hoping for a bit more durability other than that it is really useful the laptop area is especially well designed in terms of padded edges and a curved zipper to make it easier to get in and out regularly
i am using this bag from almost # month 's although this bag looks thinner than other bags . . this has lot of dividers and pouches inside it . looks good . feel 's good . . liked
been using it for # days , looks like a good replacement for my old laptop bag seems pretty resistant , i hope it stands the abuse the old laptop bag took for # years only thing i have to get used to is the handle it has stuck a couple of times with the zipper i guess it 's something to get used to in everyday
i recently purchased a messenger bag which was n't that great not built for folders , laptop etc . i needed something sturdy and well built , hence the samsonite classic this bag was everything i need . my only problem is that it get to heavy for my back to carry it i gave it # stars because i like the bag it 's a thing i love my wife
i ordered this as a christmas present for my husband he needed a new <unk> bag although i was nervous about ordering online , it lived up to the images the pockets and pouches are just as pictured everything that my husband needs for work fits and is organized he really likes it plus it 's a lot lighter than the leather one he just got rid of on the computer it looks more like a leather than it is in real life it is a tough fabric , and looks good he just started using it this week , so i 'm not sure how it is in daily use yet
pros : lightweight , decent quality for a bag at this price point cons : the manner in which the strap is connected to the bag could be vastly improved the strap on my bag keeps wanting to disconnect from the bag so i have to be extra careful also the gussets -lrb- zippers -rrb- could be more robust overall , i 'm satisfied with the purchase and would give it a # . # star rating for quality and a # for the price
for the price , this bag can not be beat before purchasing this bag , i went through # kenneth cole leather bags i am rough on my <unk> and this one has definitely handled it well it is a little stiff , but i think it will loosen up it has ample storage space and is overall good quality
i was looking for a bag that was # & # # ; - # & # # ; thick -lrb- deep -rrb- , so that i can place it behind the driver 's seat of my car this bag fits perfectly the only improvement that i would make to the bag is to add little feet at the bottom the bottom part of the bag sits flush with the surface that you put it on in the event that the surface is wet or soiled in some way , the material would get wet or dirty otherwise it is a perfect bag i highly recommend it
only problems : # i wish there was a little spot to put a water bottle on one of the ends . # the shoulder strap is n't that comfortable i 'm probably going to end up buying a new strap to put on this bag all in all , i 'm very happy with my purchase , especially at this price point
i purchased the samsonite <unk> three gusset laptop bag for work it has pleanty of room for my files and a wide laptop the bag is well made and not so large that it would be hard to take around but has plenty of room for everything
this suitcase is quite good if there is a thing i have to say negatively , it is the size is out of my expectation i think it 's a little bit big however , i am sure it will be a good choice for those who frequently have business trips
i have a # & # # ; hp envy and it just fits into space where the computer needs to be placed need to place the front of the computer into the case first to make it fit the elastic band that is suppose to hold the computer in place can not be used . but with the snug fit you do not need it lots and lots of room to hold item seems to be constructed well , but then i only received the case and have not travelled with the bag yet maybe samsonite or amazon should explain what & # # ; three gusset & # # ; means
this bag is amazing for mobile computer and file storage it has space for everything , including a tablet and laptop accessories it 's study and nice looking i would give it # stars if the shoulder strap were more comfortable but it 's definitely better then others i 've used all in all i 'd say # . # stars
a very nice case , love that i can put the sleeve through the handle on suitcase -lrb- just wish it was a little tighter , either that or i need to not load it too much -rrb-
i wanted to carry just one bag with all my electronic gear -lrb- laptop , ipad , music , camera , kindle , noise cancelling earphones -rrb- this one is large enough to get all that stuff in with some room to spare it is not too heavy -lrb- that is the problem with leather -rrb- , but it looks pretty sturdy and fits on the handles of a rollie no i just have to keep my eye on it at all times losing it would be great pain
this is a case i got for a christmas gift it is built very well and seems strong i like how it has lots of compartments and pockets it really holds a lot of stuff i would recommend this
i enjoy this bag it is a good product for what its use it is better than the other laptop bag i have i use this one for work there is more than enough space for all my gadgets : -rrb- i 'm happy with my
did n't want anything fancy and i got it while it looks fine , that was n't a criteria very functional , lots of pockets that work for various business tools seriously , i wanted a reasonably priced bag and am comfortable to buy function over form feels well made
i previously had a samsonite and it lasted & # # ; # years , so i thought i would try another one i like this one just as much from my initial impression , i am satisfied and i think it will last just as long
i have nothing bad to say about this bag except for one thing it does not have the rubber feet at the bottom i did not notice this until i read a previous review after my purchase other than that it seems to have good quality i just received it today so time will tell the only reason for the # stars is the absence of the rubber feet a good buy so far
purchased this for use to carry my # `` notebook and ipad and all the chargers and laser pointer and phone and some documents as well carries quite a lot and is light weight for travel good looks , well made , good price
i like it , its made out of good quality fabric has a lot of sections , <unk> for # & # # ; laptop the only thing i dont like its that sometimes when you pick it up by the long strap , one of the two hooks get released its strange , but i learned now , i check both before carrying it -lrb- that cost it a star
i have been using this bag for over a year , and i have been pretty happy with it it easily fits and protects a # -inch laptop , and it has several other pockets for papers , laptop accessories , etc . it is very roomy and can hold quite a bit the bag is not waterproof , which i found surprising , so i sprayed it with <unk> when i first received it the # handles do not have a velcro or button piece to attach them together , which would have been a nice addition i carry some very heavy items in the bag , and the bag ripped near the point at which the strap attaches to the bag it was relatively easy for a local repair place to fix it recently one of the zippers on the large middle pocket broke it actually has # zippers on it , so i have been able to open and close the bag with the other zipper for the past couple of months
got it today and the bag is very spacious with lots of pockets to keep the items it has got nice padding for the laptop in the middle pocket and there is enough space for the laptop it is a very good option for those who travel and need to carry lots accessories apart from the laptop as of now seems very durable and looks like will last for quite a long looking forward to use it
great briefcase for business or travel lots of useful pockets , sturdy and well made , and the handy pocket that slips over the handle of a carryon piece of luggage is very convenient
this is a great bag with plenty of room for documents , headphones , a tablet or laptop and many more items just right for carrying on the plane bag is very well built and very roomy highly recommend this bag
this bag is very well constructed i am very pleased with all the room and full features of this bad although would like more color designs as it is not very feminine you will not be <unk> holds my # . # inch laptop as described
this is everything it is advertised to be but did not realize quite how large it was this could easily be overloaded causing excessive stress on the strap mounting hardware but is working out well
i travel a lot for business so i have had my fair share of laptop cases this one is hands down the best i 've ever had it durable , its light , and somehow it has magical alternate <unk> <unk> inside of it because i can pack <unk> more stuff in this bag than should be possible no bulges , no torn seams , no broken zippers this thing rocks
i bought this bag for school , i am a college student , and i have to carry my textbooks , laptop , notebooks and all other class materials in this it fits it all , <unk> easy access to it all and keeps water out easily the bag looks great and feels great no complaints here at all
high quality zippers , using it for ipad , travel documents , camera and bose headphones , etc when i fly fits in the smallest overhead bin or under seat easily do n't need my wheeled bag i used to carry my laptop anymore
previously had the leather version and ordered the fabric just as professional looking and plenty of room had the original for years so expect this one to last as long too
this briefcase is roomy , with plenty of thoughtfully placed pockets for keeping stuff separate as a bonus , it is by far the <unk> briefcase of this size i have ever owned it is a lot bigger inside than it looks outside -- it can easily serve <unk> as a computer bag or a weekender
i bought a new lap top computer and thought i should also get a new bag both the computer and bag were over # years old and showing their age i looked on line at the amazon site and found this bag good size and well made
great quality and lots of space holding up well and a place for all my stuff only time will tell if it holds up to wear , but so far so good
this is a good multipurpose bag that can hold my laptop , ipad , paperwork and still have plenty of room for most anything you would need traveling the zipped pockets on the side are great places to store receipts or slip valuables in before going through security nice design and workmanship <unk> priced too
no need to decide on what to carry and what to leave behind it all fits in this bag i use it daily for work and have had zero issues with it my previous bag would detach from the shoulder strap while in use this bag is very reliable
well my old -lrb- # + years -rrb- leather brief case finally died i got over it by getting a carefully researched one from amazon i love it and it does a great job of holding all my sales gear plus all my cords , cards , etc . it helps keep me organized
was looking for a bag that i could drop my laptop and i-pad into , and this does the trick really well plenty of room and really durable construction comfortable carry strap for using it alone , and a slide over strap to attach it to my rolling carry on an excellent value that i expect to be enjoying for years
i bought this as a ` go - bag ' to store all our important documents and use in case of emergency <unk> -lrb- we live overseas -rrb- we 'll be able to add the laptop and other items at the last minute the numerous pockets , the good quality zippers , and the comfortable handles make this a great bag
good large laptop bag that can double as an office bag two <unk> with one stone i ca n't wait to give it to my father with his new laptop <unk> ... do n't tell anyone
purchased for my husband 's # . # & # # ; laptop the laptop fitted just fine like the multiple gussets the material looks durable hope it lasts longer than the expensive leather bag i purchased just months ago
to receive it <unk> my husband not what would be very large , but no , i love it , and it is having so much capacity that any would do , responsibility for delivery
extremely fully for a full size laptop , large tablet , multiple external drives , power cords , etc . and plenty of room to spare for stationary , files , and a book or two construction is very sturdy , looks classy , and is not heavy also , the strap is of great quality , although the handles themselves could have been better padded at a fraction of the price , it 's as close i 've gotten to my tumi briefcases
a similar item costs at least double if i were to buy it locally great build quality and plenty of space within looks very professional and smart i 'm loving this bag
absolutely nothing wrong that i can pick out it 's perfect for any travelers if i had to , i 'd like a more plush shoulder pad , but that would n't affect the rating i love it the price maybe could 've been a bit cheaper , but nonetheless , i love it
this case is a very well built and definite lives up to its samsonite name no manufacturing <unk> leftovers such as strings and bits of material could not find a case in any local store that matched the functionality and quality has plenty of room for computer , plus power adapter and small tablet , with ample room for folders and necessary office tools
durability and quality of samsonite stylish and sleek great protected insert for you laptop pocket for phone and pens and <unk> , strong shoulder strap clamps -lrb- my hubby always breaks the plastic fits under airplane seat perfect even when fully loaded
just what was needed for new hp # . # & # # ; laptop plenty of storage space without making bag bulky hp fits securely in bag very good price for samsonite highly recommend this bag
our # & # # ; laptop fit perfectly , it had plenty of compartments and as an added bonus it will slide onto our luggage handle for trips would purchase this item again and recommend it highly
i got this bag to replace a canvas messenger bag that i was using as a substitute teacher bag this definitely is an upgrade from what i was using there is room and are compartments for everything i need to pack when heading into a classroom , including my personal items this bag keeps its shape so it is very easy to find items , even if it is stuffed to the brim it is also very sturdy -lrb- my bag contents currently weigh about # pounds -rrb- if you 're looking for a sub bag , i would recommend this over a messenger or tote
this bag has the right sized compartments and the correct number of storage areas to hold computer , cables , <unk> , eyeglasses , snacks , and lots of folders and papers it is well made and easy to carry
great looking , perfect size ; lots of pockets just what my husband , who is a musician and music teacher , needed to use as a gig bag delivery was super fast , even though i used regular shipping i was more than please with the entire transaction
purchase the bag and its really roomy and provides alot of pockets for <unk> things only down side is that if you put too much , its gets real heavy the strap it comes with has this shoulder pad which is kind of weak its small and doesnt offer much support id assume if you purchased this bag , you would have a larger lap top and carry alot of items i recommend purchasing a better and more support shoulder pad otherwise , fantastic product
first , i got this for about $ # , so i ca n't comment on full price value overall , i 'm satisfied with the product i have nothing to complain about it 's big enough for my laptop and other random things , while still being pretty light its quality is very good , too nothing feels cheap or weak if you want a new case for your laptop and also have many other things that you carry around , this is an excellent product but like i said , it depends on its price , and i got it at a discount i would probably pay $ # - $ # tops for it
i can keep everything organized and fit everything i need in this i wanted leather and was a bit disappointed that this did n't come in leather -lrb- or maybe it was just much more cost effective i do n't recall . but i am very happy with it
my daughter started a new job and needed a briefcase for her laptop i liked the way it looked and it looked like it had lots of room , so i bought for her and she loves it it holds everything she needs and more i highly recommend it
my co-worker and i work for an attorney he had a similar bag that the inner lining had torn as of shoving file cases in it every time he went to court after years of a different product , he asked for one for his christmas gift we reviewed tons of bags with the measurements he gave us but this one meant all his criteria , including the ballistic nylon our boss was thrilled and surprised with it and thought we spent tons more on it than we actually did he uses it every time he has to take client files to court thank you samsonite two <unk> who are very happy but a boss who is ecstatic
