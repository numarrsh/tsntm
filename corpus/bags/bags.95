laptop tote is very nice , it 's larger than anticipated , as my laptop is # & # # ; ; but that 's okay , my nook will fit along with other items while traveling i am happy with the padded protection for the laptop it will be very secure
this is a great bag for a great price it fits my laptop perfectly and has pockets for everything i need i especially love the ability to hook it up to my suitcase when i travel
this bag is really nice in appearance -lrb- especially for the price -rrb- , but i wish that it held more stuff i am a lawyer and find that on days when i have to also bring my laptop that the bag is not capable of holding as many files and paperwork as i wish it was the <unk> inside are great and the fact that it slips onto a suitcase is an added bonus for weekend trips
this is quite a large bag for anyone planning to use it as an everyday purse & # # ; & # # ; which i do so , if you do n't want something quite this large , you might want to look elsewhere people wanting to use it as a work tote will find it more than ample aesthetically , the bag is basic & # # ; & # # ; black with minimal decoration -lrb- just some bronze nail trim -rrb- the interior has plenty of small pockets for pens , phone , etc . i do agree with others who have commented that the straps are sort of flimsy and likely wo n't hold up well but for the price , this bag suits my purposes well for now
i do n't think you can find better quality at this price this bag <unk> holds my laptop , business and school files , flash drives , cords for all my electronics there is more than enough space inside this bag and it looks cute too
i really like the style i wish it could hold more though i use it as a briefcase rather than just a laptop tote i hope it continues to hold up ... ! ! the shipment was fast too ... ! !
i seldom need a tote for my computer so did not want to spend a lot but did want a nice carrier this one fit the bill before ordering , i checked at my local office supply and discount stores but could not find a nice tote for under $ # so , of course , i went to amazon and here it was i had seen a solo tote just like this one at my office supply store and it was $ # i would have preferred a tote in a different color but , for $ # , it works
this was a gift for my wife , she loved it she can now go to school and not have to worry about carrying the laptop in a heavy case it is very classy to it adds the extra good look to professional women will definetly recommend it
i bought this bag for travel with my laptop for work i had low expectations since it was so cheap but when i received the bag it looks nice and professional it fit my large laptop and many more items i needed for my travel and a bonus zip pocket on the back unzips and you can slide the bag over the handle of your rolling bag this is a great bag if you are looking for a professional , nice looking travel laptop bag that does not cost an arm and leg
it is impossible to find laptop cases with built in straps to fit over suitcase handles i had one years ago and have been unable to find one in stores this case was exactly what i was looking for nice quality , fits all of my peripheral equipment . . and easily slips over suitcase handles !
this laptop bag was the perfect size to accommodate my # . # & # # ; laptop for work the inside # pockets work great i was glad to see it had an inside zipper pocket also it 's actually big enough it would fit a # & # # ; laptop since i only paid around $ # , i was n't sure of the quality but the material looks great and the feet at the bottom of the bag will help maintain the durability
this case has enough padding to protect the laptop , yet it is not <unk> the straps fit comfortably and securely over the shoulder it is also a really attractive case
this bag is very attractive as well as sturdy i saw one somewhere else and of course much higher priced i don . t carry my laptop everyday , but i think it will last for my use
the slip is perfect for the # & # # ; mac airbook and the side pocket holds pretty much all basic accessories although it can get bulky the quality of the slip is excellent and the zippers feel solid overall a great product
this is a fine cover for your laptop it is soft sided , but sturdy with good zippers i would recommend if you are just looking for a cover to keep your computer from getting scratched
cover is study and does not snag as others do , plus the padding is substantial the pocket provides plenty of room for ac cord , mouse , business cards , etc .
this will fit your macbook air # `` perfectly , and can hold thin accessories in the front pocket i use this for an extra layer of protection when putting my macbook air in other traveling bags i do not recommend this for use as a standalone portable utility because of the lack of a strap or handle while this case will provide some protection from water , it is far from waterproof
although there is n't that many users rate this product , i am glad that i found it it fits my new mac air # `` very well , the material is what i expected i never tried other case , but i think this one is worth more than what i paid . i found this case accidentally while i was reading another review for another case of course that user found that the <unk> is much better than the one she first tried out this is not a premium leather case it just does its job very well , and cost effective so i highly recommend this product
product is not robust enough , the seam has already begun to tear open , and this is only the first trip i took it on i will be returning it for full refund when i am back in the states
the wheels too noisy the fabric looks cheap has many scratches in only after # travels has not many pockets to organize your stuffs laptop sleeve is not adjustable bad bad bad
i have had to <unk> -lrb- sew -rrb- the seam around the zipper # times already i had only used it twice -lrb- locally -rrb- when the seam blew the first time it has a lot less storage capacity than expected once the laptop and charger are in there , it may fit one change of clothes the only good thing i can say about it is that my laptop fits perfectly i like the wheels , but due to the fact that the <unk> is so poor , i am afraid to use it for my original intention . . overseas travel carry-on bag my last targus lasted years going back and forth between the caribbean , florida and <unk> perhaps my expectations were too high
the bag was ideal for what i wanted the right size for putting under the seat on regional jets the wheels are <unk> than most the biggest problem is that the seam broke i bought it in february and now it 's july and i have to trash it the seams on both sides started fraying months ago on my last trip the seam on one side broke and it 's no longer usable
i 'm so disappointed i loved this bag -- lightweight , can fit tons of files , computers but after # months the seams are coming undone and the wheels are ground down to <unk> i do walk # mile or so a day with it -- but clearly not durable to last
this case is literally a head turner ... not because of style , but , because of noise on carpet it rolls ok but , the moment you take it on a slightly harder floor , it makes a <unk> also , the design in terms of compartments is not great the laptop compartment is on the lid portion of it so , when you open the sleeve , it tends to fall forward because of the laptop weight also , this case is more of an over <unk> and lets you pack a shirt in it not a good everyday business roller
bought for my son 's school year now he has been using this everyday for # months we are having issues he just traveled with it and loved all the pockets and nooks & crannies but after much love and constant use we are now seeing the wear and tear one of the main zippers is stuck and the pull-up bar jammed in the # st position , so sometimes it does n't go all the way down my son is now looking at all the other rolling backpacks on campus and says the jansport really is holding up with the other kids he is # - so perhaps he has been a little rough with the product , but it should have lasted longer than this
heading into my # nd year of grad school while working full time , i needed a bag that would fit my laptop , books , shoes and my lunch bag since i frequently go straight from work to school i have a large bag without wheels that handles all that quite nicely , but shoulder issues required me to find a bag with wheels once the laptop is in this bag , there 's barely room for much else i have to switch out work stuff and school stuff and leave what i 'm not using in the car i 'm still looking for a wheeled bag big enough to handle it all this bag is nice , just smaller than what i was looking for
very nice bag for the light load traveler but it is a little lacking for my needs i travel a big deal and carry a large amount of cables and adaptors with me # -rrb- not enough seperate pocketed areas for my needs # -rrb- a little concerned about the durability and strength of the top strap handle # -rrb- wheels are made of a really hard <unk> and make a whole lot of noise when dragging it through airport <unk> and the like . # while i really like the idea of the flap for the backpack to roller bag the flap could use zippers instead of velcro to <unk> the seal flap catches on things and overall feels like a real good quality bag but just does n't meet my needs
i currently use the old targus rolling backpack -lrb- item model number : tsb # -rrb- , and was extremely pleased with it i am a frequent traveller and that bag has been great for the last # years the zip quality , build quality , seems and handle have been amazing based on my experience , i purchased the new rolling backpack for my wife -lrb- targus tsb # us compact rolling backpack for laptops up to # <unk> pros up to # -inch - black -rrb- however , i 'm disappointed at the drop of quality in this new backpack - large space -lrb- a sure advantage -rrb- - extra compartment for <unk> - rectangular shape holds more books easily compared to the old <unk> shaped <unk> - not built for # year use , like the earlier one - quality of handle is not upto the mark - <unk> quality has reduced too since i am comparing the bag to an older version , which i rate very high , it is possible that there could be a <unk> if you are planning to use the bag for # years then this is a good bag
when i saw it first , it was everything i needed and i was delighted but when i use it on a daily basis , the noisy wheels are very annoying both for myself and other people i think the wheels could have been covered in a material that would make them less noisy and irritating when rolling on concrete
i have used this for just a few months and have noticed that a seam is already coming undone i was very happy with past products from this company but now it looks like their standards have dropped off andi will have to think twice before buying anything else from this company other then the seam coming lose i will <unk> else seam to be good at this point
the depth is too great to easily glide under smaller aircraft seats it does fit in the overhead bins the backpack depth is probably more than i need for carry-on luggage -lrb- i check a larger bag -rrb- it does hold a large sony laptop and has enough room for other items for travel , it is also nice to be able to quickly retrieve the vertically placed laptop for airport security the wheel construction allows for easy <unk> , are nicely constructed , and are quiet on tile floors
it is large enough for most backpacks and has plenty of space for other things great carry on size i was disappointed with the wheels though it does not roll as <unk> as others i have tried
this is a nice backpack , but it would be # times better if the zippers went completely to the bottom of the pack as it is now , the zippers only come down to about two to three inches of the bottom consequently , you can not lay the zippered flap open if i had known this before buying this backpack , i would not have bought it
last year i made a lot of overnight trip and desperately needed a backpack that could convert to a roller i also needed one that could fit under the seat in front of me or in some smaller overhead compartments this targus compact rolling backpack has met all of these requirements the only thing that kept me from giving this backpack # stars is the lack of extra <unk> inside the main area of the backpack while it has a slot for a laptop and one for a tablet it has no other divider or pockets to store extra things my things end up getting mixed together the thing i really like about this backpack is the flap that covers the wheels when you carry it on your back i specifically looked for a backpack with this feature as i did not like the idea of dirty wheels touching my clothes i 've already used this backpack on numerous trips plus i use it almost daily for work as with other targus bags that i have owned this one is highly durable and i fully expect it to last for many years
i have a physical <unk> and can not carry heavy bags i 've gone through several computer bags before trying this backpack i ca n't believe how lightweight it is i can carry it up and down stairs with one arm without fear of falling it easily rolls in between tight spaces such as airplane isles and the extending handle feels sturdy making it very easy to maneuver
works great for the price . is as advertised i 've never actually used the backpack portion of this , but thought it would be good to have the option ... it 's nice that the flap will cover the wheels if i do
i recently purchased this bag as part of my traveling photographic gear bag while not perfect , it does allow me to carry equipment needed for jobs that require on site photo <unk>
i have been searching for the perfect travel companion and i am pretty sure this is the one this rolling backpack is spacious , has pockets for all small items and rolls smoothly around airport , stairs and out on the street i saw a few reviews complaining about the noise of the wheels but in my opinion they are not more noisy than any other rolling luggage also , the size is about right : not to big that it is awkward to carry and not to small that wo n't fit anything not very comfortable when used as a backpack though as the sturdy bottom protection presses the lower back a little too much also , the straps do not tuck in completely when using the wheels -lrb- or i did not manage to tuck them in completely -rrb- but those are small <unk> for the advantages i have seen so far
this backpack with wheels is exactly what i was looking for has plenty of room and is light i can either use it as a backpack or as a roller bag the side pocket , where i keep my umbrella could be a little deeper but otherwise it 's a great bag
i love this case i gave it # stars instead of # because the handle is a & # # ; t & # # ; handle , which makes it a little hard to pull behind i wish the handle was more like a suitcase , with two bars that pull up and a handle across the top other than that , i like all the features of the case
i took this rolling backpack with me to the airport this weekend the location of the laptop `` sleeve `` make it easy to pull out my laptop as i went through security unfortunately , having the laptop at the front side of the large zippered section also made it a little bit more difficult to remove other items from the back of the bag i like that it includes those little elastic <unk> to help hold a change of clothes in place it has a lined pocket at the top front for things like cellphones or glasses this backpack case fit my laptop comfortably and still left room for my cables and charger , a kindle , my phone , a couple changes of clothes and some snacks i could fit it under the seat in front of me on my flight so i did n't even have to <unk> check it the telescoping handle is probably my favorite part it feels quite durable and was easy to switch between a rolling case and a backpack
the bag is good and the roller is perfect it is just has few pockets . the upper hand give you the feeling of weakness and it may teared . it has a great value of money
purchased this as a replacement to a high sierra laptop backpack solely to get away from a backpack to a rolling bag so far after # trips i am liking this bag a lot rolls well and stays standing not quite as spacious as the bag it replaced but not by much biggest plus is that this one fits under the seat , which was important to me planes so far are a southwest # and <unk> <unk> and embraer aircraft
purchased this to replace another rolling backpack it seems to be well made to early to tell too much about how it will hold up these are becoming hard to find so many are built so cheaply & do n't last i 've hopes that this one will last
i bought this backpack for my school books , laptop and ipad and it has been a <unk> that this was on the market at the time i give this backpack # stars because of the biggest weakness that this backpack has the wheels getting <unk> really easily even though i bought this backpack in the end of april , and it has worked perfectly since then , the wheels have gotten <unk> multiple times the backpack itself is an amazing piece of luggage with so much space to fit multiple books , clothing and laptop with room to spare i did see previous reviews that said that they did n't like the noise they made on the <unk> floors , or the handle was weak , but i did n't experience any of these problems whatsoever i would definitely recommend this backpack to everyone , and i have indeed
i am mostly pleased with this backpack although i will never use it as a backpack one thing i do n't like is the way the handle takes up space on the inside of the pack the interior is not smooth or level and makes it a little harder to organize things i do like how smoothly the handle does work the outside mesh pockets could be a little roomier , they do n't hold bottles very well
i got this bag to accommodate my shoulder and wrist issues in order to transport my # lb laptop to and from work i really like this bag - it fits my laptop , work folders and files , lunch , and accessories with room to spare the only problem is that you ca n't always roll a bag like this on the average commute there are lots of times where i have to pick it up by the handle and carry it , especially in the winter when sidewalks are <unk> or blocked with snow it does have backpack straps , which is helpful , but it is uncomfortable to carry that way i ended up switching back to a regular backpack by <unk> -lrb- ridge <unk> ? -rrb- that keeps the weight of the laptop pressed against your back , minimizing the weight and making it a breeze to carry since i have started using the backpack , my shoulder and wrist have been doing much better i still use this bag from time to time , but the backpack wins for ergonomics
wish it were a little more expandable , maybe one more pocket it is one big pocket and then smaller pocket in front smaller pocket is super convenient lots of space the way it opens is a little hard , but works <unk> very good quality , super quiet for rollers
this product is very well <unk> i have travelled with it a few times already and it is holding up great it has # compartments which eliminates trying to figure out where you put what
i really love this backpack it is easy to maneuver around and has a lot of space for all my books i like that it has padding for the area where you put your laptop and in the front pocket for a tablet
recently i was promoted and now need to take by laptop to work in addition to the items i used to take -lrb- lunch , coffee thermos , resource materials -rrb- my existing shoulder bag was inadequate , so i added a laptop bag quickly i realized the weight of all these items made the long walk from parking quite uncomfortable as i researched possible solutions , i found that most rolling computer bags were great for office items , but a coffee thermos was too tall hence , the perfect solution - this rolling backpack it rolls easily on various surfaces ; it is stable ; it carries everything i need ; it stands by itself all in all , it is perfect for my needs
this is one incredible bag : strong , roomy , flexible , and with great wheels the computer protector is just inside the flap , so the computer does n't take all the weight when you lay the bag down on its back the handle is also sturdy and extends nice and high for this nearly # <unk> person , but i 'm also not afraid to pick the whole thing up with the top handle i 've managed to get a laptop , slide projector , and printer into this bag -lrb- including cords -rrb- , with room for a couple of small books ! then the front pocket can hold my zippered plastic bag with <unk> & <unk> , plus pens , pencils , <unk> , etc . there 's even one zippered outside pocket for just those few more soft things -lrb- i always carry disposable <unk> & gloves for going through security -rrb- if i had one tiny complaint , it would be that the <unk> mesh sleeve on the outside could be a tad taller ; i 've had a tall water bottle fall out a couple of times then there are times when you just have to use it as a backpack , like <unk> train station stairs with your other luggage coupled with the price , this is an overall win for travelers
i can not imagine there is a better bag for the price i bought one for only $ # less at wal-mart -lrb- gross -rrb- and it fell apart in one day with all my heavy law books in it i have back issues so i am unable to carry the # lbs worth of books , supplies and computer i need every day on my back this bag has lasted me for # months already and is still going strong it is truly <unk> , i have rolled it through parking lots with textured pavement , on <unk> trails and through mud and it has not suffered ill effects past needed the wheels cleaned it does not hold as much as a traditional backpack i sometimes have to take my lunch separate on heavy course days , and while my old bookbag could fit # & # # ; thick law books and a computer this one can only fit two however , i have not seen anything reasonable that is bigger i am not overly careful with it so i think people who are having issues must be extremely hard on it to me it suits my purposes perfectly and seems like a great deal
i am an instructor at a college and have to carry a lap top and heavy books this has plenty of room and has so far held up very well i would reccomend for anyone needing a fair amount of room to hold stuff it is not small if that is what you are looking for
really practical and sturdy so far have used it for a little more than a semester , treat it roughly , and use it a lot it is so easy to slide the laptop in and out and get to what you need plenty of room for books and other materials good pocket for tablet or in my case , small notebook like having the water bottle pocket handle works and is long enough overall , very happy - just what i was hoping for
i 'm starting school again and i have to commute targus bags have served me well as a commuter student in the past and this bag is no exception it is roomy , has a nice wheel base , a sturdy telescoping handle and a lovely profile i can carry anything i want in here , it even has a section for a change of clothes i 'm pleased thankfully , it arrived quickly because i waited until the last moment to order it it rolls smoothly on most terrain and i look pretty fly with this <unk> behind me through to halls at school targus wins again
excellent bag for the price , lots of space wheels seemed to work fine delivered on time , and unfortunately , had to return it and the vendor was very nice to work with the reason for the return , it will not fit under airline seats
i love this backpack , even more then my tumi very durable and so comfortable now to travel around with this back pack wheel are great and the flap that covers the wheels is very easy to put on and off
great as advertised - light when empty , seems to have quality rollers and handle i use daily to transport laptop and papers to and from work office and a far away employee parking lot , and has just enough pockets for things like charger cords , phone , etc .
i have looked for a perfect carry on bag for years - my closet is full of & # # ; <unk> & # # ; this bag is very light it rolls up the isle and stores under the seat if necessary the backpack straps store behind a flap and are easily accessible the back pack straps are very handy when you can not pull it the pull out handle is long enough for an adult this bags stands up very well when not being pulled i love the fact that the zipper opens wide , almost like a suitcase , this makes it easy to pack it did have a padded interior pocket for a laptop , but i cut it out to make more interior space the front pocket holds my ipad and my kindle plus a few other items , a small pocket at the top holds my passport and boarding passed -lrb- folded -rrb- . i love this bag
upon first glance it looks okay , it kind of <unk> the apple logo which is annoying but it 's expected the real problem is trying to get it off the keyboard cover is fine and the bottom practically falls off but i ca n't get the top off the first two times it was okay but now the top literally wo n't come off i 've been trying for about half an hour now and all i did was get my fingers crushed time and time again i do n't know if this problem is common , but it certainly is worth looking elsewhere
i was gon na give it three stars because the color looks a little bit more pinkish than i had expected however , after i put it on my computer , it looks very outstanding
i absolutely loved the product , everything fit perfectly on my macbook pro i like how you can see the apple logo perfectly when the laptop is turned on i like its rubberized feel , which is just as described online . only down side was the keyboard cover one letter was a bit discolored for some reason , but it is nothing big the keyboard cover fits perfectly as well -lrb- : i would definitely buy this case again in a different color . i recommend it hopefully it lasts
i bought this for my petite grandmother who cant seem to find her size in any store i originally bought the medium and she likes shirts less fitted and that is what she usually buys the medium was to big but the small fit perfectly she is # ' # and # pounds so we are so <unk> to have found a company who still thinks of our petite <unk>
i love the color and the fact that you can see the apple logo , the keyboard cover is ok , sometimes i miss the keys it 's a little awkward but functional as sometimes i train with my macbook and do n't want other people 's paws on my mbp i recommend it though
i bought this case for a # & # # ; macbook pro -lrb- aka my baby -rrb- and have found that the case is fantastic the key cover is a nice & # # ; bonus & # # ; but it muffles music , and is less than aesthetically appealing however , it effectively protects the keys i just do n't use it basically , great case for a good deal
very fun <unk> looking cover for my mac helps keep it from daily scratches due to use or whatever keyboard is easy to use as well as keeping area clean pleased ! !
this case is amazing the color is exactly like the picture , it fits perfectly and the keyboard skin protects amazingly very protective and easy to put on i got my macbook in january and have had the case ever since
literally is , what you see is what you get i 've dropped my laptop once with the case on , and it cracked on the corner , but it 's still on & there is no damage to the laptop ! : -rrb- completely satisfied with this
i bought a cover from the apple store for $ # and it was always falling off and did not fit this well very well made and soft , i would buy this product again i can not tell you about the key board cover as i am not using it , i just wanted the hard case
great protective case and very nice looking easy to clean and take off but it is well fixed to the laptop so it doesnt come off easy if you dont want it to # month of use
it looks great on the keys and on the exterior . some of the letters and symbols on the keyboard cover are not aligned perfectly but i mean i really dont care ... it looks amazing . great buy
this case fits perfectly as does the keyboard protector definitely worth the money i would highly recommend this item to anyone looking for a protective case for their macbook pro
great shoe , extremely light and it looked great just an fyi , it runs narrow compared to the `` normal `` <unk> , it runs more like the <unk> from the narrow foot point of view
i bought these for our teenage daughters to provide a little extra protection for their laptops they are easy to install and the price is excellent compared to similar products sold at mass retail stores
you would think that i toss my macbook pro around or something by the looks of this case so disappointed in the product because i really liked it to begin with word to the wise : if it 's after one month of the purchase date , the seller will not refund or replace it ... only offer a # % refund after you order a new one no thanks , i 'll just figure out a different solution
i had a lot of trouble with this cover , it did not end up fitting on my macbook . . even though the serial number matched to the one they have on their page i had to get a refund
the case almost absorbs random things and looks dirty all the time i like the color and it has protected my computer well but it does n't look as nice since it appears dirty
i love bright colors , greens & <unk> especially i originally bought a green case for $ # at best buy which i loved but when i saw them for half the price on amazon , i returned it yellow is one of my favorite colors and this case would have been great if it was n't so neon yellow it 's a lot brighter than the yellow in the photos and no where in the ad does it say it 's a neon yellow i 'm not going to return it because its a pain to do that but i 'm not totally satisfied will most likely buy a new one when school starts because i will definitely stand out lol - on a good note , the product fit perfectly on the computer and it came brand new , no scratches or
it did n't take long to receive it in the mail the case fits and the color is nice it looks exactly like the picture i 've been using this case for a few months now and it is protecting my laptop very well the keyboard cover fits perfectly around each key except between the up and down arrow keys but it is n't a huge deal overall i have no problem with this case and i recommend it
my daughter orders case covers to match her room at college she is very happy with the beautiful bright color and matches perfectly this is the # rd or # th color she has ordered and she loves all of them
great value just what i needed and the color is <unk> love it and customer service was great i have bought # different colors of this and every one is a <unk>
this product should not be confused with the speck case it is much lighter -lrb- not as dark as in the picture , it has a opaque gray look -rrb- and does not snap on securely everywhere the cushions at the bottom of the case are held by stickers so these came already misplaced when i got the item dust and particles get stuck on this case very easily and holding it makes it feel <unk> the keyboard pad is pretty good but again , does not feel the same as the other ones you get at apple get the speck case
although the black hard case does smudge finger prints easily the keyboard cover is great , it did take some getting used to . you pay for what you get and i think this is a great product for the money
first off i bought this item primarily for the case i had no intention for the keyboard cover because i did my research and it got horrible reviews it is really uncomfortable to type with and sometimes -lrb- when i type fast -rrb- it does n't even type words because it 's really in the way you ca n't see the light through the keyboard as well either as for the case cover , it does it 's job it had great fitment and i am satisfied with how it looks and protects my macbook pro for the price of both items i would have to say it was worth it this is a cheap case and it gets the job done
this fits my computer but does n't really stay in place it has come off many times when i move my computer the keyboard cover is nice to protect it , but makes it a little bit difficult to type quickly i am still using it because i want to protect my computer , and it 's better than nothing but i am still looking for a good , solid computer case that is not too bulky
well , like the ` ol saying goes , & # # ; you get what you pay for & # # ; for the price , i suppose its decent , the case i find is rather bulky , and makes my mac a bit bulkier also it has a & # # ; cheap & # # ; feel to it , but like i said for the price its decent the keyboard cover is rather disappointing i find that it covers up the keyboard lighting and the & # # ; caps lock & # # ; light i would rather pay an extra buck for a better keyboard cover in the end , the whole thing is okay ... but nothing to rave over
i received my case today , and it looks great solid black , and all the usb ports and the disc drive is well exposed the only problem is that it does n't fit exactly snug the front two tabs that click around by the trackpad are barely holding on but it serves its purpose
the cover is exactly what i wanted and needed protects the body from scratches , and feels decently thick i do n't think it would protect much from a drop , but i do n't think that 's the purpose of this cover the rubber keyboard cover took a little getting used to , but for me , it 's worth it using my computer outside for work fairly often
this was worth every penny there was one thing i did n't like and that in some places the edge is sharp so watch out other than that it was a great buy
the case is awesome but i do n't like how the keyboard cover does n't allow the back light to be seen in dark rooms the keyboard cover has also slowed my typing down which is inconvenient during my classes i do really like the cover , it protects the sleek material of my mac exceptionally well
ever since i saw a buddy with this product i was wanting to get one when i found it on amazon.com for the right price i was excited great price and great buy
really great product my son loves it and it really protects his computer he has had this computer for # years and after putting this product on it , said & # # ; i feel like a have a new computer ! & # #
this is a fantastic protective case my laptop fell from pretty high and survived because of the <unk> that is this rubber case it saved me not to mention it looks fantastic -- very sleek , plus the rubber keyboard cover that <unk> it is a bonus protector from dust and possible spills while working on the laptop
my boss love it and the feel of the skin on the key board i purchased one for myself in teal and base on that purchase , i already had him sold before i told him the <unk> quality of the product however , completely satisfactory and so much more reasonable than some of the other hardshell cases ive purchased in the past quite comparable to the speck quality of cases plus , the keyboard protector is a huge bonus
identical to the $ # speck cases -lrb- which is what i normally buy -rrb- i bought this for a <unk> issue computer so i did n't care about quality as much but i would buy this for my personal computer
yes i said it it really is the best macbook case ever fits like a glove i love it so much i 'm gon na get more colours if you ever need a case for your macbook i strongly recommend you get a & # # ; top case & # # ; cover
purchased the black case with keyboard cover for my son 's # in mac book pro it looks and fit perfectly snapped right on within seconds great price , fast delivery and would purchase again from seller
the case looks and feels great and am confident it will protect my macbook pro from scratches etc . the keyboard cover is a good idea and it fits on , but the feel of typing is not the same , so i decided not to use it
i love the feel to this case , beats the hard case covers by a mile it has a soft feel and is easy to grab and tote around which is <unk> i have children who carry my computer everywhere , including <unk> filled <unk> gym ! ! it snaps into place and it is easy to wipe and keep clean you will love it
