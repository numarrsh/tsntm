the item arrived on time it fit perfect on the computer i did not give it # stars because it look a little bit cheap finished and did not have a zipper to secure the
i had a heck of time trying to find my girlfriend a case that she liked for her # `` mba and i eventually settled on this one without knowing how it would fit the mba # `` unfortunately it did n't fit that well it 's too wide for the mba but i found that if i kept the foam that came with it inside then put it in it fit reasonably well fortunately for me , what <unk> more to my girlfriend is that it looked really cute . =
i bought this for my daughters netbook that i got her for christmas i had to return the netbook and got a laptop instead that still fit inside the case
this laptop case is not what i expected it 's hot pink , has the same picture on the cover but it has a full zipper opening , nothing like the image shown it 's fine for the price but it 's also a bit cheapy feeling i just wanted it as a cover and i plan to use it with my laptop bag so it 's no big but the picture is quite misleading
my laptop is # . # inches long and comfortably fits in this sleeve i feel like i could put a notebook in it as well and it would still be fine my i love the pink color and the feel of the sleeve is not cheap at all my only complaint is that the actual kitty is shiny and looks as though it is a decal that could eventually wear off definitely worth the $ # bucks ! ! ! ! !
the sleeve i received was n't the one pictured but we still liked it . the sleeve i received was a zipper type sleeve which is fine . . maybe the picture needs to be updated . otherwise , we still were satisfied
i love this laptop sleeve it came in earlier than i expected & the one i received is a little different than the one in the picture the one i have does n't have that side flop that says hello kitty on it
my order actually came in a day before the estimated delivery date which was great the only flaw was that the item pictured did not match exactly what i received the laptop case had a different <unk> like a flap , and the once i received had a zipper even if the item was slightly different , i actually feel more safe assured with the zipper because i know the laptop wo n't fall out i have a # . # asus by the way , and it fits perfectly
i ordered this case it looked real nice received it really fast but it is of poor quality the case will crack shortly after using it and the seller is unwilling to replace item do not purchase this item instead add a few more dollars and purchase a speck case that will last and has a warranty and will not crack while protecting your macbook
when i received the cover and opened it - it looked very nice but wen i put it on my mac book the `` apple `` symbol was not centered . . needless to say i kept it
when i received the cover and opened it - it looked very nice but wen i put it on my mac book the `` apple `` symbol was not centered . . also it dosent fits properly to screen part ... needless to say i kept it
good value for money fits well and easy to install only thing i can think of as not so good is that the hole showing the <unk> is a bit offset the packaging was only a <unk> envelope , so the case had been damaged during shipment a small crack at the bottom of the case for the lid
this case is still in good conditions , it came in really fast and like they said it it does have a free mouse pad which came in handy as well the cover has been very durable and i have no complaints very happy with the item
things that have broken : top handle , both of the main zippers , stitching on main seam , neoprene bottle holders this is a great bag , over engineered in every way but the assembly i want to love this bag , but mostly , i just want it not to fall apart i admit , i 'm not easy on stuff , but for the price it should at least last through the kind of overstuffing that any college student would put it through booq sent me another bag for free , but it 's the exact same product it 'll disintegrate soon we 'll see if they send me a third bag bought it from amazon back in december # , received it in jan. first major failure -lrb- zipper -rrb- was in feb. , followed by the neoprene bottle holders , handle -lrb- march -rrb- then the main seam maybe you 'll be <unk> than i was , but if you 're on the fence , i 'd stay away
this was the third booq backpack i 've owned as i thought it was an upgrade from the booq <unk> # -lrb- i also still own a booq python xl -rrb- overall , the design and layout is good , and i especially liked the front camera compartment , but the front organizer pocket is poorly designed -lrb- the internal booq <unk> # organizer was much better -rrb- my biggest complaint is that several zipper pulls pulled out from the slider booq needs to install a zipper pull with a smaller gap between the pull and the slider so that the pull does not separate
great material , the different compartments work great , can bring your camera , for work maybe too big , it can easly replace a carry on so make sure what you are going to use it for
i do n't really get the wrong reviews mine came in a nice box , and the quality of this backpack is awesome , it feels expensive it 's thick so it wo n't easily tear apart very comfortable , i can carry lots of stuff and feel nice the pockets are great , it has pockets for everything you need your electronics will be protected
i have had this bag for a while now , and all i really need to add is how awesome booq supports their product if you 're looking for a <unk> sized bag with a ton of utility slots , this would be it
this case is listed in the description as being able to use with a toshiba thrive not so , it 's about # `` too short and the zipper is difficult to zip nice case , but not recommended for the thrive
this case is described well on amazon , however , when i received it i was surprised that the brown was actually more orange in color if i had seen it in person before buying i would n't have gotten it but the price is good and is n't worth paying for return shipping the size is perfect for my ipad # it fits snug enough so it is n't moving around but not too snug that i have to fight to get it in or out
i mainly buy this because of the good photo display which looks good but the one i received have a <unk> of black instead of brown it does n't look good in actual it protects the ipad but my gf which i give it as a gift ca n't appreciate because of how it looks
this is pretty and certainly protects my ipad when i need to tote it around in my purse , but it is a little roomy some have said it fits the ipad like a glove , but i do n't see how that is possible as there is at least an inch of clearance in mine maybe i got a weird one anyway , it is advertised as fitting the ipad , but i think this was designed for a slightly larger tablet overall , i feel like it is worth the price , but avoid it if you are looking for a snug fit
i 'm not going to rate this as a # just because i had to return it it is a very nice case , good material quality and very well put together however , i would warn everyone who is thinking of buying this to be cautious it says that it is an # inch netbook/ipad case , but that is n't quite true i have the toshiba # . # inch mini netbook , which the description says will fit in this case it does n't it stuck out at least # inches past the zipper i would say if you have a netbook/ipad that is # inches or less , this case is for you anything bigger , pass this right up , because you will be returning it
i 've had this sleeve for a few months now and i use it with my asus aspire one d # netbook the netbook fits snug and the sleeve zips all around works perfect for me
i bought this to carry both my samsung galaxy # . # tablet and a tablet keyboard they both fit perfectly in the sleeve and makes carrying my ` gear ' easy and fashionable from conference room to conference during the work day
i initially loved the look of this case but the very first time i put it on my macbook air , it started shedding the velvet material ends up coming off where you touch it or where it rubs against almost anything since the case is black and i use my laptop in bed , my lap is covered in this crap not to mention , the smell of the case is very chemical and that does n't go away i very very seldom leave negative reviews since hard candy is a reputable company , but i expected a lot more from this manufacturer than this poorly constructed product i do not recommend this case at all
after a lot of research i decided to purchase the hard candy <unk> for my macbook air at first i was very impressed by the cover it was exactly what i expected however , after about # months the cover began to stretch and no longer fit as well and would come loose from the macbook air when it was fully open now that the cover is # months old all of the ` piping ' along the outside edges has come loose leaving an exposed rough edge although the cover is still functional it is no longer the neat looking cover i thought i purchased
i thought this would look like a suede leather protecter instead of a velour protecter for the macbook air , its <unk> it fits well and does an excellent job of protecting the mb air and the price was right but it looks like a synthetic velour cover and not a suede leather cover i know , i know if you do n't mind the velour look as opposed to leather then you 'll probably like this case at least it does n't look like vinyl if you want that `` leather look `` you 'll have to spring for a leather case what was that about no free lunch
i 've bought a few cases now to protect my mac book air since i spent so much money on it anyway this is my second of the hard candy line , the previous one was white i love how this looks and protects my computer once they start <unk> worn they tend to start coming apart from the edges other than that with my usage they last about a year
i had read the reviews on this before i ordered it i still ordered it hoping for the best within # minutes of loading up my new purse , the cell phone pocket came apart i was so disappointed i sent it back before anything else fell apart chic black <unk> <unk> print pu patent leather office tote top handle satchel handbag briefcase
upon arrival the zipper holder fell off . then the <unk> clasp by the bow fell off with no contact to it whatsoever . the material of the bag feels like plastic . it was an overall disappointment
the picture looks great ; however , when i received it . . it had creases that would not come out i would n't want to be seen carrying something that looked that cheap i had free shipping but returning it cost me $ # . # that means , that i lost $ # in purchasing this item if it had looked as nice as the picture , i would have kept it by the way , the one star says i hate it i do n't hate it ... just in great dislike
this product is so cheap , i regret to place order for it picture looks so great when you see actual case you hate it i should not order it i am sorry
bag arrived on time but after such anxious wait based on the description and picture i was so <unk> quality is very poor not as large as i had hoped i live outside the us so i had it shipped to my sister who lives in the state , therefore by the time i got it i could not return it a true waste of my money not very useful for office use
i ordered this bag to be able to use it to transport files from work to my home so i could work at home and also use as a purse while the bag itself is gorgeous and seems very sturdy and well made , the handle was too small and there is no way i could fit my arm through it to put the bag up on my shoulder i have a toddler that i have to carry so there 's no way i can just hold it in my hand looks nice but not practical for me
when you receive it you will love it , but for me , # weeks later , i can not use it more . it is broken . i thought i could use it with my laptop , and there is enough space to do it , but the quality of the handbag is terrible and it will get broken inside . it also lost its shape at the # days i think you can get something better at that price if i could have paid again , i would have paid no more than # usd .
it 's pretty , but it is only about an inch wide , and it does n't hold much i regret buying it and am considering returning it since i could n't get all my stuff in it it is so slim that it can barely stand up by itself there is only one section inside the purse , but there are inside pockets and outside pockets on each side unfortunately , you can put only slender things in the pockets this purse would be enjoyed by someone who does n't carry much with them ... but if you like the convenience of a large purse with # sections on the inside , you do n't want to buy this one
it looks pretty sharp online with its faux alligator texture and silver trim , but it 's & # # ; as flat as a pancake & # # ; it 's challenging to fit even a few items inside the unusually narrow form structure maybe it will stretch ; -- rrb- i can barely manage to put my tablet , cell phone , and a few folders inside the bag did n't like my bulky wallet or other items ; it only likes a few slim objects
it looks just like the photo so no <unk> here , however the high gloss gives it a very plastic look i did not like this , because it appeared & # # ; cheap & # # ; looking at the end of the day , i chose it and not the fault of the supplier
this bag it very attractive but after the first use , the silver <unk> on the bow fell off it is wide enough to hold legal size reports but the handles are too short so it ca n't be worn on your shoulder i would not carry anything heavier than a report or two in this bag for fear that the strap may tear off
overall this bag seems a little cheap , but the main problem is that the straps are very short i ca n't put this bag on my shoulder at all , and i am not in to having to hold my purse with my hand so i will be returning it
just got this bag and am very disapointed the pockets on both sides are n't deep or wide so files wo n't fit and the lining throughout the bag feels and sounds like paper this bag is going back
super cute bag , large enought to hold my ipad a few thin files for work looked very polished and professional i 've used it less than a week and the handles are detaching from the bag i will be returning this
the bag seems of a god strong quality with a number of pockets , but seems less spacious than anticipated which means that it seems bulky after just a few items are placed in it
i bought this bag to carry files and office supplies to work and back i wanted also to be able to carry a water bottle and couple granola bars it is a little smaller than i pictured it in my head but i do n't think it 's smaller than the description details i think it will work for my purposes however , i definitely would n't want to carry a laptop in it as was suggested could be done the bottom has no padding of any kind and i 'd not trust it to carry anything fragile for file folders and paper clips it will work ok the metal decoration on the front is removeable when i put it back on it marred the material a little bit i 'll have to be very careful with this bag so it does n't get scratched
the bag is very stylish and nice when i hold it all my friends like it although the zipper stitch is not strong and you need to be careful every time you open it
its pretty , big , but too narrow i ca n't fit too much things in this purse this was a gift for my mom she liked it but she said the same thing
this is a very sharp looking purse it would hold important paperwork and an ipad however ... the handle is quite small if anything were to stick up , out of the bag , you could not use the handle i felt this purse was just a little smaller than i expected i returned it
i purchased my `` office tote `` to <unk> my new status at work and felt very chic until the silver <unk> on the front fell off i found some double stick tape -lrb- the heavy-duty thick kind -rrb- , stuck it back in place , and kept it moving unfortunately , after # months , the straps are holding on by a thread , the lining is torn , and the cardboard in the inside is about to come out this is a very nice bag , the size is adequate it 's perfect for carting around files , but not very good for everyday use
great bag for a small amount of items the inside is smaller then it looks and the threading inside that holds the bag together came out on one side when i unzipped the bag it has a great look but is poorly made
i would not use this for a briefcase or to carry a laptop unless you have a very small one , under # inches which is what mine is i did not get it for that purpose but it is advertised as an & # # ; office tote briefcase & # # ; which it is not if you want to carry papers from the office in it , fine , it will work for that i got it for an ordinary purse it is a good size for that but i would have liked it a bit larger it looks great , has to be carried by hand or on your arm , not over the shoulder , which i prefer -lrb- over the shoulder -rrb- it has a zipper which i like and the compartments inside will carry my cell and blue tooth and my usual stuff so i will use it and i like it
it came in handy for my interview , but it is a little small i was able to get a binder and a couple of folders in it , but it was unable to zip when i did it was okay side to side , but barely long enough for them to fit it is very stylish and useful but a little longer would be better it is not quite a purse but not quite a satchel either
i like this bag it is exactly big enough for me to carry my # . # kindle and my asus table in the middle section the two side sections holds the rest of my things -lrb- like my brush , makeup , etc -rrb- nicely it is almost perfect for what i needed the only thing i do n't like about this bag is that the handles are too short to fit over my shoulder and it does not have a shoulder strap if it had a shoulder strap , it would be absolutely perfect
though i experienced one disappointment , where on the same day i wore this hand bag , the sliver buckle to the front fell off in public , the bag is over all good value for price overall the <unk> of the bag is chic and steady only wish list for this product is that it be made a little larger to accommodate a full size laptop with space to accommodate the usual lady carrying items like make up bag etc . however the current size is perfect for <unk> running 's
solved my headaches of not being able to find stuff in my handbags , <unk> around in the dark , trying to feel around on the bottom , etc . this one is especially good for papers , folders , books , wallets , checkbooks , cosmetic bags -- keeps them nicely upright in the place where you slid them bag stands on its own , does n't flop
just received this tote for work and absolutely love it i have received so many compliments already it is a very compact but spacious enough for the day-to-day work tote received this product in less than week would recommend this seller
i love this item i actually carry it as a purse and i found the size to be perfect and the quality outstanding i would recommended this item to every woman !
i just had to have this purse and the moment it arrived i immediately starting using it i am complimented on it every day it 's perfect for corporate attire and interviews , and can even be used for evening outings the interior is roomy and it has additional pockets on each outer side of the purse if you like sophisticated , classy accessories , this purse is a must have
i purchased this laptop bag after reading the reviews that a # . # inch laptop will fit in it it does however : you have to stuff it into the main compartment -lrb- which has # pockets in it that you can not remove -rrb- and it leaves no room for anything else it does have # large pockets on the outside that will fit a mouse and power cord but nothing else will fit in the bag if you have a smaller laptop , then get this it is made of good quality , the shipping was fast and it is very cute if it 's a bigger laptop , find another bag i will keep it for a book <unk> bag
the material is really strong and i really liked the designs it is perfect for my laptop and i can totally see myself using it for school or anything else i totally totally recommend it ! ! also , the price is really reasonable !
five start item the bag is just like the picture the bag is padded and my macpro # & # # ; fits perfectly with room to spare the strap also has padding i am not currently using my acrylic case , so not sure of the fit great shipping and product arrived in a clear bag i do n't foresee the straps or handles being stressed the fabric is strong and has multiple pockets for other items to be placed in the bag i have my computer and hk hand <unk> in the bag and still have plenty of pockets unused great gift for the hk lover
i simply love this computer bag i use it everyday for work and get numerous compliments i 'm also rocking out hello kitty on a daily basis ! the computer fits nicely as well as my cord , several folders , pens/pencils , and a # ring binder ! lots of pockets
this bag is super cute and very good material i love the hello kitty rubber zipper heads adds a really cute feel to the overall bag the entire bag is made with great strong material to protect and support your laptop there 's lots of compartments and slots to put all your goodies in i really really like this bag the strap that it comes with is very sturdy
my sister was so surprised when she opened this up for christmas its kind of small , but fit her # in macbook pro with ease made of really good material too !
i ordered this bag for my daughter , in college i did get to see when i visited her and it 's so cute she really likes it and it appears to be pretty sturdy
this item was exactly as stated it arrived on time and i have seen in past reviews about the zippers being a surprise i now know what they meant and i wo n't ruin the surprise either but i will say its worth every penny spent it is made very well has plenty of pockets and storage room i would recommend this to anyone looking for a laptop bad and loves hello kitty i love this bag
the case was fine while it lasted however , after only # months of regular use , the zipper is completely broken , to the extent that part of it has come off of the case entirely for a $ # case , this is totally unacceptable
nothing more to say other than the laptop case cost $ # , lasted # weeks before the zipper teeth broke off and would not open past the first corner the product now lies broken and in tatters in the garbage can in my office thule may be `` made in sweden , `` but the made in china tag on the inside seems more reflective of the quality of construction and duration of use
i used this product for approximately # months before the zipper broke on it <unk> , it broke just outside of the amazon return window the case itself is quite durable and tough , but it 's no good if it wo n't close i will be purchasing something different going forward
the sleeve looks much better than it performs the zipper is very tight and difficult to open and close when the new macbook pro retina is in the sleeve there is a little more than a half inch of play in both the length and width , so the laptop tends to slide around inside i was definitely disappointed in this case , and expected something more form fitting
i bought one at apple store the zipper broke at the corner after few months i took it back and they replaced just few months passed and it broke again , in the same place it comes with lifetime warranty but does it mean i have to replace it every # months ?
this was an awesome case the one fault i have with it , though is that the zippers are rather weak both corners of the zipper broke within # months of use however , if you 're willing to be very careful with the zippers , it is a great case
i had this case for almost a year i was an active duty marine and took this case to africa , europe , mexico , well you get the point the case itself is great and very rugged it has a slim profile and fits just the mac book pro # retina however after repeated use of the zippers both zippers have gone off a rail i expected better quality for paying this much for a case not sure is thule will replace it
i ca n't say that i have tested this by dropping my laptop or anything but it is rather thin the zipper is supposedly `` waterproof `` which makes it hard to open and close until you break it in i hope i never have to test this either i bought a booq cover too and find myself using it more than this one price on this one is steep for what it is
you get exactly what you pay for a durable sleeve i do n't get <unk> enough to throw my new laptop around , but this case could probably take a couple of bumps and bruises you can be a little more careless with your laptop in it i paired mine up with a hard case without any problem and it works out just fine did n't have problems with zippers or any of that it might be on the pricier side so i 'd like some tests done to <unk> the quality of this product that paired with absolutely no pockets leads to a #
the quality is superb and finished is beautiful the sleeve definitely looks cooler and sturdier than it is in the picture i just like a little bit more padding for more protection and peace of mind
fits my macbook pro # & # # ; very well and protects it when it 's in my bag or kicking around the house appears to be fairly water resistant , but would definitely not survive <unk> -lrb- not that it claims to -rrb- not crush proof by any means and probably would n't save the computer if it were to fall to the floor from the height of an average table this is a very good <unk> proof cover
rugged protection for my # inch macbook pro i like that you can use the laptop while it is still in the case the case opens up just as the laptop would , providing protection even during use after i 'm done i just zip it up and throw it in my bag i do with there was a bit more padding , however , this is probably a good trade off between degree of protection and <unk>
this case is super nice it fits my # inch macbook pro with retina like a boss very sleek design , fantastic protection , lightweight , and fits countless accessories it even fits the power cord and adapter no problem i would recommend this case to any and all friends with macbooks
took my computer on a week long bike ride the gauntlet held my computer and both were in an aluminum case well protected but it had to be as it was tossed on a luggage truck with hundreds of other pieces of luggage not a scratch
i 've been quite happy with the thule gauntlet which was purchased for my # `` macbook pro it 's semi-rigid , which is what i wanted and protects my system from being scratched while not in use i have n't tried using my mbp while in the case as others have the zippers can be a little challenging to maneuver around the corners but that 's easily dealt with i 'd recommend this case to others
this sleeve is super rugged and very stylish i just find it hard to swallow that it is very shock absorbing compared to other sleeves with foam i looked for information on testing of its shock absorbing capabilities and could n't find anything it would be nice to see a comparison test with another product on shock absorption
there is no doubt this case is rugged and i love that it is water resistant my only beef with it is that the elastic bands on the sides often get caught between the keyboard and the screen portion of my macbook pro w / retina also , the elastic band that secures the laptop inside of the case should go horizontally instead of vertically this would make the design much more useful in my opinion otherwise i am very satisfied with my purchase and find it to be a good purchase to prolong the life of such an expensive piece of hardware
this is the most well made macbook pro sleeve i 've encountered however , keep in mind that this is just a sleeve , not an attache there are no handles despite the very rugged look , it 's actually durable while being lightweight and somewhat flexible it 's not the same quality as an aluminum composite case like zero halliburton would make this is a no-frills quality sleeve that would work well to throw into your backpack or into the backseat of your car if you are looking for the attache version of this , <unk> gauntlet <unk> # -inch macbook pro attache -lrb- black -rrb- for more features including a handle , a shoulder strap , and an interior pocket that would be my recommendation if you need more than a sleeve
it 's not a totally hard shell , but it seems like it will protect my mac in <unk> # command laptop messenger bag , which does n't have enough padding for my taste my early # `` mbp fits snugly , even with a logitech universal receiver sticking out the mac seems to cool down quickly enough when i close it that i think overheating wo n't be a problem i take it out of the sleeve when using it , however some people have complained about the smell it had a chemical smell for a few days , but now , a month later , i can barely smell it if i stick my nose right in it so i suspect that the smell wo n't be a problem for most people some people have complained about the waterproof zippers being tough to use they have n't been a problem for me there are elastic bands that can get in the way when zipping it up , so you have to be sure to tuck them in before zipping
great buy , happy i purchased for macbook pro # inch very stylish & nice fits in backpack perfectly not too bulky , keeps water out very much needed on rainy days on campus
great protection for my mac book pro with retina display easy to use my laptop is safe and secure and i would recommend this to anyone who has a laptop
i use this to protect my mbp while it 's in my backpack it 's slim and light , but definately sturdy and protective also looks real sleek , and i can use my mac without taking it out of the case i would recommend to someone looking for a case , but not a bag , there is no room for extras like a charger or mouse -lrb- maybe <unk> flash drive .
i bought one of these for my mbp in # and still use it today great protection and fits nicely over my mbp without adding too much bulk in my backpack the case still looks great and has held up extremely well i highly recommend it
this will be a simple review : if you 're looking for a rugged case that is waterproof -lrb- including waterproof zippers ! -rrb- , you can not do much better than this pretty typical of thule products , as well as <unk> craftsmanship in general it is lightweight , but provides just a little more peace of mind for your macbook pro
the best case for laptop , do n't need to take laptop out to work with it just open and go , great on planes this is my second one had zipper problems after # years but it was used everyday
this case is incredible my mac fits inside it perfectly and it provides the ultimate protection to <unk> the case i recommend the thule messenger bag for the mac book then your computer will be protected forever
i use this sleeve to keep my macbook pro retina display in and it has not failed me yet i do n't have to worry if i am walking to class in the rain about <unk> my laptop and having to buy a new one it was a great investment to protect my laptop
bought this for my husband 's new macbook laptop , his is # `` i believe <unk> loves it this item arrived promptly and with no problems very happy with this purchase so far
i get a lot of compliments on this case , and really do think it does it job exceptionally well i love how it can keep the macbook pro retina inside while its open
great durable form fitting case using it with my # `` rmbp please note that it ca n't hold the charger , but if you 're ok with that then it 's great i personally do n't plan to carry around the computer around a lot as it 's meant to be a desktop replacement i 'll add that it works as a good heat shield if you do use it on your lap to prevent your legs from getting fried i take the computer out of the sleeve and place it on top of the closed case i 've read that if you use the computer while it 's inside the case the soft interior will block the fans and cause it to overheat i have n't tried this however
got a brand new # & # # ; mbp recently and wanted to have good protection on it from day one this one seems very sturdy so far and i feel pretty good about having my mbp in it as i carry it around in my backpack i also have a hard plastic case on my mbp , and the computer still fits inside this case it 's a bit snug but that 's not a problem , in fact it 's ideal very convenient that i can use the computer in the sleeve -- that is , the sleeve opens up -lrb- & # # ; clamshell & # # ; design -rrb- all the way just makes it a little easier to take it out and use it quickly , and is convenient when i do n't want to put my computer down on a rough or dirty surface pretty good protection for the price build quality seems great -- no plastic zippers here from the feel of this thing i expect it will last me a while
i have had this for about a year i absolutely love it prior , i was a full-time student and had my # inch macbook in my backpack all the time now that i am a teacher , i do the same thing i feel so secure having my laptop in it and the zippers have been working great , i noticed some critical of them but they have been great
this is a solid laptop case i love my macbook pro and i want it to stay nice for as long as possible so i got this case saw it at the apple store and loved it the case holds my baby in place and makes me more confident about keeping it in my backpack i have a northface <unk> bag and even with the case on my <unk> # macbook pro has no trouble fitting but its also not too loose
its a little roomy -lrb- thickness wise -rrb- for my # & # # ; samsung book # ativ plus np # xxx it seems like it will definitely keep my ultrabook safe also , the zipper appears to make it water resistant i know its a little on the expensive side for a zippered <unk> , but i have no question about its durability
