it 's an easy on , easy off rubberized case and a matching keyboard cover that does n't stretch out over time there 's a tiny embossed & # # ; tc & # # ; logo on the lower corner of the case -lrb- closed , facing you -rrb- , that 's pretty much invisible
i thought that this would be a soft case , it 's a hard one but i like it just fine snaps on and off pretty easy and fits well the keyboard cover is really nice , but will take some getting used to for typing on
this product is exactly as the image and description depicted the product arrived very quickly and it works great to protect my macbook pro definitely recommend to anyone who wants to give some personalization and protection to their laptop
i wanted a case to protect my computer and i love purple this was a good value and i like the <unk> look it was delivered on time and packaged well . ! !
this product protects the case , allows for a rubberized feel that a cellphone sticks to while going down the road it also has gripper feet that keep it in place on smooth surfaces never had any issues with it so far -lrb- # months now maybe -rrb-
i ordered this on a sunday and it came on wednesday ! i literally just put it on and it fits perfectly it 's a snap on and its so easy the color is a super light <unk> color and it 's subtle and amazing no bad things so far . super easy i would totally recommend . :
the topcase i bought is just what i was looking for i travel alot and wanted extra protection for mac bookpro the <unk> came very quickly and as described
i ordered this item after looking at similar items in retail stores the other macbook pro cases that i looked at cost $ # or more , and did n't seem to offer much protection this case is not only very attractive but it is rubberized , which gives me more confidence that it will provide adequate protection to the laptop if it is dropped , versus the hard shell cases overall , i thought the quality of this case was excellent , it has an attractive appearance , and the price ca n't be beat i would highly recommend this laptop case the keyboard cover -lrb- while it may take a little getting used to -rrb- is ideal for keeping spills out of the keys if you commonly have a beverage nearby while you 're working as someone who has has a laptop keyboard <unk> by moisture , it just seems like a smart idea to prevent accidental computer damage caused by spills on the other hand , if you do n't need it , do n't use it ... or give it to a friend you 're not paying any extra for the keyboard cover
the case came exactly as described , and i am very happy with it it was delivered very quickly as well the case fits my computer extremely well and will protect it nicely
very happy with the product , fits my mac like a glove , it 's exactly what i needed . color and quality is perfect the case arrived much quicker than other products i have ordered love the keyboard cover that for me was a bonus , great value in comparison to products in the store
wonderful ! ! i 've been getting so many compliments ! ! true to color and feels great i screwed up on the size and they got back to me right away and sent me the correct one love love love ! ! !
i ordered this and it came faster than i expected # days to be exact i absolutely love it , the case snapped right onto my macbook pro the case and keyboard cover were just as described i would definitely order from here again
the case is pretty durable the top part does n't fit exactly perfectly -lrb- there 's kind of a bubble -rrb- but it does the job in protecting the macbook the bottom part fits well the keyboard cover is alright , just a little hard to get used to so i do n't think i 'll be using it that much the free mouse pad is a nice touch
this was easy to snap on , fits great , and protects well my computer has no scratches or marks the color is vibrant which makes my computer easy to find when with a group of colleagues i like the key pad , but it took a little bit to get used to typing on i purchased a hard case and pad for my son 's computer after he and i used mine
this product does what it says it will do fits wonderfully on my mac i love the color and the texture also , its not a heavy product so my mac is still very light weight also great if you want to personalize your mac & make it <unk> from other <unk>
the case attaches easily and you can fully tilt the screen without <unk> and the white bumpers on each corner of the bottom are better than the mac ones imho the vents on the bottom are a nice touch also the keyboard <unk> matches up great and the font matches perfectly but it requires a little more pressure to type on the keys if i 'm typing anything much longer than this review i just take the keyboard cover off and then put it back on when i 'm done
snaps on tightly and is still able to come off when you want it too lightweight and my macbook still seems very protected keyboard cover feels kinda weird while typing , i feel like my fingers do n't slide across the keys as well , but it lays on nicely and wo n't be hard to get used too
item arrived promptly and as described this is the second one that i bought the first one is for me and i bought a second one for my son in law it protects the case without being bulky the keyboard cover is a nice bonus
this was a wonderful purchase to protect an expensive investment i have not taken my hard case cover or keyboard cover off since purchase my mac has been pushed across a desk or counter top a few times and i am so glad i have this protection on there to prevent marring the finish of my computer
this is case does not fit the model # , but the quality and price is good the color is as seem as in the web site i really appreciate the topcase customer service and solved my problem they are so nice
my son loves this cover the keyboard cover however does not fit right and makes the light <unk> and makes the keyboard sticky so dog hair sticks to it a lot
when i ordered this case i was a little nervous just because i heard that they are n't the right color and does n't always fit correctly but let me tell you ! ! when i got the case it was in perfect condition it was the exact color i thought it would be it was really easy to put on and take off and i truly did n't think i would like the key pad but honestly it adds to the computer . it fit perfectly onto the key board and it does n't flop around or move when i type i love it i 'm so glad i got this case its the best
love it ! and so do all the other teachers at my school since i got my put on my laptop i have seen about # other new ones around school
im in love with this case ! the key board fits perfect , takes a little while to adjust but its great . i love how my laptop looks and the apple icon shines through perfectly
i bought this for my dad for christmas and he said that 's what he wanted just something to protect it a little more , especially from scratches . the keyboard pad part did n't fit great , but we were n't sure if the more he used it the better it would fit he was n't too concerned about that part though , he really liked the case
this is exactly what i was looking for very light but also makes me feel like it 's still protected the keypad takes some time to get use to while typing but otherwise no problem
this is a must have for your mac that you have just spent at least a thousand dollars on this case protects the computer from scratches and other stains i especially love the keyboard cover because it keeps any dust or crumbs from getting under the keys it 's all about prevention and this is the solution
product arrived on time in perfect condition however , upon opening the package i realized that i had mistakenly ordered the wrong size case due to my own <unk> i then contacted the seller , who responded promptly and exchanged the case i originally ordered for the right size case that fits my laptop model , free of additional charge the whole process was handled very efficiently : the new case arrived in just # days from when i first contacted seller the case is a lovely translucent purple that is easy to snap on without scraping the surface of the laptop as for the keyboard cover , after a few minutes of typing with it on , i got used to the muted feeling of the keys and do n't find it <unk>
i purchased this for my son , as the previous hard case cover -lrb- not this brand -rrb- had cracked so far , so good he is really happy with it and feels that it protects his device
beautiful case & key protector i have gotten some amazing complements on the case delivery on time , and i love how it fits well on my # ' ' - ` totally recommend
very pleased with the service from start to finish case easily snapped onto my macbook pro # ' & # # ; ... looks great would definitely recommend this case as a very nice looking and reasonably priced case
i got a new macbook pro # & # # ; and wanted something to protect both the outside and the keyboard , this order fit my needs perfectly i would recommend this product and company to anyone , in fact , i have i used to work for apple and have seen many covers that are more expensive , but none of those were any better than this for fit and protection
the case and keyboard cover were selected by my college-age daughter as one of her christmas presents , after much research on her end her only request was that i choose the color - orange or black orange it was , and exactly what my daughter wanted it fits her laptop perfectly , the keyboard cover is amazing -lrb- i did n't know they made such things -rrb- , and we are very happy with the product and service it 's a great buy
this is my second case for my macbook because my first case started to crack , although i never dropped it anyway , i was a bit concerned because this did not have any reviews , but i am so glad i bought it anyway i ordered it on monday night , and got it today -lrb- wednesday -rrb- super fast shipping the case is a really pretty light purple , and the keyboard cover is a plus keys align pretty well , not # % but close enough only thing i would be careful is the shipping this came in a regular <unk> usps envelope with no padding whatsoever i was worried it might have been already damaged but i was lucky otherwise , awesome case
arrived well before the company 's <unk> i expected it to be more gummy to the touch no worries as it 's made of a hardened rubberized substance and fits like a glove i am sure it will absorb shock of any bouncing or <unk> as well as protect the metal case of my laptop it has a lovely true to picture color what you see is what you get here
great deal for the price . need to keep <unk> the key board cover now and then . overall , working out great and i love the shade of purple that it is !
this is probably the best accessory i have gotten for my macbook pro i wish they had these back when i got my powerbook -lrb- # years ago -- which i still use -rrb- this fits like a glove , does not hinder any kind of use , and has a nice texture which makes the macbook easier to grip it is a hard case that clips on to the body of the laptop , so there is no residue , and it can pop right off for easy cleaning the keyboard cover keeps `` stuff `` from getting under the keys , and the laptop a whole lot easier to clean this has kept the body in a lot better shape the grip pads on the bottom of the case are nice and `` grippy . `` this is going to extend the life of my laptop by a whole bunch i would highly suggest getting this if you have any desire to keep your macbook pro looking good
it fit perfectly and looks great on my computer the only issue is that there is a power button where there should be an eject button on the keyboard
i love the texture , it fits <unk> keyboard cover is very good despite having <unk> keyboard it works perfect the only difference is the enter key but i still use it anyway
could be a challenge to <unk> for some people also takes a day or so to get accustomed to the keyboard cover but with time it <unk> quite well
i love the texture and quality of this case it fits perfectly the keyboard is soft and comfortable to type for long periods of time i 'm so glad i ordered it
i bought a mac for school and wanted a case n keyboard cover for it i love the color ! it 's the exact shade as the picture on the site i 'm looking into buying another set in a different color , just to change it up a bit from time to time
the cover protects my mac very well i 've had the cover for around # months and it feels very natural to have it on it the cover protects the top when anything is placed on it and the bottom never overheats the cover looks great too i would recommend this to a friend -lrb- the color i chose was black
i bought this case as a gift for my friend 's <unk> the color is more lilac she loved it it 's very sturdy shipping was fast i would recommend this product
incredible and wonderful we had to & # # ; dress & # # ; three laptops and had been considering some covers for $ # we found these on amazon - based upon look - they seemed similar and the price was dramatically different ... so we went with it we found no tactile difference in the cover from the expensive ones and the look seemed the same to our eyes what a score we love our covers
i purchased this laptop cover for my <unk> laptop the black hard cover fits the laptop like a glove i had no problems trying to place it and it fits so well that i never have to worry about it coming off on its own i love that even though its a black cover you can still see the apple icon on the front when it lights up the added bonus i felt was the rubberized key board cover omg ! ! this thing is great , i wish someone would make one for the extended key board it fits perfectly and at the same time its not bulky at all so when i pack up the laptop i can close it with the rubberized cover on without it preventing to close the computer i highly recommend this you will pay double at other stores and this item is just as great
my local office supply stores offer little in the way of mac accessories this was just what i wanted at a great price and it is holding up well during daily use
totally love the case and the keyboard i ca n't lie , i was very nervous about this product but it was shipped very fast and it really protects my laptop and the keyboard from anything
the case is exactly as described in the product description and in the reviews the <unk> onto the aluminum case is excellent and the alignment of the case with ports , latch and hinges is perfect the keyboard cover is very thin and pliable it fits perfectly flat on the keyboard , but does take a bit to get use to as it adds a slight resistance to the key <unk> but it also adds great protection also included in the package was a small thin mouse pad ... an unexpected & # # ; bonus & # # ; this is not a case that would provide <unk> to the computer to any degree , but it nicely protects the aluminum case from scratches and minor bumps upon seeing how well it fit , we bought another one for our other macbook
it was suggested by a co-worker to protect my new computer i 'm pleased looks great too took a little getting used to when typing the feel is different but no problem
i had just bought a mac and i really wanted a hard cover , i looked at a lot of places and i chose this one i love it the color is perfect and it is really cute a also love the keyboard cover it matches perfectly ! ! all my friends love it , they always complement it great buy !
i 've had these products for about # months now and i love it the case snapped on easily and the keyboard cover fit seamlessly thanks to it no dust or anything can get under my keys and the case is lightweight and does n't overheat my computer you get great quality for a low cost
the product fits perfectly on my computer , andi love the color i did n't think i would like the keyboard thing but it is really useful for keeping crumbs out of the
love this case for my macbook , it fits perfectly , was super easy to put on my laptop , and the purple color is really pretty , it 's almost more like a lavender definitely worth the money , i 'd recommend this to anyone
at first i was nervous to buy this item due to it 's reviews quite a few people complained about getting the wrong size , color , or fit , but i was extremely happy with the product the # & # # ; case fit perfect on my macbook pro and is quite soft it was easy to put on and stays on very well ; the keyboard cover perfectly <unk> with the keys i received the right color , and it came very fast the only thing i was a little bit disappointed with was the packaging it came in a flimsy envelop , and i was afraid it could be damaged ... but all was well i 'm very content with my laptop 's new case
the product was just as described , but it does not fit my mac laptop i received a label from topcase to return it i have already ordered the product that should fit my laptop
i like the case it is exactly what i expected when i ordered the color is very pretty , and you can see decals through it , if you decide to use them as well has worked well to protect my laptop against scrapes and dings
love the color and feel of this case i would order this case again i could get not get it to & # # ; click & # # ; into place , but with great customer service , it fits great now
exactly as ordered it looks great and my wide really likes how it sets the computer off the slightly raised surface allows one to hold onto the computer much easier than when it has just the aluminum cover
i love my case it fit my mac book pro # inch perfectly people need to pay more attention to what item they are buying the case for and stop giving the case a bad <unk> because they have the wrong computer it 's not the cases fault you do n't know what you 're buy
we all want to protect our <unk> equipment this right here was the real deal for me it came just in time -lrb- sooner than i thought -rrb- , awesome material fits perfectly , and the keyboard case does n't come off to the air it sinks in perfectly the price is awesome and i suggest you to purchase it asap before its gone
i still use ti is amazing and thick ! ! really protect outside of my computer it also comes in very useful when you have greasy fingers <unk> n u you use the keyboard
my daughter loves her new cover it 's nice that you can see the apple glowing through it too no worries if she spills something on her keyboard with the overlay for a girl that loves purple , mom scored a home run
i ordered this case about a year ago and loved it i unfortunately spilled nail polish all over it , and thus had to order a new one i could not be happier with the case it not only is cute , but it definitely keeps my computer from being dirty the pink keyboard case is a bonus
i searched everywhere for a good protective cover that i also adored and eventually came across this one on amazon i 'm a big <unk> , and i always put the work in before a purchase i am extremely happy with this cover the illuminated apple still shines through beautifully , making it a mac the color is gorgeous , the texture is velvety , yet it still has the necessary grip , and it does n't get <unk>
love this case bought it in black to replace a clear one i had , which was broken and dirty i have a macbook pro from # the addition of the keyboard cover makes it a great deal , though you ca n't see the caps lock light through it i love the matte feel of the cover ; however it shows oils very easily but overall i 'm very satisfied with this product makes my computer look sleek and protects it from minor scratches fast delivery , too
great computer cover much better quality than the other covers i have purchased on amazon the color of this case in person is very pretty also , it does n't show scratches or bumps i also really love the keyboard cover it came with i 've been using it for several months now and neither the case nor keyboard cover have faded
i love these cases they protect your computer as long as you <unk> dropping it or knocking it on anything the keyboard is just okay it is kind of annoying to type on
i was expecting more of a rubber feeling , but it has more of a plastic feeling i got this cover because it was good price , but also because the original price was very high . so i thought it would be a good quality cover for a very cheap price i am not sure if i order wrong or something i did n't get the keyboard cover with the cover kind of upset about that i 'm glad i did n't spend too much money on it because overall , not really satisfied about this product
brought it for my wife , great protection from everything , the case come in a wide selection of colors and it fit snug on the # & # # ; mac book pro thanks
did my research and made sure i bought the right case for my model macbook pro thank you for posting the compatibility in the posting extremely fast shipping and fits perfectly love that the keyboard cover has the same <unk> finish as the case so that it does not stick to the screen when laptop is closed keyboard cover also fits perfectly and does not raise up while typing -lrb- a worry of mine -rrb- i will definitely be looking for other covers in new colors from this company and have already recommended this company to friends to cover their computers too would be nice to get some with designs -lrb- hint hint
good transaction , got to me quick and no problems -lrb- i 've heard of many other people who have gotten these broken from other sellers -rrb- so i 'm very happy mine came perfectly intact the color is beautiful and the rubber keyboard cover is nice too . i did n't think i would like it , but now i 'll never take it off keeps everything clean
this case was just what i needed handing down to my young her daughter her older sisters laptop the lavender shell offers protection with a splash of color @ the right price
well worth the price , very clean looking keyboard is typical , just a throw in for me love how it 's see thru and i used an apple sticker as an accent to my red keyboard
everything came as described in a plastic wrap and amazon box could have put more foam or bubble wrap for protection though the pink is as you see it in the picture there are multiple vent cutouts on the bottom cover to ensure your laptop does n't overheat the gel keyboard cover fits well from what i was told from the lovely lady that this was purchased for the silicone keyboard pad is a bit to get used to if you like the hard key oem setup would buy again if the lady somehow breaks this case hopefully it 'll do its job
i bought this for my daughter who is in high school she takes her computer with her every day the case is very good at protecting her computer and it looks cute also i would recommend to purchase this item we also received it within # days
this case fit my macbook pro perfectly the only thing i do n't like is that it looks darker than it does in the picture i thought the case would be light purple but it 's actually a medium , regular looking purple idk if that makes sense other than that everything fits great the keyboard cover fits but it does take some getting used to i saw some reviews that said the letters and numbers do n't line up but i ca n't see through mine for that to make a difference
this product was exactly what i was looking for it fits my macbook pro # -inch perfectly it is made of strong , durable plastic , and looks great the purple is a great color and shows the logo nicely - no hole in the middle like some i was skeptical of the keyboard cover but now that i have seen it and used it , i can vouch that it is also perfect the color is great and it 's not too thick overall i am extremely satisfied with this product and would recommend it to anyone and everyone looking for a colorful and protective cover for both their computer and keyboard
case came in on time , fits very well and looks amazing on my laptop the keyboard cover is great , as well i bought a keyboard cover at my local apple store when i first got my lap top a few months ago , and it was very loose and difficult to type with this keyboard cover however , fits perfectly , and is a lot thinner then the one i previously bought from apple although it 's quite difficult to type , i know i can adjust i 'm very pleased with this choice of purchase . quick & looks great if anyone needs questions about this item , feel free to ask
i am very rough with my computer i usually leave it anywhere and this case has saved me from damage to the computer , while also giving it a sleek unique and simplistic style just cracked the side after i dropped it from my bag no worries ill buy another one of these as it has lasted me a little over # years
the case looks exactly what is depicted in the image and fits perfectly on my mac i 'm very pleased by the fit and durability of the case will definitely recommend to friends and family
first of all , # stars for shipping speed i ordered it on friday , it was there by the time i came home from work on monday i got it in clear the keyboard cover is n't perfect and i ca n't see the <unk> through it very well , but for the price i 'm happy the top cover fits exactly , but the bottom cover is completely useless does not lock into place , does not grip on to the sides edit : thanks to the lovely people in the questions & <unk> section , i got the bottom to fit very happy with this case
quick delivery and fits my macbook pro perfectly the blue looks the same as it does in the picture and the keyboard cover sits easily on top of the keys
i have had this case on my mac for a while now it has been to afghanistan and back , it protected my mac well although the case sustained a few heavy hits resulting in cracks my laptop was safe i will for sure be purchasing more of these as gifts for friends
i purchased this for obvious reasons to protect my computer from daily wear & tear both the external cover & the keyboard cover fit perfect and do not hinder the computer -lrb- plugs , buttons , openings , etc . -rrb- in any way a wise investment
the case fit my macbook pro perfectly and was very easy to snap on -lrb- on in less than a minute -rrb- the bottom is ventilated its plastic it is not a <unk> cover that is going to protect the laptop from a major fall , but it will prevent the laptop from getting scratched up from daily back and forth use others complained about the keyboard cover it fits mine perfectly and fits as well as my previous keyboard cover by a different brand initially you need to kind of press in the spaces between the keys to line it up but after you use the keyboard for about # minutes it is just like typing on a regular keypad the laptop closes fine with the keyboard cover on both the case and keyboard cover can be easily removed if you want to clean them
i just received the # inch macbook pro for christmas and was looking for something to make mine unique this case is it the item was exactly as described and fits my macbook perfectly item was delivered super fast i have already had # people ask me where i got the case i love my new pink macbook
i love this case , it fits great and protects my computer from scratches and dirt i also like the keyboard cover as it keeps dust , crumbs and cat hair out of the cracks the keyboard cover fits really well and broke in quickly considering buying another one in a different color
this is my second purchase of this case the first one was for my son in black his carrying case has been destroyed and this case and more importantly the computer are fine as a result i purchased this one for my daughter
the product is exactly what i was hoping for and it was shipped promptly the cover and the keyboard cover fit <unk> seem to be durable products i highly recommend this product the pricing is also a
the color is great much better than i had expected i do n't really use the keypad but i like how it feels under my fingers - very soft to the touch
looks great and feels great the feet on the bottom part really stick to stuff so you wont have to worry about it sliding around they also give it a little lift to the laptop but not much i love this because it covers up all the scratches and stuff i have on the laptop . the keyboard piece is something to get use to but very nicely made if your laptop heats up alot because of video game playing or stuff like that , i would n't suggest leaving the bottom place cover on because it can cause extra heat and then your computer wont run as fast fits pretty snuggly but a little loose in some places i know someone who got a different brand and complained because their laptop does n't close all the way , well this one will close <unk> , just like the case was n't there because its not completely tight up against the top of the laptop the logo is blurred ... does n't effect laptop or anything , just looks . <unk> up everything well . wont slide
i love this color ! ! ! ! it has been protecting my macbook for some time now and the color is still so vibrant and i get a lot of compliments on it !
love the color and so does everyone else the plastic protection is great i 've dinged past computers without it i like the rubber keyboard cover too it keeps dirt and other stuff out of my keyboard , but it does take some getting used to to type on it
i am a college student and i take my laptop everywhere , so this comes in handy and it fits my macbook pro perfectly it looks and feels great , and the keyboard cover is an added bonus that i also love neither the case or the keyboard cover cause my laptop to heat up or cause any problems with the ventilation
bought it as a gift for my dad 's mac and it was perfect it snapped on the way it was supposed to , has vents on the bottom , and is that hard gel type material that will protect the computer he loves it
i love the whole set the hard case cover is great to prevent scratches the keyboard cover <unk> the keys which is helpful during meetings , but it also protects from crumbs and dust getting below my keys i do n't have a mouse to use with the mousepad but it goes with the set arrived quickly and in perfect condition
i thought , <unk> i 'll be careful and wo n't have to worry about scratches famous last words i dropped the macbook -lrb- short fall -rrb- by obtained a scratch on the lid as result that day ordered this cover since having it , of course it has not fallen but it protects the macbook well looks good too
i 'm a college student who is looking for a protective case for my laptop that is cute and affordable . although the silicon kinda slow down my typing ... i like the color and it fits my macbook perfectly . . definitely recommended for those who want to have some protective to their macbook . . thumbs up
keeps the macbook safe , and looks wonderful the case is a perfect fit and is well made we love the color too the keyboard cover is not our thing , but is nice to have if we absolutely need it
