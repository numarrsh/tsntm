i bought this for my husband for his birthday he was a little reluctant to move to a back pack instead of a tradition computer bag etc . he loves it it holds so much & # # ; stuff & # # ; and fits a # inch computer no problem it is very sturdy and he has no problem with the shoulder padding it is a quality piece and worth the extra few dollars it costs swiss gear lives up to its name sturdy and full of room
this bag is great there are so many compartments for pens , flash drives , business cards , just about anything i need while on the road just love the feature to unzip the bag so it lays flat to go through the machine at airport security so nice to not have to remove my laptop it speeds up the time and effort needed to get out to the gate have taken it through most of the major airports in the us and have never been asked to remove my laptop from my bag
this is without a doubt the most stylish -lrb- imo -rrb- and functional backpack ever quality stitching and compartments galore comfortable while carrying either <unk> or on the back when i opened my shipment - it had that & # # ; new car smell & # # ; about it - and it was just awesome i highly recommend the swissgear travel gear scansmart backpack to anyone looking for quality , <unk> and comfort
excellent storage options and great durable laptop section i have used this backpack for a month and i can see that it is going to hold up well there is n't much else out there that can beat the style , price , dependability and size of this backpack
this is the first swissgear product i 've ever bought i 've been using this bag for over # months now i love it it is reliable and very comfy the airflow feature is nice , it is useful the bag has so many pockets and all of them are useful it is possible to carry a laptop or a tablet in it . usually i carry # - # pages books and up to # notebooks , and the bag handle them very good i would really recommend it for a friend . in fact , i just ordered another one for a friend of mine who lives overseas
i <unk> this bagpack for a trip to canada i had to go to the university with my computer , ipad , electronics and others gadgets it was confortable when walking around everything fit well and i could used it to go <unk> to <unk> and could get a lot of cloth inside i recommended , eyes closed
i have had this bag for a few months now and it has held up rather well does fit my # . # inch laptop and that was a concern for me at first as some local stores claimed there 's fit that size and did n't
i had purchased a toshiba bag for my laptop and the shoulder strap started pulling loose in about # months this swissgear bag seems much sturdier and fits my laptop much better as it does n't slide around in the laptop compartment like it did in the toshiba bag will update this review after a few months to see how it stands up to daily wear and tear but so far i love it
i use it for my everyday to and from work routine plenty of space for my laptop -lrb- full # inch screen -rrb- i also carry a fair amount of junk in the back compartment without any issues i have now used it for traveling a few times and the scansmart compartment worked fine at a few different airports
i bought the red and black one as a gift , since my husband was going back to school he loves it it 's pretty big , though , and on the heavier side but he says the straps are comfortable for walking around all day with a laptop , some books , and notebooks there are a lot of pockets and compartments it 's great for securing keys in secret compartments , water in the side things , and pencils/pens in the front pocket would definitely recommend
this is a high quality backpack for a great price it has the perfect number of pockets and fit 's my # & # # ; laptop and tablet perfectly this backpack could also hold a great number of clothes easily as well without the laptop in it , so it 's perfect for a weekend getaway when you do n't want to drag along a lot of baggage very happy with the quality of this product and will buy more products from swissgear in the future
i have come to appreciate swiss army products as i have owned many this backpack is no exception very well made with many thoughtful features for carrying stuff it is attractive , durable and versatile just like all their products it is also very comfortable to wear and carry i recommend it with no <unk>
this may be the perfect backpack for travel it has plenty of pockets of different types , ideal for a carry-on it fits under standard airline seats , and has compartments designed to quickly go through airport security the construction is durable and stylish i highly recommend it
this was a gift for my husband who had been shopping around for a nice travel pack he <unk> right away on how heavy duty it was the zippers are thick and solid he uses it everyday taking his lap top back and forth to work and all the extra pockets make it nice to stash all the other techy accessories safely it looks like this will not be wearing out anytime soon he is a big guy with broad shoulders but the straps fit very comfortably
my previous backpack was beginning to disintegrate i saw a friend with one of these and i asked what negatives he encountered he said & # # ; none & # # ; and now that i have one , i totally agree
after having used an old <unk> backpack for last # years through college , this was a very welcome upgrade to use for work and travelling the bag is perfect for carrying my work laptop -lrb- # . # in -rrb- along with the mouse and <unk> , a couple of folders , and enough clothes for a weekend trip the zippers and material appear to be made out of quality material only had it for about a month so far , but it 's held together with no problems and would handily recommend it if you need a nice quality backpack
many pockets , lots of room well built zippers and seams great as a business overnight and laptop bag easier to transport for flight or road use than a typical laptop bag side zipper great for laptop removal fold in half design speeds up airport check-in side pockets great for laptop charger and cords business <unk> pouch , toiletries pouch , and a compartment for literature or clothing
this is a great bag the quality is great and there is too many compartments -lrb- that 's a good thing -rrb- to store all your items at $ # something dollars ... . its a very good deal
i se this backpack to go to work i can carry lot s of things and there is still space for more the fact that the laptop goes apart from the other stuff makes this bp practical
bought this for my boyfriend as a gift since he has recently began travelling more for work he loves the scan smart feature ; says it makes going through security with a laptop quick and easy the bag is made well and has plenty of room
this backpack has gotten me through hell it 's got compartments left and right , a perfect slot for a laptop , a water bottle holder , and much more that makes it stand out as the best backpack on the market i 'd recommend it to any student entering college
excellent backpack , where all my travel stuff fits in as shown in the picture off course swiss gear name guarantees the quality product if you are a <unk> then this is a must buy back pack for you i am using it here at afghanistan and am always on move this back pack is just perfect for me , also easy to carry
bought this bag for my middle school son we love the pockets everywhere has # large sections for large binders and # <unk> it also has <unk> & brace for a laptop the handle is extremely sturdy and the straps are padded and not too complicated with excess pieces hanging about the bag is great for overnight camping trips or such i <unk> think this is an excellent bag -lrb- & i 'm picky -rrb- btw . . my son is # ' # `` and # lbs the bags proportions are just right for his size
enough room for my over-sized # dell laptop and it 's brick like battery , with plenty left over for other essentials i 've used this bag every day since i bought it weeks ago , and it 's holding up great would recommend to anyone
exactly what i needed for carrying my laptop very easy to take out or <unk> the laptop and tons of room for other items great build quality with beefy zippers so far i 'm loving the bag
so much space ! ! i never thought i would find a backpack with as much space as my last swissgear which i had for # years i was dead ass wrong , this thing is huge
fit my large dell # & # # ; laptop with no problems appears to be very well made actually used it for a long weekend and was able to fly without checking it it fit in overhead bin on small and large planes
this is my first time buying swiss gear i was looking around for backpacks with storage and hold laptops , came across this one and so far this is the best one i would buy from this seller again
this product is large enough to be used for school and travelling it is strong enough to bear as much load as you put inside so , i strongly recommend it to every one
sturdy and very well made extremely roomy - holds a ton without breaking your back works like a charm getting through airport security only criticism : zipper fobs are quite noisy i try to find places to tuck them in so they are n't constantly jingling
if you need a good quality bag to go to the gym , to carry your <unk> and other gear , this is the perfect bag it has pockets and pouches in all the right places and the zippers are really durable i highly recommend the black bag for the money never really understood paying more money for a different color i 'd recommend skipping on that
this piece of junk lasted about # <unk> longer than the warranty i would n't buy or recommend it or any toshiba products to my worst <unk> repair would cost more than a new unit so i bought a new apple computer you get what you pay for this was the first time i had as bad a problem any computer i 've owned gateway , dell and apple all make far superior products
<unk> quality is pretty average or even below average from some of the <unk> camera quality is poor and the sound is also poor all in all i would not recommend this product
the operating system fried after about # months to reinstall the operating system -lrb- on a computer that cost $ # -rrb- would cost $ # with no guarantee that goes beyond # days if i replace it , i would have to replace office and norton , as this was my last license in each case not likely to ever buy another toshiba
we bought this and it is under the bed , unused it is slow and often jams up we had to buy an external dvd player so we <unk> load programs on it there are many better laptops i wish i had spent more for something decent
after much success in buying toshiba products , i was very disappointed in the short life i experienced with this product after only # months of use , the mother board failed , and i had a $ # paper weight that was useless the repairs would have been over $ # , so it was a no-brainer not to repair it additionally , it cost me $ # to <unk> the problem my experience with the product while it worked was very favorable , and i recommended it to many of my friends and co-workers i expected to get years of use of it , and # months is far shorter life span than my anticipation
bought this for my dad thinking it would be ideal to skype with the parents while the price was good , i must say it was too good to be true performance sucks , picture was terrible , camera was so blurry no one could see properly sent it back to amazon i 'll just give my dad an ipad w/a keyboard
i bought this laptop for my son who is a freshman in high school we bought it as a christmas present it is now mid feb and the computer does n't work we took it to a repair place here in town and they told me its a hard drive problem and this should not have happened with a new computer the said it is not caused by a virus , its simply a faulty hard drive and to repair it would cost more than the computer come to find out the warranty ended january # st through amazon simply we got screwed
poor quality . within a year , it is not <unk> up and constantly showing an error code f # <unk> # i called toshiba technical service and was told that it has only # day warranty . but booklet coming with netbook states that # year limited warranty . very <unk> to receive crappy product
similar problem as one of the other reviewers right out of the box and it would n't start up error said no operating system toshiba technical support said it was either that an os was n't loaded or the hard drive is bad returning to amazon -lrb- who make it very easy -rrb- but it is now out of stock so no replacement i needed it for a birthday present this weekend and i 'm out of luck if i was reviewing amazon i would give them # stars as they are great for making returns , but the computer gets # star for poor quality control at toshiba
four months and the hard drive already went are you kidding me i have always bought toshiba laptops and had great luck but not this netbook ! ! do n't buy it do n't do it
i purchased # of these laptops for my daughters within # days a blotch appeared on one of them i returned the defective laptop but kept the other , now less than a year a blotch has appeared on the other one furthermore , toshiba refuses to honor the warranty to repair or replace it # feeling ripped off ! !
i bought this to use for school to take notes , some research and papers , etc . it serves its purpose for that , i upgraded it to the # g memory , but it 's still a bit slow i would recommend it to anyone that needs something portable and light for minor tasks update # / # so officially just under # years later , it crapped out totally . . during <unk> and would not turn back on ever again never been dropped , no water damage , nothing !
i have had my nb # for one year now with following comments excellent battery life , low weight , bright and clear display windows # starter : terrible - can not change desktop background or other configuration items in the os unless you use a different win # version performance : terribly slow when running windows # for both boot up and general speed i have added the max memory with no increase in performance touch pad is so sensitive that it is not possible to type a multiple line email without the <unk> moving on it 's own - very aggravating this is a problem with any application that has user input <unk> one week after the # year warranty expired , the hard drive failed glad i backed up the data or this would have been disastrous in conclusion , i would never have bought this netbook with it 's poor performance - the hard drive failing could happen to any computer
it is super portable and very light , but not much beyond that it kept freezing , would turn off randomly and in general was just slow i 'm not a gamer or big <unk> and only used it for email , facebook , etc . , which i was told it was good for well , it was slow , slow , slow and <unk> a lot speakers are atrocious , and battery life is not as good as it said returned it after a couple weeks
this review is written # months after purchase the hard drive started causing <unk> problems # months ago and has now failed completely the cost of purchasing a new hdd and windows # os makes the whole exercise <unk> i 've given it two stars as i did manage to get # months usage before failure
the nb # seems like it could be good if it ever connects <unk> to the internet it <unk> the internet when connected with the rj # <unk> # cable to the router otherwise , the yellow triangle with the <unk> -lrb- ! -rrb- point appears on top of the <unk> reception <unk> bars on the lower <unk> side of the screen you can disable and enable the wireless network interface card , but that does no good i will try the wireless function later this week when i travel if it does not work at the hotel , then i will <unk> the problem is a <unk> issue and the computer will be returned to amazon toshiba does not have much to say about the issue too bad that they may have to bear the expense of a return , simply because of an issue that should have been resolved long before marketing their product
i am not sure what my review of this netbook is just yet i do know that best buy is selling the one with the ddr # memory $ # cheaper amazon recommends the memory upgrade as ddr # but it is really ddr # i assumed that they would sell me the correct memory upgrade so i opened it to install and discovered it is the wrong card so there is also a # % restocking fee since i opened it be careful of what you are buying on amazon i will post once i buy the correct memory upgrade the netbook at the moment is very slow and have n't even added anything to it yet
the toshiba nb # would be a fairly decent netbook if it had a better keyboard there is something really wrong with it since sometimes more characters than typed appear the right shift key stopped working and nothing could bring it back to life finally the f # key keeps <unk> the search function in whatever application it is almost impossible to surf the net or press the start button without having a search window or <unk> coming up on the screen took it to a technician but could not find a
sorry toshiba going back to gateway this net book is lite and compact , however does not perform nearly as well as my gateway net book was not happy at all with this product returning for refund and going to get a gateway
similar to other reviews , my computer arrived <unk> it wouldnt start at all , returned it , but out of stock so now waiting to get another one this will be my first toshiba , so far not too impressed , but because of the price and i dont want to search for another one , i am still going to go through with it seems like a common problem and toshiba needs to get its act together
you get choppy frames when watching a movie on netflix - even a <unk> <unk> one the speakers are <unk> small and <unk> viewing complex websites will be very slow i do n't know what purpose or what type of user this computer is good for
i like the laptop it is great for school the only problem is that you can get this at bestbuy brand new for # beats # amazon wants for it
i like the <unk> of this netbook computer , but its # mb limit memory hinders its speed also , its built-in wifi signal reception seems weak compared to other laptops that i have had built-in speaker is weak - need to use external speakers to get good volume and <unk>
this model worked well for exactly # . # months we have three of these , and our high schoolers like them for their portability and <unk> battery life but as soon as the one year warranty was up , the hard drive on our first one crashed of the other two , one has power issues , possibly due to rough handling , but the third one is still working fine after a year of ownership , our conclusion is that these units work well as long as they are handled gently next time out we 'll be getting something sturdier , possibly with a solid state drive
got this for my daughter for her to take to school it works okay it it really slow and hangs up often we have run several virus checks and there is nothing there it <unk> when she is listening to lectures , but she makes
everything is okay except the mouse touch pad does n't work for <unk> sometimes it works and other times , not i have to use an external mouse in order to use the computer for travel that is cumbersome
i bought this netbook when the price was $ # it 's a small size laptop and works very well <unk> keyboard although i still need time to learn this location of every <unk> battery life , if you watch video with it -lrb- # hours # g <unk> you load two web pages and it happen to be two page with video links . with # g ram , your windows will freeze so be ready to upgrade the ram you need to check the model number of your memory ram like the other reviews pointed out i really like it if you need a portable laptop is small , light , good for the light work . you ca n't go wrong here
i decided to buy this toshiba computer after looking at best buy , together with other brands after receiving from amazon , i can make it works within less than half an hour , connected to my network very easy and the overall performance is ok so far , not that fast but reasonably accepted the keyboard is good the only complaint i may have is the sound ... i hope toshiba could do better in this area with the price , you ca n't go wrong ! ! ! <unk>
it 's a great gadget for the price the only reason i knocked off a fifth star is that toshiba equipped it with a <unk> # gb ram the cost of upgrading to # gb is minimal -lrb- about $ # -rrb- , and the performance improvement is considerable it would have been better for toshiba to provide the # gb at the start , and raise the price by $ # note that when you upgrade from # gb to # gb , you 're doubling the total memory , but you 're <unk> the available memory , after windows # boots up normally , you 're left with about # mb available for applications upgrade to # gb ram , and you now have # mb available
this laptop is great for everyday usage like listening to music it 's a little bit slow , but acceptable if you are not going to run # or # programs at one time , it 's ok
i 've had the netbook for almost a year and it has performed flawlessly excellent screen , comfortable keyboard , fast boot up time my only complaint is that the touchpad is n't the best for scrolling it is easy to miss the side of the touchpad or scroll in a choppy way otherwise , i would give it # stars i 'd buy another one with no reservations
it works well the screen is nice , the keyboard works well , and the color is a nice touch i agree with the reviews that this unit is a little slow it would go a long way if it came with more memory its cheap and easy enough to add , but in this day and age toshiba could certainly throw in more out of the box without much affect on the selling price
i 'll make short it comes with only one speaker located at the bottom , sound volume is ok for home use but not for crowded places like classrooms and airport . good enough with headphones like most other netbooks , it come with one ram slot so , in order to upgrade to # gb ram you need to buy a # <unk> ram stick and toss away the # gb ram stick be carefull , screen easy to break four stars only for the single speaker , but it is a reliable toshiba any way
love the keyboard love the weight love having this little baby with me everywhere , but the # gig ram upgrade is mandatory for this machine without the upgrade in ram it 's slow , gets locked up constantly and simply was n't any fun not sure why they do n't just sell the netbook with the ram it needs to make the machine work
i do like the toshiba nb # toshiba nb # -n # or # . # -inch netbook -lrb- orange -rrb- very much , quite similar to the hp mini # i previously owned and used the following are my impressions when comparing the nb # with the hp mini seems <unk> and <unk> , rubberized <unk> and indicator <unk> to the same <unk> <unk> <unk> seems to have not as good of a wifi reception for same location this is an important point since this is a netbook glossy finish of screen causes
i like my netbook for my uses - getting online for email , facebook , <unk> , taking it to a class for notes my occasional problem is that if i have n't saved something often enough , i can wipe it out in about # or # <unk> i 've tried to <unk> the problem , but have n't had much luck it will happen if i hit shift -lrb- left hand -rrb- and then <unk> or <unk> -lrb- right -rrb- and then another key , although it seems unlikely that i would do this accidentally this highlights some or all of my writing and then it 's gone before i realize not to hit another key i have been able to undo at times , but did n't have that option a few minutes ago have others had this problem if so , is there a good way to retrieve lost data i save often in class , but am more likely to lose portions of emails
works really well ; great little machine for traveling only serious issue is that speakers are weak strongly suggest headphones with microphone if planning to use skype for calls would also recommend external speakers if you plan to listen to music through this computer
this netbook works pretty quickly and is easy to use the only issue i have is when i type in an address and it kicks me out still not sure why that is happening overall , i 'm very satisfied with my netbook
bought this for my wife and her travels for the summer i got it with # gb of ram definitely go with # gb module we ended up ordering it right away i took out as much of the toshiba built in software as i thought i could get away with removed the norton and put on microsoft security essentials my wife chose it for the touch pad which supports <unk> <unk>
very pleased with my toshiba netbook - purchased to take along on motorcycle trips - working out great & price was very affordable this item fits the bill <unk> travel size easier than taking my laptop
i just received this thing , it 's reasonable for the size , however , it 's smaller than i thought it would be it might be that i 'm so used to using a desktop , that this is all new to me so far , i like it i 'd just have to get used to the size and the keys but other than that , it 's a cool netbook
very nice looking and operating netbook have not used it to much yet but will when i head south in april small and light i hope it will be just what i need when traveling , mostly e-mail and getting home town news , and keeping track of my personel <unk>
the product itself is worthy of five stars , but i had to take off a point because amazon has the ram falsely listed as ddr # - this product uses ddr # ram i immediately upgraded the ram , installed a solid state disk , and put windows # enterprise on it this netbook works wonderfully in this configuration - light weight , long battery life , and adequate speed i can not comment on the <unk> configuration , as i only turned it on to make sure the unit functions
its my first notebook so i do n't have others to compare it to i just need to use it for internet and simple tasks when on trips and it is perfect for that its not as fast as my large computer but its not annoyingly slow the design is decent and its a great size i got the <unk> one which is very pretty
i purchased the toshiba netbook mainly to view the websites i visit daily , i.e facebook , and also to have something small to take with me on motorcycle trips to document our adventures i love the look of the netbook and it was easy to set up right out of the box i upgraded the memory as was recommended in several other reviews i did find the smaller keyboard somewhat challenging at first but am getting used to it i really like not being tied down to my big pc , which i rarely even use now that i have the netbook overall , it has fulfilled my needs , i 've had absolutely no problems , and i would n't hesitate for a minute to recommend it
the netbook does exactly what it is advertised to <unk> ... a <unk> computer at a great price my primary use for the netbook is web surfing and for that purpose it does a great job like many reviewers , i upgraded the memory and <unk> the <unk> software from toshiba it did improve the overall performance i would recommend this computer to anyone how is looking for a lightweight computer for travel and just <unk> web surfing i do n't have any complaints because i read all the reviews before purchasing so i was not expecting it to replace my desktop and laptop
i like the key board , <unk> raised allows you to type faster speakers are very poor - at its highest i could barely hear at a yard i got the phone to work with my droid it works wells the resolution is good i really like toshiba 's customer service
i love the convenient traveling size of this little laptop it 's light , and easy to bring just about anywhere i like that the volume is much louder on the # than it 's predecessor , which i had before wish it had an sd card slot but overall , i like my lappy
the first one i ordered would not start windows , just gave a <unk> screen saying it could not find the operating system credit amazon for an almost totally painless return process and for having a replacement in my hands # hours after the defect was found i really like the second one so far boots fairly quickly , feels very solidly made , has a super display and an excellent keyboard and touchpad seems like very good value for the price i would give it five stars right now except that the delivery of the first defective machine makes me wonder a little about quality control and durability
this is just what i was looking for : a compact portable netbook that performs in most respects like a larger , more expensive laptop my only complaint thus far is the highly reflective screen which makes it <unk> to use under some bright light <unk> ; perhaps i can find some sort of film that will alleviate this problem otherwise , it is an excellent buy for the money
i am quite glad with my new tool , its a very useful netbook the battery can last for about # to # h in use its light weight allow me to take it anywhere i need i recommend it
if the product label does not indicate ddr # in the upper right corner , then you need ddr # memory , should you decide to upgrade here 's a link -lsb- ... -rsb- i rate the netbook at # stars , as it really should have shipped with # gb memory otherwise , seems fine , and does what it needs to do
i ordered a samsung nc # first , but found a qc issue with it we then get this brown nb # because my wife really likes the color and style the nb # costs about # ~ # % more than nc # 's sale price at amazon , but it 's indeed a better netbook for the style and performance though nc # 's features and material seem better , for some reason this nb # performs better on the same atom cpu and its <unk> wireless does a better job as well the only problem for me is that it 's not good enough for # p video , but there is no other netbook with <unk> atom can do either
shipping arrived soooo fast i 'm thinking of dual <unk> with ubuntu , not sure only issue , the battery life is ok not as is supposed to be still working fine
please wait to buy ddr # or ddr # until you have the product in hand the listing calls for ddr # , however , upon opening the package the computer clearly calls for ddr # the good news is that i can resell the ddr # here on amazon fairly easily
very nice for a netbook the smaller space on the keyboard and display take some getting used to especially if you are used to using a laptop or desktop pc otherwise , very fine product , fast and functional , works well for simple tasks like surfing the net
product met all my expectations it was a great value for the price which was far better on amazon than in the retail stores in which i had shopped i can live with the lesser performance capabilities which i knew about before i made the purchase
this netbook is one of the best i have come across <unk> for the price the only thing i could see them doing is upgrading the ram to # gb i had purchased the toshiba brand ram listed on the toshiba website and when i got it , it did not fit in the slot waste of time and money if the toshiba website is unreliable in which ram will fit , i do not know where to look all in all , this is a great product
this netbook is thin , light , and works fine i recommend upgrading the ram to # gb like i did for an additional few dollars the ram chip is easy to change my only negative comment is that windows # starter , which is what comes installed , is a stripped down version of the os simple things like being able to change the wallpaper have been <unk> there are ways around this if that is a big deal for you i decided to just leave the wallpaper as is i do n't know that it is worth spending the money to upgrade the os , but you can if you want the additional features
got this for the <unk> to replace her old laptop that died thus far it 's a hit it arrived pretty much on the estimated date , works , and is the right colour
this netbook is great it is lightweight and easy to just throw into a purse or a bookbag , which is extremely convenient to me as a student the battery life is amazing , too , which is extremely helpful if i 'm in a classroom where i do n't have easy access to an outlet i also love that even though this laptop is small , the keyboard is full size overall , it is a great on-the-go laptop , especially for a college student
being one of the lower end netbooks around , it does the job just remember this is not a laptop and will not handle as such you can <unk> some games like <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , etc but it is not very recommended , since it <unk> down everything else the battery life is great , it lasts at least # hours even on high power mode i use it for homework , reading and some light networking
device performs exactly as expected , the display is great , the speed is good the size is small as expected and getting used to the keyboard spacing which is compressed is a little tricky wireless antenna is strong fully met expectations
perfect for the size and it has all i need for job and homework i liked it very much , the color is beautiful and thanks for the service and fast delivery
one good point : a leading consumer rating service has found that toshiba <unk> have good reliability , which was why i was attracted to this brand at first my husband recently bought a toshiba laptop and he likes his a couple of negatives and solutions this netbook came with # gb of ram -lrb- as do most netbooks sold these days , so this is not unusual -rrb- as it was shipped , it 's fairly slow it is well worth it to purchase an upgrade to # gb memory as shipped , its windows media player does not play <unk> # video files that i had previously pulled off my camcorder and saved -lrb- my hp desktop -lrb- running windows # professional -rrb- and my husband 's toshiba laptop -lrb- running windows # home -rrb- can play these files without difficulty . i downloaded the free <unk> <unk> media player and this works just fine
i was n't sure about this netbook after reading some `` so-so `` reviews , but i have to say this little netbook is a handy gadget to have around i had no problems setting it up -lrb- although i <unk> several unwanted programs that were <unk> - norton for example , went with a better security package -rrb- which , including configuration took less than # minutes i did install # g memory right off the bat looked at installing a full version of windows # but after researching what i would benefit from a full version , i chose not to . # starter fits my needs just fine think i may buy another so my wife and i will both have one since i got this jewel , my ipad is just collecting dust
great little netbook - bought one each for wife and daughter - they work great for basic computer stuff , web , <unk> , word <unk> , as well as movies , <unk> good screen , sturdily built , long battery life - they are used almost <unk> without being plugged in , as the batteries last for hours recommended for the price , great basic product wonder why people spend twice as much for a tablet or ipad , when this does all that and more in a package that is about the same size
i purchased this notebook with <unk> based on the low price my hope was it would do basic things only as i did not want to get my hopes up to my surprise this is a very good computer that can do almost anything i wish it had a cd/dvd drive but even without it it 's an excellent buy
like other reviewers said , you need to upgrade the memory to # gb , but after that , this is a great little device i use it when travelling i can hook it up to a tv and stream from <unk> and other sources - fast action makes the video a little <unk> , but otherwise the video output is sufficient for watching a tv program or movie the battery life is pretty good ; and the keyboard is much better than a lot of other netbooks i 've tried well worth the money
