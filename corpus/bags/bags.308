the only good part of this package was the outter skin for the laptop the satin case was old and crumpled , the keyboard cover did not fit well , and the protector screen was had a crease in it
i would 've given this a # star rating but here is my only problem with this product the case on the laptop started to break i 'm not saying that this is n't a good product but i have n't had it for a year and it already broke
computer cover fits well and stays attached silicone keyboard fits perfect and all looks great threading on neoprene sleeve began to unravel on day # but really a minor fix overall i would purchase again
the case worked fine and i like it so far , but the screen did n't fit and was too big so it 's peeling off already other than that , it came in on time
this product is okay . the hard case fits perfect i love the color and the fit of the traveling case the keypad cover is nice , i just wish you could see the light of the keys through it . . makes typing in the dark hard i was disappointed in the screen protector . it did n't fit my macbook pro # -inch with retina display at all . not even close to fitting right as if it was for the wrong computer entirely
i love the color of the case and the amount of accessories that come with it however , the case did not fit exact , but it was good enough unfortunately , after # months of having this case , it began to crack and now has pieces that have broken off my laptop has only been used in the house and has not been dropped or banged while in the case
i love the color the biggest reason i bought this was for the hard case and its the best part it fits well and looks nice drawbacks : the screen protector was difficult to put on so i ended up throwing it away immediately there were also no directions for an easy way to do it the soft carry case smells , but hopefully that goes away quickly i also did n't receive the mousepad
i like red and overall , item is ok i 've been using it since i got it the only thing that i was n't able to use is the protective shield since i do n't know how to apply it right it produced a lot of bubbles ... but that 's me
love the color and the accessories in addition to the cover would give five stars but the cover is a little loose fitting on one side and the screen protector dimensions are a little off overall good but for me ! !
i did not receive the mouse pad , that was suppose to come with the package , otherwise the stuff looks nice the screen protector was not good at all , after i put on it gave a bi glare the case was really hard to get off , if any one knows how to take off please tell me
the hard case is really nice - the only thing that bothers me is the part where your wrists rest does not stay on securely the sleeve is too big and does not fit snuggly like i wanted it to
we had some problems getting the correct one that fit our screen because we were not aware there are different size macbook pros for instance we ordered a # & # # ; case and needed a # . # & # # ; but that 's a simple mistake the <unk> was quick however not very professional also we had to pay to have the item shipped back all in all the product is good my husband is very pleased with it after we finally got it
except for the case , the cover , pouch and keyboard cover are doing well so far . . the corners of the case are <unk> out and sharp edges are making it even worse
a good protection for my macbook is the reason why i bought these items the price is acceptable , but there are some flaws after they were shipped to me first , the sleeve is too thin to provide enough protection for the laptop and is a bigger than my macbook pro -lrb- # inch -rrb- , and i am very disappointed about this second , some characters on the keyboard cover are not clear may i change the sleeve and the keyboard cover
mostly wanted the shell case but the bundle deal was too good to pass up the shell and keyboard cover are alright but the shell comes up just enough to dig into your wrists while typing the screen protector size is a little off so i wo n't be using that , and the soft case has a terrible smell that wo n't go away luckily nothing was damaged during shipping but in the future it 'd be advisable to maybe ship your products in a padded envelope
it 's pretty cheap , to be honest i think the best thing in this bundle was the keyboard protector the case is very <unk> and not transparent whatsoever disguises my expensive macbook to look like a cheap chromebook anyways , the screen protector works good , i ca n't even tell it 's there when my display is on ... and the sleeve stinks to high heaven i 'm afraid to put my macbook in it , to be honest overall , it 's okay i do regret purchasing it and would return it , but honestly , i 'm way too busy so , it 'll have to do
i like this but it broke easily and the squishy keyboard cover is super annoying so i threw it out the color is lovely and lots of people tell me they like it
shipping : received a day earlier than stated keyboard cover : it 's a little too big and it came in a little dirty sleeve bag : it fits perfectly but it just is n't padded enough to keep it safe if it in worse case scenario , drops hard cover case the top piece fits every well and holds it in place the bottom piece is dented , slightly scratched , and it you try to take it out , it falls right away it was too big to fit on my screen , had to cut up the sides to fit overall : the only satisfaction i had from this package was the top piece of the hard cover case and the keyboard cover i do recommend this , only if you are very careful and not clumsy for the most part
did the the job , got it sale priced , ca n't complain the edges of the clamshell are a little sharp on the wrists , so i had to edge with vinyl tape the keyboard cover is very handy for collecting crumbs from the snacks i should n't be having , too
the case fits perfect but the screen protector should be installed by a professional the tolerance of fitment is small i had to keep re applying it to get it perfect to not lift on the edges ended up getting to many dirt particles on it and took it off silicon keyboard cover fitment is ok , i just wish the light up keyboard would show through
almost everything came the right size except the screen protector -lrb- it was way too big for my # & # # ; -rrb- but the hard case and the sleeve are working perfectly the case has n't scratched my laptop and i 've notice that a lot of people in my university have the same cases
my model is a # silicone keyboard cover has a defect as dots of pink paint for royal blue color and worn keys the bag is very big even with a case for notebook at least # & # # ; m in width the only plus is the case it fits perfectly missing mouse pad the item was delivered on # days ahead of
love , love love ! does all that it is made to do i would have given # stars but for some reason i feel the case does n't properly fit i may be wrong because it has n't fallen off but i can easily snap it off . . but all in all , great product , especially the sleeve !
the case and the bundle are a fantastic value the rubberized material makes it feel more secure to tote from one place to another it is a lightweight case ca n't go wrong with this choice
i love the case , the whole deal is awesome i did n't give it # starts because i ordered a new product , and mine is used the sleeve had been ripped and sewed back together , the keyboard cover had some kind of gunk on it and will not come off
can someone tell me how to get the top part of the case off my mac ! ! ! ! my nails got chipped and thumbs are in great pain but still i ca n't take it off do n't wan na do anything to damage the mac but it seems to me the case is protecting the mac too well love the product still will prob buy again with another
edges easily chipped , otherwise a good case i like the texture which makes the case easy to hold on to the neoprene cover is a convenient way to keep the laptop with extra protection and keep out dust
i really liked allot of things about this package , but there are a few things that are issues case , cover , and screen protector fit great , and very easy to <unk> feels solid and of good <unk> with the cons below , for the price is still a great value the edge at the bottom of the case -lrb- by palm rest -rrb- is to sharp , and will wear on your wrists this could have been easily solved by the company just <unk> this edge -lrb- you can fix with a heat source , like a lighter , but be careful ! the keyboard cover is pretty bad it fits the keys fine , but has too much overlap on the edges , and i had to trim it to get it to lay flat also , the structure around the keys is to stiff , making it difficult to press the keys at times -lrb- definitely a solution if you want moderate or speed typing -rrb- i only keep the cover on when i 'm just browsing around , or when outside or near food , etc . otherwise , is just a pain to use
this case fits my macbook pro retina display perfectly i got the aqua blue and it protects really well the only thing i do n't like is that the keyboard protector is a teal color and does n't really match the hard shell , but other than that everything is great , especially for only $ # i would highly recommend this product
all of my stuff fits well on my new macbook and it 's such a great deal to receive all these items for the price the only thing i do n't like is that you ca n't see the keys with the keyboard light on because the letters on the cover are black i bought the turquoise blue and the pictures shown are accurate . the case fits the computer well and the keyboard cover does also the soft sleeve bag is basic , but there is a little room for you to fit more than just your computer . overall , good buy
products were good overall keyboard cover : perfect fit , good <unk> case : ok quality , i have the # & # # ; macbook retina and the case is a little too big leaving too much wiggle room i have n't used the snap on case or screen protector yet
fits my macbook the smell of the sleeve does n't bother me it smells like new shoes and has like this strong smell to it . lol i 'd just spray perfume on it .
a great purchase so far the case fits perfectly with the new -lrb- november # -rrb- model macbook pro my one complaint is the screen protector , but screen protectors are n't easy to apply in general tip : apply the screen protector before you place the top half of the case , this will make it easier to remove the air bubbles from the screen overall a great value for your money they even included a small free mousepad
looks beautiful on my new # computer now i do n't have to worry about external scratches or spills on the keyboard ! : -rrb- one note : as hard as i tried , i could never get the screen protector or keyboard to fit exactly perfect at least one corner was <unk> also , the static on the screen seemed sufficient at first , but after i took of the protectors it lost most of it it 's pretty easy to make it come loose but this might be good if i want to get a new one eventually all in all , i 'm very pleased for the price i paid though
i bought the case mainly to keep the device clean in a dusty environment i have n't really tested it in those environments yet but the case seems sturdy and for the money i paid looks like a good bargain i give # stars because it does n't come with any instructions -lrb- not that you will need it -rrb- and i would have liked a few extra stuff like a keyboard cover which allows the backlight to come through and the case which is a bit lighter the sleeve is good and the screen protector fits well the silicon keypad cover is also a good fit , the only issue i have is that it covers the backlight of the keyboard , but that does n't matter since i am usually in a pretty well lit environment
i would recommend this product to users simply because it works well , and the price can not be beaten for what the package includes the topcase is smooth and effective , and prevents scratches or damage the only fault i see with this product would be removing the case , it takes some time and practice but that seems to be with every similar macbook case , and you will not remove it often anyway
excellent value for money package shell case fits perfectly , as does keyboard protector and neoprene case screen protector is exact size which makes it hard to install properly if it was a fraction smaller it would be easier overall , very happy with the purchase
i did n't my daughter did but i have to return it because it wo n't fit it 's to small so now to see how much of a pain it is to return
was very pleased with my purchase the cover was missing one of the rubber feet when it arrived , but otherwise it fully met my expectations keyboard protector makes it cumbersome to type , but i do n't have experience with other protectors to compare the protector fits nicely and snugly on the keys , although i 've chosen not to use it case fits the fall # model perfectly
the price is very good and shipment arrived on time color is exactly shown online . no surprise screen protector was difficult to apply onto the screen cause the sheet is the exact size i end up to the store that sell phone case and protector and spend a little money , but it is worth it
the case is true to it 's color online , fits my macbook perfectly love that it comes with a sleeve and a screen protector though i have not used the sleeve and chose to not to keep the screen protector i did order a separate keyboard cover that is transparent with the same color blue <unk> the keys i recommend doing this if you do n't want to be overwhelmed with looking at robin egg blue unfortunately , the case did arrive with a crack on one corner but it does not affect the overall fitting or protection it makes my computer significantly heavier but that 's expected with a case and the weight is able to protect my computer better overall , a great product and worth the price , i would buy again
pretty colors , mac definitely looks cuter the hard covers surface keeps all the fingertips on it . . thats the only thing i do n't like . . but it does a job of protecting my mac so i can not complain love the rubber keyboard , it does n't stick so its super convenient to change them out
all four parts are really good the case fits perfect and is convenient the outer case and key protector work good too make sure you put on screen protector carefully because i had to take mine off because there were too many bubbles
actually it was so much better than my expectation ! ! i am so happy to ordered this item : -rrb- -rrb- -rrb- i hope it works for me good as long as i have this mac ;
this case set is everything you need for your laptop the only problem i has was with the keyboard case it did n't stay on the laptop properly other than that everything else satisfied me :
this was a great value compared to what you would purchase at the apple store the plastic case snaps on easily , stays on , and feels sturdy the neoprene case is fine and easy to use it smells , but is going away with use keyboard cover is fine , thin enough that there 's only a tactile difference that you get used to quickly i did n't use the screen guard the only issue with the plastic shell is that it has white foot pads , which are kind of ugly
the case was true to color and snapped on easy there was only a few minor imperfections to the case that are easily over looked , i 'm just ocd however i will say that i do n't care for the keyboard cover it is n't a perfect fit , so the cover feels like it is moving when i press on the keys and it bubbles up in places like other reviews have said there is a bit of a smell to everything but i am sure it will go away in a few days all in all i think it was worth purchasing , i bought this product mainly for the case and it is serving it 's purpose
got the pink & dark blue case and for the price compared to what they where in competing stores i loved it buttons take a little getting used to with the key pad cover but you do n't have to use it my biggest con is that the case itself picks up finger prints bad , takes away from the look a little but still does the job i bought a decor for mine & that 's been helping a little :
hard case fits perfectly keyboard cover is a little loose , but not significant soft cover case is a snug fit the screen protector is larger than the screen , as most people said it 's about # mm too long i would 've given it five stars if the screen protector was n't so difficult to put on
i only am using the soft case and the hard shell , but this was still a good buy the keyboard cover was nice , but it is just easier to type without it i could not get the screen cover on correctly without any bubbles
i got it a few days ago , the case is great , works great and fits perfectly the screen protector is as promised also , it actually reduces quite a bit of glare very good too the sleeve i got did n't smell , like others had said , and it also fits the mac great , with or without the case on the keyboard protector is the bad part it gives the great macbook keyboard a leathery feel and it does n't even stick down on it i thought it was horrible , i do n't even put it on but for # $ ? this is a steal as a case alone is around # good product for the money
i love the mac case and the keyboard cover , i also like the cover my mac fits perfectly in it i do not like the screen cover though , it keeps coming off and it 's slightly bent i will definitely look into another screen cover
it fit the # & # # ; macbook pro retina perfectly has the breathing <unk> and correct access to clearance for accessory ports only reason i did n't give it four stars was because i had hoped it would have a less smooth finish on exterior for grip perhaps the design could have somehow given the back corners more protection
great package , the smell that others talk about for the soft case does stink , but it goes away after about a week , other than that it is awesome for this price i could n't be more happy
i have had this for awhile now i only use the actual computer cover and sometimes the soft bag the screen protector is a joke ... get a good one if you really want one the keyboard cover is just not for me it does not fit right and moves to easily
the overall purchase was very nice and came super fast however , when i tried to put the hard cover on my macbook , it was slightly too small and i could n't get it to fit i do plan on returning this purchase , but i believe this may have been a mistake on my part by <unk> the measurements of my laptop the color was exactly what i wanted , though , and i hate sending it back i believe this is a great value for anyone if it fits to your macbook . :
actually i want to give # and a half star at first , i read the comments after i bought it i was worried about whether they fit my computer when i got them , i think i love it there is only one thing i do n't like the sleeve bag smells bad
the cover snapped easily on my laptop , but i wish i can say the same for the screen protector my husband and i had the hardest time trying to put the screen protector on , it seems a bit big for it the keypad cover fits nicely , but not snug im happy with it overall
i received # products -lrb- because they give me a mouse pad -rrb- it fit perfectly , only when i use the computer with the case , it makes my wrists hurts , because they rub against the case
the case arrived a day sooner than expected which made me very happy the case itself is well made and fit perfectly along with the keyboard protector the color was as expected too , it matched the description <unk> well i only have one suggestion that could improve the product , thus the rating the screen protector was just ever so slightly larger than the actual screen which made the outcome less than satisfying i had to cut the side after installation and since it 's hard to cut with the protector on it ended up a little crooked on one side i decided not to cut the <unk> and it 's overlapped by an # `` or so the top and one side is a fraction away from touching the bezel so now i 'm in the process of purchasing another screen protector the quality and <unk> of the protector is great , the size just needs to be l little smaller i used it on the model a # , maybe the other model has a slightly larger screen
i love the orange color i choose it 's a true orange ! great product i actually like more than the case i bought from apple only thing is the case smells like plastic or some kinda chemical hard core after a bit of febreeze and airing out it 's ok now but still what 's the point if you ca n't use the case for awhile but overall a great product
i really like my order i get soooooo many compliments on how cute my mac looks the keyboard cover was a little stiff at first , but it stays in place nicely and once it was broken in -lrb- about # days -rrb- it was excellent the case fitted beautifully and i really like the cover the only thing that was n't great was the screen protector i tried several times to get it on , but there were always bubbles finally i peeled it off and threw it away there was no damage to the screen
ordered this less than a week ago , and everything arrived earlier than expected so far so good except the keyboard cover makes it a little harder to type , but not enough to make a huge difference there was no odor on any of the products like others mentioned a good deal for the price
clear case : great fitting case screen : did n't use screen <unk> soft cover : smells really bad initially ... have n't found a need for it since i use the clear <unk> : i can not type through the keyboard !
it protects my macbook pro w / retina display great and it 's such a bargin for all it offers they only thing i did n't use was the screen protector because i could n't get it on straight other than than everything was perfect
this set is very pretty everything is as pictured and works well the only reason it gets # stars and not # is the keyboard cover does not lie right on my brand new macbook pro the entire bottom row rolls up and does not fit the keys sitting a couple books on it for a few hours made it fit the keys a bit better but its still not completely flush with the keys in all , nice set thats worth the money
the clear case is great , easy to assemble and light the keyboard skin is quite hard to type i am not gon na use it anymore the sleeve bag has a strong smell , i have to put it on the balcony for a few days i strongly recommend you to buy the clear case cover , all the other things are a waste of money
everything is really nice about this set , some people were complaining about how the cloth case smelled bad -lrb- which it did -rrb- but the smell wore off very quickly the one thing do n't like is that the bottom of the case can come off easily sometimes . but no to often , i would recommend this set very helpful
it came in quicker that the posted date which was very much appreciated everything fit my macbook pro perfectly i gave it # stars because the cover is not as clear as i expected additionally , the edge part under the trackpad kind of irritates my wrist other than those two things i am pretty much satisfied with the product and service provided
i bought this for my new macbookpro and am happy with my purchase the rubber cover fits well and snaps in place if you want to snap it off - close the lap top and remove it from the hinge side of the lap top as for the protective film for the screen , ensure the screen is wiped clean love the color i do n't use the rubber keyboard cover much as it makes my typing slower
i have gotten so many compliments on this case it 's a really nice quality and the hot pink color is so fabulous ! ! plus , it arrived very quickly i would highly recommend this case
fits perfectly -lrb- make sure you order the right model number -rrb- and i get compliments on it all day long at the coffee shop well crafted and worth the money
the sleeve is the perfect size , the case is a great fit and great color with the apple logo clear in the back , i highly recommend it for the price
product is perfect and for the price , you ca n't get a better deal with this # -in- # received the item quickly and the owner of the company followed up to ensure customer satisfaction i do n't always write reviews ; only when i feel strongly buy from this company you wo n't regret it
had an issue with an incorrect item , an error on my part those involved at top case <unk> and really came through fantastic customer service department we are very pleased with the product as well thank you to those of you at top case
i received this case and i absolutely <unk> the color choice and the case color everything was really good except i havent tried the screen protector yet <unk> maybe i should try it since its included <unk> if i could , i would buy this product again ;
everything arrived very fast and although the case had a small defect they quickly sent me a replacement the colors for all the products are exactly like the ones on the pictures
was a little concerned because the price was so good that the quality would be low , but i was wrong love it and my computer looks <unk>
i ca n't tell you how many people have complimented me on the package i have on my macbook pro i absolutely love it and it was totally worth the
i wanted mine to stay bright and spiffy i got clear so could see it 's sleek gray finish the key protectors give me problems typing so currently they are off my daughter says & # # ; you get used to them & # # ; but i kept messing up <unk> and i hate repeating myself i 'm an at home person mostly so the computer does n't get carried around much , but it seems very secure on the computer
items arrived at the expected time they looked as the pictures and fit perfectly on the laptop i did n't like the keyboard cover because it feels too loose when pressing the keys but it is a personal opinion and not related to the quality of the product i got the light pink skin and darker pink sleeve both fit great and colors are as shown in pictures
this product comes with just what i need for my new mac that i will be using for college the price is worth paying for you get a great deal when you buy this product and the best part is they ship it in your favorite color i recommend anyone to buy this
i just want to say this product arrived promptly as promised it fits my mac like a glove the keyboard cover feels responsive to my fingers when typing the screen protector went on with ease i especially live the cover for the case i chose pink and the apple logo is visible through the top cover i love the & # # ; rubber feet & # # ; on the bottom of the case cover which keeps it from moving around overall , i am a happy customer
fit perfectly and really like the extra protection it provides for the computer also used the sleeve on a trip recently and liked how it was protective but not heavy and
i was <unk> between # and # stars and finally decided on # this bundle costs about as much as just a hard case cover but with # extra pieces i have n't used the screen protector yet but i am very happy with both the hard case and the keyboard cover it takes a little while to get used to typing with the case -lrb- i feel the edges -rrb- but i notice it less and less the keyboard cover fits well and does n't make typing any more difficult than without it my only only complaint is that i still have n't used the sleeve because i am still airing it out as others have mentioned , it does have a smell it 's not a deal breaker , but it should be noted it does fit well and i 'm sure i 'll be happy with it once i get rid of the smell and start using it all in all , i think it 's a great price for a very good bundle
loved the products bought them for my boyfriend and he is thoroughly pleased with the color it was a bit more neon orange than it looks in the photograph , but it was actually better two thumbs up :
i received the package yesterday in the mail , and despite some of the reviews i 've read , i 'm very content with my product i was looking into getting a hard case directly from the apple store , but that was going to cost me between $ # , so i 'm thrilled i found this little bundle for $ # the keyboard cover and the snap on case both fit perfectly , and the little carrying case is nice too it 's obviously not the same quality you 'd get with a $ # case , but it 's exactly what i wanted : something to protect the exterior of my macbook from getting scratched when i opened the package up , the case did have that weird plastic odor everyone 's been writing about , but after being out of the plastic packaging for about # minutes , it was gone would definitely recommend it
i ordered mine in august and it still looks nice the color is perfect and matte i hate the glossy case so this was perfect for me the keyboard cover catches a lot of dust so you have to clean it often the case smelled nasty for a few days but now it smells fine
purchased a mac looked at the prices of the covers at the apple store and one of the <unk> told me to go on online and shop for one i did and found this best quality ever fit was perfect and looks outstanding
i am ecstatic that i did n't listen to some of the other reviews here this product fits well with my laptop a # the bag smell is n't bad , it 's just a chemical , manufacturing , etc type of smell if it really bothers you , use the bag case inside out until it airs out this is my first time using a keyboard protector , it takes some getting used to but i ultimately like the feel of it hope this helps
after reading some of the reviews i was worried i was n't going to be satisfied but i still went ahead n purchased it and hoped for the best the items arrived faster than i thought i have the brand new mac book retna # in and it fits <unk> i love everything that comes with it when i first opened up the box it smelled a lot like plastic but after one day the smell went away also the bag that comes with it is not the same exact color as the keyboard n cover but the rest of then items match perfectly if you are looking for something with good quality and worth ur money i definitely suggest this i even purchased my sister one cus i love it so much : -rrb- hope this helps if anyone takes time to read
i could not be more happier with this purchase , it fit my laptop like a glove and the color is just as the pictures i definitely recommend this product , all you get for a good price
this case was amazing fit to my mac perfectly and love the color this is a must buy item if you have the mac book pro with
great case for what it is i do n't think it would survive a long fall or anything , but for the price , this whole kit is wonderful would definitely buy it again
love this case and all the items that came with it super great deal ! highly recommend it easy to install it 's taken a bit of time to get use to the <unk> cover , but it 's all good
this was an awesome bundle that fit my retina display macbook perfectly plus , topcase did an excellent job making sure i received exactly what i wanted i highly recommend them for your purchase i plan to purchase from them again
this is a great way to personalize your macbook it fits perfectly and offers protection against everyday wear the screen protector was a pain though and i just gave up on it i love the keyboard cover and i 'm very happy to have it to protect against dust getting in my keys my only complaint with that is that the letters do n't line up with the letters on the keyboard so the backlighting is hard to see
this worked great for me case fits well and sleeve is perfect for what i need it for keyboard cover is a little loose but works i did not use the screen protector or mouse pad
customer service helped me out a lot when i needed help getting another item they helped me send back something i ordered by accident and they gave me what i wanted
it looks great on my computer it is durrable and fits perfectly shipped super fast if you have a new mac you would be stupid not to protect it ... this is the perfect case
