it & # # ; s very compact bag and looks small from <unk> it can take all your stuff with no <unk> well <unk> are good but not as strong as they should
this is the bag i was searching i serves all my needs . weight balancing and compact design makes this bag , easy to carry with not much <unk> i dont have to worry about stuff as it has nice supporting padding nice one indeed !
it did n't fit my laptop , but thats not why im not rating it higher i thought i liked it until i received it and then realized its not really me its well made and the price is right
i was hesitant about ordering this due to someone else 's review about the zippers scratching their notebook but after searching for a few days , i decided on this one anyway i 've only had it for a couple of days now , but i think it 's great my macbook pro # `` fits inside nicely as long as i 'm not throwing it in there , i ca n't imagine the sleeve doing any harm to my notebook hopefully my first impressions will hold up for the long run * i would like to mention that it did arrive with a few black dirt marks on it they are n't too noticeable as they somewhat blend in with the darker branch part of the <unk> and they are n't in the white part they definitely are n't enough to make me return it , but they are noticeable and somewhat annoying -lrb- my reason for the four stars vs five -rrb-
for the price it was fine it only has the design on one side and it 's grey on the other it fit my # & # # ; laptop perfectly and it is cute , but you get what you paid for and it 's not fluffy like some others you would pay more for for $ # , it was just fine
my main priority is that it protects my mac it does that that being said , i was kind of disappointed to see that the design was only on one side , which was a bummer it fits well with the actual cover i also have , so it is really useful other than the design only being one side , it does protect the mac from scratches and such
i use this case carrying my computer to school and home , or from my dorm room to the library it is really nice and handy to have
i absolutely love the look of this case i would say that this case is really only for looks though not so much protection , that does n't bother me too much though as i purchased a cover case for my macbook along with this due to it being a light color on the front and a light grey on the back side it gets dirty very easily i find that using a clean eraser on the dirt spots get them right out im very happy with this purchase
pretty cover , well padded and looks great the only flaw is not having the design on both sides , other than that the zippers work well and it seems to be very sturdy
i have a plastic hard cover case on my mac and this case is still a perfect fit however it does get dirty quite fast i loved it so much i bought it again because i accidentally ruined the zipper of the first one
we liked the color of the cover arrived earlier than the rest of the items ordered in the same order pleasantly surprised but shocked to see the visible black/grey marks on the flip -lrb- cover -rrb- i returned this and the refund was <unk> applied no hassle with the <unk> got the full refund - including the s & h ; fees that was charged good customer service
i have an hp envy # us this case is a bit loose around it the neoprene is more like a thin packing foam ... not a nice cushioning neoprene like built products color is great velcro closure is good
this is a very nice laptop sleeve for the price , but it arrived wit stains on the flap i was disappointed after finding other had similar issues , i have decided not to purchase another one the <unk> process was very easy
fits perfectly for my # inch hp velcro is still nice and tough nothing wrong with it at all it is n't soft or cushiony on the inside like a lot of my friends ' , but there 's were $ # it protects it nicely enough to not have to worry about throwing it in your backpack or carrying it with a stack of books on top . hope this helps
i like it fits my netbook perfectly i have an additional book bag & i keep it in there with my school books i love it acts as a protector so my netbook does n't get scratched or damaged cute pink color , spongy , velcro is secure
i bought this for my sister for her laptop she is a college study in hawaii and needed a protector for her laptop while in her back pack once she received it she told it did fit the length of her lap top but was a little big she would have liked something that fit a little snugger but she kept it anyways i gave this laptop cover a # star rating because it 's width was too big for the lap top computer it specified , however it will still work
it says is neoprene but it sure does n't feel like other neoprene <unk> i 've seen it should be fine for keeping my toshiba satellite in and away from dust and dog hair not good for transport since it is too flimsy , and a bit big on my # . # inch laptop
this case is way too big for my # inch laptop the neoprene seems plenty sturdy and the color is beautiful , but its not really even usable because it is just way too
this cover is a very <unk> color its very very squishy and it <unk> fits in the case but its just a little big for it over all its good and <unk> happy with
i bought this product because my favorite color is blue it work great i bought it for my new hp pavilion dv # . # inches laptop it fit very well i recommend it
it arrived quickly , and the sale price is great , but the price plus shipping and tax makes the product not worth the money the material is cheap and does n't seem very protective
a very nice computer sleeve , but the color is n't quite what i expected it 's not a very vivid turquoise blue ... more dull than the color looks to be in this photo
bought case for my wife 's lenovo e # , # & # # ; screen the case fit perfectly , from side to side -lrb- width -rrb- , there was about # & # # ; of extra space on top for the money and quality of product cant go wrong it will offer adequate protection against small bumps and definitely protect it from those annoying scratches when your lap top rubs against other stuff in your book bag
i have an hp dm # , and it fits perfectly into the sleeve its a nice blue , and as i am a college student , it will fit into my backpack with ease i 'm very happy with this overall shipping was fast and easy , since it was delivered right to my door the next day definitely worth getting
this case is a nice , snug fit for my vaio laptop it offers some padding for protection the only drawback is that you must <unk> the ac adaptor cord into the cover to <unk> batteries
i just love is perfect for my # inch computer sony . it fit perfect and i have enough room for my earphone ! ! and maybe i charger i never reallly try to fit it there too
stitching on the velcro started coming apart after only a few uses , and the case was actually a little too big for my dell # z the neoprene was nice and thick , offers pretty good protection , so it does have that going for it
fit my lenovo u # perfectly problem was once i took it out of my suitcase at airport security it allowed to laptop to get banged up if you are using this inside another bag than great but otherwise it is very flimsy
i have a # & # # ; laptop and when shut the velcro does exactly match up # % but still covers everything and i have been happily using it for a couple of months now
a bit too big for a # . # in laptop and the quality is ok the velcro is pretty flimsy and feels like it will break soon but for the price , it is n't all that bad maybe useful as a second layer in a backpack or something
it 's ok it 's actually meant for # . # inches , though it still fits fine , and the stitching does n't seem that great it works , but if i were to buy one again i 'd go with another brand
after a lot of looking i found this cosmos sleeve uniquely sized for my lenovo e # the sleeve just has a velcro close on the flap and the quality and looks are better than you might expect for $ # it provides adequate protection for the laptop from companion items in a backpack or messenger bag
this is n't going to <unk> you over but hey , it 's a case i actually bought it for a large wacom tablet and the specs were dead on for a fit it has adequate room and is well cushioned i would n't use it for a laptop alone but that 's neoprene across the board
received my case and appeared as a very good quality product for the price problem , it did n't fit my toshiba satellite a # and i did liked the case for my needs but no luck contacted amazon for <unk> and everything went well with <unk> my card
this sleeve or case is everything i wanted it to be i opted for a velcro opening for faster access it fit my new dell inspiron # z snugly and perfectly it slides in and out great if i had a critique it would be that the material be a tad thicker , but it 's really fine the way it is
needed a case for my new laptop this one looked good , the price was real good and when i received it i was happy i bought it the quality and delivery were both excellent
this is a great laptop sleeve , it feels great and fits my laptop perfectly however , there are # problems -lrb- i got the blue one the color of the laptop sleeve on in the picture is a lot lighter than it actually is in reality , its darker , kind of like navy blue rather than the light neon blue that shows in the pic it says on the title + cosmos cable tie but when i checked the box , there were <unk> # reasons were why i could n't give it # stars * * * -
i expected something a little larger but this one will go to my <unk> grand child for her use at school ... it really bothers me that i have to write twenty words to leave a positive feedback it makes me not want to bother at all with any feedback . this item is as fine as <unk> hair . good stuff indeed
just a bit too big for a # & # # ; but does the job the product was received pretty fast the material was as described and much better i do recommend this product to anyone
color is as pictured -lrb- darker , baby blue -rrb- padding and sewing seem decent we 'll see how it holds up as others have mentioned , this is more for protecting your laptop from slight dings or scratching when you have it in another case -lrb- e.g i have a rolling backpack that i use this inside of . -rrb- the neoprene is ~ # & # # ; thick , but very airy it is not neoprene like used in <unk> or <unk> but the whole sleeve is light and more than capable of protecting your laptop from your books , charger , or other items you might place next to it i only give five stars to products that greatly exceed my expectations -lrb- e.g . <unk> <unk> , design features above & beyond core use -rrb- if your expectations for usage meet my description above , i challenge you to find a better value than these sleeves
works well as a case for a laptop and will fit must # & # # ; screened laptops has lost a bit of its foams sturdiness -lrb- aka looks ` broken in ' now -rrb- but still looks fine
i thought that for # dollars it would n't be that special i ordered it and it said it 'll be here in # weeks i was <unk> because i wanted it sooner it ended up arriving # weeks before i was supposed to get it the packaging was terrible and the color is n't as bright but a good case for $
i have bought a lot of good quality things -lrb- such as phone cases and screen protectors -rrb- for a cheap price so i guess i had high expectations for this laptop case it 's a good price , about $ # , i love the color and was n't sure if it would fit my samsung laptop but it did however , the delivery took at least two weeks because it comes from china the sleeve seems pretty thin , maybe i did n't read the description as well as i should have but it does n't feel as though it can protect my laptop well i will most likely invest in a better laptop sleeve
this product was everything i expected it to be , it has great padding for my laptop and fits my # . # in ultrabook well shipping was amazing as well , especially since it came almost a week before expected arrival time
this laptop case is sturdy and will protect your computer nicely mine fits my toshiba perfectly and protects it when i 'm traveling i recommend this to anyone with a # `` laptop , especially pc users
this laptop sleeve fits my # . # inch asus computer perfectly it provides the perfect amount of protection to put my laptop into my backpack for school without worrying about damaging it the color is true to the picture and it fits perfectly in my jansport backpack
this is a really cute sleeve for my laptop the color is exactly as pictured the foam could be thicker to offer more protection , but i am mostly using it to prevent scratches , since i keep my laptop on my side table when taking it to class , i 'll put it in a laptop bag as well i really like that the sleeve opens completely on one side -lrb- instead of having a part that you have to stretch over the computer and overlap - it makes it easier to keep my computer plugged in while still protecting it from my dog it 's a great price for the product , and i think i 'm going to love it
this fits my laptop and fits inside my backpack perfectly i like the opening at the top so that i can take my laptop out without removing the entire thing from my bag
it fits well and is perfect for what i needed just wanted a slip case to put the laptop in so my cats will not bother it now shipping did take a while , but then this is mailed direct from china so that makes sense nice inexpensive little case compared to some of the others on the market and it is well made
i bought this cover about # years ago and i am still using it ! i do n't take the cover in and out of my backpack , which might be the reason why it 's lasting so long , but it is worth the money since it is couple years old , i have little plastic fibers coming out on the bottom , however it does n't get in my way or anything , it 's always hidden in the bag
this thing is a great product for the price i bought it just to keep in my backpack for debris - free computer transportation it 's worth noting that i use it to carry a # & # # ; macbook , but i think it 'd big enough for a # & # # ; too it 's fairly thin -lrb- thinner than some other neoprene laptop bags , but definitely not flimsy -rrb- but it 's nice and big and works very well for me
got this sleeve , so i can just slide my laptop into my jansport and be on the go for school/work this product worked out well & its a very pretty blue too
we have a chromebook samsung <unk> # -a # us , which is listed case is way to big for it ! does not fit it at all ! item is going back ! ! wanted a case you did not have to remove the computer to use , will be looking elsewhere !
contrary to what they say in the description , this case does not fit my acer chromebook c # , but is way too big so much so that i ca n't utilize the elastic straps in the upper corners if i want to use it while in the open case -- the top of my chromebook does n't reach high enough it also slides around inside quite a bit , but i 'm guessing that probably wo n't damage it the padding is not as thick as it appears in the photos , and there 's a seam that is n't sewn flat on the inside and is beginning to come apart i just got it today , so i figure it wo n't be long before it completely tears open i spent several days looking at cases on amazon before i chose this one it was inexpensive , but that 's not what <unk> me to buy it i purchased it based on the good reviews , and the claims that it would fit my <unk> and be protective , and it was the type of case that i was looking for i 'm really irritated that i ended up with another inferior piece of junk , which i 've been getting a lot of lately , shopping online
this product arrived on time within the delivery date given it is not a bad product but it could be made slightly smaller to provide a snugger fit for for my google chrome book by samsung one of the hard plastic zipper pulls snapped in two within two weeks after i received it i was tempted to return it but decided the damage did not affect the main reason i ordered , because it provided more protection than the one i first ordered i am still somewhat disapointed and therefore would not recommend it to my circle of colleagues
this case was very nice and it had the bands to hold the computer top i did not fit the acer chromebook so we returned it and ordered a case logic which we love
sleeve is very durable it is a little too big for the chromebook i was looking for a tight fit but it is good for what i need delivery was before the date which was great
the sleeve works fine i can see how , with a lot of use , the clasp will wear out ; but , we do n't use it that often , so , for us it will be fine
it was a gift for my daughter who tell me often how much she likes it great padding good zipper ipad fit well she would of prefered a different color but blk was all there was she & i would recommend this product to anyone who is always on the go and with ipad in hand , its good protection
i bought my wife a samsung # . # laptop and wanted a product to protect and store it i saw the pwr + sleeve case cover and it was the perfect fit we travel a lot and this was the ideal storage case to keep it from being damaged would recommend to anyone with a small laptop or notebook
great product that serves the intended use only reason not # stars is that it has a little more extra room in it then i would have liked - i like a snug fit others may like more space to accommodate papers and such
yes , the product is a little larger in size than the computer that is supposed to fit in to it i read about this concern from other purchasers before i bought mine however , i chose to make the & # # ; buy . & # # ; overall , the product protects my computer very well , and the size <unk> is not a huge issue i am a student ; i use the product every single day
the pwr + case cover bag for samsung series # chromebook is a well made product although it is n't a custom fit for the chromebook , the chromebook sits in it pretty nice the case provides protection for your chromebook while you 're out and about
i brought my pc inside this case recently , and amazed about the protection from any damages and shocks the material used is nicer than any other 's i have ever used i absolutely think this is the one of the excellent items in amazon !
i would highly recommend this pwr + sleeve case it has kept my samsung chromebook safe and protected during my travels i have used it in tote bags and carry-ons and it is well cushioned and sturdy i keep the case on the chromebook while i use it on my lap i also use the case under my larger laptop when i use my laptop to protect my legs the case and the zipper are well made a very good product that i would recommend to others
purchased the case for my son 's chromebook it is masculine in looks , but love the padded ribs the most the ribs give a little extra protection to the chromebook , being that he is a teenager and just a bit careless so far , so good thanks for a great product
the case was sent fast and is very cool looking i like the look and feel of the product i have had many compliments and asked about where to purchase one i cant wait to recommend it to
i bought the chrome book for my son for <unk> and included a nice sleeve to protect it as well my son loves the whole thing a lot i am very pleased by my choice and would do it again i am very impressed with the this product than you for making this available to is love it !
works exactly as described inside is made of soft cotton material that does not scratch computer fits my samsung # . # inch chromebook nicely i like the padded ribbed construction for added safety i toss it in my backpack and go i also like the elastic straps on the inside you can use them to hold your chromebook in place while traveling or feed the top cover into the straps so the computer opens when you open the sleeve case cover shipping was fast product arrived before the estimated time that was given during ordering i would purchase this product again from the same vendor
the chromebook fits snuggly into the cover and can be used with the cover in place my grandson , age # , tends to throw the chromebook into his knapsack - not always careful - i think this cover will be very protective
like my chromebook this carrying case is small and compact it is well padded and offers protection from motion the fit is not snug but the right size and i still have room for a mouse and the adapter suits my needs perfectly
ordered for my high schooler 's chromebook that he carries back and forth in a back pack it protect the chromebook from scratches and has enough padding in it to absorb any shock if dropped very happy with purchase
this bag is roomy thats a plus it fits most anything i need the problem is the strap is too long -lrb- maybe bc im short -rrb- and the top flap comes open often i would <unk> a bag i can grab and go and i have trouble with the long strap and opening top flap when i grab out of my car from drivers seat
this bag does the job however , i expected it to have stronger strap support since it can hold a larger size laptop also , the top opening is a <unk> and i would have preferred a zipper -lrb- i did not look close enough at the product description before ordering it -rrb- the design is cute , but a little on the kiddish side
the design is very cute and exactly as it appears in the picture my pavilion g series computer -lrb- # . # & # # ; -rrb- fits nicely not snug like some reviewers mentioned , but my laptop is also pretty thin there 's enough room for my computer , my notebook , and my charger in the main compartment , but not much else the pockets in the front are n't quite as big as i would like them bag itself is a little heavy -lrb- not super heavy , but enough that the extra weight is noticed when carrying it -rrb- overall , very minor cons , major pros would certainly recommend , especially for a slightly smaller computer since there would be more available room
this was a really great bag loved the color , i like that it had a compartment to put pens and pencils the only problem i had is that it lacked the necessary room i was looking for in a bag at the time , i use it on days when i 'm able to pack light other than the bag seems to be durable and dose not dirty easily so in all if you are looking for a bag to carry your laptop and a note book or too this is the bag for you
this bag is great it has tons of space , lots of pockets to organize things , and is a beautiful color -lrb- although it does get dirty easily -rrb- i bought this for my # . # `` toshiba laptop , and let 's just say , its a tight fit i basically have to shove the computer in there the description says it fits up to # . # `` laptops but just know , its really meant for a smaller size laptop , as mine just barely fits
could not think of what to get for two sweet # birthday gifts and then found these great messenger bags the bags are well made and perfect for carrying laptops and paperwork -lrb- school work -rrb- and still be stylish - which is even more important when the <unk> are teenagers
i love this bag not only is it beautiful , like the picture , it fits everything i need i was concerned about some of the reviews that said it would not fit my laptop , but i find it quite spacious i can fit my laptop , and there is space for my ipad the handle is soft and wide which makes trekking from a parking garage to a fourth floor classroom easy i love the zippered pockets on the outside that hold random items
it is a beautiful bag my laptop -lrb- actual measurement is # / # inches across -rrb- does just barely fit in the pocket designed for it but i like that it is a snug fit there is another pocket in the main part of the bag in which you could put your computer if it is too big i really appreciate how well made it is and all the detail
this bag is so roomy it has a spot for everything the only problem i have is my laptop does n't in the velcro pocket but since the whole bag is padded , it fits in the main pocket i like that the strap is adjustable and wider than most i 've seen seems more sturdy it 's easy to clean and it looks nice too
i love the color and though there is n't a lot of room for more than a cord and computer and a few smaller items , but it helps me to not shove it full and make too heavy
this laptop bag is perfect for transporting my laptop and equipment the strap is nice and wide ; it wo n't fall off my shoulder when walking there are plenty of zipper pockets for all kinds of things from usb drives , cds , pens/pencils , paper , notebooks i even have room with all that to add a laptop cooling <unk> the design is very nice and the bag is easy to clean
i bought this bag for a co-worker and they really loved it she said it provided great protection for her laptop as well as plenty of extra space for accessories
i got this for my # year old to carry to school she loves that it is a messenger bag and that it is not the same as every other girl in her class it is attractive and well made
i love this messenger bag it arrived within a few days and the description was right on the money great bag for those adults who want to continue their <unk> but not in a <unk> looking backpack laptop fit perfectly as well
i got this for my mom 's birthday and she loves it seems pretty good quality if you want to put a lot in it , it would n't work for that but a laptop and it 's accessories are perfect
perfect for travel throw my laptop which has an acrylic colored hard cover and a soft neoprene sleeve in the bag and with the # it 's all the protection my computer needs has plenty of room to include my kindle , ipod , and whatever else i want to put in it not to mention it 's stylish too
i liked this product a lot , it looks <unk> and the quality is nice however , i measured before i ordered because i wanted to make sure the keyboard i own would fit into the cover when comparing my measurements with the sizes online it looked like it would fit with a tiny bit of room to spare but it was too small , the keyboard does not fit , the inside is almost # & # # ; too small the rma to return it arrived very quickly but when the amount was refunded , they charged a restocking fee on both covers even so only one was opened -lrb- they stated both were opened - not true ! -rrb-
if cost is no object , i wholeheartedly recommend this case it is well constructed and fits the apple wireless keyboard perfectly i like the plastic tabs that snugly secure the keyboard as well as the elastic loops that keep the cover closed when not in use it is high quality leather with suede inside it does add some weight to the keyboard , so those who like to keep their keyboards light may not want to put it in this cover also , the cover does flex enough to not prevent accidental key presses , so picking it up could inadvertently turn on an ipad -lrb- i do it all the time -rrb- but it is better than having no cover the only negative is its cost i really like this cover and trust it to keep my keyboard safe and secure
i do not always use my keyboard for my ipad , but there is no question that i need a pad for the cover i am happy that i did not chose the connected cover for the ipad , and very happy that this cover fits the ipad keyboard perfectly it is snug , has a wonderful little flap , and stays clean and safe there are no downsides as best as i can see to this cover the price is right
maroo otago wireless keyboard cover provides stylish protection for your wireless keyboard i often toss my keyboard in my bag , but i was worried about protecting it from damage the maroo otago wireless keyboard cover does a good job of keeping it safe the cover is sturdy and offers good protection i also like the clean , sleek design , it is stylish in an understated way it fit my apple wireless keyboard perfectly , too if you are in the market for a wireless keyboard cover , i 'd recomment the maroo otago wireless keyboard cover
this is a great looking and functional carrier for your apple keyboard fits the newest generation my only issue is that the case does n't seem sturdy enough for typing when the cover is set at an angle
i have an apple keyboard for my ipad # i am so careful with most of my electronics , yet i did n't order a case for my ipad keyboard , not good i almost dropped it once and even spilled some liquid `` near `` it , near enough to get a few drops on my keyboard ... again , not good so i broke down and ordered this keyboard case i could n't be more pleased i was so grateful to the person that gave the video review because it is what <unk> me to purchase this and , just like in the video , my keyboard fit like a dream it 's a well padded case , and looks great although it cost more than i had wanted to pay , i 'm glad i went ahead and purchased it
both attractive and functional , this case protects the apple wireless keyboard very well made fron quality leather and well designed i have not found a case that even begins to compare with this one
the nice thing about this bag is that it is light weight and has a laptop compartment what i do n't like are the shoulder straps they are thin , hard and uncomfortable when i have it loaded up with a laptop , camera , couple lenses and misc gear , the straps dig into my shoulders and make my neck hurt this is not a bag i would use if i wanted to carry my gear for more than a short time i also wish it had a way to attach a tripod
i carry lots of cameras , lenses and stuff ... when on a trip and expect to take lots of pictures sometimes those trips are last minute and the red -lrb- not red , red -rrb- bag is perfect i can spot it quickly , it 's light and carries everything i need with plenty of protection i would recommend this to a friend - the red is trendy but does n't over do it
this is a great bag i really like it , although i would n't say that it is large it 's more of a medium sized backpack , in terms of what it can store i have my nikon d # , which is a little larger than some dslrs , a few lenses and some misc . items and there is still a bit of space left , but not a ton there is also a place to put your laptop , so that 's great if you want to bring yours with you
nice backpack , confortable and very usefull , but it 's necessary the space to put the tripod i 'm so happy with my brand new backpack , recently travel with this and i recomended
gave it a # just because i paid for two-day shipping and got it in # days other than that , it 's exactly as said the inside has customizable velcro <unk> your equipment how you want and the bag its too big , meaning it does n't <unk> a big camping bag but it 's big enough for all your essentials
