i bought this hoping to have some extra protection for my dell mini # v well the top portion snaps on as expected and it stays on the bottom portion is a different story most of the snaps will attach well , but the one in the front left palm rest will not stay on you can actually finagle it on so that it makes that snap , but then you will notice how much the plastic underneath is somewhat warping improperly as if it was not contoured exactly to the curves of the laptop eventually this warping will lead that attachment point to snap off -lrb- not snap as in break , but just snap off of its attachment point -rrb- this is quite annoying because it will not just stay in place i have decided not to even use the bottom portion -lrb- waste -rrb- so for the money i only use the top part which essentially prevents fingerprints from getting on the top lid wish i could give # . # stars
i love the pink cover i recieved it quickly and all that my only complaint is that the order form and all of that said i ordered a clear cover and i was worried i would get a clear one but i did get the pink that i ordered
this fits my dell inspiron mini # perfectly snaps right on , and definitely will protect it from scratches and such i also really appreciate that it has feet , so it can stand off the table and not overheat i only gave it # because the joints for the feet feel like they are not going to last for very long , but for the price , i 'd absolutely purchase another one
i had no idea they made a hard cover for my dell mini i 'm so glad i found this product , i bought mine in red and it 's just perfect , it fits like a glove i 'm very happy with my purchase
the idea of a clear plastic case for a macbook pro is great , however this is n't the product to purchase for sure my first iteration snapped through simple use on the bottom piece -lrb- the little tab that holds the shell to the bottom , one broke -rrb- speck replaced the item only to have it break in the exact same spot i decided not to call speck again and just write this off as a waste of money i thought speck was a good product line , guess i was wrong
the review says it all the cover does not fit my mac book pro : -lrb- i read the reviews -lrb- as i always do -rrb- and apparently my mac book pro is older than # i would obviously not recommend this product to mac book pro users with older pros waste of excitement , money and time
this case looks great on the computer there is nothing at all aesthetically wrong with it but if you run more serious programs on your computer , you 'll need to remove the cover because it covers the vent and causes overheating also , having removed and replaced it a number of times on the laptop , the cover wore down and cracked in a few places so you must choose between either overheating or replacing your cover all the time
so when i got my new macbook i needed to protect it normally i dont go with hard cases but with the new bag i got i needed to get a hard case i really wanted a clear case and speck was the only one with a hard case in clear it was easy to install . then after a few week i noticed some stuff under the cover dirt got in and started scratching my macbook also the way the new macbook chargers come only allow for the charger to clip on one way , and when its charging its blocking some of the ports will be getting a new case and it wont be from speck
i love the color and the product was exactly what it said it was however , i was not aware of the fact that this was going to make my laptop about # lbs heavier than it is already , but really , i got used to that pretty fast otherwise , this product is pretty great i had to take the bottom off because something slipped between it and my computer and one of he snap on hooks broke , but otherwise , it is a great product
this product was extremely easy to snap into place the only reservation i have about it is that it came to me pretty scratched up , but it is inevitable the material that the cover 's made from will naturally get scratched that 's the only reason why i did n't exchange it when i first rec 'd it other than that , it does its job
i do n't know if it 's supposed to be this way , but only part of the holes are cut out the rest are still left in -lrb- i 'm <unk> to the ventilation holes on the bottom -rrb- i 'm really worried about the heat
the case is well made except that the tabs that hold it on the computer have already broken off the bottom cover after # months it is very easy to snap onto the computer and does protect it well enough it gets carried to school often but i was hoping it would last a lot longer i love the color but now need a new bottom , perhaps they should sell replacements
its exactly what i expected it to be - a great hardshell case for my new macbook pro it fit perfectly fine , and i am overall satisfied with it i feel like i can pick up my laptop and not have to worry about it getting damaged it also keeps the laptop clean , and comes with a cloth its easy to set up , and i have n't had any problems with this product i recommend it
i got my macbook pro # `` for school -lrb- go full <unk> -rrb- but i needed more protection for it my friend told me about the speck cases and showed me her <unk> -lrb- blue -rrb- one and i loved it i think i 'll collect them all -lrb- i 'm a <unk> , huh ? but overall i love this case it 's easy to install but unfortunately it seemed to get a scratch just a little too easily , which was not to my personal delight nevertheless at amazon prices i truly do n't mind investing in this - i also got the <unk> pink silicone keyboard cover -lrb- it was # or # bucks -rrb- and together they pair very well
well i have to say that i love this case and the pink is super cute and protects the computer like i wanted but it sure does make the computer heavier <unk> heavier actually even my boyfriend commented about the laptop weighing more i still love the case though and it prevents it from getting scratched which is why i wanted it in the first place
this case is very nice , excellent build quality with a perfect fit does n't make your macbook much bigger or heavier my only gripe is the price , as this is really just a piece of molded plastic with rubber feet still though , worth it , as it will protect your computer 's body and potentially save your warranty
the casing looks good and fits the notebook exactly just that i find it a bit costly for a piece of plastic like this and there is a scratch when we received the good we didnt bother to return overall , still ok but just that it will be fantastic if the price is much lower
easy to snap onto your macbook pro , not so easy to pop off ... but that 's a good thing ... it 's secure really pops with bright barbie pink color , true to website appearance the shiny plastic looks like it scratches easily , and i have a few dings already , but it 's better than my actual computer getting banged up , right if you 're looking for a really bright pink cover , this is the one for you i 've gotten lots of compliments on how it looks , and it was exactly as i expected does n't make the computer hot , and all the ports are accessible
this is one of the best cases i have ever seen for a computer it fits so well and keeps it safe from surface scratches while the price is on the high side it is definitely worth it
the see through case makes my # inch macbook pro look professional while providing it with protection from scratches it is a perfect fit , with no problems getting it off to occasionally clean the computer is a breeze everyone who sees it comments on the look i purchased the aqua blue - it is more of a <unk> turquoise
this case is even more attractive in person than it was on the site i purchased the aqua , and it looks great and gives me piece of mind for my new mac it snapped on with no problems , and is a perfect fit great job speck
when i purchased my second macbook pro , i knew i needed a case for it i constantly had issues keeping my first one clean , but never wanted to buy a cover for it because i loved the silver color of it and did n't want to lose the <unk> feel of it and , well , because i 'm lazy with my second mac , i wanted to keep it in pristine condition , so i started looking around for something a friend of mine told me about speck cases so i bit the bullet and bought one i 'm so glad that i did when it arrived i thought it might be difficult to put it on , but it slipped easily over my mac and fits so snugly i 've used it for about # months and have never had any issues it does gather dust/dirt occasionally , but is easy to clean -lrb- and better the case , than the mac imo ! -rrb- anyway -rrb- i love it and hope you do too
i have a speck cover on my # year old macbook i wax the cover once a month if you want to totally protect your aluminum mac , regardless of size , this is it i use the clear one but they come in colors i have both a # and # and have them `` speck ` ed `` from day one at resell time , this spec cover will have paid for itself i know a few friends of mine that see the price and that keeps them away on has a big scratch on his , i say nothing , but he knows what he should have done
this brand is my favorite when it comes to laptop cases i like that the <unk> on the bottom keep my laptop in place as i 've found this to not be the case in other top brands i 've tried i will continue to purchase specks products i will not waste my money on the other brands of laptop cases btw the color on this case is beautiful
i 've used my speck cover for almost a month now and it 's holding up great i carry my laptop everywhere to do presentations around campus and do n't have to worry about scratching it up the see-through case is very professional and also helps alleviate the problem i hard with the sharp edge when resting my hand and scrolling the case is made of sturdy plastic , fits like a glove and has all the correct port holes great product and a good solution to protect my investment
pic of product is lighter in pic -lrb- i.e . more pink -rrb- than in actuality , but the product is accurately described as purple wife likes the color pink , i like the price of purple , <unk> got here <unk> -lrb- arrived on a saturday -rrb- will buy again from this seller , they are highly recommended
i have had this particular clear speck case on my macbook pro # `` for several months now and it is so durable before i purchased an i-pad # , i took my macbook pro w/case everywhere ... the classroom , library , home office , campus computer lab , starbucks , <unk> etc . after months of heavy use the case still looks great and does n't scratch easily and it fits like a glove with no wiggle room at all no matter where i go people always say `` i did n't even realize you had a case on your computer until i looked closer `` , then they want to know where i purchased it as long as i own a macbook pro of any type i will never use another clear case other than the speck brand so many other cases detract from the aesthetics of apple 's design for their products i only wish speck made and equally attractive and truly crystal clear case for the i-pad # if anyone knows of such an item please post a comment below
i love this product . the installation was easy and its a perfect fit for my # inch mac book pro i did quite a bit of research , some said they could not open the screen way past # degrees i dont think so ! the only drawback is it does make macbook pro a little heavier but not too much thicker
the installation was quick and easy this year 's model was about $ # more than the older model , but it is a quality product this is my second one and i 'll probably buy another when i get a new laptop in about # years
having never used an apple i must admit i was n't sure but it is very user friendly and love what it can do for me the <unk> was so helpful when ordering both my daughters use apples and now i can see why an awesome product
it 's hard to improve on the macbook pro , but this little case does just that i have experience in the plastics industry , so i 'm rather picky the <unk> , cut-outs , rubber feet and <unk> finish of this product are impressive it 's very nicely made , snaps on easily , and protects the computer perfectly the wonderful range of colors also lets you personalize your machine - or choose clear to keep the ` industrial ' metal look my ipod and kindle have hot pink covers , so i chose to match them functional and cute
my only complaint is that there is only one small pocket , barely enough to store the cord i had hoped i would be able to keep the external hard drive in the case as well , not the case this item is plenty expensive for what it is
i purchased three cases for my husband , grandson and myself the ipads fit perfectly in these cases and i 'm extremely happy about the protection they provide a friend told me about this case and i 'm so happy he did
fits my acer <unk> one great and the outside pocket fits the a/c adapter and headphones i do n't use my netbook for hours at a time , but i assume heat could become an issue with the poor airflow the case provides
i have the gumdrop <unk> case on the ipad and the fit is excellent after doing extensive research prior to purchase , this case fits the ipad like a glove the inside -lrb- memory foam -rrb- is soft and gentle on the screen and there are even elastic and plastic straps to hold the ipad in place it is perfect for traveling as well the two outer zippers align to use with a lock the second zippered compartment is perfect for my cords and chargers with all the selection out there , this case is as perfect as a case can get
i bought this because i was looking for a case in which i dont need to take out my acer d # it fits well and extra pocket is <unk> for some extra stuff : -rrb- overall satisfied with build and quality
i purchased this case for my asus eee # netbook and it is a perfect fit it fits the netbook quite well and the outside pocket can accommodate the dc <unk> as well as a compact camera or whatever else you want to put in there the case allows for easy use when traveling so that you can simply unzip it and begin using your netbook i took it with me on a recent business trip and it was easy to use on a small jet on the small table behind the seat it also is sturdy enough to protect the netbook from being damaged in transport the quality of the construction - the memory foam and the zipper is excellent i would recommend this product highly
just received & extremely unhappy this is so far from the pink or ` hot pink ' as clearly shown in the picture - it 's actually purple not fuchsia even - just a plain dull purple i hate purple its not my screen <unk> - i 've looked at this on my laptop , my ipad retina display & iphone so no , it 's not my screen and the description clearly says hot pink if they had been honest about the color i would 've purchased the black zebra & been happy i gave it one star merely because the larger size is good for ipad with a keyboard cover or in another case note to <unk> : your pictures and descriptions should match what you sell to customers if this was just a little `` less bright pink `` than shown , i 'd deal , as it is i 'm giving it away
i love the design on this but it is definitely not as big as it seems the front zipper will barely zip closed with only the ac adapter in the front pocket i had to order a larger bag to be able to accomodate all my tablet accessories
i have a thin leather case on my ipad already but i wanted more protection when i travel this pouch fits it just with al little room inside but i feel it 's well protected i love the extra zipper pocket on the outside to keep my extra chargers in
the cover is very attractive i like having two zippered pockets the reason for # and not # stars is that the inside padding is loose and my # ' kindle fire tends to pull out with the padding sticking out
i was a little hesitant because the description says it is for netbooks # - # `` and i have an acer aspire one d # with a # . # `` screen i am so glad i took a leap of faith the sleeve is durable and fits my netbook perfectly - not too small , not too big it is super cute to boot there is even a lip on the inside to protect your netbook from the zipper the zippers are sturdy and material is good quality there is a front pocket for accessories such as headphones , flash drives , or mp # player if you do n't mind the bulge , you can even fit the charger i am very happy with this sleeve . :
this case is really great it is well constructed and offers significant padding to secure your device it also features a lip just inside the zipper to hold the laptop/tablet in place the front pocket offers plenty of space to store the charging cable plus any other small accessories the only minor issue was the color the case is actually deeper in color than is pictured here it is a deep magenta , almost purple but it 's quite lovely actually , so it was n't too big of an issue ; just different than what was expected overall great quality
netbook case is very cute , well made , and fits my # . # inch asus eee pc perfectly the side zipper is perfect to hold my mini wireless mouse and flash drive very happy with the case , love it
i use it for work and it holds my # & # # ; samsung tablet with accessories i like the extra zipper pocket outside i can keep my daily business things all in one place the only thing i would suggest is to add inside pockets for separating items i use for daily business
i purchased this for my girls to use for their ipads they have the # th generation ipad with a smart cover on it both fit into this case perfectly they like using it for added protection
telescoping handle is weak and just broke off about # months after i bought the bag when i called amazon to get them to fix or replace the bag they refused , saying i had to contact the manufacturer and when i contacted the manufacturer to ask for a repair or replacement they refused and said i had to contact amazon good thing to know - anything you buy on amazon has nobody standing behind it if it is defective
this is literally a carry-on sized bag my # inch laptop fit 's very securely and i am confident it will travel safe in this bag however ... this is n't a bag you 'll want to transport your laptop to the coffee shop in - large & bulky i have used this bag as my carry on and fit shoes , # days of fresh clothing , pj 's , a book and toiletries into it , in addition to my computer this is a high quality , luggage grade bag with multiple useful compartments -lrb- with high quality zippers -rrb- , and smooth <unk> to steer wheels not complaining about the bag ... just thinking i should have considered buying a smaller laptop ;
the bag is really elegant and it looks sturdy it seems that the manufacturer thought about all the different <unk> and made this bag ready for it the only disadvantage is that the bag is huge to be carried to the office on daily basis if nearby , but it is perfect if you are travelling
i purchased this bag to transport my <unk> equipment in , hoping to fit my portable machine in here but it is too thick for the bag to close the machine is almost # x as thick as a normal laptop it is nicely made , has straps for using as a backpack -lrb- very convenient -rrb- as well as a pull up handle to wheel the bag also has lots of zippered pockets & storage areas it is well made , does not look cheap at all & has a padded compartment to put ur , laptop as <unk> a separate section in the main compartment the separate section does not have any padding between the pull up handle and the inside of the bag which would be nicer but that 's a minor detail overall a good
backpack was way larger than i expected its about the size of a standard rolling suitcase the overall quality is good and i recommend this to those who travel a lot for business
works good for what it is i have an # `` laptop and travel several times a year good for short trips to be all in one i have tried to do more with it than travel <unk> use as my ` briefcase ' to work every day for that use it could work better with a few more paper size compartments thumbs up for quality and versatility
if you have a large laptop this is the bag for you i have been able to get everything i need in this bag with no problem the bag is not heavy at all
i have been using the hp # -inch roller case for weeks and it has done a great job my only concern is whether the telescopic handle will handle the rigors of winter in ohio heat and rain have not been particularly challenging for the wheels , hopefully snow and ice will not pose undue stress
high quality product , met and surpassed all my expectations besides fitting my large notebook there is room left for packing clothes for a <unk> getaway just perfect , highly recommend it
my # . # & # # ; screen laptop fits more than comfortably in bag there 's plenty room for my books and stuff easy to pull handle raises and <unk> smoothly i 'm very glad i bought this bag
my daughter has used this item for school for less than # months and the handle is literally in shreds this item in now useless and no longer <unk>
we purchased this item for our son to use for school he has to carry a computer to all of his classes plus his other supplies this seemed like the perfect solution we ended up returning the first one because after about # weeks of use the handle started ripping away from the fabric we easily got a replacement and <unk> him to only use the shoulder strap now , # weeks into this one all handles are ruined we will not be replacing this one again
i thought this was a <unk> case including the lunch bag , binder , and laptop case when i received my package i only received the cheap looking lunch bag , which was poorly wrapped in a flimsy , plastic , ziploc bag and no <unk> if i wanted to purchase a lunch bag , i would have just gone to the store to buy some brown lunch bags it would have lasted longer than what i have purchased i wrote to amazon the day i received my package -lrb- three days ago -rrb- and yet i have n't received any response back from the customer service <unk> . i will be returning this product back for a full refund do not buy this product it 's not worth it
as soon as i pulled it out of the box i noticed a huge rip on the back of the binder the outside pocket was ripped like someone tried to pull the lunch box off and it would n't come off immediately returned the product , sad because i was looking forward to it
the size is great but the quality is very poor my # th grade son has been using for the last month and the handle is tearing away from the top of the case good idea poorly
this binder was supposed to come with three parts ... the binder itself , a lunch kit , and a computer case i only received the binder and the lunch kit the computer case was completely missing when i contacted amazon customer service , they were not helpful at all i was told that there was no way i would be able to receive the third piece
the shows that it is a <unk> build a binder , neoprene zipper binder with computer case and lunch kit ... when i got it today it was only the computer case ! ! not what i was looking for very unhappy
it 's ok not really not the quality i expected in the item ca n't put to much in a one time because it may rip in the seams and not last but over all for the price i paid it 's ok
# - # <unk> - good <unk> lunch <unk> shoulder strap -lrb- my high school kid like this feature - handle broke from where it was attached - only last a few <unk> enough space in the binder section need at least # or # inch wide to accomodate # classes of high school kids if they would change the material where the handle is attached to , make it durable and triple <unk> it , this may solve the flaw of the design
i really wanted to like this case because the design is very convenient , even though it 's bulky like several others mentioned , the handle on the binder , and the hooks where the shoulder straps clip onto the binder , started to rip away from the binder within the first week everything was stitched to a thin layer of plastic covering the binder , instead of being fastened to the hard layer underneath i no longer use the binder i just use the lunch kit and laptop case separately , which defeats the whole purpose of why i bought this case
in the first week one side of the strap ripped which is very disappointing i do n't honestly know how much longer this will be useful while the idea of this product is great , i do n't think the strap is sewn <unk> enough the strap should have been bound to the hard part not just the fabric not sure it can be replaced because it 's damaged now
i bought this for a middle schooler who needed a binder for school i wanted one with a strap so he would not have to put it in his backpack on most days , he just uses the binder case unfortunately it was made with the sticky velcro on both sides of the binder so when you just use the binder , it will catch on some of your clothes the binder started ripping after a month the other one he had from case it lasted # months it 's also a bit soft sided so papers can get bend
very dissapointed that the laptop case did not come with the binder as it stated in the description of the product part of the reason i purchased this was because it was suppose to include a laptop case i bought this for my grandson and had it shipped to his home in another state , so returning it is more of a hassle than it is worth
my son and i thought this was the perfect idea for him he did n't want to carry a backpack and this did it all but the strap is n't strong enough and the entire handle/strap piece tore off after only a month too bad it was n't made better , because the idea is great
this is n't big enough for coupons if you coupon like i do i would recommend something bigger it seems okay otherwise but i really am wishing i had n't purchased it
would be perfect if it was about # . # inches wider my work laptop does not quite fit into it if there was one a litte bigger i would buy that one # & # # ; ! !
while the idea of this product is wonderful , the product itself is n't very durable if you want to use it sparingly , it works terrific , but do n't expect to carry a laptop or use the binder for everyday usage still , for the price , it was well worth it and the lunch box portion is terrific
i love the concept , but mine is ripped right down the seam now i have to take everything out of it and wait to get something else i am really annoyed with the quality of this product
lasted only a couple of weeks , until the handle started ripping away from the binder not expected much from this brand , have not had good luck with them at all will not purchase it again my kids have to carry a binder at all times , and i have yet to find one that will stand up to wear and tear of # th , # th or # th graders
i only had this binder for less than a week and the zipper broke yesterday i love the binder but they need to have a metal or more durable zipper now i 'm out a binder . : -
the binder didnt last more than # months i still use the little lunch holder i dont use the laptop case since my laptop is macbook pro and the case is not very sturdy . if you have an acer or hp , it is fine
the bag looks great and has plenty of storage , but is not very sturdy within a week a zipper broke , the next week the strap tore loose it has now been seperated into its different components and my wife uses the binder part
it 's okay but not great one of the zipper tags came off the first time i used it also , when i had it fully loaded , some of the seams have seperated
this was a gift for my # -year-old son and he loved it in fact , his friends loved it too and asked where they could get one the strap and handle could have been better reinforced they have separated from the binder ... which when you have an ipad , a lunch and the binder 's weight combined , it is a tremendous strain on the handles a reinforced grommet or two through the spine of the binder would be a great design improvement in fact , we <unk> holes and put nuts , <unk> and <unk> on it to repair the damage
i really like this handy product the only thing i do n't like is that the velcro is just on the bottom part , so when you attach either the lunch box or the other part it hangs off
this is a great gift for anyone on the go all the time the quality is great and can be used in many different ways i purchased another one after receiving the first one to give as another gift if you 're a person who needs help with organization while you 're on the go , this is definitely a great start
i bought this to hold my coupons , i found out i dont need a lunchbox or a laptop holder to carry around with my coupons but the binder itself is great i love the strap
why i bought this is because i use it for school the lap top case is used for my homework folder and its two compartments are for my school planner and a book to read i use the big part for my papers , color bag where i keep my color pencils and pencils i really love this binder by case it i have this binder for about three to four months now and its a very good binder the lunch box is usefull as well i have two lunch boxes but i use both of them i recommend this is to any middle school student , high school student , or even a <unk> student i plan to still have it when i go to college its a very good binder
i purchased this for multiple purposes but had hoped to use it to organize my son 's important papers for college ironically , he chose to use the laptop case for that , but the components are useful just the same ... individually or together i plan to use the lunchbox for <unk> and other small items that need to be kept cold
a lot of pieces , and each one is good quality i use them separately , as all of that put together -lrb- with my computer , lunch , and binder contents -rrb- would be too heavy i got this on sale and for the price , ca n't complain
i have used <unk> brand binders for years ; they always have innovative ideas to organize that keep me coming back this was a new one though ; a built in computer case , binder and lunch kit well , here are the pros and cons - lots of space - the lunch kit is insulated , keeping this cool and or warm until you use them - tons of pockets that are all very helpful - easy to carry around - incredibly large for what it is - hard to set down on tables flat because of the lunch kit on the back other than those two , this is a fantastic product and one that i recommend to anyone
i purchased this for my # yr old grandson they are n't allowed to carry back packs to class so he needed a large binder to carry <unk> and other class needs in it is great he <unk> it he often takes his lunch and is able to keep it in the detachable pack and put it in his locker until lunch time it holes all his books and is easy to carry i would certainly purchase it again also amazon was good to get it shipped as <unk>
this is the best thing i have ever had for <unk> with todays prices i have to save every penny and this binder used with my coupon storage filler pages is so much easier and faster my shopping trip is more efficient and i do n't spend extra time searching for the coupon i need
the best part of this is that each section can be used on it 's own , they each have their own handles and more to facilitate use and portability but you can also velcro the whole thing together ideal for students but really great for anybody because you can use each section separately you wo n't find a better value
i purchased this backpack for my upcoming trip based on the good reviews i wanted a more compact backpack than some of the others out there this solo pack looked like a good fit i received my backpack from amazon , put my # `` dell laptop -lrb- not very heavy , by the way -rrb- in the included sleeve and <unk> it on my shoulders instantly , i heard a pop and the left strap gave way the fabric of the strap had completely torn i checked the other strap and found it to be frayed , moments from giving way if i had n't taken the pack off immediately , it would have simply fallen from my shoulders , dropping to the floor , and probably damaging my laptop in the process i 've requested a replacement pack from amazon ; we 'll see if it 's any better
got one for college , and it tore from very little wear and tear the backpack could barely handle my textbooks , but it does come with a good laptop sleeve got my books soaked on a rainy day anyway , the bag was in <unk> by october , so i replaced it with a jansport with a lifetime warranty and much prefer it
i 've had one of these and it lasted # years and i was very satisfied then i got a second one recently and it already started ripping around the straps seems like they <unk> out on the manufacturing , pretty disappointed i will say the backpack looks very professional
tsa still asked me to extract the laptop from the bag as far as they were <unk> it was not a <unk> backpack it does not unzip fully horizontal i had trouble using the side pockets as they are not very big the rest of the bag was as advertised
i have been using this with my # inch laptop for # years now . it is a bit heavy by itself , but provides good storage and a comfortable fit on the back i 'm a small person # & # # ; and petite so i struggle with too big backpacks this fits me well overall i would recommend this
i use this as a professional backpack i wanted something i could use with a suit when traveling and to bring into a meeting it 's a little heavy with a laptop in it so i use it for ipad and misc stuff the side pockets are weird and i do n't get them because they ca n't hold anything useful
this backpack is perfect for the working professional it has plenty of compartments and secure zippers the special space for your laptop is great as it provides a stable and sturdy storage place for your laptop the construction of the straps make this backpack easy to carry and feel very secure the only con i found with the backpack is that it did n't have a hook for my keys also the pockets inside the front zipper compartment did not have velcro to close them so that change or lose items would not fall out into the compartment itself other than that , this backpack works great
i 'm extremely impressed with this backpack it holds my laptop , several books , all my writing tools , and it still seems lighter than my old messenger bag i 'm having no issues with the straps , they seem sturdy and well sewn , and i love all the zipper compartments - this is so much more organized than having just one large pocket the only drawback is the two side pockets i 'm not quite sure what to use them for although zippered , they 're not big enough for a bottle of water i suppose they might be good for a wallet and car keys , but not much else overall , i would recommend this backpack to anyone looking to easily carry their laptop and accessories
the structure is nice and it is comfortable however the backpack ripped about six inches through a seam that held together the largest compartment within eight months of use i contacted solo and they replaced the bag at no cost immediately great customer service
i bought this because it has a lot of pockets and is better for the back i can store my cords in one and my work <unk> in another so they do n't mess up my papers could be a bit bulk and <unk> to some woman but i like that i do n't forget anything now love all the different compartments
