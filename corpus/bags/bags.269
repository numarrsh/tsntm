this is a great bag it 's a little thin , because it really is just made for laptops which makes the other pockets in the bag very thin , but i love it
this is a great bag , i use it for everyday use , to carry my toshiba thrive tablet and every thing i need for it and all my personal stuff , love , love , love
this laptop/messenger bag offers stylish personality to a type of bag that is usually boring and ugly -lrb- believe me , i did the research -rrb- i 've had mine for almost a year , and although it 's a bit worn in , it still looks great and offers the wonderful versatility of matching every outfit i would n't hesitate to buy it again if/when my current bag needs to be replaced
the case came very fast i got it in # days good quality material fits my macbook pro # . # and has extra space to store my charger for my laptop
my favorite case i love the print , it is unique it is comfortable , adjustable , and functional i love all of the pockets i have a mac book pro and the charger fits perfectly into the pockets the option of adding the strap is also very nice well worth the price it has lasted a year already and i would recommend the purchase to anyone
lots of compliment when i go out and about with it the pocket are not big for bulking power cords so i have to <unk> my power cord in # pieces and use two pockets velcro lose on bottom pocket but i still love this bag perfect for my white sony laptop
honestly it has n't left my house but this is where i stash my chromebook when i 'm not using it what i received is what i expected and i 'm happy with so far
the item is very handy with the tablet i am using it for with all the thing being able to fix with my # . # & # # ; tablet , it make it all easy to carry everything in one carrier it also fit with the keyboard cover with lots of room to place my cords and <unk> for the tablet . lots of pockets for all to fit in places thank you again for the fast shipping
my issues with other laptop sleeves have been - no shoulder straps - no pockets -lrb- who wants to carry the laptop + a tote ? - too expensive -lrb- $ # ? $ # - <unk> one is perfect arrived in great condition and a great value for the price the four pockets are great you can fit the cord , it just depends on how you wrap it and if you keep the extension connected
this bag is absolutely beautiful it gives a vintage kind of feel there are also nice pockets in the front for your phone and other items that you may carry around with you there is enough room in the bag if you want to carry a book or two with you the case can also work as a work bag i carry it to the hospital with me everyday and it works like a charm buy this product !
this bag looks great and has an awesome design , but it didnt last more than # month , i carry my macbook pro everyday and it started to tear apart because it didnt support the laptop 's weight . i dont recommend it if your laptop is as heavy as a macbookpro
this should probably not be listed as a messenger bag since it appears to be suited to only carry a laptop , to that end it is well padded so it should provide decent protection a <unk>
i love this carrying case i 'm a student in college , and this case is n't bulky at all , so it fits easily in my backpack it also has handles , which is a must , in case i just want to bring my laptop to the library the shoulder strap is good quality too it looks just like it does in the picture online , and it protects my laptop from being squished in my bag the only two things i do n't like are that the inside of the bag is n't lined with anything ; it 's just cloth so it 's not particularly soft inside also , the pockets on the outside are velcro , so it 's loud to open and close other than that , i 'm glad i spent the money on this carrying case
my computer <unk> # inches - which according to the info given , should fit into this bag but , it is extremely snug and i am trying to get it to stretch a bit pay close attention to the size of your items before ordering this
i was scared to order this bag since several people said it only came with one loop thingy , but my bag was great i guess it matters who you buy it from i have amazon prime so the one i bought was perfect my macbook pro fits perfectly and i have pockets for all the connections and things that i carry i look forward to using it during the school year
my daughter loves this bag it has several compartments and holds not only a laptop , ipad and cell so it makes a wonderful in flight travel bag the colors are vibrant and the bag is constructed very well shipped on time ... for xmas ! !
when i read the reviews , i was little scare to order this bag , but because the style and the size was exactly what i was looking for so when i got it , i was really happy with the material and style it has light padding , it 's very light weight , with all extra pockets and does n't feel bulky at all it fits my # `` fujitsu , wireless mouse , power cord , & web cam i love the print , it 's unique , i ca n't find anything like this in any store
great quality for the value lots of storage great travel bag holds my british umbrella i just love this bag i get many compliments it has a pocket <unk> for everything now i have my british phone case , laptop case and umbrella !
took this on a trip to both <unk> with a new asus # e # . # `` netbook perfect for times you do n't need a heavier case outside pocket fits the power supply and nano travel mouse seems well made and i like orange so there you have it
this fits my # `` samsung n # just fine , and the exterior pocket is great for the power adapter i also tried it with my friend 's acer netbook and it also fit very well , so i think it would work with just about any # `` netbook the zipper pulls are actually better on this model than on the larger laptop sleeve -lrb- which i also own -rrb- this accessory makes it easy to travel with the <unk>
the roocase is exactly what i expected and the quality is good it can be a bit tight when a mouse and power cord are stuffed in the front pocket , but it works fine .
bought this for my # . # & # # ; notepad ; it fits nicely in this case with room to spare this case is soft and good looking ; it comes in several colors and i chose the <unk> orange color the two zippers work smoothly with a dual zipper on the main compartment i use the outside pocket to store my charger on the inside of the main storage area are two plastic pockets intended for memory cards i use them for soft cloths to clean the screen my preference is to face the <unk> screen away from the plastic pockets just to avoid any chance of scratching for the money you ca n't beat this deal
this product is wonderful and so are the people who sold it i had problems with the mailing service but the buyer was <unk> and <unk> me all the way through the new shipping now it has arrived and i 'm loving it my notebook fits <unk> and the outside pockets are perfect for usb cords or other accessaries , while inside i can keep my memory cards thank you so
this bag is of horrible quality it has twice failed dropping my macbook first to the ground . . then down a stairwell the strap has failed . . the clasps have failed . . and i watched my work tumble down a stairwell now i have to replace a relatively new purchase . . thought i might be able to save someone else the trouble
its only been a few months and i am already being forced to look for a new bag the bag is beginning to & # # ; thread & # # ; , i.e . threads coming out from all over the place , sometimes getting caught in the zipper and becoming a hassle i would not recommend this bag
great backpack , big enough to hold a # `` laptop and small enough to put under your airplane seat single strap is great with plenty of <unk> for small items there are bigger backpacks for students -lrb- if you need to carry large heavy books -rrb- but this is the perfect size for on the go , sling on one shoulder and go well built as well
good delivery delay and services , this product got a good quality and it 's really <unk> perfect to travel -lrb- reason why i bought it -rrb- and most important fit perfectly my new toshiba ultrabook # . # ``
the material is superior for portable use and it fits like a glove , i am using this bag as a back up , it can pack the power adapter and small wireless mouse but very tight this bag is very useful for people on the go
great product , light and functional , i miss the compartments with zipper so that multiple small accessories are not <unk> around in the bag , but nothing a couple of ziplock bags ca n't fix
this was an updated version of the sling pack that originally came out # years ago i liked the original one better as they made some changes on this one that seemed like it lowered the quality overall the zippers feel cheaper the materials for pockets feel cheaper even the <unk> feels cheaper i still like it the design and am happy with the purchase , but i would have paid twice as much for the original
for any designer with its own # `` apple macbook pro the bags such like this are useful although is somehow hard to carry around more than # kg on the back this incase pack is my portable office and i can work <unk> and visit a client with my `` office `` on my back
this was a nice looking case and the price was right , but it was very poorly made when it arrived the front zipper was broken , and another zipper was not zipping properly i had to return it i bought a case logic case to replace it and am very pleased with it
an awesome bag ... until the strap broke as i was rushing to class a real bummer i fixed it with safety pins because i do n't have time to sew it otherwise , a perfect bag
there are some things i really like about this bag if fits my # . # inch ultrabook very well , has plenty of pockets for storage , it 's attractive -- nice deep brown color -- and looks more like a purse than a laptop case one of the straps has come unsewn , but i think i can repair it myself it 's a shame i have to , though just keep in mind the quality is n't the best , and might be more tolerable if the price was lower
when i received this product , it looked pretty good after further inspection , i realized that it had a broken zipper on it otherwise , i love it lots of pockets and nice sturdy build
all i can say is that i love love love this carrying case for my # & # # ; macbook air stylish and a perfect fit seriously , it could double as a carrying case and as a purse i might buy another one in a different color i highly recommend this case
an attractive bag with plenty of room for your accessories this is made for a # inch laptop , but my laptop is # inch , and fits great i 'm very pleased with this bag
i bought this as a gift for my sister she thinks its nice and it looks cool i think its a piece of crap you have to stretch it on over the laptop like a rubber glove that 's too small there is no padding to this thing , its just a cover with no pockets for even a power cord the slightest bump would dent or break your computer definitely not worth twenty bucks guess i 'll buy her an amazonbasics case and she can put the whole thing inside really disappointed with this purchase
this would be a near perfect bag if the handles were on the outside of the bag why on earth would anyone put the handles on the inside there is no way to zip the bag closed and use the handles the only way to use this is by attaching the shoulder strap to the rings on the outside so what is the point of the short handles this is a major design flaw also , as another reviewer said - it stinks of chemicals ! ! this is definitely not the quality i am accustomed to , nor is it anywhere near the quality of other cases -lrb- for kindles i have bought from the same company in the same design i am very disappointed and will probably send this back
it is nice design , but i was expecting it to be a little more <unk> very <unk> made and i 'd not trust carrying my laptop in this bag if my hands are full and i ca n't secure the bag
actually this is a really nice case and i use it <unk> and i encourage you to but on the only part i dislike is it should had been thicker cause it 's kinda
a good buy very attractive and so far it seems durable my only complaint is that the handles are stitched inside the sleeve so if you need to use them you can not close the zipper which leave your laptop vulnerable to falling
pretty nice bag the only problem i see is it stinks pretty bad when you first open it the smell started hurting my head other then that it 's a pretty good bag
this bag was n't what i had in mind when i bought it -lrb- my fault -rrb- but i like it it 's pretty , lightweight and my laptop slips in and out easily it is slightly stretchy so the charger cord can fit in the bag but there is really no good place to keep it besides right with the laptop
i purchased this item to match the laptop skin for my daughters laptop she is eight so the fact that it matches was a big hit ! it serves its purpose ... with style
got this for a high school student with new laptop the student has to move around place to place and this was a sure way to have her <unk> the laptop if it was a bulky black bag , she would have never used it color was perfect
the sleeve looks exactly the way it does online it was exactly what i wanted except that it did n't have the long strap that is displayed in the picture but i did n't mind too much
this bag provides nice protection for my computer , i 'm not crazy about having to leave the zipper open slightly when using the small hideaway handles but other than that it 's great
i did think the bag would have a pocket or two which it does not , but it works for my needs for now next time i will read the description more thoroughly
i really like this bag it 's pretty and well padded the only disappointment was that it 's not big enough to fit the cords in as well good for a short day trip
i chose this bag because it was both pretty and lightweight it was exactly what i was looking for most carrying cases for laptops are bulky and heavy , since i am a senior , i prefer something lighter with a feminine touch
since both of my granddaughters were getting laptops for christmas , i bought them each a bag and wireless mouse but did n't want them to be alike the granddaughter that loves pinks and purples loved this
the seller shipped really quick i rec 'd an email the same day i ordered that the item shipped i was looking for a sleeve in stores that was cute and that would fit my # . # `` hp laptop ... could n't find anything in the stores and this is exactly what i was looking for there was a bit of an odor to the product when i opened the package but i assume that is from the screen printing <unk> , it has already faded quite a bit my # . # `` fits snuggly in the width and i have a few inches to spare at the top of the sleeve ... great bag !
love my carrier i do not have <unk> with the handles like others have mentioned . it does the job while protect your laptop to and from no its not the kind of case where you can toss laptop in the back seat if in a hurry and know the laptop will be padded . . its not a padded case . . its light use
great product my <unk> loves it , the design and she loves the detachable shoulder <unk> the butterflies . and thank you the case arrived right on time very speedy . thank
i have bought other cases like this before and was happy with it but this thing is horrid the packaging was stupid my case was exposed when i received it in the mail the thin bag they sent it in ripped put more padding on it would you after applying it to my macbook i noticed it clicked in the back every time i opened it i had to break of a piece and sand it down to get rid of the clicking after a month having it i noticed the fishing is starting to rub off in areas and looks odd and dirty
this <unk> different from all other cases it is n't see-through so when you put the case on the macbook pro looks completely red , like it went through <unk> or something it does n't really add to much bulk to the computer and the case is n't too heavy for the lid aka the screen does n't shut because of the weight of the lid however , when left on the computer , it leaves a tough to clean residue
fits my macbook pro # . # `` -lrb- version # -rrb- perfectly the cover does however cover the apple logo there is n't a circle cut out which actually not having the circle cut out looks way better my only issue is that the bottom piece has a somewhat sharp edge where it over hangs the key pad area so it can get a little uncomfortable but overall i 'm very pleased
it fit well with my computer and lasted about a year because it is hard plastic , it cracks and breaks when it has fallen a few times , but it does a great job protecting the computer love the color
i bought this around a month ago - it 's a really great case it 's a very cool transparent green my old case protected fine , but did n't look as good and was very heavy after buying the top case i ca n't picture buying anything else
i ordered the `` topcase black hard cover case `` for my macbook pro # inch . . and i love it does n't get in the way at all - screen opens all the way - -lrb- unlike cheaper hard cover brands -rrb- shipped on time , nicely packaged * # stars
the color on this case is perfection it is a little unusual , but still very calming and pleasing the circle for the lit up apple is key i got this cover to keep the gorgeous surface of my macbook pristine it works for me it also makes my macbook feel much more personal it has been about # months since i bought this and installed it , and i am very happy with the purchase
this is a little too big for my # `` toshiba m # and too small if i have the # -cell <unk> battery pack on the laptop other than it not fitting properly , it seems to be made very well for the $ # i paid for it item was in its own plastic bag in the amazon box with a few other items only # stars for it being too big for my toshiba # inch laptop , then too small for it with the # -cell battery
good choice for business occasion but i think it is more fit for laptops of business use such as thinkpad t # <unk> , or dell latitude # <unk> as to my dell xps # , it is a bit tight you do n't have to care that this case is made for toshiba because the <unk> of toshiba on the case is quite small and dark
this toshiba laptop sleeve will protect other <unk> of its screen size -lrb- ! # inch -rrb- quite well i have been using with my dell inspiron # z and have found it to offer better cushioning than the neoprene # . # inch sleeve that i had purchased for it
my large wacom tablet and pen fit perfectly within this sleeve it 's a fraction of the price for flimsier neoprene sleeves or the wacom branded accessories and yet it is sturdier so i know my tablet wont get scratched or cracked if something gets set on top of it also keeps dust off the tablet , the main reason i purchased the sleeve
great buy ! ! much better made then i even thought it would be and for under $ # . # i would n't think twice about buying it again ... its worth at least double what i paid
sleeve for # `` toshiba - black `` very good price product was perfect for my needs the sleeve gives me added protection inside my standard laptop case and offers the convenience of protecting my computer when i do n't have to lug my standard case into a meeting the flap closes via a magnetic closure and the rigidity of the case makes it perfect to carry as a folio
this bag would be great , if it were n't so big i recommend opting for the small version i ordered this one fearing the small would be too small this is at least two inches taller and wider than a normal bag which makes it very awkward on your back other than the size it is a really well put together bag with really a nice pocket layout
it 's really really big -lrb- and a little heavy when empty -rrb- the design is probably not very impressive , but it is very well made there 's many pockets and the overall quality is just great fits any # `` laptop + an ipad really easily the included waterproof cover is also great if you know it 's big and you know how it looks , go ahead and buy it , you wo n't regret it
this backpack is the # rd stm product i own i also have two messenger style bags this particular backpack has several compartments which helps me keep my computer and cables are nice and organized the laptop compartment is padded and plush lined , and is located right in the middle of the backpack while my messenger bags have had no problem , after a year of use the velcro inside the laptop compartment that keeps that section <unk> eventually lost its stick i spoke with stm and they offered to send me a free replacement as part of their limited lifetime warranty between their warranty , and the quality of the products , i would definitely buy stm again
i purchased this backpack as my old messenger bag was starting to wear down my shoulder it 's perfect for carrying my macbook pro and books back and forth to school everyday the laptop section is brilliant and fits my # `` laptop well the pocket just outside it -lrb- i think intended for an ipad -rrb- makes a good space to store my coiled up powercord i think some people have commented on the rather large size of the bag i 'm # ' # `` , and i have no problem with its size or the way that it sits on my back however , i can see how some people might be <unk> by its bulk if you 're looking for a solid backpack to haul all your many things around places , than i would highly recommend this oh , and the the rain cover that it comes with works well too
i loved the purple color of this bag , but am returning it it just did n't seem to have enough padding to protect my computer very well i like the fact that the bag opens instead of having to slip the laptop through a <unk> opening , but there just really was n't much padding it also had a divider strip that could section the compartment into sections it too , did n't seems stable i 've had this in other bags before , and the one in this bag just was n't as sturdy as those and seemed to flop over i decided to return the bag and look for one that is more sturdy -lrb- and probably more pricey -rrb- so my laptop is adequately protected
the <unk> and space of the back is great the first time i used it was to carry my laptop on the plane for a trip and both zipper puller <unk> came off ! ! i was very <unk> -lsb- -lsb- pointed about that the rings that attached the zipper puller charm were not closed all the way so they cam off
i would have loved this bag but the color is not a true purple like the ad shows it 's more of a <unk> purple nice bag , good features if you 're not as picky about the shade of purple i 'd still recommend it
when i receive this item , it had a huge <unk> in the back of it it looked like when someone took it out of their shipping box to send it to me , it was cut with an utility knife however , i sent it back for a full refund
the first one that was sent was sent quickly but in the wrong color -lrb- i received white instead of purple -rrb- they replaced it with the right one , but two zipper tags tore off within a week or two i have to grab the short zipper <unk> to open and close it because i did n't want to go through the replacement process
i think i was expecting it to have a bit more padding for protection of the computer , however , there was very little overall , it was a nice bag , a gift for my wife , which she thought was fabulous the price point is good , for a basic bag in an unusual color -lrb- most important factor in making this choice -rrb-
my particular bag had a small flaw in it , but that 's just mine -lrb- i hope -rrb- if i did n't have the laptop stand to carry as well , i 'm not sure it would work for a laptop as skinny as mine it barely holds as is otherwise it 's great
the only negative i have with this bag is the velcro strap inside the case it 's purpose is to secure the laptop and keep it stable if you accidentally turn the bag over , you laptop is supposed to be somewhat secure the velcro is weak all the pockets are great for keeping cords , folders , etc . my hp laptop is almost the identical color as the bag it looks like it was custom made for it ! ! !
purple has been my favorite color for nearly # years and it 's everywhere in my house so when shopping for a laptop bag this one was at the top of my list the color is deep and vibrant and i love it it 's got a decent set of pockets and it 's lightweight enough that adding a laptop does n't hurt your shoulder too much it seems well made and not cheap or flimsy and it holds its shape for easy use however , i just do n't think there 's enough padding to protect the laptop my last bag had padding on all sides of the laptop compartment -lrb- cover flap included -rrb- and it felt more secure
in reality this briefcase is lighter purple than in the photos here it is <unk> girly purple not a deep dark manly purple i was expecting but it is purple nonetheless and a great case with good organizational pockets and not too much padding so u can stuff a lot of gadgets in with it and it is not too thick medium build quality but for as often as i use it it will last me a decade i love it
fits my # . # & # # ; asus laptop very nicely there is one velcro strap to secure on the inside i feel the padding is adequate construction seems sturdy i anticipate it will last a long time the outside compartment is big enough to hold a binder or two and there are <unk> pockets on the inside the depth of it is a few inches so you can also store notebooks on the inside with the laptop the picture is accurate color is deep purple
i am happy with this bag it fits my # . # inch laptop , wires and miscellaneous items like that it also includes a shoulder strap bag seems to be sturdy and made well i would highly recommend it , especially for the price
i chose this bag as it is just ideal for my <unk> book my only wish is the choice of colors , i did not like either though i did order the purple , but everything about the bag otherwise is great i really like it
this bag is great for transporting a laptop and the contents of my purse since we can only have # carry-on bags on some flights without paying extra , i use this bag for my laptop and the other things i need the velcro pocket is perfect for my wallet , keys , ect
this is a very nice laptop case it 's very light weight but works well for our use not a lot of padding but enough for home use the purple color is unique and my wife likes
i would have rated it a # . # if the option existed only because there could be a little more padding to protect the contents other than that , it is a great bag it is sturdy construction , nice color , and the perfect size for a # inch laptop
this was a perfect fit for my widescreen # . # `` acer it 's also deep enough to accomodate my cooling pad and all my cords when i travel the extra pockets are perfect for files and papers i 've already had one friend order one and several others have commented on it
i really like this case because it has done it 's job in protecting my computer has enough storage space and was not hard on the pocketbook the color suits me just fine as i can tell the difference between my laptop and my husbands at a glance i have not carried it around much so i am not sure of how durable the handles and straps are , but when you have and expensive item in a case you should always tote with care
case holds a # . # laptop nice and snug for the price and quality it ca n't be beat i liked it so much i reordered it for my other student in green nice front flap for adding a notebook or pens so they do n't have to carry this and a book bag sturdy zippers with pockets in the main compartment we placed the velcro removable partition for storing the charger at the bottom of the case for additional padding as the notebook took up all the room the color is a rich purple , just a tad <unk> than the picture but not gaudy
just got a new laptop and wanted to make sure it was protected when in transit since its purple , i wanted a purple bag and this meets all the requirements and then some the best part was that i got it # days after ordering will look for items from this vendor in my future needs
this bag was ideal for me mainly because it had the shoulder strap that i really needed the color was not as vibrant as i would have liked ; however , it is fine i also ordered a purple remote mouse to match great bag and a reasonable price
i love this case and it does fit a # . # in laptop snuggly i think the color is perfect , almost the exact same color pictured definitely could be used for a male or a female
i needed a fashionable yet functional bag to hold my laptop not only does it hold my laptop but stationary materials for just in case it feels like it can hold
purchased a # & # # ; lap top and plan to travel with it it fits perfectly with all the & # # ; necessaries & # # ; it needs to hook up ... wires , battery , mouse , etc . it even has room to take along extra games or paperwork and a & # # ; fan & # # ; to keep her running cool
this bag is the perfect size for my # & # # ; dell computer the side pocket is large and easily holds the charger having the optional shoulder strap is great because it 's easier to carry this way color is as shown and the fabric seems hardy , as if it will last a long time it arrived quickly
bought this bag for myself after i got tired of using a laptop bag that said it was big enough for a # `` laptop , even though it clearly was n't that said , i am super pleased with this bag - plenty of room for my # `` macbook pro but not enough space that it 's bouncing around everywhere it also has plenty of extra storage space without being bulky - extra bonus , do n't have to carry a purse to work because lets face it , purses are annoying there are also a few people that mentioned a different colored product that the image , but my bag is pretty true to its advertised color - a medium plum
the item purchased , notebook case , was as advertised and was promptly shipped and received in great condition at our home we are completely satisfied with the service , product quality and shipping time
this laptop bag is made with great quality at such a great price , i was worried it would be flimsy and not made well i was surprised to receive this item to find it was a high quality product well worth the money
