i 'm giving it # stars because the bag is supposed to come with a shoulder strap , but i did n't get it i tried to check if it was possible to get the shoulder strap without returning the bag but it did n't apply because the seller is fulfilled by amazon -lsb- ? -rsb- and if i decide to return it i just get half of the price i payed doesnt make sense the bag is a bit heavy but i still like it for my # ' # notebook i 'm a petite woman so even though this bag is kind of big it doesnt look too big for a short women like me anyway , it 's a <unk> sweet purchase because i do like the bag but now i have to get my own shoulder strap it 's the second time i buy from amazon and an item is missing in my order
no padding and the strap broke right after i started using it it makes a nice purse , but it will not stand up to constant use and is definitely not something i would trust my laptop in
i bought this for my wife so she can transport files from home to work , work to home so far , she likes it it is feminine enough and sturdy i got lucky and she likes it
nicely done for the price the product mimics a much <unk> bag very well my other school/work bags are leather and this one rates right with them i needed a professional bag for school -lrb- post grad -rrb- and work i holds my netbook + accessories , a couple paper back texts , files and personal accessories and still zips i am very happy with the product , however i am sad to see the brown croc is no longer available as i would have purchased it also
this bag is perfect for necessities i can fit my ipad , phone , key , some minimum personal items my bag is never full of clutter and never liked big bags it which one can loose things it 's very professional , <unk> the handles can be laid to the side which makes for easy removal of the contents
very , very nice i bought the gray my extremely <unk> teenage daughter immediately tried to take it away from me i have yet to try my mac pro in it but it will certainly take my ipad plus more without losing it 's classic stream lined look the packaging was outstanding and it arrived here very fast with the always impressive amazon prime
i give it # stars all the way around style , quality i will be buying one in every color one a month i am so pleased with the ` faux ' leather it is <unk> -lrb- i do not purchase items made of <unk> .
i have really enjoyed owning this bag it is beautiful and durable & # # ; i 'm able to fit a lot of things inside of it it is perfect for taking to work on a daily basis , and looking really nice at conferences
the bag arrived fast and with no complications , like you would expect with amazon upon opening it , i was surprised at the quality and overall appearance the bag definitely looks and feels more expensive than it was it is on the small size , but to transport documents and carry personal items -lrb- cell phone , wallet , keys , etc -rrb- it is perfect
i originally planned to use this bag for my # `` apple computer but like it so much i decided to make it my everyday purse i get so many great compliments on it thinking of buying another one i bought the multi color croc -lrb- very classy -rrb-
regardless of whether or not you own a mini laptop , this bag is a must-have its crisp lines and <unk> hardware give it a vintage feel -- this is every bit as classy as the <unk> kelly bag that i will never be able to afford speaking of price , it 's worth every penny of the # $ i paid for it the bag sports excellent workmanship -- the handles are actually riveted in , rather than just glued the bag even comes in a protective bag of its own -- always a sign of quality i hope to enjoy this bag for many , many years
i bought this bag for a small laptop carrying case it is a gorgeous bag and i wish it was either a little bigger ; so i could use it for a regular sized laptop or a little smaller ; so i can use it as a purse i have read the other reviews on how the bag is small , but i wanted to try it anyway because it is so beautiful i ended up having to return it because it is about half an inch too short and the zipper wo n't close with my laptop in it
this is a sturdy well-made <unk> it holds everything i need and it 's stylish i use the bag for work and for every day use i simply throw a wristlet with all my necessities in the bag for when i shop and run errands
i was a little skeptical about whether this bag would fit my macbook , but it does but please be warned that you will probably not have room for much else because it is a compact bag otherwise very stylish and classy
i use this as a purse and it always gets great comments it looks very expensive this has become my favorite dress purse the compartments are just enough for anything i need to place in the purse i guess i could use it as a laptop bag -lrb- it does come with a space just for one -rrb- but i really love how attractive it is with all my outfits
reading some of these reviews , i was confused if it would fit my macbook pro # & # # ; that i purchased in spring # let me just say , it fits my computer perfectly it is snug and the detail is exactly like the discription says if you have a # & # # ; macbook , it will fit , or if you have a smaller computer , it will fit that as well but may move around a bit
this is a great product the quality and protection is here this laptop sleeve is attractive and has received many compliments i am interested in seeing what else civilian sells
this sleeve is well built and i have every confidence that it will keep my ultrabook safe in my bag it also looks very convincing and i have received quite a few comments about it when i pull it out at meetings
i bought this for my # in macbook pro retina as i 'd had previous experience of this case with an mbp # in the case is well padded with a non scratch interior the case closes with both velcro fasteners and a string device just like a real manilla envelope it does however , add a fair bit of size to the dimensions of your machine and if that 's a problem then the incase neoprene sleeve also sold by amazon might be a better option for you i said classy in the review <unk> , without exception , everyone that has seen it and realised it 's a leather case has commented on how much they like it and how unusual it is i have n't actually seen anyone else with this case so if you want something unusual , effective and at a reasonable price , buy it , you wo n't be disappointed
we ordered this for our son to replace what he was currently using he loves it he travels a lot with his business and it is perfect for his small pieces of equipment check him out at <unk> .
the bag itself is well made and easily accessible when open setting open on a desk everything is just a grab away the gripe i have with the bag it that it is deceptively advertised to hold a standard file folder the photos show file folders to fit inside the bag they will not amazon should pull the photos showing the open bag because they do not truthfully show the bags potential it is false advertising to show these photos i had been looking for a small bag just big enough to hold my netbook and a couple of file folders this is not it
i was so excited to get a netbook case that would let me get through airport security without having to dig my little computer out of my <unk> approved bag but there 's little point to a case like that if it wo n't also hold a few things i need in my carry-on , like the documents i use while working on my computer text and images submitted by solo imply that the bag will hold things that are # `` wide -lrb- things such as the red <unk> folder they show popping out of the top -rrb- but my magazines are # . # `` x # `` , and so are the <unk> manila folders i carry all my work around in neither fit -- the width of the pockets are just shy of # `` . my other issue with the bag is how heavy it is part of what i wanted in a netbook was a machine that was really lightweight , but this bag adds another # lbs . without adding a lot of storage space if you have little else to carry -lrb- a small paperback , your cell phone , perhaps some reading glasses and nothing more ! -rrb- and do n't mind the extra weight , this is a well-made little case
despite the very nice appearance of this very well-made bag , it 's not as useful for my purposes as i would like it to be all the fabric , padding , straps , compartments actually add extra bulk in places where it 's not needed , which makes it heavy for its size and reduces the internal space of the compartments and pockets since my purpose in owning a lightweight netbook is portability in size and weight , it does n't make a lot of sense to add weight and bulk without <unk> a lot of storage capacity the <unk> styling could be improved i can see myself in an airport security line flipping it open , only to have all the small accessories go spilling over the conveyor belt because the compartments are not secured well so this is not the best choice for a woman who wants a messenger bag with enough room to also carry personal items
the quality of this bag is excellent the folding feature for air flight makes it too bulky for my taste i found another bag that works best at a retail store
this is a very well built case the size is just right for netbook computers , and it expands to hold a lot of stuff but it has a major design drawback that you need to be aware of before you buy the front compartment sides do not go up to the top of the case cover -lrb- the computer compartment sides do go to the top -rrb- there is a # / # to # inch gap on the sides to the top if you left the case on its side , small things could fall out and get lost i 'm going to have long velcro straps sewn in to act as covers over the front compartments , preventing things from falling out if it was n't for this problem , i 'd give the case # stars
this is a great case as others have reviewed should note that there are two different versions of this case one has metal hardware -lrb- shoulder strap clasps and side hooks on the case itself -rrb- and the other has plastic hardware i have both versions by far , the metal is more durable , will last longer and simply looks better on the case i removed one star because of the plastic hardware i recommend to try to get the case with metal hardware
this case is intended for the no frills , light traveller <unk> <unk> would give this messenger bag his blessing plenty of room -lrb- for its size -rrb- & well designed compartments make this small but usefull mini-notebook case a winner construction is superb and the fabric is thick & strong the side pocket holds all the pc accessories i need on the road : mouse , ac power , cord , rj # cable two front pockets fit a # x # notebook , daytimer , small calculator , <unk> , pen , reading light , even a small paperback it lacks a water bottle compartment but that can be improvised last , it is a breeze to go through airport security as pc access is via a flip of the cover
this is a great bag to carry not only your new mini laptop , but all the accessories you may want the bag also allows an airport check without taking it out of the bag handy for travelers
i purchased this bag for my toshiba nb # netbook it is a perfect fit i also like the fact that you do n't have to take it out of the bag when you go thru airport security it is not large , so it keeps me from packing it too heavy it has enough room for about # cd 's a memory stick a couple of file folders my hand written date book -lrb- yes i keep one of these too -rrb- and some business cards it has a special compartment for an extra battery or the power cables i would <unk> recommend this product it feels secure and of good quality
after <unk> the net for a bag that would fit my asus # ha netbook , i finally settled for this one it fits my # . # `` netbook just fine it 's actually a perfect fit there is a small compartment that can be opened via a zipper on the side of this case for your ac adapter it can hold anything , but it seems more geared for the ac adapter because the opening is sorta small but there 's plenty of room inside the bag does n't always hold its balance very well when sitting on a flat surface , so i tend to either lean it against a wall or just lay it on the side there are an additional two compartments for misc . stuff one you open up the bag , aside from the one that holds the netbook and the one that holds the ac adapter this netbook is not big enough to hold a spiral notebook or anything more than # `` in length i was hoping i could stick my spiral notebook , which i use for <unk> , but it does n't fit
i wanted a bag that could hold my netbook <unk> and some tools , paperwork and accessories for work the manages to carry everything i need to keep me going for a whole workday , i would highly recommend this bag to anyone who does not need to carry many large , <unk> and bulky items throughout their day
when i opened the box containing the solo tech collection i knew instantly that this bag was just what i needed out of the box i was already filling my solo case with the special equipment i carry for medical needs everything fit perfectly not only did it fit perfectly , it was made with high quality material that i knew would last for a long time the & # # ; solo tech collection mini <unk> airport security-friendly case & # # ; is exactly as described it arrived exactly as promised the quality and price are outstanding -lrb- with all <unk> i would recommend that you check the bag dimensions against what you plan to carry . i never had a solo case before but i plan to purchase only solo products in the future
i recently began using an hp mini netbook , and bought the solo case for it i carry the computer , mouse pad , wireless mouse , power supply with cord , small surge protector , two flash drives , small notebook , and a pen , with room to spare the case is compact , convenient , and durable , fitting my needs perfectly i do n't need a complete computing station , but rather a <unk> word processor and a simple photo processor this package gives me these , and it looks as if solo designed the case for me personally
my main purpose in wanting a bag was for protection i believe this bag will do just that there is plenty of room for all i want to carry it will be interesting to see how it works with the nine cell battery attached works fine with the # cell quick delivery and good packaging
this is the perfect netbook case , the # # reason for me having a netbook is to eliminate bulk and weight when traveling for those who complain about lack of storage space i would say buy a bigger case this bag holds my asus # he securely and has plenty of room for the odds and ends i need when traveling
it is a quality bag and renders excellent protection for my laptop however , the manner in which the top part of the cover should stay attached to the laptop when the computer is open for use is not very practical the corners constantly slide off i grew tired of its poor fit what good is it if it does not fit properly more trouble than its worth
the package label clearly said it was for a # `` computer it fits loosely and i hate it . returning would cost more than its worth so <unk> it it fits very loose i have a # . # `` notebook
i bought this for my thinkpad t # , which is bulky , and the charging cable made the fit too tight it 's a good concept for charging but did n't work in the real world
a good little case for a quick zip and protect , but once you open it up , it realy does n't stay on all that well but i bought it for my two boys and it offers a little more protection than what they usually afford when tossing around their laptops
i hate to keep beating a dead horse , but like many others have said the sleeve simply does n't fit ... it 's too big instead of a nice snug fit , it fits loosely i think this sleeve is designed for <unk> type laptops for those who own wide-screen type laptops -lrb- i own a # . # -inch hp pavillion dv # laptop -rrb- , this is not the sleeve for you i have an old # . # inch toshiba laptop that is not a wide-screen type , and it fits much better the build quality of the product is very good ... that 's why it got # -stars buyers should be *** warned *** to measure your laptop accurately and compare it to the dimensions of the product before you purchase it i do n't think that most newer # . # -inch laptops will fit properly for that reason , i ca n't recommend it
i recently used this for my laptop on a long trip to india it was so convenient not to have to take it out of the case to go through security at the airport it is sturdy and protected my laptop i like the special grip
this has been a very durable and functional case it has taken a lot of wear and still looks and works great the zipper is very smooth , and never hangs up
i can see no use for this item it covers the fans -- no laptop design could breathe in this thing you can not connect the power supply -- their picture is silly with a basic cord hanging out the back you ca n't get the power supply in it so what 's the point you could n't use the laptop with sleeve on -- even on battery because there is no way to <unk> the heat well , for the price i 'll keep it as a protective cover i guess still , that means removing the thing to use the laptop no use what-so-ever
it was too big and could n't fit my # . # inch sony vaio i looked at the other reviews before i bought it and thought that it might fit mine , however i <unk> the size of this definitely should make measurements before buying this
i wanted to keep the case of my stainless steel hp laptop scratch free i have the # in monitor and found it difficult to find a case online that would fit a larger screen because of the other reviews on this product <unk> the fit i went with the solo tech yes it fits but the fit is loose and it looks cheesy
i purchased this # inch laptop sleeve for my new toshiba <unk> # inch laptop and it does not fit it is too small the solo laptop sleeve would be great if my laptop was only a # inch screen
my laptop is a # . # inch , a little more than preferred for a # inch sleeve , but i figured it would provide with a more <unk> fit closed , the sleeve does a good job of protecting the computer , but it was a bit loose ; i 'm concerned for the # inch customer this product advertises for most awkwardly is the `` <unk> `` feature solo boasts , the flaps that are supposed to keep your laptop secure as you keep the sleeve on with the laptop open , the corner flaps barely hold onto my # . # inch , off-putting my expectations and excitement for the product overall , the sleeve works well with the laptop closed , but as it is on and operating , the corner secures are lack luster , and may even simply fall off of your # inch
works well enough my toshiba satellite # `` just barely fits the stretchable fabric that holds the case to the screen side of the computer does n't hold well this case works better as a slipcase i did n't have to open up the case when going through security at the airport
the biggest problem i have with this is that my laptop just do not fit entirely into this sleeve when i try to zip it up i have a lenovo y # `` laptop i had to stretch the sleeve a bit i guess its size is not an umbrella cover for all # `` screens however , i keep it on all the time and so far i do n't have any heating problem overall , i will rate this product good enough
i was looking for a light weight case or sleeve for my laptop this one fit the bill exactly it is very streamline and does not add any weight to the laptop easy to carry around
i have a hp <unk> <unk> # i read another review about a similar model fitting , so i gave it a shot i opened the package and found that it was very easy to install i found that the sleeve was actually larger than my computer so i guess it would fit something bigger than my # inch laptop that is the only reason for me not giving it # stars i thought it would be a little more snug , but overall i am satisfied
i love this sleeve it 's slightly too big for my # `` hp entertainment dv # , but i prefer this to it being too small plus , it 's not too <unk> it has a good access for the cords since i leave it plugged in mostly , and since i leave my computer often on my kitchen table , and this sleeve protects it from dust , etc . in addition , the computer does n't get hot , so i do n't have to worry about that i 'd much rather have this than a `` skin . the only reason i gave it a # instead of a # is because it only comes in black ... how boring
it is everything i was hoping it would be it 's nice and cushiony , providing the perfect amount of protection at all times the opening in the back and the flaps that hang over the corners of the laptop allow for me to keep it on for any and everything that i need it for it 's a high quality , <unk> black product that i would highly recommend for any laptop owner my only complaint is that i wish it fit more snug onto my laptop
this laptop sleeve does exactly what i need it to : protect my laptop from sliding around in my backpack the only drawback is that my # . # `` hp practically swims in it because it 's so big but when it 's tucked tightly away in my backpack , the confined space prevents it from moving around so much i have n't used it in an airport setting yet , but i 'm pretty sure it would get that job done , too
this <unk> laptop sleeve is excellent just unzip it to go through airport security , the sleeve stays on my only complaint is that the access to the input cords is on the back and my laptop has the connections on the side otherwise i love it
love the solo laptop sleeve easy to use ... came quickly when it was ordered and in brand new shape as advertised husband is happy with his also glad i bought it
this laptop sleeve is a perfect one for my # . # `` laptop during my research for laptop sleeve and reading the review for this specific sleeve , i read a review that a # . # `` laptop it <unk> fit well it fits and it has a plenty of space for other <unk> to fit inside i love this sleeve
i love how you can use the computer while it 's in the case that 's actually what i use mine for , i strap my laptop in when using it at <unk> as i fall asleep with the computer on my chest and sometimes it crashes to the floor the laptop sleeve has so far provided good protective armor and kept my laptop intact
item is of excellent material well constructed , design well thought out for laptop , price of $ # . # was the best price i found on the internet and shipped <unk> deal highly recommend this for any and all laptop for protecting laptop from foreign <unk>
this sleeve is incredibly low priced , great quality i keep my laptop brand new by having it on almost all the time it stays on , my laptop is an # `` toshiba satelite
i got ta admit , it fits nicely however there are certain aspects i did not consider before buying this case although it fits , it adds a lot of thickness to a notebook that is notable for being thin and sexy if you press down on the plastic cover , you will realize that there is a bit of space between the cover and the notebook it causes your macbook to heat up quickly i sometimes have to take off the bottom cover so that my macbook can cool down a bit although there is a vent for the macbook , it just does n't work in the same manner if the aluminum shell is on a surface remember , overheating on the laptop can cause damages to the battery
i tolerate my speck case it does n't quite fit so it lets a good deal of dust and debris in under the plastic which results in forced frequent cleaning else i suffer scratches -lrb- did n't i get the shell to help prevent scratches ? ! it 's so loose that one of the clips -lrb- the one near the power button -rrb- does n't even stay on the majority of the time meaning that much more <unk> now granted for under $ # it 's not as bad as it could be , but i still feel that i paid hard earned money for a product that was specifically designed for my machine it should fit ! my advice : buy this one to tide you over <unk> <unk> makes a unibody case i had that for my black macbook = love . : : sigh :
even though the case came slightly damaged , the costumer service team is great they helped me to make sure i was completely satisfied i would definitely order from this company again
the aqua cover looks nice and fits the new -lrb- july # -rrb- mac book pro # `` but you can not use a kensington lock with the cover the cut out for the dvd slot is too short so it covers the hole for the lock so , now we are faced with either using the top cover alone or using a dremel to make the cut out on the right side longer
this case is very nice , but not only does it look a bit fragile , but please keep in mind that this is for the new macbook i have the model from about a year ago and ordered this case , and it does n't fit at all do n't make the same mistake and make sure you have a compatible computer
i ordered the clear case and i felt it was easy to put on i watched a quick video on the <unk> site i like how it seems almost not there at all nice product and i 'm sure will help protect my machine the only drawback : i was nervous when i picked up the box from the mail locker i could feel it was loose on the inside after i opened , luckily i found it undamaged , but it was very loosely packaged with little bubble wrap
we got this case so that we could preserve the exterior look of the aluminum apple macbook pro # `` casing the shell is very easy to snap on and can be done in about # minutes the case comes with a soft cloth to clean the case when necessary
this is for the new aluminum macbook the product fits securely and seems to be well constructed it does add a bit of weight also worth mentioning , a `` speck `` logo is now located on the top portion of the case -- probably about an # . # `` wide , and clear this logo was not present on the previous macbook pro case i was a little disappointed to see it there and prefer to have the cleaner look of just the apple logo good product overall though
the product is good for its price you have to be careful though because it 's a hard case so there are parts of the product that are too sharp the edges are specially sharp so it cut one of my fingers but other than that , good item for its price
this is must have for owners of the macbook it fits perfectly and <unk> the elegance of the macbook and allows users to handle the laptop with less risk of it slipping out of your hands while avoiding scratches to the laptop i have only had it two weeks how it stands up over the long term and what it looks like after you have travelled with it in the laptop bag to and from airports is too early to tell , therefore #
a good buy overall - fits well and the clear see-thru plastic does not take anything away from the macbook 's own look downside - adds some weight to the already <unk> heavy notebook i also didnt like that speck has its own logo on the front cover -lrb- on the back cover would have been better if they really want it -rrb-
i covered my old mac and gave the computer to my son it has given the computer a nicer look -lrb- and hopefully protects the computer too -rrb- the only thing we do n't like about the case is that you can only plug the charger in facing forward - not sure if they can change that without affecting the ability for the case to stay on i have taken it on and off a few times with no issues
after a disastrous run with my previous white macbook because i did n't buy a hard case i decided to treat my new macbook with a bit more care this case is much cheaper than the same one sold by apple it fits really well and after about a month of use i can see the scratches which would have been on my laptop i also do n't think the speck logo is as big as other users have claimed , i barely notice it i have n't dropped it yet but i feel that this protection is well worth the money and i will continue to use these
this case is all you ever need to protect your investment it prevents the mackbook from getting dirt and/or scratches and to keep the dirt out all you have to do is remove the case it is so simple to install it as it is to uninstall it you will get your <unk> worth if you buy the incase neoprene slip case you will see that this see thru protector on the mackbook slides in with no problem great case ! ! !
someone told me that when you remove a speck case it can scratch your laptop , but i have had no problems like that and i 've taken it off a handful of times i have a # in . aluminum unibody macbook and it fits perfectly
this is really worked for my macbook # . # `` when i bought my mac on # , i bought this case this is still keeping my macbook new cleaning is easy and see thru will give you the good look it 's really protecting laptop from dust and you can carry this laptop to anywhere without worrying about the <unk>
i have not had any problems with my cover for my laptop it has not scratched my laptop -lrb- like i 've seen in several reviews -rrb- , and it still looks as beautiful as the day i first put it on ... several months ago now
this fits perfectly and looks great goes on in # seconds i just love it definitely would recommend it in order to keep my new unibody silver # `` macbook scratch free took it on a # week trip and felt confident that it would n't get damaged also great for use thru airport security
while searching for products , i find the reviews most helpful especially when the product i 'm looking for appears to be a little more expensive than i was anticipating however , with the speck see thru case purchased through amazon i feel it was money well spent the case snaps on in two simple steps and has n't given me any problems thus far i can still access all of the ports and it does n't want to pop itself off at all my husband now calls my macbook my little green apple because the apple logo still lights up thru the case you will be very happy with this product and it was cheaper to buy it though amazon that at my local apple store
this cover is exactly what i wanted -lrb- if not more than i expected -rrb- it just snapped right on and was ready to go i have used many speck products and really like the quality and look i recommend this product for the aluminum unibody macbook -lrb- i got my computer in # -rrb-
i bought the green speck see thru case and i have to tell you it is perfect the green against my aluminum macbook is beautiful the see thru case is easy to put on and even comes with a cleaning cloth the rubber nubs on the bottom keep the case from getting scratched on surfaces and keeps the computer in place on a table the profile is sleek and there is no noticeable added bulk ... you do n't lose the shape of the macbook , which is why i assume a lot of us bought the aluminum unibody in the first place overall it is a great investment i bought mine on amazon instead of speck directly because not only was it cheaper but the shipping was free buying it from speck would have been cost <unk> because the shipping would have been almost the cost of the case
i 've had this laptop case now for almost a month and i love it it does exactly what it 's supposed to and is easy to put on and off i definitely recommend it
i purchased this case almost # year ago for my mac book pro i 've had absolutely no problems with it during this time it 's very easy to install but tricky to remove the color is great and it protects very well if i look closely , i can see all the dings and scratches that it save my mac book from it does exactly what is says ; protects without adding bulk or weight , and adds a dash of personality with the wide color selection i continue to get compliments on it even today definitely worth the cost
i ordered this product for fear of potential scratches and dents in my new macbook so far i have experienced no problems with the case and no scratches despite hauling the computer back and forth from work for the past few weeks case was easy to place on and i have had little difficulty removing it when i needed to i have had no problems accessing any ports or the disk drive does add a little bit of <unk> to the computer but this is barely noticeable and the plastic is easier to grip than the aluminum case of the computer which i found slightly slippery since ordering both a family member and family friend have ordered similar cases to protect their computers as well with similar positive feedback
i was fooled by thinking i am buying original carbon that was sold way back by apple store my had worn out so i got this thinking it is the same thing . they do n't show any detailed pictures most likely so you do n't find out it is not the original to make a long story short , this one has half of the pockets missing , plus many other things that that by far can not compare to the original plus they had charged me # bucks couple of weeks after i had received it was sold for # dollars of course when i found out i was past the point of returning this be aware of amazon <unk> when you buy anything from them
i am a road warrior in the it space this is , by far , the best backpack i 've ever owned i 've had other <unk> , port and kensington backpacks the shoulder and back padding is excellent the riveted cable handle is very sturdy this backpack has travelled on planes with me for about # years and it is still in excellent condition very well made with interior pockets mounted high in the bag to increase usable space of course , it also stands up on its own
it 's hard finding a decent bag that will fit the macbook pro # that does n't look stupid this is stylish as well as functional i must admit , it is a little heavy , but this is n't the bags fault as the power supply and laptop contribute to much of the weight i love the reinforced handle at the top for grab and go , in addition to the comfortable shoulder straps all in all , it 's a great buy for the money
the design is very elegant and stylish , excellent and very high quality i felt that it is also designed in away that makes you feel you are carrying less weight i really loved this backpack despite the relatively high price
this is definitely a super value for the quality and price it is top quality construction along with convenient features and lightweight as well perfect for flying and other kinds of travel ; it 's the first piece i pull out when i 'm packing
i was sick of the standard old laptop bag i 've used for years when i bought this backpack style bag i was unsure of how i was going to like it i 've never looked back far more comfortable than a traditional bag great size . . not too big or small it has all of the little compartments needed to keep your things secure and easy to find zippers are tough ! , no seam issues i 'd buy the same one again
after # years my son need a new backpack . # years high school , # years college , # years <unk> , multiple trips overseas these backpacks are well constructed , handle weight real well and can take rough handling stop buying cheap packs and <unk> for one of these packs you will save money in the long run
my # inch macbook pro fits very snugly inside i wish it were a little easier to get out and put back in i have a speck hard shell case on my laptop to protect is from scratches , so i think that may be the problem as well also , the one pictured has a lot of pink the one i have has a lot of orange on it i do not think you get the exact pattern pictured , and i would have much preferred the pinks and purples to the more red and orange one i received
this is clearly meant for a # `` my asus # `` feels <unk> when i get it inside the spare space can be filled with papers and stuff but it 's not the idea love the color and materials if only fitted my tiny little thing
not only is this sleeve colorful and simply the cutest thing , it fits my macbook perfectly i was skeptical at first because it did n't look like it would fit , but the size is perfect it fits my macbook nice and snug and the material stretches i love this sleeve , the colors and other reviews helped me choose this one and i am so glad that i did
bought this sleeve for my asus # n netbook , and it fits well it 's a protective sleeve - not a case ; so it works for minimizing scratches and scuffs but wo n't help if you sit on or drop the laptop this is a good product it could be `` great `` if it was n't so expensive
i bought this because - first , for the colors and second , because it would fit my new netbook it 's cool looking and has sufficient padding for my netbook i 've only taken it to meetings and not traveled with it , as yet ... but feel confident that it will work great it is not a tight fit for my netbook which i appreciate so i can get the netbook out without a struggle
my netbook has the battery attached all the time i was unable to stretch the case around the computer with my <unk> hands my son did it but the edge of the battery still stuck out without the battery it would work fine a sturdy neoprene case
this is a very nice case for my samsung # netbook -lrb- # `` -rrb- it fits perfectly in the case and the case has an `` egg carton `` insert attached that provides more protection i like the `` hood `` style but if i could redesign it i would just make it a zipper instead overall , i like the product and would purchase it again
- a snug fit for my samsung nc # -lrb- so it should fit all other # inch netbooks - have n't used the pocket for accessories that is built in so i 'm not sure if it works well - no strap so it 's only meant for light protection and will need to be put in a bag or carried by hand
i have an eee # ha # . # `` netbook and it fits perfectly in this case i 'm very clumsy and the extra protection afforded by the shell gives me peace of mind it looks great - i love the little <unk> blue color the case is pretty slim - it slips into my backpack or tote bag without adding too much bulk i can even fit the power supply into the back of the case without having to worry about scratching the computer i highly recommend this case to anyone with a netbook
