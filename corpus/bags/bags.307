the backpack looks good . it 's comfortable what i most like is the new design for the adding pack near the bottom there are two things i think need to improve . # , there is no <unk> or hole for mp # -lrb- headphone -rrb- . # . the zipper is too simple , it does not have the <unk> function that means they are easy unzipped
i would give it a # if it was not for a vertical zipper on the front pocket for me , the vertical zipper is a bad design because you can not stuff anything in the front pocket for fear of it falling out when you unzip it the bag is sturdy and the compartments are well designed otherwise the airflow system on the back is a good idea
not the biggest backpack i 've ever owned , but perfect for zipping around the city or going on a <unk> lots of pockets , solid construction , and padding so it rests comfortably on the back got it on a flash sale for $ # - a steal
overall i like it i bought this when amazon had it for $ # . # plenty of pockets and the inside pocket is a nice thought to keep your wallet from pickpockets this backpack is well thought out the back cushion is pretty thick the top carry handle is reinforced and real sturdy you can put a small water bottle on the right <unk> and the left side pocket is perfect for usb chargers and cables my only gripe is that i wish the straps were wider and has thicker
i 'm a computer tech so this product does everything and then some i can fit everything i need when i 'm on the field and it 's is very comfortable the build quality is great
caught this on an amazon deal and it 's perfect especially at the price i got it for may never need another backpack again super durable , roomy , tons of pockets , and comfortable to wear
i was concerned about the size but was pleased to see that it is quite spacious perhaps a bit larger that i expected i would say this is between # l quality is just excellent a backpack made to last
this is my favorite backpack i have owned i have owned quite a few it is immediately obviously that this backpack is well-made ; a heavy handle , good zippers , fine material for all the fellow luggage lovers ... this is a good buy i attached a clip onto the strap for something when i realized that the backpack came with a clip well done , wegner
you have a place for your laptop , your notebook -lrb- # or # -rrb- and your lunch if you eat outside , that means space for # more <unk> enough space for laptop accesories and tools sturdy and good looking hope to have this one pass on to someone else in the future
it is a great back pack especially for traveling there are many compartments and large computer compartment is airport security friendly i am not sure how much waterproofed is , but top middle zipper is waterproofed zipper the handle on the top is made of wire and prevent cut , but i am not sure if it is necessary the shoulder straps are soft and comfortable i hope it last long
this is the ultimate commuter backpack it fits my # & # # ; dell laptop nicely and still has plenty of room for a lunch , a book , water bottle and more you could easily load two laptops the construction is top notch the & # # ; hidden & # # ; pouch on the back would be perfect for a conceal carry pocket on the con side : there is no mp # player pouch nor a headphone port not a deal killer for me i see this as being my primary backpack unless i am on a long term trip where i may want to throw in some clothes and a shaving kit
got this for my son for his new laptop keeps it safe and is not too big if you do n't need to carry the office around with you , this should do the job
the targus computer pack i owned was wearing out and i saw this <unk> on amazon had good reviews so i decided to pick it up <unk> computer back pack the material it 's made out of seems <unk> of good quality i like all the room it has , # side pockets for a waterbottle and other stuff , even a pocket where your lower back is , have <unk> anything to put in it yet .
i bought this for my son for school he is hard on his backpacks and we end up buying a new one every year we are hoping this will last for <unk> a year will let you know !
so far it has been extremely durable i have it pretty loaded down and have not seen any stress rips at all the only drawback i would say it has is the size i would have liked it better if it was a little larger but overall all i am happy with it definitely worth the money compared to other backpacks that i have purchased
i use the backpack for a variety of purposes from the gym , work , to travel somehow there is always the right amount of pockets and space to fit whatever i 'm hauling
this is a solid backpack , lots of space , and very comfortable i would recommend it to anybody who wants a backpack , specifically people who like to carry their laptops and/or textbooks with them
i read a majority of reviews that stated there was n't a spot for headphones as advertised i thought the same until i noticed a hole in the very bottom of the side pocket opposite the water bottle pocket the slit is <unk> and this is where your headphones can be <unk> through great backpack altogether and perfect fit for # inch macbook
i needed something to carry on a flight and was a little worried about the size of this bag but decided to try it the size is going to be fine as long as i do n't load it completely full and my # inch widescreen laptop fits great i like all of the pockets and it 's really comfortable to wear there is a slot in the middle pocket that a cord for headphones could fit through even though i do n't see the traditional hole with the headphone symbol the one side pocket opposite the zippered pocket is open with an elastic pull that can be tightened down i assumed it had a zipper since i could n't really see it from the picture , but i think this works better for my larger water bottle overall a great backpack
this backpack fits the bill perfectly my huge hp dv # laptop -lrb- # & # # ; -rrb- fits inside perfectly , along with a whole bunch of textbooks and then there 's still room for more stuff the thing feels pretty rugged too i feel like i could get into a fight with a bear and walk away with the backpack intact or , you know , not walk away at all ... but the backpack would be fine , that 's my point
very comfortable and more than adequate for everything needed i have a small laptop plus # kindles , cords , chargers for all , plus cell phone & charger still lots of space left for personal & # # ; stuff & # # ;
well its feels very comfortable when its on i put a ot of stuff on it , and i dont even feel them its really good for traveling and for sports etc .
this is definitely the best backpack i 've ever had , literally it has many pockets and its very durable , not to mention it looks really cool as well i 'm a college student and this backpack was able to carry my laptop and all my books with ease it 's design also does n't strain your back if there 's a lot of things in your backpack which is very useful
this bag is very heavy it does , just barely fit my # & # # ; laptop . many pockets , and extra places to snap your keys or a water bottle or flashlight too . straps are adjustable i use it mostly just to carry my laptop and accessories it get 's too bulky to put much else in it
it 's vibrant ! when i pull my macbook pro out -lrb- everyone has one -rrb- , everyone is looking at it i wonder why it is such a beautiful color and the apple also lights up , day or night , you can see the apple even better love the stands -lrb- # -rrb- at the bottom too !
fits my # & # # ; macbook pro -lrb- released oct # -rrb- perfectly snaps on with ease and the color is true to the photo -lrb- maybe a little more subdued - i got the fuchsia / purple color -rrb- i 'm <unk> this will protect my comp from scratches and dents , while looking fabulous along the way
this fit our new macbook pro # . # with retina display perfectly my wife picked it out but to me it looks more pink than purple but the color is n't the issue as much as the right fit and protection which are both excellent
everyone always asks me how i got a purple macbook the case fits well and protects from scratching the only con would be the fact that the legs feel pretty flimsy
these are easy to install and they protect my mac very well -lrb- i 've had # of them now -rrb- be aware , they are made of plastic they 're attractive , in my view , but they do n't look like the aluminum of your mac so if you want to show off your mac 's aluminum casing , do n't buy a cover ... just accept that your mac will get scratched up for me , the covers are great
this bag is a lot bigger than what i thought it was going to be the straps on the backpack are really small and hard to put it on your shoulders not a good backpack
i had this backpack for two weeks and suddenly the strap broke i did n't even have heavy books or other heavy items in it also the strap adjustments always get bunched up when u try to adjust them and the magnets keeping the backpack closed never stay
my bag got a hole by the bottom strap pretty quickly also , the magnetic snaps pop open often , particularly on the side pouches it becomes less useful the more you stuff it with stuff it is cute though
a lot of people complained about how this product sucks due to the color , the smell and the straps but i had none of these problems wonderful price and product
i have had this bag for a few months and it is holding up well the canvas is on the thin side but sturdy enough for a few books and such , i use it as my main purse and carry all for tablet etc . the color is true to picture the straps are plastic but i knew that when purchased , they look fine and work well the bag is lined which is very helpful
it was a fantastic case except that the dimensions were a little off and had to return my ultra book is exactly # inches wide and . # inches so i thought it would fit , since the measurement for the width was # . # & # # ; i wish they specified the interior measurements and the maximum capacity
this case was great and exceeded my expectations the only reason i am not giving it # stars is that the padded portion of the strip came off within the first week it is not that big of an issue as i can still use the strap without it and will also just sow it back on soon the carrying capacity is great for the case as well i can fit a hard drive and # mice without an issue additionally , the front pocket is great for the charger
i really like the size of this case my macbook pro <unk> display fits snuggly and is held in place by a wide elastic band it does have pockets for cord and external drive , but i am not sure it would protect the external drive from a hard bump overall it is a fairly sturdy case and a nice streamline size
so far , this case seems to be an excellent value and i 'm very satisfied with the purchase this is essentially what i was looking for in a case for my macbook pro , e.g . a low-profile , semi-rigid case with a bit of storage the price point is very reasonable , and if this case lasts over the years , then this will prove to be an outstanding value and investment
very good case to protect the laptop their are elastic pockets on the inside and out inside , you probably want to avoid bulky items that may scratch the laptop , so i put my power supply cable in the outside pocket it does hold it , but since it is a stretchable material , smaller items may work themselves out through the gaps left in the pocket opening laptop is recessed just enough so their is plenty of corner protection if all you carry is an ethernet cable and power this is a great case
for those who 've made the financial leap into apple 's <unk> notebook , this is the case to safely carry it around in it 's also got style the reason we all buy this dream machine is because we want power yet reasonable portability this bag finishes this goal quite nicely except for one proviso - carrying the a/c plug is n't quite perfect while there 's just enough room inside the zippered and padded interior for the mac . there will be a slight bulge for those who consider esthetic appeal important when also carrying the power supply for those who travel by air , getting through security will be a breeze thanks to the easy to access interior since the best way to prevent accidental breakage to any item you 're shipping or carrying around is by keeping the item snug yet padded , this case accomplishes both goals perfectly the hardware is very stylish yet well made for the shoulder strap this bag just might make us rethink how much we carry around our mac retina thanks to bag + a/c supply + notebook still coming in under five pounds
i am rating this drive logic & # # ; hard carrying case for # -inch macbook pro # stars as it is really nice and works as a portable and protective carrying case for the macbook pro #
this carrying case is very lightweight , but it 's not exactly a & # # ; hard shell & # # ; it 's stiff , but flexible , like very thick <unk> cardboard or light plastic it is not hard enough to be protective it holds a macbook perfectly , but not much else there is n't enough room to carry the power cord in the case , and the outside pocket is also too tight to hold it it 's a nice lightweight case for running around town , but not very protective and with little extra capacity
this case is perfectly styled to carry my rmbp # adding the power pack makes it a bit bulky , but the case easily accommodates the accessories mostly , the size is just right more like an attach & eacute ; than a laptop case if you 're looking to carry your mbp and the kitchen sink , look elsewhere if you carry just your mbp , power pack and magic mouse , this is the case for you
this case is ... well it 's great it 's sturdy and fits my macbook pro just right it also has a <unk> extra room for some things i usually put my wacom bamboo create tablet w / pen inside , along with a pair of headphones and some wet cleaning clothes for the screen it will fit the power adapter with extension cord but it has to make a stretch so i usually do n't carry those in there i 'm sure you could easily fit the portable cd drive , or external harddrives inside if that 's what you use most i just wish there was a little more room to hold the power adapter
i first saw this on amazon and after reading many reviews made my decision my macbook pro with retina fits in like a glove hard enough outside to <unk> serious knocks enough room for extras i 'm just delighted and <unk> this item
basic , well designed laptop case that fits the mac pro # . # & # # ; like a glove plenty of room for the cord and a few other accessories this is a slim design , not meant for carrying file folders and the likes , just the laptop and a few basics
my macbook got really banged up while inside my standard laptop case actually bending the frame i got this case so that it would have some protection this case is great since it holds my macbook and a small laptop while inside my backpack furthermore , when going through airport security , all i have to do is unzip it and lay it flat and do n't even have to remove the computers for the x-ray machine just fold back up , zip and put it back in my backpack
i wanted a smaller and lighter case for my <unk> # and was initially considering the purchase of a booq case , since i had purchased one years ago for a different laptop however , i thought i would give this one by drive logic a try and was glad i did the construction and quality are quite good and my laptop is protected and easily carried the charger does fit in the outer pocket -lrb- with a significant bulge -rrb- , but i carry the charger in a separate bag most of the time anyway there is not a lot of padding , so i still carry it with care , but for short trips where space is a premium , this case does what i need
this bag is a perfect fit for the # & # # ; rmbp , and is hard enough to <unk> against daily bumps and scrapes the outer pouch is surprisingly stretchy , enough to hold a power brick or several notebooks i have had no trouble with zippers as yet
this case fits a current macbook pro perfectly the exterior pocket can handle the charging unit , but the fit is uncomfortably tight if the charging unit is placed inside the case it 'll fit , but its tight the case is light weight , and the hard sides provide good protection it opens flat for ease going through airport security -- no need to remove the computer the removable shoulder strap is very convenient
the zippers break , it 's a good solid case but it comes with such a cheap zipper that when you pull it around the corners of the laptop it breaks and is <unk> they sent me a second one to replace the first one but it was only for me to find out that the second one was just as good as the first one their service was very friendly at first , but once i reported that the second one broke they ignored all of my emails , leaving me stuck with two broken cases if you are looking for a case that will last longer than a week , i recommended you search for a better one , it will definitely be worth the money
before purchasing this item , i read the item description to make sure this item would fit my mac book pro what i received did not come close to the dimensions of what was promised and you could n't zip the case closed tried to contact the seller and they refused the return do not buy anything from this fake company
you get your moneys worth # $ you 'll get a good case but it doesnt zip and close you have to break a piece of plastic in it to close it the case looks good however , would give it # stars if the case could close and actually serve its purpose but o well there goes # $ i keep my macbook on my desk # % of the time so i kinda of use it more as a docking stating / sleeve
wanted a <unk> <unk> shell case for my laptop this definitely fit the bill wonderfully its a bit snug on the edges , so sorta have to squeeze my # macbook air # & # # ; into it -lrb- but i can zip it closed if needed -rrb- however , i keep it partially zipped and use it in my messenger bag the laptop sleeve is somewhat padded already , however i wanted something a bit more too for about $ # , this was def worth it for me
i am impressed with this case i have a # inch macbook retina -lrb- late # model -rrb- and originally had bought the bookbook from the apple store that was supposed to fit the retina , but it did n't fit i was pretty frustrated because i had spent $ # on it after buying this for the price , it shipped earlier than expected and fits my mbp retina perfectly it even has the extra strings on the bottom so it can hold both the keyboard and the screen to the case the case actually seems pretty sturdy , which i did not expect , but that is a good thing and makes me feel like my computer is more secure my laptop does n't move around a lot in this case like it did in the bookbook , and when zipped up it looks professional , like a black padfolio i did n't even try and get free shipping with the $ # + deal because all together this case and <unk> ended up being about $ # ? which is n't bad overall , i am just happy to find a case that fits my retina well and came at a good price
i love this case , it keep my mac save and protected also is very light . excellent for traveling or school and the best of it is the price i highly recommend this case
after a long <unk> search on apple , ebay and many other places i found this fabulous case on amazon it fits your macbook pro retina # `` perfectly it seems like it can for sure absorb impact if it is dropped i really like the quality of the case inside and outside no funny smells like some of those cheap cases absolutely no odor at all and it is a quality product this is a must have case if you have a macbook pro retina # `` if you have to there is just enough room inside to place the full size ipad with the front cover along with your macbook and you can comfortably seal the zipper of the case this product is precisely made only for the macbook pro retina # `` dimensions so that nothing wiggles inside - because of that do not buy this for a different computer buy it and you will not regret it at all and keep your macbook pro retina # `` very safe
fits my # inch macbook retina well ... a corner elastic may slip , but rarely i have confidence that this zipper carrying case is good protection for my $ $ mac light weight , easy to zip and good value for the price not a $ # leather case like my son has ... but very satisfactory i use the cover at home as well it does n't get in the way , is n't bulky my macbook heats up when watching videos , so i take this cover off then as it does tend to hold the heat in
very good case ok , so its not like an otterbox for your cell phone , but it will definitely protect your mac against scratches , and can handle light to decent bumps do n't throw it from the roof and expect it to work , this case was not design for that it looks very slick and professional , it fits snuggly with my <unk> # ' , zipper closes it tightly but not <unk> it is perfect as it opens up with the laptop , no more unzipping , getting the mac out , opening it , closing it , put it back on the bag , zipping the bag just unzip the case and turn on laptop the corner elastics are well placed on both the screen and palm rest side they do n't block any ports , and the case does n't either extremely good <unk> , would recommended for anyone with a <unk> # '
it did not fit my computer the product look beautiful but did not work despite the fact that the sellers said it will fit my hp envy -lrb- # -in -rrb- it did not <unk> waist of money did not have time to return
do your research on this as it did not fit my hp envy seems they could have more details on the amazon web page for which models of the envy this product fits i had to <unk> return it and there does not seem to be an <unk> version that fits my hp envy
this products is neat snaps right on and feels more protective does n't add to much more bulk the little lifts are actually really useful and looks great cons - scratches easy with minor light
i had always wanted to get this hard shell case after seeing my mac friends using them before i got my hp <unk> # i got really excited when i found the hard shell on ebay and specifically designed for the <unk> envy # i really like how this hard shell case add durability to my ultra book , making it more sturdy without adding too much weight the back design with numerous venting slots along with the retractable stands help my envy # cool down especially when i am playing <unk> video games and with this hard case , i do n't need to worry about finger prints on the cover any more i used to worry that soft laptop sleeves do n't provide enough protection , and this hard shell can definitely add that extra protection i 'm looking for i hope there will soon be hard shell cases for kindles too
while the bag is durable and more stylish than other & # # ; luggage & # # ; type bags , it simply does not leave enough room once the laptop is inside it is meant for daily use , where only a few additional , flat items are stored along inside it is not a good fit for travel when you may need to store other items like power cords , etc . . . for carry-on
i am a baggallini fan ; despite the fact the purses are n't particularly stylish it 's ok because these bags are designed to be more functional than stylish and that 's where this laptop bag falls short it 's not very stylish and for the amount of money that it costs should have a more substantial should and cross body straps the straps , in my opinion , are a cheap cost saving measure that <unk> the utility of the item if efficiency and functionality are your claims to <unk> , then live up to them the size of the front zipper pocket renders it almost useless though the ability to slide it over the handle of your suitcase is extremely handy i travel a lot and have several items of this brand because i like my stuff to be coordinated and match so to that end this product delivers i think that for $ # they could have done better with the straps
very good but not as perfectly functional as i 'd hoped this is probably because it has some padding for a laptop which takes up some of the space of the bag this also give the bag structure , <unk> , so that is a good thing because it looks tailored it just is not as easy to put things in and take them out because each side is a bit narrow it is easy to organize & # # ; purse items & # # ; on one side and & # # ; work items & # # ; on the other , so that is also a good thing i love the color inside & out and the long straps + crossbody option is great
i travel a lot for work and needed to update my # -year old rolling briefcase this one slips over your luggage handle , which makes it easy tote around with your carry-on plenty of room inside for my laptop , kindle , wallet , keys , etc . the bag is top-notch , the only thing that i do n't like about it are the straps -- they tend to wrinkle up and dig into your shoulder ; i wish they were sturdier also the zippers are large and rough to the touch -- they are sturdy but scratchy overall , a great purchase
i love baggallini bags and this one is perfect for my everyday needs i purchased the executive bag and it was just too big this size is just right for all of the items i normally carry in my purse and there is a totally separate section for my kindle fire , charging cords and a book i love the shoulder strap and the removable crossbody strap the quality is excellent as always and i recommend this bag
while this is a nice size for carrying a laptop and a few other things , this is a very stiff bag my main disappointment though is that one of the pieces that wrap the handle came off of the bag within the first two weeks of using it i <unk> and now my # day window for a return is expired bummer for my new bag that i thought i would
this bag is a great size , but it is extremely stiff i thought it would break in after using it for a very months , but it has yet to budge the stiffness can be problematic when trying to get things out of it , especially from the front two pockets also , the stiffness causes the bag to fall over if it is full , even though it has a solid plastic piece in the bottom that is supposed to keep it standing after using this bag for four months , i am changing back to another bag i had previously as this one is more trouble than it 's worth
this bag looks great and offers plenty of space for laptops , notebooks , and all of your work day essentials unfortunately , it is <unk> material and does n't offer the same flexibility as leather but for the price , it 's a minor detail
good quality , looks much more expensive than it is has plenty of room inside the two pockets on the front are a bit tight though it looks very professional and the two straps are a good <unk> , they are long enough to sling over your shoulder , but short enough to carry by hand a comfortable height
terrible product , completely different from what i was expecting the description , the pictures , i really should have paid attention to the comments i felt <unk> its material is not leather , definitely , and the appearance is not good , does not seem to be the samsonite even living in brazil , i returned immediately to amazon and asked for my money back attention buyers from amazon , be careful , do not buy this product
the bag looks fairly cheap due to it 's lack of texture ... which i can get over with a little wear and tear it smells just fine the size is good - i am able to fill with documents , # laptops -lrb- when needed # & # -rrb- , chargers , and misc goodies i travel a lot and assumed it would n't take long to give this bag some character ... well , instead of aesthetic character it just started tearing the inside base at the partitions split a little and the shoulder pad tore within # weeks i can get over the inside ... but the shoulder strap is pretty important a replacement strap is not simple with this color scheme and online <unk> of brown straps is next to nothing , so i need a new bag completely i would return this product if i could , but i missed the deadline by # day . boo
the color is a <unk> bit lighter than the picture but i think it still looks great i have n't put it to use yet as it 's a gift for someone else but i sure hope it 's durable
everything about this bag i like with the exception of the buckles the picture shows the pull through belt type buckles in actuality they are click through buttons underneath those one of mine works fine , the other takes an <unk> amount of pressing and wiggling to get out i 'd look elsewhere if you intend to open this bag on short notice at any time in its life for me its most inconvenient when i try to open it to pull the laptop out for airline security
when i first received it , i was n't quite happy with the look , it looked not as good as it 's shown in the pictures but i am in china so i decided to get on with it i use it to carry laptop mobile battery & chargers <unk> and lots of other god knows what things after i stuffed everything into it , it was & # # ; bulged & # # ; and looked not bad at all , kinda stylish so if you have a lot of stuff to carry everyday and you are not slim nor under medium height -lrb- i am # foot tall and it still looks big on me -rrb- , you might like it
very sturdy and reliable bag true to colour shown and the leather looks , feels , and smells very good be prepared for the large size of the bag , but overall i am very happy
this is an excellent bag for the money i bought it for school , and it easily holds several large textbooks with no problem i do n't understand the negative reviews it is made out of real leather not the finest cut , but so far it seems to be quite durable i ordered the brown color , and it is slightly darker than the picture if you compare it to other leather bags this size you will see that this is a great deal
well , firstly almost scared off from purchasing by the other comments of this product yet it turned out to be really great no weird smell , in good condition , though not as shiny as the picture shows it 's also larger than i expected
i have a # & # # ; macbook pro , and the case did n't fit i 'm from <unk> , and i 'm really mad because i had to pay extra shipment to get it here and its not for a # & # # ; laptop i 'm so unhappy with the product
please , do the formaldehyde test the smell of the product is really weird could the seller provide some <unk> from some agent , such as consumer product safety <unk> because the smell is so bad and i really doubt if the product is toxic or not i opened the package and then just throw all of them away the smell made me sick
the yellow colors do not match at all the case is more of a see-through yellow so its not very bright , has a slight lime tint to it the keyboard cover , on the other hand , was a true yellow as i was expecting the sleeve was not even close to yellow , it was a horrid greenish color the quality was fine , just be careful on color ! !
i 'm extremely disappointed with this product the shell case is cheap and not at all rubberized as advertised if i would have known the set was so cheaply made , i would n't have pair more than $ # for it save your money , this was a waste
the only thing worth getting was the sleeve the laptop case was thrown together there was glue on the misplaced rubber feet on the bottom and a film that could be scratched off not the mention the scratches on it the screen protector bubbled up horribly and i 've apply quite a few of these in my day i will probably throw most of it away
after looking at multiple cases , i decided on this package the shipping was quick was only about four days do not purchase if you are looking for a case for the newest # & # # ; macbook pro with retina display it is about an inch too small and will not fit your computer this is horrible if you are looking to get your computer protected quickly i am still currently waiting to hear from the seller to see if i can even return the package i have never been more disappointed with a purchase on amazon
most of the items in the package were good but the laptop case did n't fit tried to have it replaced but they made me return all of it quickly <unk> my return and i 'm waiting for credit
everything was very nice but i ordered the wrong one and i <unk> fit my laptop and can not seem to find a way to get in touch with them to send it
you get what you pay for . covers laptop fine ... but feels some what cheap still use it for my mac pro with retina for simple protection if my laptop where to fall i wouldnt be surprised the whole case pops off
well after reading some of the reviews on here , i can say i 'm not the only one disappointed with this product like others , my hard case is too small to fit my mac book pro yet , everything else fits i believe that i received the wrong size case
the rubber case that goes on computer i like cause it protects my macbook pro very well however you can see dirty marks on the black one easily , it does protect very well though the pouch for the case i love now the screen protector i received all wrinkled and was n't able to use i had to throw away and the keyboard protector works well but i never use cause it feels better to type without it so all and all all i used from this package was the actual rubber computer cover and black pouch i was disappointed about the screen protector coming in bad condition but everything else is okay
the screen protector had dents all over it , almost unusable . also the covers were slightly dirty and scratched pros : good deal on the product cons : awful packaging , and <unk> covers
the color is not the same as the picture , and the clips that hold the bottom protective cover on keeps coming off it is very annoying that when i go to pick it up , it comes unhooked and i have to <unk> it would not buy this one ! ! !
this product did not fit my computer even though it says it should fit my make and model not happy that i wasted money on a case that did not even fit
the bundle is great - i love the pink color , and everything fits my computer perfectly but the smell is horrible the chemical stench on the sleeve and case are so bad , they give me headaches i had to remove everything and put it outside to air out hoping the smell wears off soon , if not , i will have to return or trash it
i spent a lot time making sure that the mac book i have matched the specs for this case the soft case and key board cover work but the hard case does n't fit its not worth the effort to return the product but it would be nice if it was easier to match the mac book you have to the case you need
i order my case based on the recommendations for sizes on the page when i got my case the bottom part did not fit , even though thats what size the company said to purchase the top part of the case does fit and is true to the color in the picture the keyboard cover takes some breaking in it was really hard to type at first , but after using it more its gotten easier the sleeve for the laptop protects it from scratches , but is not as thick as i 'd hoped i just use the top case and keyboard cover i really liked the color , but was upset about the rest of the products
mouse pad , sleeve , and keyboard cover were great ! they all fit well when i pulled out the laptop hard case and placed it on my # ' macbook pro , it was too small lacking one inch on each side there was n't even a possibility of snapping the case on my computer kinda crazy for the price they charge including shipping considering the hard case was the most important thing to have to me
i was so excited about finally getting this case in , i came home to it yesterday and go to clip it onto my # & # # ; macbook pro with retina display computer and it does n't fit it 's about an inch or so too small to even clip on to either the top or bottom half of my laptop . . huge let down somehow the keyboard cover fit perfectly though but the actual case itself was n't even close to the correct size and after reading all the good reviews i thought for sure it would fit and i would have no issues so now unfortunately , i 'm on the hunt again to find something that will protect this laptop
i feel really upset about the macbook case in amazon the first one which ca n't match my macbook , so i returned it then bought this one this one is cracked on the left side and the case is smelly i am so disappointed
