i got this for my boyfriend 's <unk> chair the original arms are deteriorating to prevent the deterioration and make the surface soft i bought him these sleeves he is very happy with them i would recommend this product
i bought these arm covers to take from the hard feel of my <unk> arm covers the stitching on the arm and the collapsing foam padding made for a harder arms ' surfaces these thin yet effective arm covers did the job perfectly the material is thin but provides a smooth and snug-fitting surface -- no more elbow abrasion that i was getting from the broken down arm padding even the stitched area on the perimeter of the chair 's arms began irritating my <unk> these pads have solved the issues i was having ; they are comfortable and have a sufficient cushioning without adding <unk> to the surface of the arms the laces also make for a <unk> fit ; this is product that works
there are # covers , although the description <unk> to a cover the padding is thin , about # inch , but you can use # on one arm to get ample cushioning as noted in another review , the little <unk> fabric tag with the case logic logo can be slightly uncomfortable for the elbow or wrist one <unk> is to cut off the thinner tag on the back side -lrb- easier to cut off this one -rrb- and put the case logic logo side down more comfortable and looks equally fashionable
because of the video review on here , i knew these would not have much cushioning i order these with the intention of using them to hold in place some memory foam works great because of the design of the ties i did have to supplement the ties with more <unk> because my chair arms are wide
i bought it because the trolley was detachable and assumed you could attached just the laptop bag to the trolley but there is no such provision also , the bag looks bulky but you can hardly put anything in it the laptop bag is fine on its own , but with just laptop and charger the laptop bag becomes big enough that you can not put it back into the trolley bag i am very disappointed with this purchase
looking at the mcklein website , it states this bag has a laptop compartment of # . # `` x # `` x # `` i have an asus that is # . # `` x # `` x # . # `` because of the curved top on this bag , the laptop will not fit in any compartment i do n't know of any laptop shaped like the top of this bag so make sure your laptop is significantly smaller than the stated dimensions or you will be returning the bag as i had to other than the <unk> size , the bag is very nice and appears to be well made
the mcklein usa chicago <unk> laptop case with all its features is a good idea , however , it 's heavy and if you fill it up , may be to heavy for carrying on some airlines you must remove the detachable wheel assembly to fit the case under the seat or in the overhead baggage compartment it is difficult to get the removable laptop briefcase back into the main case the clips that hold the case on the wheel assembly can come loose from both parts when removing the case , which means you need to be careful not to loose them on the plus side it does hold a lot of stuff and if you 're not flying is easy to pull the wheels are quiet and smooth rolling the pullout laptop case is useful as a stand alone case for a meeting the case is well made and looks good having used the case i probably would not buy it again to travel with
i travel extensively this fits in most aircraft overhead bins , however i sometimes have to disconnect the bag from the cart i have already broken the tabs off some of the plastic clips supplied with the bag to fasten the bag to the cart i called mcklein to ask for more and i was told # would be sent to me - that was over a week ago and still waiting also after these four i would have to pay for them i thought this was under warranty as i only purchased it two months ago quality of the bag is great but very disappointed in the system as a whole i will not be buying this again and am disappointed after having come from a wenger that lasted for years until the handle broke
the bag itself has held up well so far it has been in use for about # . # months but the <unk> has not been used too often after # weeks of use the laptop shoulder bag 's closure flap pulled out of the top part of the buckle , tearing the leather i was using the bag to carry a standard sized laptop but think the design of this bag is poor the shoulder straps attach to the top of the <unk> -lrb- instead of the body of the bag -rrb- which has the snap portion of the buckle hence , when wearing the bag on your shoulder all of the weight is placed on the buckle with the current design the bag is unable to be used since it is broken if you try to use the handle or carry strap the bag opens due to the buckle being broken i just filed for a rma with mcklein any complications with the return will be updated
i have had this bag for several years now i travel for work and i use my luggage sometime to the point of abuse this bag as taken every bit of it and is still going strong i would have gladly given it five stars , except very early on in my use of it , the black vinyl on the handle and on the front of the bag started coming loose from the cloth backing the strength is is the cloth , so the bag is still totally functional but the appearance , with a good bit of the faux-leather vinyl missing , is very unfortunate it looks like it has been through hell if it were available in all leather , it would be an exceptional piece of luggage with a unique and very <unk> designed removable wheels
this bag has been the perfect bag for weekly travel holds all work related item plus enough clothing -lrb- just shirts , underwear , <unk> and socks -rrb- for three days lasted through four years of heavy travel the wheels are now breaking down for the price i paid , it would have been nice if it lasted longer , but i guess the fact that i am replacing with the same model says it all
mcklein makes an excellent line of products i researched and looked and looked hard at the descriptions and settled on this one i returned it with in a week because in the description it said at the time ` napa leather ' which i did not know meant ` not leather ' i researched more and found the same model in real leather and ordered it the napa leather was a nice bag and i would still have <unk> i had not found the real leather bag
i have had this bag for about # months now and really like it the build quality is outstanding one can see that a lot of thought went into design and engineering of bag the pull out document folder is really nice i actually use it for my laptop and the rest of the bag for the other stuff i need i will point out that it is a big bag both in size and weight i recently took it on a trip on a small jet and it will not fit in the overhead compartment with the wheels in place however , the wheel section removed quickly and easily and fit under the seat until i arrived at my destination next trip i may leave the wheels at home another plus was that the clothing compartment kept my shirts neat and pressed and ready to wear
i 've had this product for a little over a month have traveled numerous times and it fits into the overhead nicely small clothing space but great for all of my office documents , laptop , and the <unk> number of power supplies required by my phone , laptop , tablet , etc . would highly recommend for the road warrior who cares about the professional appearance of their luggage and needs a bag with lots of compartments , ruggedness , and utility i will say the wheels do not remove as easily as i would like and it is easy to lose the fasteners but since i keep the wheel harness on this is less of an issue overall , great bag - very happy with the purchase
i travel <unk> and this bag is absolutely superb has a compartment for everything and is very versatile cramming the full laptop brief in the larger bag can be tricky but , if you take your time and have some patience , while packing , it can be down makes going through airport security a breeze
the water-resistant taping on the laptop compartment zipper started peeling off after several uses after a few months it was completely separated finally the same zipper started separating completely from the bag itself when i contacted customer service , they offered me a discount on a new bag no offer to repair or replace contrast this with other durable brands such as <unk> , high sierra , etc . who will service your product well into it looking old and tired <unk> is replacing zippers and velcro <unk> on a ~ # yr old jacket , free of charge if you are going to make the kind of durability claims that bbp makes about their bags , you need to stand behind them spend your money somewhere else
the other reviews are right about the design - the pockets are a real innovation unfortunately , they are also right about the carry strap , it 's not comfortable in messenger configuration the big problem is workmanship one of the pocket zippers separated almost immediately the main compartment lining separated from a seam after only # months of use <unk> customer service refused to <unk> unless i paid for shipping all in all , a bag to avoid
i live it except for few possible minor issues - the two clasps for the flap use a round type of clip which looks cool but does not allow one handed closing which would be possible with a regular clasp - the main compartment has no zipper or velcro closure - so as soon as you open the flap , the main compartment is exposed and contents can fall out if the bag tilts a simple velcro strap across might have been good and i 'll probably get it done - the same for the inside pockets in the front zippered area - it could have <unk> zippered or velcro other than that , the bag is perfect as a convertible i 'll be using it until i find something better
a little bigger than i thought it would be and not quite as attractive as i 'd hoped but still ... it is very well designed and durable if i were to change one thing it would be to replace the magnetic catch on one of the pockets with something more <unk> and if i were to add one thing it would be a bright <unk> fob -lrb- red or orange -rrb- to the zip on the back the current black on black fob is hard to find in low light levels an easy fix tho i just tied a small red ribbon to the zipper but these are minor complaints . . it is an excellent product with tons of storage and yes i do use the back-pack feature on occasion and dont feel like i look like a <unk> when doing so ; -
this bag totally rocks for what i use it for : a # minute walk to work with my laptop , a <unk> professional look while i 'm around the office , and travel for travel , the outer laptop compartment makes me cry tears of joy every time i 'm at the security checkpoint when i 'm around the office , the messenger-style strap looks way more presentable than a backpack and yet , i can walk for miles with this thing all loaded up and not break my back only possible drawback hey , it 's no <unk> ' <unk> bag or anything it 's a workhorse that looks like a workhorse i 'm so happy just writing this review i 'm gon na go use it right now
i have had this bag for less than a year and it has let me down substantially i was excited by all the positive reviews but today was the last <unk> the strap on the bag broke as i walked to my car additionally , before this fun incident the bag has been slowly fraying on the sides no bag should last only # months and to me is a testament to its poor quality i called customer service and they were less than helpful <unk> just added pictures of damage -lrb- see under customer images -rrb- i have reached out to company , but still no response
the case is nice large enough for laptop and other items i am not crazy about the finish of the leather - it is very hard and has a high gloss finish - looks like vinyl
i bought this bag to replace a tumi one that was stolen from my car it ' basically ok even if a bit too big for my needs , as i have a `` regular `` notebook and an ipad for my business trips another minus the leather , that is not very soft however , the product is very solid despite a pretty decent weight
this case is huge , solid and very well made nice lining of all pockets , great leather construction swallows my # `` screen dell with plenty of room left over - would easily take a # `` a lot of room for files and books even with the laptop , and it 's expandable my only real complaints is that it lacks what i would consider sufficient small pockets for loose items and it is really heavy when loaded but , it does have a well made , comfortable shoulder strap and excellent handles it 's just a big adjustment over my last case
the bag is made of thick leather , or similar material that 's a little too stiff , perhaps it will soften with time it 's also quite heavy i expected to get more stuff in a bag this size it has a thick insert to protect the computer the insert can be removed which would reduce the weight and increase storage capacity the shoulder strap is nothing special , i 've had better and worse i kept my old targus strap as a backup in case it breaks as others have commented overall a good value for the price -lrb- $ # -rrb-
in the three weeks i have been using the bag , it has performed as expected it is sturdily constructed , easy to carry and well-organized papers and a laptop computer fit comfortably , and there are plenty of open pockets for mouse , business cards , glasses , etc . the bag would benefit from having a few zippered compartments for small , loose items such as change overall , i recommend the bag to the growing number of people who carry their office with them prices were <unk> when i purchased my bag ; i saved # % by waiting a few days delivery was as promised
while this product looks like all the other bags , it is probably twice as heavy as other bags and twice as thick , and about # % taller so if that is what you are looking for , this is the bag for you if you were looking for a normal work briefcase of standard size , this is way too big and heavy
i read many reviews , searched high and low , and i simply could not find a professional looking bag that would fit my needs i was looking for a large bag i need to store all of my school books , laptop , personal items , and anything else i may need to carry day to day i am currently a university student who works full time so i really need this bag to fulfill two separate duties , and this bag did it nice leather , there is a couple of imperfections but the overall quality of the bag seems very sturdy i have used this bag every day for the last # months , and have not had any issues has all of the right compartments , exactly where i would expect them to be , that are very convenient the removable laptop case is very useful , and the fact that this bag is expandable is a great feature mine is hardly ever in the smaller state really , if you need a bag that can carry a lot , and still be very comfortable to carry with either the durable hand grips or the shoulder strap , this is the bag for you
this laptop case is well worth the money it is well constructed and has generous pockets it is hard to find a case this size that is not wheeled this is the # nd one that i have purchased i used the first one for over # years
this bag is awesome it holds so much stuff and it is not cheaply made at all it is very sturdy and i like that the shoulder strap clips are distributed on opposite sides of the bag so the shoulder strap distributes the weight of the bag evenly that is a major plus as all other bags do not do this and end up ripping very easily because of weight i would buy this bag again
this is a top notch leather bag which could be used for both # - # . # laptops i am using it with both my dell precision m # and dell precision m # units it has lots of space in the middle compartment one could carry # external hard disks , a # <unk> large size power adapter , a bunch of visiting cards , and usb drives it 's a great product especially for folks who 's work require them to be on the move i have tried targus and samsonite in the past they were not very comfortable on the shoulders i would recommend this one instead the shoulder grip is very comfortable and helps me hold quite a bit of stuff with ease i am sure you would love it too !
this leather brief case was one of the best gifts i have ever purchased on here it has a place for everything including your lap top and power cord the price was great also
this bag is a tiny bit bigger than expected , but definitely serves its purpose ! ! i can fit so many client files in it , all my accessories - tape measure , calculator , pens , notepads , bus . cards . , and so much more i do n't use it for my laptop -lrb- it has it 's own bag -rrb- so the weight of the bag is fine for me i have n't had it long or used it much yet -lrb- # week -rrb- , but hoping the leather will hold up and the best part is my stuff wo n't get wet if it 's <unk> much more professional looking with the leather too i would definitely recommend this bag to anyone as it can be very versatile
really well made laptop case lots of pockets all around and the computer storage area is well-protected handles are especially strong it also has wide storage areas that hold a lot without making the case feel overly bulky to carry around recommend this one highly
it 's large enough to fit lots of other things in besides his laptop everything is accessible from the top , so he can literally grab things while on the run it 's a nice leather , and a great looking bag that is extremely functional
i wanted a quality all leather computer bag for my # . # & # # ; hp envy laptop it was difficult to even find a case that would accept my laptop as it is # . # & # # ; wide i tried the targus <unk> # , which worked great , but was barely small enough to fit in the overhead compartment of small jets it was also barely small enough to fit under the seat of all jets thus , i wanted a quality all leather case that was smaller and still fit my laptop the mcklein walton literally fit the bill perfectly it is # inch shorter in width , # inches shorter in height , but about # & # # ; thicker which is not a problem for flying my laptop fits in this case perfectly and the removable laptop sleeve is great i chose to not use the sleeve , instead of opting for the samsonite <unk> <unk> # neoprene sleeve it fits perfectly where the mcklein sleeve went and provides # degrees of protection to my laptop
this bag replaces an old `` friend `` , one that i had with me for years but finally gave out replacing a case is not an easy process you get used to the size , pockets , sleeves and other <unk> of your old friend , and finding something that can provide the same <unk> is very hard the <unk> walton # bag is bigger than my previous case , which is one of the changes i desired it also has tons of pockets , zippered and open , which was another criteria the shoulder strap is substantial and padded which is great for the loads of documents and other materials i have put in and carried the laptop section is well padded , and easy to access for airport security purposes it also has great storage for cords and other computer paraphernalia all-in-all , a fine replacement and one that is quickly becoming my new `` friend ``
i chose this laptop case as it was leather and expandable , # inches i was not disappointed in this purchase it was a gift for a friend and he loved it and was pleasantly surprised at the fact that it was expandable the laptop case is well designed and well made of genuine leather . . it 's sturdy and durable , with a beautiful finish
this bag is really great my dell e # fits in smoothly and i have a lot of room for papers , accessories and whatever i have to take with me the only thing i 'm missing is a good place to store a bottle of water -lrb- or whatever you prefer -rrb- my former case had something like that which was even a bit isolated so i had a cool drink for
i have used this case almost everyday for two years and it is great ! it has an extra padded laptop sleeve that keeps <unk> laptop safe and secure there are <unk> compartments for additional files and paperwork the case can be expanded if needed it is comfortable to lug through airports full i made the right choice , now you can too
just received the product today it is not a white color at all , but more of a neutral <unk> , almost iridescent it looks stylish and appears well-made it fits around my # . # `` macbook perfectly however , there is not a lot in the way of extra storage space - there are a couple of side pockets that would be great for holding dvd 's and other small , flat items however , it is a little bit of a struggle to make the power cord and mighty mouse fit ... but they do overall , a very good product that looks as good as the mac itself , but do not expect to be able to store a lot of accessories in the side pockets
i saw the tucano macbook <unk> at a store and then went ahead and ordered it online so for me it was a safe bet but for those who are unsure how this little bag will look on them , i can say that it is one of the most stylish things i 've ever seen i love carrying it around because it 's elegant , but it 's also very practical and it has enough space for everything i found it useful and nice , and i 'm happy with my purchase
i could n't be happier with this bag it is perfect , and much <unk> in person it is actually a dark <unk> that matches my <unk> <unk> # digital camera perfectly , btw it is extremely <unk> & like the other reviewer stated , it is very well-made the italian craftsmanship is obvious it is also extremely compact , which i think is a good thing , though you wo n't be able to stuff a lot of extras in there however , all the essentials fit fine and snug , and you 're not stuck carrying around a bulky shoulder bag i fit in my . mac and `` everything mac `` owner manuals , power cables , apple remote , <unk> cloth , <unk> keyboard cover and trackpad <unk> just fine
fits plastic mac books perfectly aluminum macs fit good i 've used one for # months , and there is nothing i would change very good materials high quality case simple but elegant
love the bag , it can be carried with the handles or with the shoulder strap , easy to get laptop out of the bag at the security checkpoint at the airport it looks nice and the pocket has enough room to carry the essentials i would buy it again , it is well worth the price and better than ones i have seen in the stores
i purchased this bag five months ago and it is coming apart the zipper on the back of the bag failed about two months ago and the interior and external seams are starting to separate i loved the look of the bag but now its looking like i 've had it a few years i use it to bring my laptop and paperwork to and from work and occasionally put a <unk> container in it for lunch , not really heavy items
great design for a small framed person the bag is longer length-wise and smaller width-wise ; so it feels less bulky and is a much more comfortable design for cross-body carrying though it is not a big deal in the grand scheme of things ; the zipper on the back of the bag is not functioning as designed
unlike most laptop bags , the mobile edge notebook messenger bag is taller than it is wider or vertical in profile i like it - it 's easier to carry or move around i love that there 's another compartment for an ipad , and lots of room for the accessories it 's lightweight and compact but made with high quality materials the only feature that does n't work for me is the narrow side pocket i guess you can use it for pens but it 's definitely not for a smartphone
have had the bag about a month now i used to use a typical computer backpack but it was very bulky this bag is much more to my liking it is less bulky and yet still holds everything that i normally take with me everyday it can be carried over the neck and shoulder , or just on the shoulder i can also access the bag without putting it down , unlike the backpack i used before i like the top access to the main compartment without having to open the side flap like a lot of messenger bags it is well organized , and durable the only complaint that i have would be the strap can get a little tangled and it does not have swivels to make it easy to <unk> aside from that i would buy another without hesitation
i bought this to replace the standard factory dell laptop bag that was falling apart replacing a bag in that size and style would have cost more this bag - twice as durable - twice as comfortable - twice as <unk> and half the price did i mention plenty of space too ?
i love it . nice padded pouch that mu # & # # ; macpro fits into nicely . theres a velcro strap inside the bag to keep it snug . pockets for ... <unk> just about everything , i 'm a <unk> player and i do <unk> effects with a groove box during our gigs as well i use this to pack mac and my special <unk> i can fit everything in here and it all has its own section of the bag been flinging this around for a about a month and its durability is holding up so far i will update if i have any durability
i like this case as it is a bit more protective than others out on the market , has a lot of foam inside so my $ # macbook pro retina seems better protected the pocket on the outside is nice to carry around some minor wipes and thin items only the only issue that is kinda big is that one of the zippers pulled right off and that is just after occasional use - only use this say once every couple weeks and that zipper lasted about # months still . : -
i have the dell inspiron # r this laptop cover is about an inch too big , but i 'm not too picky about that it 's a good cover for what it is nice and thin enough for me to put in my backpack
i did some research on <unk> cases for my new vizio # . # beauty in form my computer is very much like the macbook pro retina display , so pretty thin i was very much surprised that there are virtually no snug yet protective options for # . # computers out there this case certainly fits the bill - snug , protective -lrb- with awesome feeling memory foam , not the <unk> neoprene -rrb- it is also amazingly fashionable , getting a lot of complements it 's the kind of case you would expect to be aboard an <unk> # <unk> jet or a space shuttle even japanese product - what do you expect
i commute by bike and put my laptop in this case before i carry it on my bike one night i had to cross a creek to avoid a security guard , and to my horror the creek was waist deep i thought my laptop was a <unk> , but the case kept it dry and it worked perfectly when i powered it up to check it the zeroshock saved my job another time , i managed to take the impact in the rear my laptop was not damaged
i tried # different camera bags to find one that : # -rrb- fit me ; # -rrb- would hold all my equipment with a bit of room to grow ; # -rrb- was n't too heavy i 'm # ' # `` and the backpack fits me perfectly i love the back support it 's comfortable enough to wear through an airport and hiking , and fits under the seat of airplane it easily stores a nikon d # , with # lenses -lrb- # , # , and # mm lens -rrb- , # batteries with charger , rain cover , and has space to spare
the small tenba <unk> is the most durable backpack i have ever encountered i carry a d # nikon , two zoom lenses , filters , lens cleaning <unk> , a nikon flash , an instruction book the backpack is heavy , but , i do n't see how a company can manufacture something of this quality and it not be heavy i particularly like the ability to arrange the interior to securely pack my equipment i considered the medium , but it would have been too much space i am # ' # & # # ; tall and weigh # and was able to adjust the pack for a comfortable fit the only improvement i would suggest is a place for a water bottle
nice case , but it has a major problem the shoulder strap holder digs into the zipper threads causing the zipper to come off track i bought this new on amazon and had to have it replaced by marware after only # months of use the replacement case had the same zipper problem again # months later contacted marware again with no response
thin , light weight case that offers good protection has inside pockets for accessories -lrb- mouse , charger , and a third pocket , too . can slip a few extra papers or reports in there , too for a long business trip you 'd want a case that has more capacity , but for day to day use , it 's great
the bag smelled horrible when i opened it , but after letting it air out for a few days , it served me <unk> for several years i only replaced it because the weight being only on one shoulder was throwing my hips out of <unk>
i love this bag it has separate pockets for power cord , mouse , etc . - a place for everything - and plenty more room for software and paperwork i have enjoyed using it , and it looks great too the straps squeak a little , but other than that , i have absolutely no complaints
this bag is both a tight fit and roomy the compartment for my # `` mac book pro is a perfect fit even with a skin on the entire laptop the additional compartment is very roomy and has two pockets for other gear -lrb- i user it for a portable hard drive and a bluetooth mouse -rrb- . it even has a compartment for my i-phone i love it
this is the best case out there for the mac book pro it fits like a glove , and the pockets hold the adaptor it 's comfortable on the shoulder i travel a lot , so having a good case is key
this sleeve does not fit the dell # `` because of the extended life battery i called the seller , <unk> <unk> camera and digital who told me to send the sleeve back for a full refund it has been # months and still no refund
i 'm giving this only one star due to the fact that it is advertised as fitting a # `` laptop , but it really does n't great design , great case , bad fit i have a toshiba x # . . which measures # . # x # . # the box that the sleeve came in says it will fit a # . # x # . # laptop it did n't even come remotely close to that , due to the <unk> in the center the <unk> shape of this sleeve reduces the center by at least # inches , maybe more i tried and tried to stretch it to fit , but it just would n't so now i have to pay return shipping ... and i still do n't have a sleeve :
i have had a hard time finding a laptop sleeve to fit my # `` laptop -lrb- custom manufacturer -rrb- i read the reviews , and took the measurements of my laptop and compared it to the dimensions listed carefully , but it still did n't fit too bad , because i love the way it looks
the sleeve is difficult to get the laptop in , and even harder to get it out of , <unk> it does seem to get a little easier each day -lrb- maybe its stretching a bit and the zipper can scratch the surface of the laptop if you arent careful it does protect the laptop nicely
i had purchased the same item at rei and then returned it when i found it cheaper on your site the difference is that it fits much tighter although it was what i was looking for rather than the bulky other computer bags it works but i do n't <unk> my computer until after i go thru airport security
i bought this for my new # inch hp computer and it does n't fit it was a major disappointment the sleeve is great and pretty but i just could n't use it fortunately , a family member has a # inch hp and it fitted perfectly for that one , so it became her early <unk> gift
this is just a note that this is not the widescreen model of the built ny laptop sleeve built ny has models that are specifically for widescreen computers , such as the dell # `` and hp # `` computer many people in the reviews have you 've got the wrong model for your computer
i have a very big , wide-screen , full keyboard # `` laptop it takes a little maneuvering to make it fit however , from what i can tell this is the only product that has a chance once i started using it , it has been great
i recently purchased this for my # ' hp dv # series pavilion notebook and it fits just right i would <unk> to say that it probably would n't fit any older or thicker models
the # `` sleeve i got fits my # `` macbook pro perfectly ; it slips right in with nary a struggle i get comments on the look and find that it performs its duty perfectly a great way to protect my investment
i had purchased the same one but smaller which was supposed to fit all # . # `` laptops but was too small this one was perfect for my laptop which is a dell # . # `` but would not recomend it for a # `` laptop colors are very nice and pictures are very close to the actual item
i love this sleeve my # . # `` computer slides into and out of it nicely i first bought the # `` sleeve and it was too small , but the # `` sleeve is great it came quickly and was exactly what i 'd ordered the only downside to remember is your cords wo n't fit into it i bought the sleeve because i usually carry my laptop in another bag anyway , so i just carry my cords loose in that
i purchased this to match my pink # . # inch dell inspirion # -lrb- really thick -rrb- notebook it fits it like a glove ... and really protects it ! love that it is also washable i even ordered the matching bag for cords , etc . . ** although if thinking of purchasing this for a # inch notebook it will not fit
my # `` macbook fits into this bag easily and there is enough room in the interior for the power cord and other small , non-bulky items the front pocket is best for thicker objects like books as it has a lot of give for thinner file folders , loose pages and the like , there is a zippered pocket in back where they can be kept so as not to slide out the shoulder strap is wide enough for comfort and easily adjustable the bag is thin , which i think is a big plus but this product could be a challenge for cat owners as the fabric is a hair magnet i am a little disappointed in the protective structure of the bag it 's minimal if you are a bit clumsy or travel often , i 'm not sure your laptop would be adequately protected if you need a lightweight bag however to occasionally transport your computer to the local coffee shop , this should do the trick
i liked this bag a lot but i have to return it as it could n't fit the new # . # inch mac book pro i will now try # inch size instead do not buy this size for your # . # inch mac book pro i rate it # star because of the wrong size otherwise this product deserves # star rating
i bought this item for my newly purchased apple macbook pro -lrb- unibody , mid # -rrb- and it fits like a glove it feels like it does offer some protection and had the ability to store the power supply , my external -lrb- # `` -rrb- harddrive , bluetooth mouse , and some paperwork if i do not include all these items , the bag fits snug around the laptop i can recommend this item
i have been using this product as well as the previous version of this product for over # years you simply can not find a better lap top bag for your mac it looks nice , its sleek , very comfortable to carry , great impact protection , and great quality
i have n't owned this product for long , but so far i 've been very pleased i 'm very pleased with the craftmanship and the sleek design my macbook pro fits snuggly inside and looks very well protected given the circumstances there seems to be adequate space for everything i carry with my book great price as well i recommend it
this is a great carrying case neoprene protection that is specifically made for the macbook pro family there is an internal fold of material that shields the zipper from the computer case it 's big enough to carry my apple mouse + power supply + security cable lock + a couple of file folders worth of work it 's not oversized so that it temps you to cram a bunch of junk in to it you take what you need and that 's it i love it
this is the best laptop bag i 've had it fits the macbook pro perfectly - secure but easy to get into and out of it 's got just the right pockets , one internal , one external zippered , and one external sleeve it 's durable , looks professional but can handle sporty use , and is very light it has enough room for what you need without <unk> you to pack all kinds of useless crap into it it 's not the <unk> ever , but definitely a great value
i really like my new bag i am not sure if i would prefer that it zip all the way open so far it seems perfectly functional the way it is the size is perfect for the # `` macbook pro
if you 're going to shell out for a macbook , you should spend the extra to get it protection like this case this is just a basic , decent case , not hardshell but it still offers good protection
this bag is very nice looking and stylish i have a toshiba # . # inch screen which generally takes up a lot of space , but i am able to fit a five subject notebook , a wallet , a/c cord , pens , and so on so basically , it fits a lot i 've had this bag for a month , and i can see that the straps are not very sturdy , as they are becoming weak ... fraying vinyl and thread coming loose where the straps are attached basically what i am saying is you get what you pay for ... but overall , it is a nice bag
this bag is one of only a few bags that is actually large enough to hold a # `` laptop and does n't cost over $ # i was purchasing this as a gift and spent a lot of time on line and in stores to find a nice looking bag that looked more like a purse and less like a <unk> for my mother this bag has a well padded pocket for the laptop plus other pockets for items you might need while out the straps are nice and wide so you can put them on your shoulder with out them cutting in for the price this is a really great bag if you want a better one , plan on <unk> over $ #
nice bag for larger laptops -lrb- i.e . not a mac , though this would be good for a mac too , you could just fit more in it -rrb- strap good length , not too short or long pretty <unk> color on inner bag
after # months of use , i also had a problem with the straps on this bag the padding material inside of the straps started bunching up which made the bag uncomfortable around my arms other than that , it 's a great backpack there 's a compartment for everything , and enough space to fit a computer + a few books or folders
this backpack looks really nice and is lightweight i think that it would have been nice if the shape <unk> little more square on the bottom all of the contents end <unk> together at the bottom of the bag even if they are <unk> pockets making it hard to get at them quickly
i purchased this case for a # `` dell laptop a few years ago this case has held up well over the years there is plenty of room for the charger and several other accessories i highly recommend
best used for over # yrs and good i bought this in amazon after i lost my dell bag which i was using it for more than # yrs i recommend this bag for people who would n't consider carrying bulky but holds it for long years worth the pay
i 'm known to carry lots of <unk> when i head out , whether to the office , <unk> or vacation this pack is the best it gives me plenty of space and the design make it a pleasure to carry the padding protects the <unk> while keeping upright when i 'm on the move plus the colors are cool as i 'm a big fan of orange -lrb- hard to find in most packs -rrb-
extremely comfortable bag i 'm returning to college after # years and needed something i could lug my laptop around in , and this is the bag the `` butt pads `` are especially nice because they , along with the waist strap , keep the bag snug against my lower back as i walk the `` buckles `` are discs , so they swivel as i walk - the bag does n't strain against itself there are plenty of pockets and compartments and snaps and zippers to please any bag lover , and even so , the bag is very stylish i 'm very pleased with my purchase
i 've had several different laptop bags , briefcase and backpack style , this is the best of both worlds the convertible strap really is quickly convertible the light colored interior makes it easy to find things and there are plenty of pockets to help organize quality zippers , snaps and seam construction
i purchased this bag about # months ago -lrb- another color -rrb- , and the piece that makes it a backpack from a messenger bag broke , so no it is only a messenger bag it was a really good backpack , and a horrible messenger bag it is supposed to be guaranteed , but they only offer a new strap which does not fix the issue by the way the laptop zipper is failing , and the mesh on the side and inside is also failing so , bbp bags are not high quality , and they unfortunately do not stand behind their products
amazing bag , versatile strap system , can be carried over should , cross body , backpack style , or as a briefcase expands to accomodate lots of stuff laptop compartment includes dividers , holds a netbook and kindle at same time tons of pockets , extra padding materials are heavy duty , this is not a cheap quality bag color is great for high visibility when riding a motorcycle the color also is great , wife says it 's a masculine bag , messenger style , wo n't be mistaken for <unk> purse wish bbp had these in more colors , what 's the point of a black bag anyway love this bag
i ride my bike to work everyday , when i am in town . # % of the time i have to travel so , twice a week when i am home i wear this bag when riding my bicycle it is great it is comfortable , sits low , and is quite bright so drivers can see me this bag takes a little bit of getting used to as it is trying to do a lot of things i still have n't figured out what all the straps do that 's not really a big deal to me it 's comfortable as a messenger bag and comfortable as a backpack i am quite pleased with this bag
bad customer service by amazon.com i have asked amazon in several <unk> to let me return this item since i got the wrong case for my daughter 's macbook but amazon has ignored my requests for a refund ! ! !
the covers do not fit most mac book pros and they are terrible about giving you your money back i would not reccommend this company to anyone in fact , i am warning you against them no wonder they try to be cheap horrible quality ~
