spins on four wheels does n't twist you do n't have to pull it in only one direction it goes <unk> , backward and sideways i find i am doing less lifting , which was the purpose of getting a wheeled & # # ; briefcase & # #
i have artificial knees and a # pound weight limit i use the case to carry my laptop and text books the height of the wheels allows me to tilt the case with my foot to get on the bus i do n't have to lift the case it is sturdy enough to roll off the bus and fall # inches to the ground it rolls smoothly and the handle is very sturdy i am very pleased
i just have got my mobile office i like it very much so far i like the size , structure and <unk> , my laptop is # & # # ; all devices are working apparently very well i hope i will enjoy it during my next travel or may be even i will use it to work , it seems to me that the model is friendly <unk> the weight looks <unk> and i <unk> to wear it by rolling and/or add to a bigger rolling bag , which is very important to me and it has the rear strap it has a new thing smell which i hope will disappear in open air the look is beautiful
this is everything that samsonite has advertised have used it on several trips as my only suitcase it has enough room for # days worth of clothes as well as the laptop , and ipad and all the paperwork i normally carry with me one note , your ipad will not fit in the ipad pocket if you have one of those massive ipad protective covers on it it will fit with the usual cover , but not those big rubberized covers stil , there is plenty of room to put the ipad elsewhere in the bg also , the bag will not fit in the overhead of embraer # <unk> regional jets . jets most airlines are delighted to tag it and allow you to pick it up on the <unk> it will fit in all larger jets overheads
i use this bag when i travel , particularly for an extended trip with a <unk> where you might want to check a bag . it makes a great carry-on , and the spinner wheels make getting through the aisles of commuter planes easy , then when i have a hub <unk> , i can <unk> the airport without building up a sweat i used to switch from a shoulder bag to a backpack for these long trips in this way i do not need to pack my computer & bag in a standard rolling carry-on , then remove for working meetings we still use a lot of paper , and for longer trips i need space to pack my personal survival gear it all fits in this bag if you pack very light , you could even use this for a quick overnight with room for the computer etc . i ordered and physically compared this to another samsonite spinner , and two rolling <unk> , all from amazon - this was the clear winner
this is a $ # . # travel office ! it 's a samsonite ! ! ! $ # . # ! ! it 's just as described and pictured and takes all your office supplies , computer , related equipment and can take enough clothes for a trip out of town for up to three days the handle will come up high enough for a person up to # ' # & # # ; and is adjustable from about four feet on up and again : samsonite last word in durability you wo n't be disappointed
my old laptop carrier did n't spin and was pretty heavy this carrier spins , is much lighter and is much easier to heft the price is incredible i heartily recommend it
i purchased the samsonite xenon # spinner to replace a older samsonite rolling briefcase that lasted for over # years of abusive use the xenon # spinner has an even tougher material and construction the overnighter side is surprisingly roomy , even with the pockets for files the laptop pocket is adjustable to fit my wide laptop snugly and securely finally , the four wheels provide a level of mobility that i 've been looking for , particularly when navigating airplane aisles a twist of the wrist allows me to roll the case sideways , avoiding bumping into seats
i bought this bag because it was the only one i could find big enough to hold my # . # inch laptop within # months of owning it i was going through the airport when the strap ripped and while at the airport they still made me take it out of the bag so the fact that it opened all the way up was nice then about # weeks later the front zipper started to separate at the seam making it <unk> to carry my laptop and accessories i ended up buying the kitchen sink from oakley have had it for about # months now with no signs of wear this bag is nice as long as all your carrying is your laptop but do n't expect to be able to carry much more then that pros : looks <unk> <unk> friendly was <unk> : only lasted # <unk> very <unk> did n't hold up to normal use
i dropped this back pack with my computer in it and it did n't break the only thing that i do n't like about this backpack is the zipper is hard to open in the middle pouch because of the lining buy this bag
the design of this backpack and the quick scan feature led me to purchase this i fly often so being able to just zip this thing in half makes going through security that less annoying there are a lot of different compartments to store flash memory and other gadgets my only suggestion would be to make the volume slightly bigger for those of us that travel a lot with quite a bit of things otherwise this is a great looking , functional backpack
this backpack is large and roomy for my alienware # inch laptop and has quite a bit of extra space the shoulder straps are sturdy and there is enough padding to make this backpack comfortable . , there are several pockets and little zippered pouches to seperate everything out a must have to protect your m # <unk>
this backpack is large and roomy for my alienware # inch laptop and has quite a bit of extra space the shoulder straps are sturdy and there is enough padding to make this backpack comfortable on the <unk> and shoulders there are several pockets and little zippered pouches to seperate everything out overall i liked this backpack , the swiss backpack i had previously had more padding but since i am not packing this thing long distances just to and from the car it is great for me
this bag is a very nice size for carrying equipment you 'd probably need something bigger as a professional photographer , but for a serious amateur this works very well it rolls easily and the grip is comfortable
this bag is exactly what i was looking for very well made the only thing that would make it better would be spinner wheels instead of fixed wheels i love the fact that it does n't scream to the world that you are carrying expensive camera gear around
this bag is well-made and nice and sturdy , yet easy to carry for traveling it 's the perfect size for carry-on it is designed as a camera and equipment bag , and does well for that purpose however , it can also be used for other electronics items there are padded sections that are made to protect camera lenses , but part or all of these section dividers can be removed this allows more flexibility in using the bag it also includes a handy padded laptop envelope i am very pleased with this excellent bag
this is a great travel bag for the professional photographer or even a weekend amateur who likes to travel to get his shots there are many useful and well-padded compartments for your camera bodies , lenses , tripods , and laptop the bag is well-built with excellent finishing and it pulls easily due to high quality wheels although a little pricey at $ # , this bag can also serve as a regular travel bag with the removal of various compartments very versatile and useful
the case seems to be made of decent quality material and holds up alright but it does not fit my laptop well and i can not zip up this product with my notebook inside while the x # e is a larger # . # model because of a large bevel , i imagine this problem would arise with a few other models i would expect that they would make the case a little large to accommodate a large bevel and increase the amount of <unk> padding so that smaller models do not slide around too much either not a terrible product and would probably fit the # . # macbook but for others with a bevel , this is a & # # ; try before you buy & # # ; type of product
fit 's macbook # ' tightly -lrb- even scares me that the zipper might scratch it but has n't so far -rrb- case if pretty thick so it makes it a bit bulky choose this if you want something really protective if you are just looking for a sleeve against little scratches when you toss it in your bag ... then you might find thinner sleeves that would be better
very nice material and the extra pocket holds more than i thought the only bad thing is that my laptop is exactly # . # inches and it takes a bit of work to close it all the way
i bought this about # months ago to protect my hp envy x # laptop while transporting it in my backpack it fits my laptop like a glove and the front zipper pouch is just big enough to hold my laptop 's -lrb- small -rrb- charger it has held up well , definitely worth the purchase
great price point and definitely accomplishes the task well i 'd recommend it the zippers do n't impede the closing of the sleeve and i feel like my mba is securely contained
i like the bag and it looks great with anything the only concern i have would be that after a # week trip that i took , the threads started to come undone which i wasnt expecting to happen so soon
so , i like the backpack , in general it fits my computer , notebooks , and accessories i do wish it was a tad <unk> , because the space gets real tight real quick however , i do n't like the straps i 'm a girl with fairly broad shoulder , but the shoulder straps are rough and too wide they rub the insides of my arms and it 's pretty uncomfortable to wear based on the way it fits with just a tee shirt , i ca n't imagine it fitting over a winter coat it will be good for travel and being more portable , but i may go back to a shoulder strap laptop bag for every day use
i like this bag it is a slim line computer bag it fits my # . # laptop the compartment for the laptop is up against your back this makes it rather stiff but i do n't plan on carry this all day long so for me it works there is plenty of room for other things in this bag
this is a really great backpack , i am going to buy another one for my brother i feel that its a little bit uncomfortable on the neck and shoulder area it has less space than i though the zipers stuck a little bit it looks big for a small girl its <unk> fits all the essential stuff you <unk> looks big for a small girl , but its still <unk> really like the
i liked the item it is way big for my # `` laptop but it could more comfortable although i have a light weighted laptop , i feel tired if i carry it for # hour
great backpack for carrying multiple items great for college students the bag has multiple compartments enough to hold my # . # inch gaming laptop , wacom tablet , charging cable , mouse pads , <unk> , and all pc accessories has a comfortable mesh padding on the back of the bag the straps has a velcro strap that keeps it nicely rolled up rather then dangling like normal packs the inner compartment for tablet is nice and soft , wo n't scratch the screen up according to the images and information , the bag looks a lot smaller than the actual product it 's pretty bulky for smaller framed people i am # ' # and about # lbs the backpack looks like a turtle shell on my back
i purchased this backpack after my traditional rolling travel case broke this bag was used to carry all my devices from the us to the uk and back it is small , light weight , affordable , durable , and functional overall , great product
plenty of storage pockets zippers are of good quality , not the thin , weak ones in another backpack i bought that lasted only a few months ! only complaint : all the small storage pocked are aligned and product a & # # ; bulge & # # ; at the top of the backpack when each is filled other than that , good quality construction
great slim backpack it holds all your school essentials : laptop , binder , paper , writing instruments this is a minimalistic backpack , do not expect it to fit # textbooks with a binder for each class in addition to a laptop what i carry on me everyday is laptop w / <unk> <unk> bag is well-made , and can handle light <unk> on a sunny day i recommend this bag if you carry light & want a sleek-looking bag
i researched mac and ipad backpacks for ever and im glad i got this one if you read alot of reviews the main problem with most similiar backpacks are the <unk> , low quality zippers and stitching well this backpack is perfect for alot of reasons its well stitched and the zippers are smooth and quality + + + + + + + it is not to big not to small , and has alot of storage and wonderful padding to protect your items the outer material is tough and good looking there are many more reasons to buy this backpack but at the end of the day its quality and affordable ! !
i just received this backpack yesterday and opened it up right away expecting to be disappointed because as a student i 'm pretty picky with the bag i 'll be using to lug my books and equipment around in to my surprise though , i was really impressed with the overall quality of the material , the clever use of storage space , and how much room was available in the main pocket i can easily fit my # & # # ; macbook pro , nexus # tablet , notebooks , a couple of textbooks , and any other essentials the only minor detail i would have preferred is some sort of water <unk> holder
this backpack fits a good amount of school supplies along with a laptop compartment it has a lot of small compartments for the little accessories . also has a slim fit and is not bulky . great product for the
i was looking for a laptop backpack with two specific characteristics first , it needed to look mature enough to be carried into a business meeting second , it needed to fit easily under the seat in front of me on a plane i found surprisingly few options but this product fits the bill i like that it has a dedicated compartment for my laptop and a padded sleeve for an ipad as well this backpack is well suited for a professional , with room for some folders and notepads in addition to the aforementioned electronics <unk> if you need a lot of storage or will be carrying several books you are likely to think it is too small
i needed a slim looking laptop backpack to carry to work i like how the backpack keeps it slim look but also provide ample of space by having <unk> integrated pockets all around the backpack also i like the cushioned feeling of the backpack on my back
first i have to say that i spent weeks researching for the perfect bag for me and i eventually went for this one the bag looks and feels even better than how it looks in pix and videos it met all my expectations and beyond it 's slim and surprisingly light has more spaces and pockets than you would normally find in other bags looks good when you 're carrying it i use it as my work bag and carry my laptop in it it 's both professional and stylish for an outing on the weekend if you liked it in the pix and videos , get it
i am a mom , <unk> and student i needed a backpack that would be durable , help me stay organized and look stylish all at the same time practical it is ... storage for days and has strong zippers i also like that everything is concealed no outside side pockets that <unk> your items do n't be fooled by the small pocket in the front its deep enough to fit a # notebook , <unk> etc . . this is my first review and i only review when i 'm blown away ! ! ! love my backpack
if you 're looking for a bag to carry to school without having to look like you 're carrying a <unk> , this would be it it has so many tech pockets -lrb- laptop , tablet , etc -rrb- i can fit my # & # # ; laptop in the little secret compartment under the straps perfectly even if you have a bunch of books , the bag stays slim it has a nice sleek look to it -- perfect for any college student
i gave this bag # stars because it gave me exactly what i expected it may not have as much room for books and folders as a college kid like me might need however , i can simply trade out what i need for the day and it is more than functional it distributes weight well to the point where , after climbing the average # flights of stairs , i 'm not totally <unk> this bag also manages well at work , especially if you 're a graphic designer i like this bag and feel slightly grown-up while wearing it . :
this backpack is the perfect combination of form and functionality it 's great for day-to-day travel with it 's spacious laptop compartment -lrb- my super thick # inch hp laptop fits just fine -rrb- and organization pockets , including the padded tablet sleeve the backpack is very slim , which is great for a petite person such as myself i got the backpack in gray , and it looks very well-made i would n't recommend this bag for people who are often traveling long distances , however , as its slim form makes it poorly suited for carrying a lot of items again , it 's got plenty of space and organization for daily commuting there are no side pockets , which was n't a consideration for me , but might be for others i absolutely love that the straps are wrapped up instead of dangling at the sides , making the backpack even more professional looking
i was looking for a backpack that could carry my # `` macbook pro , my ipad air , and at least # textbook and # notebooks i got this backpack after careful consideration and i must say i am very pleased it 's quite slim and can securely hold all of the things listed it 's very comfortable to carry and has some velcro that holds any excess strap so that it does n't dangle around which is an added bonus
i trusted the reviews and they came through this bag is great the dedicated laptop area fits my acer aspire v # touch perfectly which is a # inch screen then there 's two other zippered compartments for other storage i keep my charger , a notebook , some papers , and even sometimes my lunch in there case logic really did a good job on this bag would highly recommend
i use this to carry my dell m # to and from work every day it fits everything i need -lrb- laptop , power adapter , notebooks , mouse , headphones , a <unk> of usb drives -rrb- easily and stays fairly small given that it fits the m # , i ca n't imagine it having trouble with any other # . # & # # ; laptop on the market
i use this bag for my # & # # ; macbook pro and a # & # # ; toshiba it holds both of them comfortably , though the bigger pocket that i put the toshiba in is not very padded but it holds my hard drive in a padded pocket , all my cables , headphones , and papers that i need for my work it 's also comfortable to wear , and i love the look of it i recommend this product !
i 'm not one of the most organized people in the world but this bag has helped in giving me a space for all of my materials greatly it allows me to keep my writing materials separate from my drawing materials which are kept separate from my building and <unk> materials there is a pocket for everything i 'm also very pleased with the separate , padded laptop compartment the bag itself is very sturdy and light this bag <unk> the saying , & # # ; a place for everything and everything is in its place & # # ;
it has many pockets inside designed for specific use , like containing your table let it is very useful design for students like me the quality is also very good
i read through some of the other reviews and decided to buy this bag it has lots of room in it to carry two laptops or one laptop and tablet there are lots of pockets to stick in your computer accessories , car keys , etc . it 's a nice size bag for daily commuting and the bag is comfortable to carry i 'm able to fit two laptops , ipad , mouse , keys and other accessories into the bag with not problem as long as you do n't have one of those large , thick laptops , this is a great bag
put my laptop in it , textbook charger few notebooks , my netbook and its still the <unk> fit and so light ! ! ! if your looking for a decent <unk> to hold your everyday essentials , this is the one !
i was n't sure i would like this backpack most of the ones i have found are too <unk> and i figured this would be as well i figured i could try it out and if i did n't like it , either return it or pass it down to my son to use for school i was pleasantly surprised - there are plenty of pockets inside and lots of room without being inconvenient the front pocket is perfect for wallet and phone i was able to pack my ipad , charging cables and mouse , a change of clothes , carry-on approved bag of toiletries , as well as a few snacks for the trip it all fit easily under the seat in front of me -lrb- even on a smaller plane , in the aisle seat where there 's a tiny slot under the seat in front of you -rrb- i plan to keep it , and might even buy a second one for my son instead
pro : light , slip , efficient good looking backpack . it has just enough compartments and simple . it has all you need to make a simple bag con : <unk> was looking for a simple laptop bag and i found it !
this backpack is lightweight easy to travel and it is easy on your entire back i give this backpack # stars for it 's entire durability and how much easy it makes my going from one side of campus to another
great quality , strong , very spacious inside - more than enough space for laptop , <unk> and phone and all the cables plus room for even more stuff i love it
when the product came to me the packaging was torn and the the case was scratched to the point of discoloration in some areas in addition it did not fit my mac the only thing i did benefit from the purchase was the key pad covering
i got this case and at first it was awesome i love the color and everything but the sides have broken off and now when i use it it <unk> me if i have it on my lap and pieces keep falling apart everywhere
the aqua blue hard case cover did not last as long as i thought it would , i bought the case on july , it 's already cracked on the bottom edges and the case keep slipping off i do like the keyboard cover which fits perfectly i wish it would had last longer ! !
color is slightly off from what is shown i would n't call it aqua ... more robin 's egg blue fits my brand new macbook pro # really well , after some struggling to get it onto the computer overall , serves its purpose well , and will do for what i paid for it
i decided to get this case after dropping my macbook a few times the color is a little darker than i expected , but really pretty however , it seems like my computer is quite a bit heavier with this on and the material of the cover is prone to <unk> dirty its just alright
i 'm not rough on my laptop i handle it with care and i have no idea how the edges became split and cracked pieces of the case just cracked off so i feel as though i paid for something that within a few days started to fall apart do n't really recommend if you are looking for a protective case but if you want to add a pretty color , go for it that 's all it 's serving for me right now the keyboard cover is fine
it is nice and good quality but does n't fit the new mac book pro # inch with the a # model so check your model number before ordering i had to return mine for this reason
the way it was shipped was horrible they just put it in a bag type of package and by the time it got here , a lot of the case had popped through the bag and created holes because of this , there are now scratches on it also , the keyboard cover color does not match the case and makes typing harder other than that , it is a good case and it was delivered promptly i just wish they would care about the shipping part more
love the color , texture , and fit just got my first mac and this makes me love it even more the only downside is that when it came in the mail the bottom corner had a crack in it still looks and fits great , not sure if it worth the trouble to exchange it since the price was so low would recommend to a friend contacted the seller and am receiving a replacement bottom quick response and great service
i actually like this case it fit my # & # # ; macbook pro nicely , no issues there the keyboard cover is a bit cheap and sits funny on the keys , but i think of it as a freebie extra , so it does n't bother me much also , it makes it harder to type , but it does keep crumbs out of the keyboard the shell itself is just as described and protects my mac however , i do notice it stains easily and fingerprints need to be cleaned off constantly and it 's pretty hard to clean other than that , i 'm happy with it love the color
my son did not like the protection for the keyboard it does not match the light so you will see two letters on the keyboard and when you press it , you have to press it harder than usual the case fits perfectly i have no complaints
fits my macbook pro great ! i like the colors , the key pad and cover are <unk> different from each other -lrb- fyi -rrb- , the key pad is more teal and the cover more blue
case fit great , shipped and arrived early corners cracked shortly after i started using it i am in contact with the seller to get a replacement also the foam feet rest on the bottom can stick to the surface they are on , only had it happen once so it was not a big deal for what you pay for this case i was thoroughly impressed i would definitely buy another one instead of spending $ # + on another brand
this product was nice at first however it did n't last long -lrb- maybe a couple of days -rrb- before it was covered in finger prints and looked kinda gross material is very sensitive to finger prints and pretty much every thing
this case came within a couple of days of ordering it i was surprised to see it packaged without any padding but everything was flawless . the color is a bit darker than it looks online , its definitely not a tiffany blue the keyboard cover fits perfectly and yes , it does take some getting used to , but i just glad of the dust protection i like it , alot ! ! :
this is a great color case was easy to install keyboard cover is a nice addition just put it on so i do n't know how durable it is i have had other <unk> cases and they tend to not look great after a year , but they sure are nice to hold
i love this , but it is darker than it looks because it is put on black keys , but still very nice ! it also takes some getting use to to type with the silicone . but it 's
i love my cover because it makes it more mine , but i do n't like how it shows fingerprints very easily on the cover the bottom cover does n't seem to stay clipped on , but it 's not really loose either i also do n't like how the rubber keyboard attracts dust but i love the color and it definitely is protecting my laptop and is keeping it from getting scratched or from wearing off the letters on the keyboard
i 'm not giving this a bad rating , because it was my fault the seller was really helpful and had multiple email conversations with me when i bought it , i thought that mac book and mac book pros were the same size when i measured my computer i figured i would be fine but it turned out , mine was thicker than what would fit on it the seller told me i could send it back and they would send me a new one right away i figured that would happen , but still have n't gotten my replacement
i love this case it shipped out on saturday and was delivered by monday the company is really efficient i wish i could give it # and # stars the only reason i did n't give it five stars is because it 's not as bright as i thought it would be
very nice color keyboard alignment is a little off with the keys so the letters appear a little blurred ... but not a problem otherwise and keeps all the crumbs away
the case looks very nice on my laptop , and fits really easily but the colour of the keyboard did n't match the case that well , i was kinda disappointed the case and keyboard get dirty really fast , but mostly the case , if you clean it with a wet paper towel it gets even worse this product was okay , it was n't that bad , and not that
the case itself is pretty awesome i got a lot of compliments it fit my # ' pro perfectly sadly , you get what you pay for i did n't even own it for a year , and it broke . :
it 's cute the keyboard is a little cheap but <unk> very nicely the covers just pop on , they are thicker than i expected but i think they are wonderful , cute and worth your money this color looks a bit darker on the computer than i expected , but all in all a great cover for your mac
i like this case a lot , and so do all of my friends key board cover is not the same exact color as the case but its ' similar the keyboard cover also is not as sticking to the keyboard as it should but overall is still useable and is doing it 's job
absolutely love it i 've gotten so many compliments on the color of it i do n't really like how the bottom does n't completely attach , but besides that it 's great the keyboard cover helps make easy cleaning for the computer i highly recommend this product
it 's a great case . i love the color , the fact that it came with a keyboard cover , and it was extremely easy to put on my computer . it stays on well and i love it
the order was filled very fast i love my new mac pro and wanted a cover that would protect it plus be different the keyboard cover already protected my keyboard from a splash of water for apple macpro users , if you order a # inch for your macpro , make sure it is for the right size macpro as it comes in two models mine is the # macpro without the dvd player which is slimmer and needs a different size case it will not fit for a regular # inch cover
i just ordered this blue cover case for my macbook pro and received it today it came within # days to my house and it fits perfectly on my computer i am very happy with this product it adds a lot of character to my macbook pro , and the color is really pretty i am also very satisfied with the keyboard cover , which actually even stays on when i shut my laptop , and gives the keys much more protection i am very satisfied with the cover and that will definitely prevent any scratches from getting on my laptop this is wonderful i would recommend this product it snaps on very easy
i just love this case and keyboard cover wish i had bought it sooner , i could have avoided some dings on the laptop my daughter has one and she loves it takes a little getting use to the keyboard would recommend to anyone who has a mac laptop
great color and perfect fit exactly what i wanted to protect my new baby the keyboard cover was my main interest - afraid crud would collect under the raised keys now just peel the cover off and clean it - keys stay in pristine condition , as does the whole aluminum shell
my boss loves the case and the feel of the skin on the keyboard i purchased one for myself in teal and base on that purchase , i already had him sold before i told him the <unk> quality of the product however , completely satisfactory and so much more reasonable than some of the other hardshell cases ive purchased in the past quite comparable to the speck quality of cases plus , the keyboard protector is a huge bonus
fits perfectly and i love the color i do n't know about the keyboard cover , it 's alright but not for <unk> term papers overall i love the product ! ! def will buy another another it also comes with a case for the bottom
i had a pink one that broke and so i needed a new one and i love the color blue it shipped in good timing and was exactly what i expected i would definitely recommend this product
this case is more than i expected it will do a great job protecting my computer and it is really cute i also really like the keyboard cover which i originally thought i would n't use
i received my case in a decent amount of time at first i thought that the bottom case did not fit right -lrb- because it would slide -rrb- but then i realized that it was my own error now it fits great i love the color also , the keyboard cover fits much better than i had anticipated i was n't planning on using but i am now great product for a great price
i bought this product for my daughter and she is in love with it the color of the casing is so beautiful and just what we expected she loves the keyboard cover as well it is not so hard to type on it as we thought it would be and it all fits perfectly this case is so beautiful and overall , is very <unk>
i bought this for my # macbook pro , and it fits beautifully i love the color as well , it 's definitely very similar to the color in the picture keyboard cover is also great , especially since i tend to eat around my computer , so this keeps stray crumbs , etc from getting into the keys my friend who has used a macbook pro for # + years without a keyboard cover complained it was a bit & # # ; gummy & # # ; when he used it , but i really like it all around fantastic ! :
this has saved my computer at least once -lrb- that i know of -rrb- i love its color , and when my computer fell , the case barely cracked from the impact , and protected my computer thanks to this case , and another padded carrier i will continue to buy and use this case to protect my laptop
i love this case , but most importantly i loved the cost of it i could not beat it for $ # i do notice , however , that if someone touches it with their greasy paws it leaves fingerprints on the case and also the keyboard cover is <unk> differently than the case itself these are minor and the benefits of the cost , extremely fast shipping and the case itself outweigh any negatives for me
the bag is constructed well like the extra padding in the back and the separate laptop pocket i only gave it # stars because it my # & # # ; samsung laptop barely fits in the laptop pocket there 's a padded patch of fabric with velcro at the bottom of the laptop pocket i took that out and my laptop fits in but if it was any bigger it would n't fit i 've seen the reviews for some other # . # & # # ; brand laptops fit other than that it 's a great backpack love the front pocket , has a separate pocket that lined for your ipad or # & # # ; tablet as well as all of the organizational pockets in the front pocket and on the front of the backpack very happy with my purchase
this is my first laptop backpack , i was having trouble finding something for my # ' hp envy and saw this i am glad i did . love the color , comfort and the extra pocket
i love this backpack it has <unk> for my tablet , my phone , power cord , pens and my laptop it is cool looking and comfortable to wear it i would highly recommend this item to anyone looking for a laptop backpack
bought this for my best friend for christmas was bigger than i expected but perfect she does n't own a macbook but instead a # inch acer and it was able to fit in the laptop compartment easily which was a great relief you put your laptop in the back area where its super padded so your laptop wont be in danger of breaking
i asked to return this bag and they said ok turns out i have to pay for shipping which was the price of the bag i 'm not happy this was a gift for my girlfriend but she does n't like butterfly 's now i 'm stuck with this bag do n't buy from this company
not as substantial as i had anticipated am glad i purchased another , more sturdy carrying case and can use this item jut as a ` sleeve ' to help protect the computer more
case is what i have expected it would be i wish i would think about the case i could put the power court in design is cute and same as shown on the
