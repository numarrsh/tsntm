having acquired quite a number of memory cards by now , and planning a trip to japan where i will need every one of them , i found this neat little carrying case and it 's absolutely perfect it 's very compact -- smaller than an iphone # -- yet holds a lot i can even slip my charging cable in with the memory cards it 's also very well-made it is exactly what i was hoping to find !
this is a very affordable carrying case to have all your memory cards neatly tucked away in one convenient place no more searching and scrambling for missing memory disc , or not being able to find the right one your looking for
i found myself with a large number of memory cards in a plastic baggie , and did n't have any idea what was on them this has allowed me to organize them and <unk> little slips of paper in the slots to let me know what 's what i wish it held more , but then again , i 'll simply order another one
this is the perfect way to organize all of those random memory cards the carrying case is small enough to put in my camera bag and really helped to find old pictures easier
great little case just wish it had more of the bigger slots like in front and back most <unk> -lrb- all i buy -rrb- come in case that fits perfect in the bigger slots you defeat purpose if you take out of what they come in to put in your case out of -lrb- # -rrb- slots in case , , i can only use -lrb- # -rrb- . if you make one with just bigger slots would be glad to start buying from you there 's my review , , thanks for what you have -lrb- we always want more or something else do n't we ?
perfect storage for my memory cards and at a great price cards fit securely in the vinyl pockets i would definitely recommend this case to anyone looking for a way to keep their memory cards organized
we bought a blue and a green memory card case my husband wanted extra memory cards for his camera so i thought i would be organized and have a case to keep them in . now he wants a memory card for each event that he has taken pictures of so he can fill the case up the cards stay in the holders without falling out like other ones do ... we really like this case we were also very happy to receive them so quickly
i was always misplacing sd and <unk> cards this simple and efficiently designed small case put an end to this problem cards fit holders nicely and are easy to access , yet are retained in their slots securely the extra microfiber cleaning cloth was a nice bonus as i never can have too many of them very much recommended product and good value
this was used on a trip to europe and made keeping all memory cards together neat and accessible without the bulk traveling by air nowadays one must be a compact as possible thank you so much for this product
the case came on time it is very well made pricing makes it an excellent value having this case eliminates lost or damaged memory cards since i have several memory cards for my cameras
the memory case came promptly and as described the case is sized just right for the memory cards -- not too big or small -lrb- # / # `` x # / # `` x # `` -rrb- the outside cover is some sort of cordura , but not exactly the interior is lightly padded there is a zipper that fully zips all # sides , where the center opens like a book there are # pockets for sd and # pockets for cf memory the pockets are pliable vinyl and seems like it wo n't crack too easily comes with a microfiber type cloth to clean your memory contacts overall , it 's good quality and great price i would n't run over it with a car , but it 's small enough to just throw in your back pack and keep your cards in one place
i filled it up right away and it works great the screws holding it together are a little big that keeps the pages from folding out good but i still like it a lot and it serves the purpose great i will buy another one but hopefully in another color
i received my package very quickly , very happy with the product , the price was unbeatable durable materials and i stuffed my case to the limit and it still closed nice and smoothly recommended to friends and family .
i thought this was a great purchase at a very reasonable price i have # digital cameras and had been storing memory cards in zip <unk> bags or a plastic case that only held # i found this , it stores # + cards and very compact i have recommended it to others who take many photos
i shopped around & kept coming back to this case it 's compact , simple , lots of sleeves , and great price it was shipped sooner than i expected & packaging was secure
anyone who takes a lot of pictures should get one of these working with may forces such as friction and gravity , it supports the weight of several sd - cards
i 've been looking in stores for a memory card case for a while and was excited to find this one online it 's lightweight , compact and just what i wanted
the item was shipped in a timely manner , pricing was good and was exactly what i was looking for i have a number of sd cards and need them in one
this little case is just perfect for my needs not only does it house all my sdhc memory cards it has # additional slots for my cf memory cards as well to top it off it fits right in my camera bag and takes up minimal space
it 's perfect although this is very small , it holds all of my sc cards no more using a bulky card holder ~ this one will slide right into my pocket
have tried others which all are too bulky or did not hold the cards securely this is one neat flat package which fits well into my camera bags at last i found the right one
it works , its small , its convenient no down side had no trouble inserting or removing cards - you do have to take a minute to do this tho maybe not good for people with less <unk> fingers
i was looking into buying some equipment for my new dslr and along with getting a few memory cards , i figured i would need a place to hold them so after <unk> through a few potential <unk> i settled on the eco-fused black memory card carrying case i am not disappointed the cards fit in wonderfully and the included cloth is certainly a bonus it is a little weird at first how the slots are set up , as three ` pages ' of slots are facing one way and then the other three face the other way but it was easy to figure out and i 'm overall very happy with my purchase oh and the shipping was great too i was expecting to wait for about two weeks but it showed up in only a few days
precisely what i was looking for i can use it to store all my cards at home , and the size is also perfect for travel great price too you wo n't be disappointed
i shoot a lot of video on sd cards -lrb- canon rebel t # i -rrb- and i always have to carry around multiple sd cards this case has space for # sd cards and # larger slots , which i assume would fit a few cf cards , though i have n't tried it out it also comes with a nifty cleaning cloth that i did n't expect
this memory card case looks exactly like the picture and is small enough to fit in my pocketbook or in my camera case i like that it can be zipped up to keep the cards safe and not have to worry about them falling out this arrived in # days with amazon prime
perfect little organizer for camera cards and other cards it will prove to be very useful in the future - since i was never able to remember where the digital camera cards were placed months before
handy and does the job , gave it as a gift and the person had been looking for something like this and was unable to find it now she can <unk> and store easily
i started shooting with different types of digital cameras in # throughout the years , i 've purchased many sd and sdhc cards depending on the type and capacity of camera it was for i needed a case to store and organize all the cards so i can easily pull out what i needed this case is perfect for the job each card can go into its own sleeve there are # sheets for <unk> cards -lrb- each sheet has # sleeves - total # <unk> cards -rrb- and # sheets for compact cards with # <unk> the case is small and will fit easily into a <unk> pocket no more & # # ; hunting & # # ; for the cards in those individual plastic cases that seems to get & # # ; misplaced & # # ; when you need them in a hurry
this is a very handy memory card case for storing memory cards while traveling it holds many cards well , but is small and does n't take up much space in a camera bag or computer backpack
perfect little case for my sd cards i do n't want them lost and/or misplaced , and i need to store them for # years , so i wanted a convenient case for long-term storage i like that it zips up so the cards wo n't fall out , too arrived in perfect condition
for the price this thing does what is supposed to do and i like it i did not expect a top notch case but this is just fine i keep it in my camera case with my video camera and digital still i like it
this case works very well to organize and keep memory cards in one place my camera uses micro sd cards after a photo shoot i have been saving the cards in envelopes with the subject written on the front i then placed them in a big zip lock bag to keep them together this case solved my storage issues the sd cards i buy come with an sd adapter i just put the micro in the adapter and add a home made label -lrb- made from the sticky part of a post it note -rrb- the micro sd would probably slide in to the pockets without the adapter , but it may be difficult to get them out it would be nice if small , thin , <unk> , labels were available to put on the sd cards to help identify them i highly recommend this product
i used to carry my sd cards in a plastic bag in my purse when i saw this carrying case i had to have it i bought one for myself and will be purchasing more for <unk> <unk> for christmas
if you have multiple cards like i do ... its a must i love it ! ! it holds all sizes and you never have to look for all your memory cards it will be right there together
this is a compact fashionable design , love the zipper only wish you made one for sd , one for compact flash and one for micro sd so i could keep them all separate
while i have n't used this case yet i really like the way it feels and looks it is a nice compact size , seems well made with a nicely working zipper , has room for a lot of cards and i really like the rich blue color
i got this to store all of my cards that i take on vacations i wanted to be able to attach small notes on each card , and this case works great for keeping the cards and the notes together
i was initially taken aback by the <unk> size of this case after transferring my cards , i realized that the size is a bonus , as it allows me to place it in one of the smaller side pockets of my bag i found its construction to be more than adequate ; but , i would recommend a gentle touch with the individual pages i feel that under <unk> circumstances , i could easily tear one of the pockets in retrospect , i would have preferred a color such as a neon green or hot pink -- colors that are easy to spot should i drop or <unk> the case this is not a weatherproof case ; but , putting it in a zip lock bag should protect it under normal <unk> conditions i highly recommend this case
of course this case will hold all my sd memory cards but i got it so that all of my sd cards will be in separately <unk> sleeves this way i can make a list describing relevant information for each card
a great value these new cards are so small they need a special place to get kept now to remember where it gets kept ! took # days to get delivered which is longer than most , but really not an issue in this case packaging was fine and all arrived in excellent condition
i was constantly misplacing or losing camera memory cards due to their small size this case is the perfect solution to keeping all of those cards organized and together in one place the quality of construction is excellent , and the wallet is small enough to easily tuck into the camera bag , yet large enough that it wo n't easily get lost the <unk> pages securely hold the cards in place and ensure no data will be lost to accidental static <unk>
good sd card holder love that there are four slightly larger pockets that can hold larger cards the bonus microfiber cloth is great i love the eco-fused cloths , as i own other eco fused products
i was very satisfied when i received the eco-fused black memory card carrying case it was perfect as i had about a dozen memory cards in a couple of places that i wanted to keep all in one place ! the only thing i would change would be the color i would have preferred a bright color that i could locate easier maybe red or bright blue would be good !
this is a nice compact case that seems to be reasonable well made for its cost the cards fit neatly inside the orientation of the slots prevents the cards from slipping out will work well for travel
bought this memory card case for my niece for christmas , i have a similar one that i use all the time it has a lot of storage for sd cards and is a nice bright blue making it easy to locate she loved it
now that i 'm <unk> different sizes of cards , it 's nice to have one thing that will hold them all since cards are small , they 're easy to lose , i like one location i 'm sure the plastic pockets will be okay with gentle use , but you would n't want kids taking them in and out too often , would shorten the products life
first off , i opened the package and it had what looked to be a professional insert that said it was for the retina macbook pro i put my computer in and there is a solid half inch of slack on either side second this case is at max # inch thick how is this supposed to protect my computer ! i paid $ # for shipping and it took close to a week to deliver said it would be here on friday , got it sunday nit a big deal if the product was legit , but it sucks do not buy from this seller ! !
i was really looking forward to this as it is a great idea to keep both devices in once case , but it was a disappointment i had two major problems with this case : # -rrb- it is way too flimsy to protect a computer , # -rrb- it smells like a tire store
fitting my laptop and ipad into the sleeve took some work - it 's just too small as soon as i took them out i noticed it had warped additionally it does n't offer that much protection
this thing is hideous ! pink is my <unk> color but this was awful it 's a poor fit for my # ' macbook pro & offers no protection at all i guess i got what i paid for
i needed a new cover for my # `` macbook air because i 've been using a sleeve that was too large and loose for my laptop i once dropped my air that was stored inside my old sleeve and dinged it 's corner , so i was looking for something better that would fit snugly and hopefully protect it from small drops i bought this cover based on product description , images , and customer reviews , thinking it would satisfy my needs what 's nice about the casecrown neoprene sleeve is that it does fit my macbook air snugly , and has a second pocket to hold my ipad mini unfortunately , i must rate this low for one main reason : the cover flap does n't fully protect or cover the <unk> corner i feel <unk> from the provided images , because it looks like the flap would fully cover the top edge of the air from those photos , but in fact it does n't so if i were to drop my laptop again , i have no doubt that the corner would get dinged again i uploaded a photo showing what it really looks like with a macbook air inside , so you can see for yourself
i guess i got it to protect my retina macbook # from dust and <unk> i originally thought it would be a thick foam or cushion but when i got it the padding was less then # th & # # ; very thin i guess if i would drop my mac at waste level it would not provide any protection what so ever the only thing nice is it fits my mac nice and snuggly also the inside is green
i honestly forgot i bought this and ca n't believe i have n't sent it back the neoprene is n't very thick and it is n't firm either , so the thing has a tendency to be loose and a bit <unk> i actually fit a # -inch macbook pro retina in it just to see if it would fit that was a bit tight so i & # # ; m guessing this # -inch version is probably about right for a # -inch macbook air
i was very disappointed with this purchase first off , it 's not padded , and second it does n't fit perfectly the macbook pro slides around , and only seems to be snug when you 're trying to get the macbook pro in the sleeve though it does protect it from scratches , but that 's about it if you 're looking for something protective this is not for you for the price you 're better off buying fabric and making this yourself
this case worked well for the first few months , but then after that the edges around the <unk> to the case started tearing , even with average use the velcro is annoying if you want to open the case without a lot of sound the interior is smooth though and it protects the laptop fairly well
the product description is somewhat <unk> , i was under the impression that this product was designed for both the macbook pro and macbook air i 'm not able to fit my macbook pro in the sleeve this product is definitely designed for the thinner macbook air also , the sleeve itself is very <unk> little or no support to your device , and no room for its charger
the velcro tab tore after the first day this was just after normal use this sleeve looks great but apparently is not the greatest of quality since it ripped so quickly
the whole point of a sleeve is to be nicely fitted to its contents i specifically bought this because it was labeled for mbp retina what i got is a very loose , could fit any mbp kind of sleeve
despite the deceiving title and description , this case is not for the retina display macbook pro does it work is it made for it it 's better than nothing , so i 'll continue to use it , but very deceiving advertising
the reason i gave this product # stars is because i did not like how i had to practically shove my macbook air into the case within the first # minutes of having the product and trying it out , it started to tear a little , and i ca n't have my laptop case falling apart on me that quickly if you are thinking of buying this item please be sure you are okay with <unk> having to put the case on the laptop , because otherwise you will rip the case
i really like this case because it is slim and it cuts down on the clutter when transporting both a macbook air and an ipad the problem , though , is that this sleeve was apparently never meant for <unk> with any other kind of protection for your devices i have a hard shell on my macbook air , and a pretty slim <unk> <unk> for my ipad mini while the sleeve can stretch to accommodate them , i 've only had this for # weeks , and ripping is already an issue i 'm not sure if i received a defective item to begin with , because i did remember seeing some loose threads however , i do n't think ripping should happen , given that this is also supposed to fit a macbook pro retina and ipad # , which are both larger
i received my case promptly and it is as pictured the color is adorable and my macbook air and ipad both fit comfortably in the case , as promised my main comment is that the neoprene material itself is a bit on the thin side i would not trust this as the sole protection for my laptop , but as i use it inside a laptop bag that has additional padding , it works well for me if you carry your laptop in an unprotected bag i would recommend investing sturdier case but for the price , you ca n't beat it
purchased this to replace my previous laptop sleeve by speck -lrb- http / / www.amazon.com/gp/product/b # <unk> # <unk> # _s # _i # ? ie = utf # & <unk> = # -rrb- but definitely does not compare i wanted a zipper free sleeve , and this was about as close as it got with it 's velcro closing i always have the flap up and over so i do n't bother with the velcro because it is pretty loud and annoying it does not have any kind of cushioning or grip -lrb- like my previous sleeve : -lrb- -rrb- and is quite thin it wo n't protect your laptop from anything more than scratches i do n't have an ipad but i can see how the second slit for an ipad could be useful i carry my samsung series # in it and it fits just fine
the sleeve is indeed bigger than the mbp with retina display however if you keep the white packing foam in the sleeve , it becomes pretty tight yes , that makes the whole thing bulky , but also gives additional padding they specifically say mbp with retina display , not only on the <unk> but also in their package i would expect something like my previous tucano second skin , but it is not i do n't wan na say they <unk> a universal sleeve as mbp specific simply after adding a foam pad , but that 's what seems to be
i purchased this sleeve for my retina mbp # inch , and was initially pleased with the appearance and build quality of the sleeve unfortunately , when i tried putting my mbp inside , like another reviewer had said , it was too loose , and i can actually feel my laptop moving slightly when putting the sleeve into my bag really wanted to like this product because it 's a great way to store both your mbp and ipad in one place , but decided to return it for a better fitting sleeve
it fit a little too loose on my # & # # ; macbook pro with retina display i purchased a hardcase to provide extra protection and it fits much more snugly -lrb- and securely -rrb- now
the stitching has started to come undone on the flap it also is a tad loose fit and can be adjusted by pulling the flap & # # ; super tight & # # ; and attaching the flap to the velcro overall , you get what you pay for and i was not expecting super quality at this price , but it makes for a nice case while waiting for a better one to come along right now there are n't a ton out , especially at cheap prices , so if you can hang tight wait and get a better case
the sleeve seems very protective , and i really like the fact that there is no zipper that could get caught or scratch my macbook my retina macbook pro fit nicely within the sleeve with a case on it unfortunately , after six months of use , the stitching on the velcro is coming off
does what it is suppose to do -- just smells odd i thought the smell would wear off , but no i 've had it for several months and the strange smell still lingers
good protection for my macbook air # & # # ; but does not fit it snugly this sleeve was designed for small computers in general and not specifically for the air as the title <unk>
just an fyi for anyone thinking about using this for another device it was too small for a # & # # ; lenovo ultrabook i am sure it is # % perfect for the macbook air ... so if that is what you are getting it for then you should be fine i was just hopeful that this would work for a similar sized device
when the product arrived , i was unsatisfied with the fit the sleeve , especially since it 's made out of neoprene should be . # `` shorter on the short side of the macbook and perhaps . # `` shorter on the long side that would make a <unk> difference the rmbp shifts and slides around in the case and it does n't feel great when carrying it around i gave the product # stars since it 's at a value , but i will admit that i am not satisfied
i like the sleeve , but in rain or snow i still put the sleeve in a briefcase or backpack it just seems a little cheesy to me probably , it 's my imagination it 's really difficult to find nice looking and truly functional sleeves for the # <unk> the sleeves look like they are to fit into the real carrying case
after a good two months of use , i do like this case i had to air it out for the first # days since the smell of the material was very strong once it got aired out , i started using it -lrb- i carry both my ipad air and a logitech external <unk> keyboard in it -rrb- repeated openings of the front flap have proven that the velcro piece is not sewed on all that well as it 's starting to come off on the left side of the case i 'm not sure if i 'm going to have it sewn on better or just let it fall off and find another case to replace this one since i did n't pay much for the case -lrb- $ # -rrb- , it 's not that big of deal to look for another case but i would prefer future versions of this case are made better to withstand continued use
this case is clearly not designed specifically for the # -inch retina macbook pro when you put the laptop in , it is quite loose within the case it 'll still protect it , but i would have liked for it to hold the laptop snugly the padding is n't that thick , either
the case fits my laptop well the big issue i have with it is that it is really , really thin it will protect from scratches but really not much else the other neoprene cases i have purchased in the past were all at least twice as thick
does the job - but nothing special other than the price -lrb- cheapest by far -rrb- nice addition of holding a <unk> ipad or # `` tablet as well does not add too much protection though other than
offered a great fit for my asus zenbook ux # a and i loved the extra pocket on the front for those extra things i used it daily for a little over # months -lrb- i 'm a student -rrb- , but it quickly wore out and now i have to buy another case the velcro , while nice , no longer sticks although the snug fit prevents the laptop from falling out near the bottom , however , wear and tear have left two corners of the case -lrb- and my laptop -rrb- exposed and susceptible to <unk> at this point , the case is no longer usable since i 've noticed minor & # # ; dings & # # ; on my laptop that will only get worse if i keep using the case it was great while it lasted , but looks like i need to buy a case that can stand up to daily use
i like the design , and the sizing is accurate the green trim color is attractive unfortunately the build quality is poor the velcro was not sewn carefully and is coming loose in one corner two days after i received it
i use this w / my rmbp # . # ' notebook the notebook fits inside perfectly but the sleeve was a little flimsier than i thought it would be i use it more so to keep dust out of it than i do for travel i do n't really trust the sleeve for travel
i really love the color and texture of the neoprene sleve case it keeps my # & # # ; macbook air safe in my bag from bumps , nail polish bottles with loose tops and the occasional water bottle mishap the little pocket in the front keeps my charger and other accessories safe and handy my only complaint is that the scratchy part of the velcro is on sleeve and not the flap i 've snagged my sweaters on it when i slip my computer into the case the design would be improved if the swapped the scratchy velcro to the flap and kept the soft velcro on the sleeve just my opinion
this case does n't actually fit the mbp # inch retina display model , but there is hope the computer is actually too thin to fill out the sleeve however , the sleeve ships with a <unk> insert in the pocket which holds the mbp if you leave that piece of padding in , instead of throwing it away , the mbp will fit in very snuggly , as if it were perfect i 'm totally satisfied after discovering this trick you 're welcome
this thing can fit a retina macbook pro and ipad -lrb- # -rrb- with some additional room for a hard drive or something the macbook pro also has a kuzy case on it , so there 's plenty of room in this thing one thing i do n't like is it is starting to unravel , but i ca n't fault it too much , i am stuffing a lot into it works well for what i need
exactly , the iphone could fit in an additional pouch in the closing sleeve , or at the center above the ipad besides that , i think it protects the devices very well i even use it inside an executive case , to protect the computer and the ipad from bumping inside it
this is a good product for those who want buy less covering cases the seal is velcro , that is probably the downside of the product other than that it is perfectly good for fitting my mbp and ipad # in my backpack - fits well , and <unk> always makes great <unk>
i carry a # inch air and an ipad everyday , i needed something to protect them from each other while in my bag this case works perfectly and at a fraction of the price of others that i looked into the only downside is the noise that the velcro makes but for # bucks i cant complain too much highly recommend if it fits your need
i bought this for the # & # # ; retina macbook pro it 's an adequate cover simple and clean in appearance macbook fits snugly in general but can slide a little <unk> along the length of the cover it 's not a problem however i 'd recommend this product
pro 's : - sleeve seems well <unk> can use the sleeve with a cover on your mba -lrb- it is a very snug fit , but it does fit ! - ipad pocket works great -lrb- i use it for my ipad mini and i have a case on it as well - the velcro makes it quickly <unk> is thick to add additional protection from falling <unk> color -lrb- i have the pink con 's : - it is not as thick as i would have hoped it to be -lrb- the material is spongey feeling , so it 's possible it could absorb impact - the material between the ipad pocket and the mba pocket is really thin - i would recommend the case i would give it # stars , but i think it could be slightly more padded to protect a $ # . plus machine
even though this case is labeled for `` retina `` display , it fits a standard # . # `` macbook pro great it seems like rather than <unk> the case for the slimmer retina display macbook , they just <unk> it for the macbook pro , it fits nice and snug , definitely worth the ~ $ # this case might be a little loose for the retina model
decent enough overall , though it 's pretty obvious it was n't actually designed for the retina model it was probably designed from the previous fat model , as it is held very loosely and just barely fits through the slot . ipad slot is fine and can hold the cord instead also ... the `` extra pop of color `` that `` may slightly differ from actual product due to lighting and color settings `` is ... a vivid hot pink thankfully it 's only on the inside , so i can live with it
it is about # inches longer than my # . # `` macbook retina display , loose in width as well that helps for fast <unk> on the go but a bit too long for my handbag so i tend to have to fold the top a little the loose fit helps only if i abuse the case and dump my charger in the ipad section when i 'm in a rush i 'm glad i got it though ... the colour is as shown on screen , material is neoprene as expected would have preferred a more snug fitting but the color makes up for the fitting
although snug , fits macbook pro retina display # `` fine along w / the `` new ipad `` or ipad # , no problem snug fit , padding could have been a little better but over pretty convenient for people who carry both in one case , would recommend buying , good price too
i mistakenly bought this for a # . # inch macbook air it is a little too small if you want to use the outside pocket to store anything other than a cord or headphones the product is well made and keeps the computer protected i 'm happy with the purchase as it is a snug fit
bought one of these for my asus # and the fit is perfect it 's a tad bit & # # ; fat & # # ; overall but i 'm sure that adds to its protective ability i really like th top closure
very soft and it fits my # inch computer . i had to get a # inch size case because i have a snap case over my computer so fyi , if you have a snap case over your computer , go a size up on the neoprene
this case is decent i wish the fold-over flap was a little wider when the mba is placed in the pocket , part of it is exposed hence the # stars
i like it however it only works for me because both my ipad and macbook pro have fairly bulky cases without them , the sleeve case is too roomy the devices would slide around too much
why someone needs to carry their macbook and their ipad may seem <unk> but for me it comes down to connectivity my ipad has <unk> service and my laptop does n't when i 'm without wifi then i use my ipad when i 'm getting serious work done in a wifi environment then i use my macbook i tend to go places with both and this case makes it easy though admittedly i had to get used to carrying a case without a shoulder strap oh , and in a pinch i can squeeze my kindle in with my ipad as well good value for a very practical solution to protecting your technology the reason this is n't a five star is simply that the corners of the flap side of the case leave the laptop 's corners exposed to possible damage not a huge deal but worth noting
video review for the neoprene pocket sleeve case from casecrown the model i review is the black # inch one but they also have different colors as well as a # inch if you have a smaller laptop watch the review video here - -lsb- ...
