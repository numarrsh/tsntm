love this carrying case i purchased for my new apple computer it fits my computer snuggly and secure and has several other pockets to store the charging cords and other accessories for the computer would recommend it to anyone considering it for their computer
loved the case and it does protect my new air beautifully color allowed me not to lose it <unk> my things when i am packing for a trip great buy ! !
my only issue would be the color seems like i may have to wash it periodically but other than that it words perfectly with separate pockets for pencils and papers , with a separate pouch for the power adapter
price wise this is a good backpack , but not a good backpack for a laptop there is zero padding in the bottom of this pack and a small amount against the laptop on the inside if you were to drop this pack with a laptop in it , there is no protection it 's a good pack for books or any small items , but i would n't haul around a piece of equipment you care about when flying , as it offers no protection now i knew the price was a great deal , and it 's obvious why , since it really is just a backpack for non breakable items
<unk> , the quality of the bag is very good it looks nice and has many <unk> carry many small items however , one minor con is that it does n't have any protection at the top part no vecro band or cover so be careful not to drop from the top side major con is the vecro to wrap the dangling strap the velcro is so stiff and it <unk> arms every time i put it on and off i did n't realize until i wear short <unk> during one week trip to the philippines , my arms got <unk> of red bleeding <unk> my skins are not that sensitive
i really wanted to love this bag , as it looks much sleeker than most backpacks and is pretty functional too lots of little organizational pockets , a water bottle holder and a fairly well-padded laptop compartment plus enough room to carry a # -subject notebook and a fairly large textbook but the straps were just awful super bulky and not at all ergonomically designed they cut into my arms even when the bag was only minimally filled maybe it 's different for those with broader shoulders but for anyone with a more petite stature , i 'd avoid this one
got this bag online the quality and colours are great it is a good backpack my only concern was the big straps they look a little awkward and that 's why i returned it case logic missed the design of this one
i have an asus g # vw a $ # speed machine that i want to protect its # & # # ; screen but doesnt quite fit in this bag , its a tight fit , by tight i mean tight the bag is good for my ipad and my macbook but not for my gaming machine which it the reason i bought this bag decent padding front and back but none on the bottom , which for students we place are bags down a lot , one day you could accidently plop it on the ground and thats the end of your laptop final opinion & # # ; its okay & # # ; <unk> gotten a # star if it fit my laptop and # star if it had padding on bottom
while it was a good price i accidentally dropped the backpack into a bathroom floor and the computer inside cracked this would not have happened with my previous pack
it 's a nice looking backpack , feels nice but one of the loops on the side broke first day -- not sure if they were meant to be used for key chains but still a bummer lost a key chain watch
the main compartment will hold a laptop and notebook binders the secondary compartment is for smaller notebooks , electronics , pens , etc . however , i 'd like an additional compartment to hold lunch or other food stuff so it is separate from my papers and electronics
design of the backpack is simply beautiful there is two major flaw for this bag first there is zero padding at the bottom second , there is only one zip at the front the strap management is cool wide strap indeed reduce the weight to carry overall i will recommend this backpack
i purchased the bag because my old bag was heavy and starting to degrade substantially the pack quality is good the size is adequate the storage <unk> were lacking for my use i had been using an older brief-case type bag this is probably best for a student
this is nice , small computer bag it is very functional , and i especially like to the two side pockets with zippers i have two complaints one is that it is a little stiff -lrb- although i find most computer bags stiff -rrb- the other is that there is no <unk> to secure the computer in the bag my last computer backpack had a clip at the top of the pack where you could strap it in that way if you left the zipper open by accident , the computer would n't fall out i hav n't dropped my computer out yet , but i know i will at some point
it 's good , but not great the straps dig into my neck and shoulders i bought it for a plane trip to <unk> it 's not as roomy as it looks , but it 's good for carry-on size but i truly think that if you intend to use one of these regularly go with something different it 's not very ergonomic
there is no padding for the large compartment besides the laptop slit i would not buy this bag again because anything you put in it will slam against the ground with no protection
this bag meet my needs and is solidly constructed however , the straps keep sliding off my shoulders and i constantly have to <unk> it i 'm now walking around with my thumbs under it to keep it in place i wish it had another strap across to hold the main ones in place like the eddie bauer backpacks
i 'm split on this purchase it is a very nice design and the <unk> colors are very attractive plenty of space and pockets for your little things i use the side pocket for my trackball mouse and it fits great now for the negative : i own a laptop that cost me over $ # , believe me , i take care of it its my work horse , and the padding inside this bag just doesnt cut it i 'm not demanding crazy padding , but for any valuable laptop , this isnt the right bag i added some padding from my old messenger style bag great shipping and product , just think twice if you value your laptop
its a pretty good backpack for the price , and looks fairly upscale - i like the cross <unk> detail on the front it has good storage on the inside and is good for carrying laptops drawbacks include there is no cross strap for the straps - they tend to slide off the shoulders and if it had a cross strap it would be much better also , due to the way its weighted it always falls over when you put it down , which is super annoying it would be better if it woud stand up when placed on the ground
i thought it is thin bag , but it is not that thin moreover as it does n't hold the laptop , when your walking laptop hits back and forth which is the big disadvantage
the only problem for me is that the straps sit little too far apart so it feels like the bag is slipping off down my shoulders this is coming from a guy who 's # feet and has a pretty wide back the bag is pretty good overall i like the color , the zippers , pockets and size
good weight distribution but a bit bulky if you are not looking to spend a lot and want a temporary solution with good space this would be ideal i had to buy a higher end one as well
this is a good backpack , good compartments and materials the build is what concerns me since i really just take two grad classes and use it twice a week with this little use the stitches that hold the top handle have started to give up so it looks good and it 's functional , holds a laptop well , just that workmanship flaw maybe i got a defective one who knows in general i would recommend for the price
i have # inch toshiba laptop and it 's a bit heavy , but the bag has good shoulders support so i do n't feel how heavy it is i wish it had more stuffing for back support , otherwise it looks cool and has lots of
good for the price i use it for college and carry my # . # & # # ; lenovo w # everyday . the water pouch zippers can get loose which is slightly annoying however , theres room for alot of things
i have been using this back pack for about # months in my daily commute it is comfortable , and roomy enough to hold everything i need i do n't usually carry a laptop in it , but it has worked out fine the few times that i have , although the laptop does stiffen the feel of it on your back the side pockets are designed so you can reach back and access them with the pack on your back , which is great for grabbing keys or work ids , or other small items the main compartment has a larger gauge zipper that works well , and has two pulls -lrb- one from either side of the pack -rrb- i wish the front compartment had two zipper pulls , too it only has one , though , so if you need something from that part of the bag , you have to open it most of the way other than that , it has held up well , and has made my commute easier , since i can keep items organized in the pockets
this is a perfect backpack for students with only a couple of books and a laptop it looks nice , is pretty comfortable , and does n't take up a lot of room i 've used it with three books -lrb- one being pretty thin -rrb- , and it 's still ok , but kind of squished if you need to carry # large or # regular books , this is not for you -lrb- the only reason it gets # and not # stars -rrb- i really like the side pockets which are perfect for keeping my charging cord in , and there is plenty of little pockets for odds and ends
not gon na lie , this backpack is huge , but i spent a semester caring my # `` laptop and textbooks in it from class to class and would n't trade it the wide straps meant the weight was more evenly distributed and i can carry all the stuff i need without going back to my dorm
love the bag ; has lots of protection for my laptop , lots of room for books and such only negative is that the straps are rather far apart and they fall off my shoulders often otherwise a great backpack
i 've been using this backpack for class and i am able to carry all my books and laptop pretty easily i think the backpack looks very nice and is made with good quality materials however , the only downside is that it sits on your shoulders a bit wide i personally do n't have much of a problem but i think for some people will find it too wide for their shoulders
this backpack is great if all you are looking to carry is a laptop an a couple of notebooks or a textbook it also has plenty of room for small things in the front pocket i have a # . # & # # ; laptop and could barely fit the laptop into the backpack while it is in another case basically this backpack is meant to hold your laptop without any other case on it overall good quality though it feels good , looks good , and it fits everything else i need to carry very well
the bag was slightly bigger than i expected which means more space for things there 's a load of pockets to put various items in my laptop fits well into this bag and has padding to protect it it simply feels like carrying around a backpack which is what i wanted as the other types the go over your shoulder can be a pain i 've yet to head back to college but after trying it at home it appears to be a great product
at first , the tannin color -lrb- my favorite color -rrb- got my eyes right away since i saw it online the backpack contains all of my necessaries for a whole day at school , even though it looks small outside the computer storage has very thick cushion , so it protects my laptop very well i love this backpack ; and i think it will be with me for years throughout my college time and later
i would have given a five star if there was a little more padding at the bottom using a card board wrapped in hand towel to create some extra padding if you have an # year old you will know why he chipped is other laptop because there was not enough padding at the bottom -lrb- most backpacks do n't have enough padding -rrb- and kids seem to throw their backpacks around i guess second generation middle class kids do n't value things like their parents :
i like this bookbag it has more pockets than i know what to do with , good padding and good straps , and it 's made out of sturdy material -lrb- especially compared to the last bookbag i had -rrb- the only qualms i have is that it does n't have a dedicated place to put a water bottle and it does n't have a snap to hold in your laptop i 've only had to buy one or two laptop bags before this one and they both had those things so i just came to expect it for right now , it 's a great bag for my purposes
i use this pack everyday for class it fits my laptop and a few text books along with the power supply , <unk> , graphing calculator , gaming headset , mouse , glasses , and random extras plenty spacious if you do n't mind not carrying all your textbooks at once very comfortable once you get used to it and break it in seems durable but not as durable as my swiss army bag descent laptop padding but could be a bit better all around it 's a great buy at least for me
case logic rarely disappoints and this item is a another good one it hold my lenovo # & # # ; easily , files , my wallet , make-up bag , cell , nook , magazine , etc . this a good backpack i traveled back east with it , i 've taken it to would everyday for the last almost month i really like it i was looking for something more girly but the reality is tech girls want a good quality pack
i wish it had a double zipper on the small pocket other than that , very happy with it exactly as described and quite comfortable to wear i am a # ' tall lady and it adjust just fine to fit over a winter coat the laptop compartment is very well padded ... no need for an extra sleeve
traditional computer bags are often bulky and not conducive to those on the go this is an exception in the form of a backpack , this bag is ideal for the mobile computer user , it is small , holds your computer and accessories and slings easily on your back as a graduate student , i need something that is not going to weigh me down but still allow you to take all your stuff the back is appropriately padded , with extra padding on the small of the back , and the upper shoulder area and straps are vented for cooling and further comfort the main compartment has a padded space for an average sized computer with a second compartment for books or files the other comparments are suitable for keys and your wallet , and the secondary large compartment has pockets for pens , and other useful items overall a great product , this will become my every day bag as it is small , lightweight and good for me on the go
for the price it was a great item . has many pocket options and the interior look is great i got it for my wife for christmas she is a photographer and loves it fits a <unk> laptop as well
i travel frequently and am constant looking for durable and comfortable carry on bags i like this so much i carry it to work every day and on trips lots of pockets to keep organized and easy to access quick access to laptops and liquids for security
the only flaw is it seems like it should have a back <unk> belt across the front straps , with a clip for support . keeps my stuff safe good store , good product
if you are looking to keep things simple and organized , this is the way to go its comfy , fits your laptop , and enough other things to move around school comfortably if youre looking to carry a lot , this isnt for you its simple and easy to maneuver it even has a front handle which honestly makes it easy to move around when carrying your laptop i would give it a five stars but it does make your back a little sweaty which is a hassle in the summer , but not a problem in the winter
my original -lrb- company issued -rrb- backback finally died i especially like this model as it is a pc backback -lrb- as opposed to a book backpack with a pc compartment -rrb- it is especially compact -lrb- thin -rrb- but with tons of pockets for items -lrb- cables , etc . -rrb- great quality , great price : not too big , not too small , just right
i have been wanting to find a backpack that was n't too big but still had compartments -lrb- i like compartments -rrb- for me this was just right and sits with comfort on my back
i travel year round , all previous backpacks were too big or bulky this is designed just right for me as a someone technical sales guy i fit # x # ft network cables in the front pocket , with a usb battery charger . # . # inch laptop , cables , power supplies it fits snug against my back , helping keep my center of gravity rather than being pulled backwards by a large bag the only thing i wish it had was a clip for keys
it 's very practical if you do n't want to carry a lot of things , it has enough pockets it could be better with an exterior pocket for a bottle of water
this bag was purchased with the intent to carry a # `` laptop and may be few books with some computer & electronic accessories and has been <unk> since purchased i am big guy # `` # , and worn as a school bag kind of looks small but i knew what i was getting and it fits the bill with the color and features listed price sounds reasonable , but it all depends on how long this will last not used in a rain , so not sure if the bag is water proof or will protect the contents nothing super awesome on this bad to give it # * 's . i like it , but time will say if case logic makes quality products or not highly recommended for carry on luggage
this is a nice bag only real issue i have seen using it are the shoulder straps they are wide and cushioning , but if i reach forward or out at all -lrb- as in pulling a suit case -rrb- they <unk> in to my arm it is the only complaint i have but it is a painful one
this is a good-looking and sturdy laptop bag i was looking for something with wide straps -lrb- for extra shoulder support -rrb- and it surely delivers while it has pockets that could be used for carrying small items , it does not have too much space to allow you to carry several books -lrb- was n't looking for that anyway -rrb-
well made - over-sized zipper pulls , durable material , thick lining , layered padding and double stitching two interior pockets , large enough for an external hard drive laptop pocket is incredibly padded exterior pockets are not padded base is not padded overall , exactly what i wanted a bit smaller than i had hoped , but looks and feels good at this price , it was well worth it
low weight is what attracted me to this bag in the first place wish there were a few more pockets to help separate contents , but basically a good commuter bag
i absolutely love this laptop bag before i purchased this i had been using a really expensive timbuk # bag and this case logic backpack is much better it is incredibly comfortable even when being worn for long periods of time , it has just the right number of pockets in just the right places , and the size is perfect the only things i could think of to make it better would be a waterproof pocket for a phone , ipod , wallet , etc . and a velcro strap to secure the laptop in place even without those things it is still my favorite backpack i 've owned
when i initially ordered it was very close to my <unk> for a work trip i honestly did n't think it would arrive before i left however , i was shocked and pleasantly surprised at how quickly it arrived the color is wonderful , much better then the picture represents it has enough space to store everything , including accessories for my computer as well as documents that i needed for work i am so glad that i decided on this purchase , which was originally based on price -lrb- it was much lower then many other bags -rrb- it 's worth every penny and then some
i have # of these because <unk> great at what they do - lots of useful compartments and good price my only suggestion would be another ` papers pocket ' next to the computer inside the bag , but otherwise perfect , in particular the sunglasses pocket on the top , which is a great idea
i 'm still using it , a year after buying it the price makes it worth buying right away i use a # & # # ; laptop in here , with some bulk to it , and this pack carries it very comfortably
i 've had this for a couple of years now and i still like it i use it everyday to carry my laptop to work the straps are comfy and theres enough storage for my power cord my lunch bag and my # & # # ; mac book pro i would buy again
over and over , i return to case logic for dependable , attractive , well made computer cases this time , this backpack case was a gift for a graduating senior she loved it plenty of spacious storage great protection for her laptop so sturdily constructed , she should easily get through four years of college with it another case logic hit
my # year old son loves this bag it fits perfectly on the shoulders and have good back support - very important in a backpack his computer travels well and safe in this bag it 's design is discrete and not loud practical style and medium sized you can not pack so much textbooks here as it 's design is quite slim
the look and feel of this product is amazing the <unk> of this product is that it has space to accomodate your stuff along with the laptop quality of material looks nice lets c how it goes
i was fed up with my shoulder bag which i carried everywhere with me this alternative provided me with an upgrade that exceeded my needs and wants all that remains is to see how long it will last
bought this to protect my new hp envy dv # as i use it for several classes twice a week works like a charm . very roomy for books and laptop along with several other small pockets for pens and <unk> etc . . still would n't go dropping it off of <unk> or throwing it across the room with my laptop but overall its just right for me
i love all the compartments in this thing there 's a place to separate everything that you need to take with you . had it since christmas and the quality seems to great so i highly recommend ! p.s not super huge capacity with this bag so keep that in mind
i <unk> & # # ; t sure at first because it seemed bulky , but my # . # laptop <unk> & # # ; t small to begin with it fit fine without stretching the seams the straps feel good on my shoulder and the pockets are well placed the small sunglass pocket is a nice touch only wish it had a place to hang my keys
i am happy with the product i have received it matched my expectation and a good value for the money . i recommend this to someone who just need a backpack for a laptop with very few other accessories
i love this . its so nice and snug which is awesome since thats what i want when it comes to protecting my laptop . even has room for my cooling stand
here are the pros - sleek and looks trendy with red belt combination - is decent enough to hold a # inch laptop and some stationary like books and gym clothes too - used this for several months and zips are pretty standard and have no issues
i am a college student and have to carry quite a bit of books and misc stuff this has been a great backpack for me holds my laptop , books , and has lots of slots for all my misc stuff -lrb- <unk> : mouse , cords , thumb drives -rrb- the straps are padded and provide a comfortable carry i would recommend this for any student
i have used this bag heavily and it has stayed very clean and has not ripped at all it 's lots of space so it 's good for me as an it person there are also many pockets on the outside and inside it 's beyond worth the money i highly recommend it
this is my second purchase for this backpack , not because my other one is damaged , but because i loved it so much i wanted my husband to use it at well it 's so lightweight i often worry i forgot my laptop it 's comfortable , cool , and the straps are well-cushioned i 've had my backpack -lrb- in red -rrb- for # months and i 'm , admittedly , rough on my backpacks , but there is hardly any sign of wear-and-tear will definitely buy again
i bought this backpack for school to transport my macbook pro even through there is one designed especially for mac because i wanted to keep the sleeve on i like the extra storage space ; it has just the right amount of compartments it appears durable too
i ordered this item on april # and it was by my door on april # . ! ! ! ! ! delivery super fast quality of this product is excellent came in big carton box plus covered inside by plastic bag <unk> of the bagpack awesome has many pockets inside good for travel thank case logic
i really love my backpack you can find it out there i looked for a good backpack for months until i check amazon and found this one i can carry my laptop , my binders , books and more it can look tight but it is not
i have a # & # # ; laptop with a # -cell battery and it fits perfectly -lrb- with a little room to spare -rrb- it fits everything i need for my weekly trips in terms of electronics -lrb- ipad , headphones , notebook , chargers for all , bluetooth headset -rrb- i also have personal items like sunglasses , gum , receipt and business card holder there is plenty of room for other items as well fits perfectly on top of my suitcase when trekking through the airport and under the seat on the plane as well i may just buy another one to keep in storage incase they stop making them
wanted something other than a regular school backpack top carry my laptop around , and this one is perfect for my hp envy the padded section gives the laptop gets some cushioning just in case you drop the backpack plenty of little compartments for mice , cables , usb drives , you name it excellent quality too , does n't feel cheap at all for the price you ca n't go wrong
this bag works great for my # & # # ; macbook pro my computer feels safe just sitting in the slot but there is even room to put my laptop in a sleeve and fit that in the slot a little hard to keep everything organized but for the price it was well worth it
i was really impressed by the quality and how big it is yet how small it looks i recently went on a weekend trip and was able to fit my thinkpad , several changes of clothes and <unk> in this bag no problem the straps are really wide so there was no pain on the shoulders and had more than enough space to store every cable and charger i needed it also looks great with the red accents such as the pull strings and some lining overall a really great bag
bought this for work to carry my laptop and it is a really nice bag and the quality is superb i would recommend this bag to anyone who 's looking for one
i have purchased several bags in the past for my work laptop ... backpacks , sleeves , and shoulder bags i have finally found the one there is room for laptop & accessories , files , smartphone , keys , and personal items so i do n't have to carry a purse i wish there were more color options but i do like the red the other cool thing ... there are velcro pieces to secure the access strap so they are not hanging down
i got this bag for my sister for hs , and she 's obsessed with it it more than fits her needs , she absolutely loves it she says it is very comfortable and has the compartments she needs and generally is a perfect bag
- cozy tablet compartment separate from laptop housing - aesthetic <unk> zipper - mediocre comfort -lrb- lumbar , trap and shoulder support easily <unk> - face handle provides excellent `` grab ' n go `` convenience - so many pockets you 'll take an extra moment searching - key
i bought this one for the roommate i have the red one i always get people asking me where i get these at probably one of the best backpacks i 've ever
this is a great backpack my wife bought one of these at an airport store i & # # ; borrowed & # # ; it for a couple of business trips , hoping that she might forget i had it she 's always way ahead of me though and took it back , so i bought my own identical pack it 's quite comfortable to wear - much more so than most backpacks plenty of room inside for your computer , ipad , books and whatever , and a good number of compartments too i 've never gotten quite so excited by a backpack -lrb- true ! -rrb- the only thing i 'd like which it does n't have is a convenient place to put a water bottle but that 's a minor gripe , maybe worth a <unk> of a star in the rating otherwise , just love it
was looking for a bag that would fit my monster # . # & # # ; msi gt # one , and not look like i was going on a camping trip the bag is slim -lrb- for a laptop bag -rrb- but yet i feel like the laptop is well protected , and i can still fit in a pair of headphones , and the huge ac brick
i have used this on two trips and it is perfect for my ipad , charging cords , headphones , sunglasses and paperwork for any travel plans act i now have one place for all of these items so i do n't have to rummage through my jacket pockets or wife 's purse etc . .
bought it for my son who is on his way back to college he uses it to carry his lap top and books and loves it he tells me it feels really well made
this backpack is perfect for work and should cover all your needs i the bag for the price is very good i am very happy with the quality too this back pack has plenty of pockets and holds everything i need it also have a very rugged handle , i ca n't complain one bit i would buy it again for sure
great quality bag fits laptop , and about # normal sized text books along with some other small stuff in the front pocket fairly comfortable and a good price for what you 're getting here
i got this bag for uni and it just awesome it fits lots of notebooks or books event with the laptop on i love the top pocket that it has as it makes it easy to store a mouse for easy access
received on time and was pleased with the purchase it is exactly as described and holds my electronics with room to spare for a light wind breaker it will become a regular item to travel with
was pleasantly surprised by how much this can hold i 've been using this not only for my work pc but as my bag for one day business trips and it is doing very well
the more books you add to the bag the more comfortable it is on your back and shoulder the many compartments help keep things in order and its very cute
i ordered this backpack for using with a hp laptop , an ipad and two cell phones while there is extra padding and one padded compartment which are useful , i 'm not sure this has enough extra bits to really make it stand out from other packs the main compartments are just generic ones overall it 's well built and quite useful for hauling things
given the price and some of the reviews that said it does n't have enough padding , i was a bit worried when placing the order but glad that i did it is a good backpack it has good padding to hold my laptop it was the area that 's in front of the laptop holder where people usually put books does n't have any padding in the bottom it might be a turn off for others , but i think thats just fine i would n't put anything delicate there anyway it feels comfortable , i have been taking it to work daily since purchase and so far i love it
it is a cheap bag , that is not so common and would do what you want it looks more beautiful than the price , people would n't know it is very cheap except you tell them yourself
this backpack holds my laptop , charging cable , lunch , external <unk> drive , papers , and more easily it 's comfortable , small enough to not be a hassle , and comes with plenty of pockets for various smaller items like pens , cables , hand <unk> , etc .
just as expected not too big and not too small fits my laptop and ipad but could also fit my notebook not much else will fit bought to use as my # nd carry on when travelling
this backpack have enough space to store all the things i need to carry i use it for work and college sometimes i have hp dv # . # & # # ; and it fit very well i recommend it to any one who is looking for a laptop backpack
i have a lenovo y # p laptop and this backpack is the perfect fit for my gaming machine the backpack provides good padding -lrb- for laptop protection -rrb- and number of storage compartments for your laptop accessories the look and build quality of this backpack is excellent
bought one for my new acer # . # laptop , everything related to my laptop and my nintendo dsi fits in this case nicely i also bought this sleeve -lsb- ... -rsb- which was a nice addition for protecting my machine
