the case itself was very sturdy and hard to take off i find that really helpful because i do n't plan to take it off the keyboard is nice and protective but its a silicone keyboard cover so do n't expect to do some speedy typing with that thing on the only concern is i had a small chip about the size of an ant and it was n't a big deal to me so i chose not to make a big deal out of it just an fyi for you pet <unk> out there overall , i would recommend this product to other macbook air users
it works well fits snuggle on my # macbook pro i even bought one for my mom the only thing i do n't like is the keyboard cover it is very cheap
the hard case was difficult to fit onto my machine initially , however after some trouble putting it on i absolutely adored how it fit my machine i bought it in turquoise , and i really love how it looks the keyboard cover and screen protecter are great bonuses for the price overall it 's a great buy , just be aware that the cover is hard to snap into place
received the package in a timely manner packaging was in good shape the case fits perfectly , snapping on easily and will not come off unless i intend for it to the key pad fits and feels good , only error with it is my arrow keys and a few surrounding keys , you can see the black through it because its not perfectly centered on the keys its a print error because the cover fits over the actual buttons fine for the price i satisfied with it and it actually feels like it hugs the keys better than the one i bought at the apple store for $ # hopefully it holds up the screen over seems to fit perfect but i have n't put it on yet to know how easy it is and if there are a lot of bubbles after install i will update my post once i do
i spent ages surfing on my <unk> macbook pro before ordering this case my biggest fear with buying a case online was how the tabs to hold the case on would <unk> with my wrists but the maker clearly thought about both that and making it easier to get on and off i was quite skeptical of the foam pads on the bottom but they seem stable enough i will update if/when they do this almost got a four from me because the color is n't quite as vibrant as the main picture and that was one of my bigger decision factors but it matches the bottom two so it is still quite pretty the feel is quite nice and so far does n't show finger prints the screen protector is a nice one the keyboard protector will take a little getting used to but it fits pretty well i wish it had a little more weight in the edges so dust could n't slip through so easily and there are a few <unk> in it but for what you pay for the package , not worth <unk> all and all , a good case
love the color this case was about # dollars cheaper then the case i purchased at the apple store i love the key guard thing keeps the crumbs out of my computer
i love this case , i got it right away and fit my macbook pro with perfection get this case , you wo n't regret it it 's so soft and the color is exactly the same as the picture i highly recommend this case its the best
fits my macbook perfect , nice feel the keyboard cover is a little weird feeling since the edges of the cover for each key is a little high , it feels differently to type , but i do n't use the keyboard cover
this purchase was a good one it provides perfect protection for my new laptop and is the perfect shade of pink my favorite color you need to get use to the keyboard cover but once you do , it 's no big deal
works great and is very cute ! seems like it will last the keyboard cover is not what i hoped but its okay i guess i 'm still getting use to it
great value , love the color ! ! -lrb- i got the royal blue -rrb- the screen protector was simple to put on , the top and bottom shell snapped right into place the keyboard skin is taking me a bit longer to get use to , it feels really awkward to type with but i 'm sure i 'll get use to it eventually but other than that i 'm really happy with this product my only regret is that i did n't order it sooner lol ... my mac had a nasty fall the day after i had ordered this through amazon but thankfully now it 's covered : -rrb-
i love my case , product came as described and fit my macbook pro perfect color is amazing fast delivery and everyone just loves it i am ready to order another color oh and what a great way to protect my macbook
the cover looks pretty -lrb- i got the turquoise one -rrb- and fits perfectly it makes your computer quite a bit heavier , but it 's definitely worth the protection i really like that together with the cover you also get the keyboard and the screen covers thumb up for really fast shipping too
the material is good and quite lightweight obviously , i ca n't really test the level of protection but it would definitely cushion the mac against minor drops or spills anything more and it would probably not help the extra slot in the fron is a nice touch the reason why it 's not a # for me is because the fit -lsb- which is my single most important <unk> for a sleeve , really -rsb- is not good at all the mac bounces around quite a bit -lsb- a <unk> for me - i 'm using it for the late # model -rsb- which is obviously not desirable
this was a nice case for the price , as it was much cheaper than other <unk> cases it 's not the most sharp looking case , but it does the job and i like the pockets as i said , the price indicated the quality but it was a good purchase
very unique and i get a lot of compliments fairly good fit with a little extra room flap closes awkwardly if you put items in the pockets , so i do n't use them
bought this for my macbook and it does the job keeping it protected when i travel the macbook power cords are pretty thick and do not fit well into the case but i 'm the case is the perfect size for just toting the laptop around
product looks as pictured and is very functional there are also small pockets which are useful the only reason this product is not # stars is that i find the felt to rub off a bit after continued use
i ordered this product for my macbook pro # . # inch and it works great the only problem i have <unk> it is that it is slightly too big my laptop and that kind of bothers me other than that its a great sleeve
i have been using this case now going on # months and i must say it is fantastic simple is the best way to describe this case it has a great cloth texture with a really soft micro fiber lining to keep your ultrabook safe i could not be happier and would repurchase if something happened to my original if you are looking for a simple case that will keep your macbook air nice and safe during transport i would definitely recommend this item
i just got my # & # # ; mbp with retina display a couple weeks ago so i have the latest model but i 'm not sure how it compares in size to the older models anyway , the sleeve is perfect it looks great , the felt is pretty thick , and has a nice lining my mbp slides in and out easily the pockets and pen loop are a nice touch they could easily hold a small notebook and pen for <unk> down notes keep in mind that this is not a case there is no handle or straps this is just a sleeve to protect it when you 're taking it to the coffee shop or when you put it in your book bag so it does n't get dust and dirt from you book bag in it
i really love this case it performs exactly as promised and looks and feels amazing i get compliments on it daily at work and school and would absolutely recommend this product to anyone looking for a functional and pretty case
i love it . i especially love the fact that it is made out of felt . it has a couple of really neat compartments . i just wished it came in more colors
you should get this case even if you do n't have a laptop to put inside it trust me -- it 's like having a furry friend to cuddle up with at night if you 're feeling down it 's a piece of your <unk> 's delicious home cooking it 's <unk> , it 's lovely it 's not super tight around your # `` laptop and i imagine the laptop does n't feel at home without its best friend nearby
it 's unique that you hear from customer service , just to make sure you 're happy with your order the sleeve fits my new lenova yoga pro # ultrabook perfectly the little inside slide pockets fit my ultra slim lg external dvd drive and usb cord without any added bulk the look of the sleeve is classic , and i really am happy i purchased it the black elastic strap that secures the flap closure gives added security when you have to slip this sleeve into a larger laptop for travel i highly recommend this sleeve
the cover is soft and lightweight , looks sleek i even got a compliment from my boss on it , the band also allows me to keep is secure when carrying it around
i 've got an older , thicker macbook pro unibody that always has a bluetooth dongle plugged in the usb port it fit snugly and slips easily in/out of the sleeve i 've found myself carrying less since i can usually just slip my laptop , maybe a magazine , and a few business cards into the front pocket and i 'm ready to go incredible value and so very very well worth it
fits my # & # # ; macbook pro perfectly , with enough room for a file folder and pens i 've gotten lots of compliments on it & # # ; everyone is shocked when i tell them how cheap it was
after looking at dozens of laptop sleeves , i chose this one for my # & # # ; macbook laptop my # & # # ; fits snugly in this sleeve the felt material is heavyweight , offering good protection , but not as bulky as other covers it 's perfect for slipping inside of a briefcase or carrying bag it can also be used alone , to carry the laptop there are # small outer pockets -lrb- located under the flap -rrb- but neither are large enough to accomodate the power cord the elastic band has held up to heavy use and shows no signs of & # # ; stretching out & # # ; the flap is also a nice cushy base for the laptop when setting it on a flat surface note that this cover does not offer protection from moisture
this is a simple felt macbook carrying sleeve and i have really found it to be much more useful than i anticipated it feels nice and is pretty good quality especially for what you pay for it on the inside there are a few little spots for your things for <unk> i 'm much happier with this than i ever would have expected
this looks great , feels nice , and is just the right size for my early # rmbp # & # # ; i also bought one for my sister who has a # white macbook # & # # ; , also a great fit
do not buy this is the second speck case i bought for my macbook pro # & # # ; -lrb- first time thinking i just ordered the wrong size -rrb- i was wrong this item will not fit your mac i would advise going to an actual store -lrb- best buy , staples , etc . -rrb- and buy one so they can help you plus it came damaged and scratched when i opened it
i was very excited to receive this case because my husband was super satisfied with the one he had ordered a week prior the satin touch makes the case a little bit softer and the minute i put the <unk> on the edges started to crack it is not been long and i have n't dropped or been rough with my computer and it is barely hanging on would love to get it replaced but having trouble with getting a response i inquired awhile back and still have not heard back needless to say i am not very happy
it cracks and i 've been using it for only about # weeks what 's the <unk> point of buying a case that probably needs further encasement and protection i do n't get it
i 've had to buy # of these things over the course of a year and they have both broken i do n't do anything that extreme with my computer , and put it in an additional case when i take it outside of my house i 'll be going with an incase case next time for my computer i would not buy this product
it looks nice but it adds bulkiness to the laptop and does n't protect well after a year or so of having the speck case i decided to remove the case my laptop had scratches all over it the case allowed dust and debris inside the debris moved between the speck case and my laptop and over time did considerable damage to the exterior of my laptop i expected my laptop to look like new underneath the case and it looks pretty bad i guess you could clean the inside of the case daily to prevent this from happening but i did n't know that was required in addition , the speck case itself was not resistant to scratches it began to dull
i 'd stay away from this case i 'm on my third one they chip and crack so easy last one i got was less than a month ago and it 's already cracked on the sides and underneath with no travel involved or any unusual activity just in the backpack to and from work save yourself the hassle and get a different product
the satin see-thru cover for the macbook air # -lrb- # -rrb- fits well , and i like the feel of the satin finish however it is made out of cheap material i have only had it for less than a month , and internal cracks are starting to show i do not recommend this product
i ordered the hard shell case for my # & # # ; with retina because it fit perfect and looked great since it was so great , i went ahead and ordered the same one but this time for our # & # # ; macbook air since it was sold by amazon.com , i got it out of the package and threw away the box and slip without even thinking twice i was later very disappointed when i put the case on the macbook air only to see that the back corner pieces do not clip to the top like they are supposed to shame on me for throwing everything away before putting the case on the laptop ... now i am stuck with a perfect fit on the top piece and a flimsy fit on the bottom piece be careful when ordering
i received a black satin speck cover for my # & # # ; macbook air at christmas -lrb- dec # , it 's now may # -rrb- i love the looks but the bottom component started to develop cracks at the rear , near the magsafe and thunderbolt ports i contacted speck , was told that nothing could be done without a receipt , which i did not have since then , the base component has basically disintegrated , and i noted when i took it off that there was some scuffing of my air 's case , which further adds to my dislike the top cover continues to do its work well , but speck 's <unk> to take care of what seems to be a design or materials flaw makes me <unk> to recommend this product or purchase anything more from speck
ok , so i got this product maybe a year ago ? maybe more , anyways , its been a while after using this case , and almost never taking it off for a year , i have discovered that this product has done more damage than not i 'm sure this is the same with any case , but using this case , things get in between the case and computer , and constantly <unk> against the computer has destroyed my computer 's resale value the bottom part of the case seems to do the worst , with the top part of the case seeming to be a lot better anyways , be aware if you plan to use this case for a long time
the case is very beautiful , however , in only about a month or so of use , one of the tabs has broken off and the case is not completely secure on this computer strange how this happens just a day after my return window <unk> it costs too much for such a cheap product i will not be purchasing any products from speck again
within a year , it began to show cracks , and then pieces started chipping off and , i am very gently with my electronics , no children , etc . since speck was so expensive , i thought i 'd give topcase a try i 've been really happy lots of colors , every inexpensive , and seems durable so far
i ordered this product twice ; the first time i received it the corner of the bottom half of the case was already broken so it could not attach to my laptop the second time i received it , the case cracked when i put it on my laptop and then the corner broke off again not impressed , considering the money you have to spend for it and then it breaks
i bought this product in august # i had to replace it because it started to fall apart around the corner are cracked and breaking off i would n't recommend this product it is not durable
i have the purple matte finish # `` it looks nice and fits well , but the corners on the bottom near the back hinge have cracked and fallen off , so now the corners have no protection i do n't travel with my laptop and have only used it around the house it seems quite flimsy for the price i would not recommend this case
my first speck case cracked # months after purchasing it they replaced it promptly , but # months later , the new case is now cracked even worse than the first i rarely use my laptop , and never move it farther than from the coffee table to the couch for getting such little use , i do n't understand how the corners are constantly cracking i wo n't be purchasing another one
i have a june # macbook air # & # # ; and the case does have ports for the new dual mic , which is just what i was looking for the color is great the texture is nice ; very soft but it does track fingerprints a lot easier than i thought it would the clips do n't exactly stay snapped on the bottom cover i have to press them back into place every few days also , the top cover makes the screen heavier than i 'd like when i 'm using it at a certain angle , the screen will just fall all the way back
product lasts much longer than the ones you buy off of ebay but i was expecting something more durable that could withstand shutting my laptop without chipping it did just that and that why i give it three stars love the color
loved the color , loved the protection it offers however , the little tabs holding the case onto my laptop are weak and two of the four on the bottom half are already gone
i love the material and color the piece for the top cover snaps on # corners and not the fourth it falls off constantly i like speck and previous covers have been great i am disappointed this time
i want to start by saying i love speck products with that being said , this particular case needs to be redesigned my wife wanted a cover to prevent scratches on her new macbook air have had this less then a month and the clips have already broken the laptop gets minimal use and has not been dropped unlike the cases designed for our iphones , this has not held up and keeps coming off , defeating the purpose be cautious as this will let you down
great looking case with an awesome fit i recommend it for all who want some protection for their macbooks if you want maximum protection , get this and put it in a carrier case
# % of me loves this product it is a good hard case for my macbook air -lrb- late # -rrb- , and i feel confident putting it in my bag without any additional protection there are two snap on pieces -- one for the bottom and one for the top very easy to clip into place my one complaint is that the bottom piece , near the track pad , bubbles out a little everywhere else , the case is flush against the laptop , but in this one spot , it <unk> out drives me crazy i sent in for a replacement , but the replacement was even worse than the first so i kept the original case and i try to ignore the one little area where it does n't sit flush overall , a good product
i had an older version of this case and it was snug . the top part literally will not come off the bottom was a lot more snug on the old version , there is a slight gap under the mouse pad and gets a little annoying it 's a great case though , there is a reason i bought another one i love it
my daughter wanted this to protect her new macbook air and i agreed she loves the way it looks i love that it protects her computer we are both happy
i have read other reviews about this product but i have not experienced any of the negative things mentioned fit my macbook air model just fine nice and tight : -- rrb- -rrb- nothing broken i love the soft touch
this case is super light and has such a rich texture it goes on very easily , and you get to see your apple logo right through the back of it it 's nice to have my mac protected without adding extra weight
i do n't understand the problems others are reporting mine went on perfectly and functions perfectly the color is a dream for a purple lover like me i get my laptops dirty from so much use i wipe this one off every few days as you c an see grease , etc . very easily , so it is actually helping me to keep it clean
this case is perfect for my # -inch macbook pro it 's a really lovely color , and it fits perfectly it came really quickly , and , despite what some people say , it fits in a sleeve with the case on just fine it has a few scratches already -lrb- i 've had it about a month -rrb- but they 're not noticeable
this arrived right on time and was a perfect gift for my cousin the color is a slightly more plum than purple shade of the picture , but not too far off it is made to fit the air and did so without any complications , just snaps right on i have taken it off to clean and is fine in soap and water
i love the case its perfect for what i needed and it fits great i love that it allows me to see the decal i have on my laptop looks brand new even though it is not and it has no damage whats so ever
it looked as if it was worth # dollars and smelled horrible the strap around the bag was so plastic , it looked as if it was ready to fall off already do n't waste your money i returned mine the day i got it
nice bag but the emblem on the front flap has come lose one corner has pulled out of the rivet the wide strap makes wearing it accross my body very comfortable
this was just big enough for the ipad and not much else i like the bag , but would have liked it more if i could fit my wallet and a few small things in it as well without it bulging out or looking overly stuffed
this bag seems fairly well made i do n't know how it 'll hold up , but it seems easy enough to repair i had two issues # -rrb- the way it was wrapped -lrb- in paper -rrb- , one of the flaps was folded over and the belt was twisted so i had to iron it before i could use it # -rrb- the leather emblem on the front is made of such thin fabric that in a <unk> environment it <unk> and <unk> i think i 'll replace it with something else last thing , the front -lrb- small -rrb- pocket is the perfect size to hold my ipad air in it 's smart case nicely , leaving tons of room inside for maybe # bottles of beer
seems durable and fits more than i expected i put my headphones in the case , ipad , phone , and there 's still another small pocket with room for my passport , keys , etc . i fly often , so it 'll come in handy
just what i need to carry my ipad around with the <unk> keyboard , there is no handle so i needed a carrying case and this with all its additional pockets works just fine it will come in very handy when i travel
this product was better than what i expected its a little bit bigger than the photos but i 'm okay with that i seen a bunch of these bags on amazon for # dollars then i saw this one for so much less , and it has prime shipping definitely worth it
i just purchased an ipad and wanted to be able to carry it safely , this is perfect for all my stuff i also purchased one for each of my grandkids to carry theirs ones a boy and one is girl and they both love the style of the bag
i am really pleased with this bag i was a little skeptical after reading the reviews regarding the zippers i have had no trouble with the zippers they work fine the quality is very good and i would recommend to anyone wanting a bag such as this
i love the bag , i could fit my ipad air , my lunch container and bose noise cancelling headphones wish they would make a leather version , would buy it right away
i bought this bag for a trip to africa , and in the airport because my other bags are either to big and flip thing a sound inside them , or are to small and i cant bring my ipad i 'm quite happy with it because i have a & # # ; survival & # # ; protection case that is very bulky on it and the pockets are still roomy
i bought this hoping it would fit my # inch macbook air it barely , barely does , you have to <unk> it a little , but it does and i really like that
arrived on time and in good condition pretty good size , love all the pockets inside and out i use it to carry my tablet and anything else that i might need if you are looking for a nice small bag to carry the small things you like having around this is the bag for you :
sleeve fits just ok the sleeve <unk> down at the bottom like the mba does and this puts a lot of pressure on the y # p when you push it <unk> <unk> sleeve it also leaves all of the ports exposed the velcro could be a little more <unk> this one will be going back
cons - very tight fit for a # . # & # # ; lenovo -lrb- be prepared for lots of <unk> to get your lenovo out of the case - shoddy sewing of inner velcro <unk> - colour is as shown in photo - essentially does what i purchased it to do
this is a very nice case it fits my lenovo yoga # pro perfectly . the only reason that i rate this item # is because the velcro doesnt stick together very well . it was also delivered on
exactly what i needed right now my only complaint is a small part of the sewing on the flap area is a bit off , but it does not affect the overall usefulness of the envelope perfect for my macbook pro w/retina display
the case , for what i wanted from it is very nice good looks , simple nice <unk> my hp spectre laptop <unk> it in my roller <unk> am very happy with the product
i purchased this leather envelope case for my new samsung ativ book # plus # . # ultrabook laptop the case is made well and my laptop fits as if they were made for each other very happy i purchased this case and not the $ # samsung sleeve
i first purchased one for myself it fit my brand new macbook air perfectly it was soo pretty a couple months later i saw that one of my coworkers had purchased herself a macbook air too , she was having a bad day so i decided to give my easyacc , she was so happy after a few days went by and i decided to <unk> my order and ordered another
absolutely astounding find for an unbelievable price it fits my macbook air like a glove , offering great protection in a very classy sleeve it holds the laptop securely without being so tight you have to pry it out -lrb- at least for the slender air version of macbook -rrb- the makers were smart to leave the sides open near the top so things like your wireless mouse usb can safely sit in the usb port without potentially damaging pressure velcro could be a tiny bit stronger but the & # # ; lid & # # ; stays closed so no complaint here great item , well worth the money
i well fit my macbook air i love it very much nice color and very thin next year , i will buy one more easyacc when i buy another macbook air again , thank you i really love it
this was a well reviewed product and i agree the construction is very good and it is lightweight as well it is a perfect fit for my samsung ativ book # plus it does n't add much bulk and is easy to hold and carry
i use this for my hp # t- # envy -lrb- # & # # ; -rrb- and it fits and works great the elastic down the sides is positioned such that i can plug in my power cable and leave my wireless mouse connector in all the time which is handy simple , clean looking , great price and well made
lenovo yoga # pro owner here got this one and the magnetic red one bad news the red cheaper made and too tight for the yoga # pro now this one i am ordering a second one , because the build quality is fantastic , you could show up on a <unk> jet in an <unk> and it would look perfectly matched the fit is just perfect one swipe and the velcro detaches , the yoga does not fall out very protective interior highly recommend to yoga # pro owners , the quality for price is unbeatable
i got this sleeve for my wife 's new acer s # before she went to europe to lecture i was a bit concerned that it , unlike her , looks <unk> and male but she loved it in fact , i 'd say she likes it better than the computer inside it 's solid , and well made the velcro closure is secure a competing sleeve has a magnetic closure this one fits snugly , but easily it really is perfect for an acer s #
barely fits on computer and very difficult to take on and off because it is so tight also making a return with this company has been nothing but difficult not a satisfied customer
its a great color and that is the reason why i am giving it two stars i have a # . # inch macbook pro and it is a very snug fit , i got annoyed with trying to get it in and out of the sleeve so i stopped using it i also noticed that the grey lining started to come off after a few months not worth it
be forewarned - this sleeve gives off a very strong and unpleasant chemical odor that takes weeks to dissipate this product works as advertised - a simple sleeve that offers some protection for a notebook however i was hit by a really bad chemical odor upon unwrapping the sleeve from its plastic bag i do not consider myself particularly sensitive to such things but the smell was really overwhelming - i could not even keep it in the house running it through the washer did not help so i left the sleeve hanging outside for a few weeks over time the odor gradually dissipated and is now essentially gone ; or at least tolerable
i like the case a lot and the color is perfect it is snug though , if you have a hard case on your laptop it wo n't fit into this one
bought this case for my daughter 's mac she loves the color purple and we had a hard time finding the right color when <unk> this one i was a little concerned because it seemed bright in the picture but it arrived and she was happy with it i ` <unk> pleased that it looks sturdy and that it will give her some protection from scratches , dents or whatever since she <unk> always with her when she travels highly recommend it to keep your mac safe , and yes it is pretty it is a bright purple
it came extremely fast , the only thing that was a set back was the color i was expecting a darker pink and it ended up be a little lighter then expected
love this case i use a hard plastic case on my macbook pro , but it 's nice to be able to keep the plastic one on and use this <unk> soft one around that too fits perfectly , great buy for the money and you can throw it in the washer if it gets dirty
very thin and perfect for the macbook air i needed something to protect my macbook air from <unk> when i put it in my purse and this is perfect no additional bulk or weight , but protects my computer from <unk> and anything else i throw in my purse
really cute and light stretches so that when i put a case on my laptop it still fit be sure to touch with clean hands because of course lighter colors show dirt easier but that 's nobody 's fault but my own
i purchased this for my brand new # inch macbook pro retina display and it fits like a glove i found the quality very good and although it is a tight fit , it goes on and comes off rather easily
i expected these to be larger to be comfortable with my hands it turns out that these are sized for smaller hands can i get my hands in them yes , but it is tight
the quality of the neoprene kitchen set is excellent but the pattern on them is not the <unk> gold leaves they are a gold , grey and black chevron pattern i am disappointed that the product is not what i thought it was however , i am pleased with the quality
