the case is great it is well padded , fits the # `` macbook pro perfectly , and has a zippered pocket for the charger as well as a special place to slip a usb drive -lrb- and it looks nice , to boot !
this notebook sleeve for the macbook pro # `` seems to be a very good fit there is very little wiggle room when loaded it also seems to be of good construction my only complaint is the color i wish i had been given choices instead of black at any rate , the main idea is to protect the macbook , which it appears to be very capable of doing i like the side pouch for carrying smaller items such as a flash drive , which has a smaller pouch included inside i looked for quite a while and tried some other sleeves , but this one seems to be the only one that will work for me in addition , the price is very reasonable
this case fits my # `` macbook pro very well not to tight , nor is it too lose the zipper seems to work great and the padding inside is very soft construction seems to be good , so it will likely last for a long time
i have purchased quite a few laptop sleeves over the years and the caselogic # inch macbook sleeve has the best design of any the <unk> compartment holds charger , usb memory stick and a bluetooth mouse while not design to sustain a drop of any significant <unk> , the padding offers protection from bumps or scratches
this case fits the macbook very well it 's thin but padded enough to provide moderate protection i have found that it 's all you need there is a corner pocket that can hold the power supply cord
this case fits the macbook pro <unk> i also store the magic <unk> the little side pocket so taht i can throw this all together into my backpack great built <unk> and soft interior to protect laptop
man this is a great little laptop case is was affordable and still met my expectations quality wise extra side pocket for plug and small drives , it shipped out and arrived on time i shopped several other brands but fell that i got the best deal for my money if you need one pick this one up
this sleeve was just what i was looking for it 's affordable and of great quality its sway material on the inside is great for not scratching my macbook -lrb- # in . -rrb- , which fits snuggly within the sleeve i do not have the macbook pro , but the white one , therefore , i do n't know if the pro , which is a bit bigger will fit there is an outside pocket for one to store the charger and even a flash drive which is so convenient the zipper runs on two sides on the sleeve which makes it easy to just slip out the laptop and then slip it back in and if you really look at the sleeve from the inside , you 'll notice that it actually looks like a sleeve within a sleeve it does n't actually have two zippers or anything , but there is this fabric that acts as protectors that get in between your laptop and the zipper so that the zipper wo n't scratch your laptop the zipper is also of noticeably great quality
i bought this for my <unk> # & # # ; portable led monitor it does the job of protecting the monitor and traveling well case logic makes great products so i 'm very happy with the quality of the product
got this for my son for his # `` mac book pro he loves it fits the laptop and charger and a few papers for trips to the library at school
after reading some of the not so favorable reviews i was n't sure if i had ordered the right sleeve for my macbook pro as it stands i am absolutely happy with the product this sleeve fits my new # `` # macbook pro like a glove and offers <unk> protection . the build quality of <unk> case is top notch and the zipper does not come close to touching the macbook pro great job caselogic !
came fast and quick , and it was just what i was <unk> for the pocket on the side is convenient for usbs or a charger , and my # inch laptop fits very nicely
i received this in a <unk> after placing the order it is for my macbook pro # inch , purchased january of # it is a great fit , hugs nice and firm but still an easy slide to close without scratching it is neoprene , so it has that random chemical smell all neoprene seems to come with , but easily resolved with a shot of febreeze and an few nights with a sheet of bounce inside overall love it for the price , especially after looking at similar items for upwards of $ # the extra sleeve looks odd when you stick stuff in it , but is convenient and i love the memory stick slot
my brother ordered this case for his mac book pro and it fit great the additional pocket for the charger has come in handy we are glad we found this on amazon
i wanted a sleeve for my new macbook pro and researched several products for quality and price the caselogic sleeve is not only the perfect fit for my macbook but the price was great thanks for such a great product
this concerns how it is used with the rmbp it 's not a snug <unk> , you have about an extra half inch of room for me i 'm going to be storing <unk> <unk> notebook <unk> it and it will fit though it is not a snug fit , it 's still protected pretty darn well the outer sleeve i have my charger , the extension cord that came with the rmbp , and a flash drive if you want a more detailed review , there 's plenty others that describe exactly how i like it , look for some of the # star reviews though , it smells of rubber for the first few days
i like the size and fit of this case i bought this one for the pocket so that i can carry around the plug in a separate section from the laptop so far , so good
i bought this case to for my boyfriend to protect his new macbook he uses for work since he 's a computer <unk> , protecting his computer is <unk> and caselogic was a great choice to do that this little case has been great through multiple airplane trips and being jostled around in multiple bags it 's super light too and the little pocket in the front is perfect for a mouse , charging cords , or both it 's a great pick that you wo n't regret
perfect for a lightweight travel case . can fit the power cord in outside pocket . or headphones or screen wipes . has lasted # + years with no issues , still looks like new
i really like this sleeve ! it fits my # `` macbook , and the pocket is great ! i am an online college student , and i am constantly going to my friends house to study , and having everything in one backpack is almost necessary
there 's not much to say it fits the macbook pro # -inch perfectly even with my hard-shell case on the protection seems superb with extra padding on the corners and sides , and the interior has a soft lining so it wo n't scratch your mbp there ; s even an extra zipper area in which i keep a sync cable , my usb drive , and my extra charger
this case was absolutely perfect the materials are soft yet durable the extra zipper pocket is amazing too it fits the power adapter with ease , and with a lot more room to spare for like a mouse , usb or other random bits great price , fast shipping , and overall a must buy do n't spend the extra money at the apple store buying their selection of cases this was perfect
got this for my new macbook , super soft on the inside and outside not too bulky so it fits in my backpack well , but it has enough foam padding where it is protected from my text books or if my bad were to fall my bag actually fell down my entire <unk> end over end and there was n't a scratch or ding on my laptop front pocket provides handy storage for power brick and a special slot for a flash drive for the price , you ca n't do better
we all like <unk> when we sleep - so does my mac , and this one keeps things clean comfortable and safe it 's fits my mbp # perfectly and keeps it from being bounced around and getting dusty
so many people here are saying that the case is a little roomy this might be true for newer macbooks without the disc drive , i am not certain however , my older macbook pro that does have the cd drive fits perfectly the case very much fits like a glove , there is no wiggle room at all the case feels very protective it has a thick padding , and the corners feel quite protected from potential dents this was definitely a good purchase for me
this case is <unk> taller than my # `` macbook pro , but fits is well regardless i 'm not concerned about it sliding around inside , because it is very close the material is just stretchy enough to hold a power adapter and display adapter in the outside pocket the tiny slot inside for a flash drive is a nice addition
this is exactly what i hoped i was having a hard time finding a sleeve designed for my # `` macbook pro everything was either a generic # `` laptop case or a small netbook sleeve i carry my laptop in a backpack quite a bit , and i just wanted a sleeve to keep the exterior of the laptop in good shape for me , this sleeve is perfect if the external pocket is part of your consideration -lrb- it was n't for me -rrb- then you might want to know that it 's not really big enough for both your cord and an external mouse
the product is perfect that it fits so well with my mac pro # inch additionally , it is light but with some sort of spongy pad inserted , which help protect the laptop the small pocket out can help you solve the problem of carrying the charger i love it by the way , do not worry about the zip scratching , because there is some space between your laptop and the zip to ensure the safety
i very much like the inner material . nice protection against bumps or drops -lrb- i indeed had one and laptop was still quite safe -rrb- . quality of zips , material are great . i 've been using this with my x # -cell . . laptop fits perfectly .
the <unk> , no-nonsense case you can get for a # . # & # # ; macbook i researched this heavily and am very pleased with this product excellent value and the pocket in the front is surprisingly handy for the charger , usb cables and flash drives it even has an internal pouch specifically for storing a flash drive
this case is absolutely great it fits the macbook pro just right ... not too snug where the zipper cant close and not too loose where it moves around inside the case 's stretchy material allows you to put papers and documents along with the computer , keeping them nice and neat inside finally , the outside pocket is the best it allows room for the charger so you dont ahve to put them in the same pouch , risking scratching your <unk> computer with the charger it also has a little pocket for a usb drive , which is perfect for someone like me who always <unk> their usb a + all around : style , usefulness ,
for $ # how can you not be happy great deal , good quality , good color , good size my # `` # macbook pro fits perfectly with no issues charger even fits in the side pocket with no issues -lrb- creates bulk -rrb- could n't be happier for the price
i love how well this protects my laptop it is not too thick and not too thin , and i love that pocket in the front . i have a macbook pro # & # #
i use this case all the time i love the extra pocket and the slim fit with the pocket , i can put my cell phone in it or stretch it out with my extended charger after it has been stretched , it goes back to its original form i can also add a composition <unk> to be held with my lap top which is always beyond convenient seems to be very durable it 's also very comfortable to hold -lrb- if you 're walking around campus -rrb-
fits great , shipped on time . enough room in the sleeve to add a hard shell if i want to . the material is sturdy and stretches a little bit i would like to see the front pocket a little bigger because in most cases you are going to try and squeeze the charger cable in there the way it is now , there is a fear that because the pocket is so tight , you might damage the mbp if put any type of pressure on the charger while it 's in the case
bought this for my # inch macbook air it does what it is supposed to do used it for about # months now and have no issues the zipper does not scratch the laptop as some have <unk> the front pouch is a good size i can fit a mouse and the charger in there
i use it for my samsung ativ book # plus fits great . word of advice : as soon as you get it , turn it inside out and live it in the open air for some time to let the scent go
i just wanted to give a review to those that may want this for their lenovo yoga # it fits perfectly nice and snug the extra pouch makes it easy to carry both the power cord and usb it wo n't fit much else , but i plan to use it to protect my laptop in my backpack i 'm not sure about durability , but time will tell it seems well made there is a bad initial smell but that will eventually go away
i am very satisfied with this sleeve , especially for the price the pocket is a little small for the charger -lrb- makes it lumpy -rrb- but the case itself is well padded
this sleeve was an excellent item to have to carry and protect my macbook pro laptop the sleeve is very convenient for putting my power cord or anything in it i am satisfied with my purchase
i love this sleeve it has great padding for my macbook air and the extra compartment on the front of the sleeve is all too great i never like carrying my charger in my bag and i liked having a usb i would normally use with this laptop this sleeve solved that problem and then some ! this sleeve has a smaller sleeve for your usb on the inside of the smaller area that can zip up i am recommending this for anyone who needs to charge their laptop on the go and may need to keep one or two usb 's with them at all times with their laptop in this sleeve
this fit my # `` macbook pro perfectly it is not fancy but i like it the outside <unk> is a must for carrying the power cord i did n't even know i needed that until i packed it all up
this sleeve was delivered quickly and works great for protecting my macbook # & # # ; as i tote it around inside my larger bags the outside zippered pocket holds my mouse and cords
i purchased this for my new # & # # ; retina macbook pro i was slightly concerned after reading some reviews about it not fitting the retina snuggly however , upon arrival , it fit snuggly and did n't wobble around , like other reviews suggested it would the pocket can fit the charger as well as a usb flash drive overall , it 's a well designed , lightweight sleeve that i would highly recommend to anyone
i 've been in desperate need of a sleeve for my macbook pro # ' for a long while , and i 'm happy to say that i 've gotten just that with this product it 's extremely well made , fits perfectly , and its additional pockets -lrb- including a neat thumbdrive pocket -rrb- make it the ideal case for your macbook you could buy something cheaper but i can almost guarantee that it wo n't fit snug to your satisfaction
exactly as pictured and fits the new # macbook pro # inch real well my laptop stays in place and it has the perfect pocket for my laptop 's charger really pleased with the product
i like the case , fits my macbook pro # `` nicely and adds a little protection have n't used the outside pocket yet to hold the power adapter , that would create an awkward bulge , but handy to have the pocket there just in case
needed a case to go to and from school and this one was just was i was looking for its fits my mac nice and snug even with the case i have covering the computer
the sleeve offers good protection and shielding of a # -inch macbook a nice touch is the front pocket -lrb- missing from many of the competing cases/sleeves -rrb- , which allows for storage of the power adapter -lrb- minus the cord -rrb- and a pair of headphones
this sleeve works great for my macbook plus a notepad that i always carry it also holds a few extras in the pocket , which stretches but does n't stretch out
works perfect for my mac book air # `` the extra pocket is great for extras i fit my a/c adapter , external hdd , earbuds , and a flash drive in there at the same time there is a built in flash drive holder in the extra pocket which is nice the outside is also quite water resistant so you know your laptop will be fine even in the rain
i love this i used it for my # inch macbook pro i even put a case on my laptop and it there was still room in there it even comes with a little pocket to put the charger in it does n't have handles it 's a great product
perfect protector for my macbook pro # mid # combine with the decal skin , i feel my macbook is fully protected my macbook fit nice and snug in this thing ! and the little side pocket is convenient too for my charger and extra thumb drive -lrb- s -rrb-
after looking at a lot of cases over amazon and ebay i finally decided on this one and i 'm glad i did . and the amazon prime shipping was a great added bonus the case came promptly and had some cardboard gunk on it , but that was easily brushed off it fits a macbook air fairly well , but you can tell it was made for a fatter macbook pro however if you use a shell it will fit quite nicely the front pocket is n't very large , but is enough to fit earbuds , maybe a thunderbolt adapter or two , or even squeeze your charger it also has a little pocket specifically for a flash drive so you do n't have to dig for it no complaints here only complaint i can think of is that the white logo on the front is more <unk> than i would have liked
fits my # & # # ; macbook great i live the pocket on the front , i use it for head phones and an external hard drive the power adapter can fit as long as the extension cord is not attached its a little tight though i feel like it protects my computer when i have it in my backpack overall a good buy
this case from caselogic has a bit more padding than the one on our other laptop because of that extra padding i feel -lrb- perhaps falsely -rrb- that my laptop has a bit more protection from the little bumps and <unk> that it takes during travel i also like the external accessory pouch for holding things like compact disks or flash drives i strongly recommend this padded case for your laptop
purchased this for my mac book air -lrb- # -rrb- fits it perfectly , quality of case is good , and the extra pocket is nice to have for ac charger got this at a great price plus free shipping and received it a week ahead of the scheduled delivery
smooth <unk> inside , flexible shell so can stuff what i need into it and fit my macbook pro # & # # ; perfectly and ac adapter . even fit a kindle in there on top of all that you get a great deal with this product in my opinion did all i wanted it to do
fits well and you have extra pocket space for your charger , head phones , and usb wish there was more colors so i could get more for my whole family ... oh well . :
this product fits my macbook even with a <unk> case -lrb- generic speck version i found on amazon for # bucks <unk> -rrb- great quality and great looking would buy again , but do n't need to
i am in love with this case ; it is simple yet chic i am so glad that it has an external pocket for the laptop charger i have a samsung ativ book # plus and my # . # inch laptop fits perfectly into this sleeve as well as the laptop charger into the side pocket
works well with my macbook air the pocket fits my charger , external hard drive , and # thumb drives with ease the outer fabric feels water resistant -lrb- i 'm not going to try testing that out ! -rrb- and the soft internal fabric keeps my laptop clean and protected
fits the macbook # in perfectly - leaves a little room so it 's not too tight and the zipper wo n't scratch the macbook case has a nice soft felt inner lining so no scratching the laptop i do n't travel often , but this is a snug , well padded , and soft case to protect my laptop when i do travel
bought two of these and am back to buy a few more as gifts love how it fits a macbook pro and mac book air also bought it because it has an outside zippered pocket to hold the cord and headphones great to drop down in a bag and/or backpack w/o worrying about scratching it it is a lightweight foam
bought a new mac in summer ' # and immediate purchased this sleeve for protection and storage it meets all my needs and fits easily into the laptop pocket of my wenger backpack our oldest son bought the larger version for his # in mac and works perfect for him too
i received this sleeve case about a week ago and have been using it since i have zero complaints , and have found it to work like a charm # -rrb- it fits my # <unk> # -inch macbook pro like a charm -- neither too loose nor too tight # -rrb- no noticeable smell , plastic or otherwise # -rrb- my primary use is for carrying it back and forth to school/work , inside a backpack the sleeve definitely protects the laptop from nicks , bumps , and scrapes in that context # -rrb- the exterior pocket works well -- placing the power charger creates a bump , but nothing that causes concern for me the little usb pocket is also handy to have
it fits my macbook pro # -inch perfectly , even with the additional casing around the laptop the pocket stretches slightly , so it fits the adapter chord perfectly
very nice neoprene sleeve best part is the pocket , which provides room for your electrical plug , a memory stick or anything other small item you might want to carry with you comes in a variety of colors to suit your taste i went with black so that it is less noticeable in the bag i carry or hiding it in the car
this sleeve fits my # in macbook pro perfectly and protects my notebook from scuffs and scratches the outside pocket is nice for small items but will fit the ac adapter a little tight the inside lining has a nice , soft suede-like feeling that i particularly like this item is a must for a macbook pro along with the moshi keyboard cover notebooks will get scuffs and scratches as it ages but a <unk> notebook will last a whole lot longer i 've owned and used my previous dell notebook for over # years with no issues i also kept my dell in a sleeve and do not transport it without one

everything about this sleeve is perfect for me i own a macbook pro & it fits perfectly the extra pocket is very helpful i wish it were a bit larger , but all the accessories fit ok the quality of the sleeve seems to be ok too
keeps my mac clean i have also dropped the computer in the case accidentally , and it does a good job of absorbing energy great for protecting the computer and the microfiber liner is very soft to the touch
was looking for a nice sleeve case and i found it it 's particularly useful to have the front pocket to store the ac adapter it even has a nook to hold the ethernet dongle overall very happy with purchase cons : does n't have handles , but this is just a sleeve i think you can just sew it on if you wanted to
the only thing that could be any better is the amount of space in the side pocket it is very difficult to get my charger in there and i certainly would n't put it in there with a usb drive as the tension would probably break the usb stick
looked at many products for my mac book pro # and this product turned out to work very well protects against scratches and is able to fit into computer carry-on or just as is with convenient pocket for charger i 'd recommend this product

i use this to protect my macbook pro # ' and i am able to fit all the accessories in side including a magic mouse and my apple charger and a spare cell phone cable for <unk> it feels just like a wetsuit and the zipper has a protective barrier to keep it from scratching your macbook pro as most owners are very much ocd about not having scratches on he aluminum

i opened my car door and my laptop fell out onto the concrete on the edge of a corner my case has a small crack the computer works perfectly by they way it fell , i am sure that if i had n't had it in this case , i would n't be writing this review right now on this computer ps it says it is for a macbook , but i use it on a hp it is a tight fit
i purchased # of these # . # `` sleeves . # for my acer # . # `` timeline x and the # nd for my friend 's asus # `` laptop it fits my acer just fine , but was too snug to get the zipper closed on the asus -lrb- which is n't a surprise -rrb- so i gave it to my friend who has a # . # `` mbp and it fits it very well build quality is good & the front pocket is very stretchy quite a good product for the price

this sleeve is amazing and fits my macbook pro perfectly i was wanting to keep it covered for when i am traveling and this is perfect and fits right into my bag for flights or bus trips
this case was indeed made for my macbook pro it fits perfectly , and the inner lining assures me it wo n't get scratched at all while it 's stored inside it makes me feel more comfortable carrying this around without my whole laptop bag , especially between classes now that i 'm back in school the outside lining does attract quite a bit of lint and dust though , in which i just use a lint roller to get rid of that sure wish i had bought this years ago when i got my laptop
i have a samsung series # `` laptop while the case has a little extra room on top , it fits pretty well the case itself seems sturdy , with a durable zipper and useful exterior pocket that fits my charger and ethernet dongle
i needed something for my # macbook pro to pack inside of a computer case with another notebook to avoid it getting scratched and to carry it around separately between offices this case with the flap for easy temporary storage of either papers or the power supply , fits the bill well the case is well-made , thick enough to absorb minor shocks , and should last a long time
we went with this brand because of quality , but unfortunately the inside seems are coming apart after only one month of use it 's used almost daily and maybe that 's just too much for this <unk> down unit occasional use would be best for this pack
if you are looking for a small city backpack then this is perfect usually i 'd like to have extra room for more gear or eventual things to carry . so i returned it and got a bigger one
i bought this mainly to carry my widescreen # lb it definitely is smaller than it looked now , ~ # month of use , i like it bc it forces me to carry light , aside from my laptop get this if you are not looking to carry your office in it i carry , # `` lt , ipad , bt keyboard , and a work folder
i like how discrete the backpack is , it does not hang off of your back a substantial amount or look bulky however , it is not a large backpack i fit my laptop , a folder , # <unk> , my headphones , and maybe one book , which completely fills it up quality wise it has held up well , had it for about a month i like that not many people use it like a jansport or north face
this is a very serviceable backpack the only factor that would have made it # stars is if it were a touch lighter love it for traveling -- especially like the side handle
i 've carried a soft-sided brief bag or messenger -lrb- a timbuk # product -rrb- for my entire career ; but , i wanted something different to carry a laptop and work stuff as well the q seems to fit my need perfectly big enough to handle what i want to carry but not so big that it looks like a kid 's school bag <unk> timbuk # for another great product
i bought this bag after a lot of research through many websites amazon offered the lowest price i bought this bag to fit my macbook pro , which is does with a little wiggle room i like the design of the different pockets i used the bottom pocket to fit my small umbrella if i am not <unk> my laptop other people said their charger does n't fit in that pocket , mine does though it 's funny shaped when you put it in , but that does n't matter to me the bag is n't waterproof but resists water better than any other bag i own it also makes what would be a terribly heavy bag quite comfortable the only thing is the bag is quite large so do your research to not be surprised how large it is
only problem i have with this is that i wish it came with a place to put a water bottle , thats it , beyond that , the bags quality is great and it goes on very comfortably
this backpack was made to last the zippers and straps are made with quality materials and havent shown the slightest bit of use the label is a bit ... loud but i just took scissors and cut it off the laptop holder is classy with its cross stitched padding perfect for a # inch computer and a # inch notebook
this is the perfect daypack for commuting or travel with a computer it 's not too big and not to small my wife stole my blue one so i got this red one
i spent months looking for a backpack that would n't be too small , but would n't be too big i wanted to make sure it was n't really heavy even when it was empty -lrb- like i had experienced with my old targus backpack -rrb- at first i thought `` wow , timbuk # backpacks are really ugly ! but i really loved this color combination , and after watching some reviews , this backpack began to grow on me i love the functionality of it especially the swing around feature for your laptop , and quite honestly , it can work for all the other pockets too i 've already used it so much i 'm very happy with this backpack , and according to timbuk # they 're guaranteed for life so you wo n't have it fall apart in a year there are so many good things about this backpack , i would definitely recommend it
