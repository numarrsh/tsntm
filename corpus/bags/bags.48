i love this backpack i 'm constantly on bike , hiking , walking , and general moving around and this pack has become part of my skin . it 's always on me and it does n't bother me
this is the best backpack i 've owned it 's on the smaller side so i 'm not tempted to load it up and hurt my shoulder separate and padded case for the computer
after one week , the pack is proving its value very solid construction very nice laptop sleeve that provides easy access this is a real bonus for getting through airport security
i purchased this as my everyday carry around pack -lrb- i walk a mile to school one way -rrb- perfect for a book or three and a laptop i usually carry a standard sized binder -lrb- # `` x # `` -rrb- , # average sized books -lrb- # `` x # `` or less -rrb- along with my laptop and power cord keeps my laptop secure with minimal jostling even when the rest of the bag is empty the power cord pocket just fits my standard size cord and the front compartment is large enough to hold a magazine and standard utensils items in front compartment may get a bit damp in rain if the bag is completely full but laptop is always dry swing around access makes it easy to pull laptop out and also give access to a small pocket perfect for storing keys and wallet in
this pack is very well made and comfortable i especially like that i can access the pack without having to take it off first the many pockets make it easy to organize
overall , this bag is very comfortable i like how the straps fit and the cross strap too i like the loops at the end of the straps so they easy to tighten when it is fully extended it also fit relatively flat on the back and does n't have a bulky look i would recommend it to others
totally large enough for my # & # # ; macbook pro ; easy and <unk> zippers -lrb- super important for speedy packing -rrb- ; breathable and comfortable to wear women : the chest strap is very adjustable , sliding all the way up and down on the straps , making it very comfortable for those of us without , hem hem , a flat masculine chest
love this bag , it 's my new teacher bag for daily use it fits my ipad retina perfectly and i love the side handle carrying option only thing i would have liked was the addition of an external water bottle holder
the bag , looks really good and is worth every penny it is nice and strong , it is waterproof and i can store # medium size books along with my laptop , and charger it has great front organizing pockets it is comfortable
i travel every week and needed a backpack that was light weight that also need to carry two -lrb- # -rrb- laptops and the other items you need when you work at a client 's site this bag was a perfect fit for me and allows me to keep all my stuff organized without extra weight fits nicely under the seat or in the overhead and allows me get where i need to go without all the extra weight that more traditional bags have
let me start off by saying i 'm a fan of timbuk # bags i like the overall design of this bag , it is very comfortable , and it keeps my stuff safe the reason i gave this product three stars is because it is not made of the typical nylon you find most timbuk # bags are made of as a result , outer material ruined the backs of several t-shirts , <unk> , and a jacket it also collects a considerable amount of lint and other debris , which ends up on the back of my clothes also
this bag is holds a lot of stuff i was able to pack my laptop , jacket , and a <unk> bag my only complaint would be that the straps are a bit uncomfortable and rub on the sides of my neck
this backpack is just the right size for my son to lug his laptop and books around campus it 's not as big as a <unk> bag but holds a lot of necessities this is our third timbuk # product and i ca n't say enough about how durable and well-made all have been
the straps feel very comfortable and the quality is great it 's just what i need for a school backpack just be cautious about which size you get the medium seemed pretty big , and i only really needed the small
title says it all this case is specifically marketed as being for the acer timeline # . # inch model , but is way too big there 's almost an inch of space at the sides and top a neoprene case like this should be snug i will be returning this item
i bought this neoprene case because it was suggested by amazon to match the fantastic acer # t # laptop it is too light or thin to provide any protection except for scratches and it is too big do not use its pocket to hold anything like a charger , a mouse or dvd drive because if there is a substantial bump or drop you could crack the computer case i gave it away to someone with a mac after a lot of research , i bought the caselogic qns- # . # inch which fits the computer perfectly for less than $ # it is light , has a semi-hard case , provides real protection and is still a small package carry your charger in another bag
i bought this case thinking it would fit ` like a glove ' well , it fits like an xl glove on a l hand there is about an inch of extra space when my laptop is placed inside certainly not a deal breaker ; the case seems well constructed and will definitely protect my laptop from the abuse i tend to dish out , it 's just a little too big for this computer
i have the # . # inch version of this case for my # . # inch lenovo x # i was satisfied with that , it fits nicely and was exactly what i was looking for i purchased the # . # inch version for a # . # inch asus x # e the # . # inch case is the same size as the # . # inch version the case is too large for the x # e , it is around # inch across the top to large be sure you check the dimensions before ordering
this case is well built & fits my acer # . # `` netbook the neoprene material is first class however i wish it did not have the plastic sleeves inside for the business cards it 's rough on the edges & may cause a few minor scratches on smooth shiny surfaces otherwise a great buy ! !
very pleased with this case it is well made and fits my acer # t perfectly there is also room for the cord and mouse in the zipper pocket slight `` new `` plastic smell from the inside of the case , but this disappears reasonably quickly
this roocase is the perfect companion for my as # t i bought them together # years ago and they are both in perfect condition , not a scratch on either i have dropped my laptop # x and this case made the difference between <unk> and relief the quality and functionality is exactly what i hoped for
this is a really high quality case it fits the laptop and the charger nicely for my acer laptop i am pretty sure there wont be a better case than this one for this
well built , durable and good fit this is the perfect protective case for the acer # series small laptops the <unk> pouch on the outside can carry the charger or external dvd drive if needed nothing else will fit inside the case once you put the laptop in there
this is a very good product it fits my acer aspire timelinex as # t- # perfectly and it has enough space in it to fit the charger and the mouse the only con specially when you open it brand new , is that the rubber smell is very strong , i guess some people could even find it a little disturbing to be honest but in general a very good product , i recommend it
most sleeves for small laptops or netbooks are lacking in extra compartments , without costing much more or being too bulky this sleeve can be put in a backpack or other larger bag without taking up much more room than the laptop itself
my acer aspire # . # inch netbook fits in this case perfectly and i love the two exterior pockets but it absolutely reeks when you <unk> it it smells like the tire department at walmart , only worse i had to hang it outside for two weeks to get rid of the smell , and i had to prop the pockets open while it was hanging outside otherwise the smell was still in the pockets and even after that there is still a slight smell , but it is only noticable when you put your nose right up to it i came very close to returning it , but i could n't find the right size in any local store , so i went with the long term `` airing out `` , and it 's alright now
i would n't buy this as protection for the netbook , but it works great for organizing all the cables and accessories the zippers open and close easily and they seem to be holding up fine
i bought this for <unk> acer laptop and it is very easy to use it 's <unk> bigger than my computer , but that 's ok i like the pockets for storing the power cord and the cleaning cloth that came with my laptop
i have found this case to be very useful with my acer c # and it fits just right the pockets are ideal for carrying your various accessories that a netbook or chromebook demands i carry my micro mouse with extra battery , my charger , cleaning cloth and it even has pockets for usb drives or micro sd cards lining the side of the main storage for your netbook it is well designed and put together , seems very durable , and it is made of neoprene which is <unk> and cushions also
not worth the money , compartment too small and the bag tear and broke apart after # months had to by a eddie bauer back for replacement better money spend else
i got this to be a less bulky bag when i was riding the motorcycle to class in that regards , it met expectations however , it was n't a great quality build seams did n't last a year before fraying and eventually tearing
this bag does fit a # `` laptop , and it does have a fairly nice design , especially for the price however , i would not recommend that anyone should purchase this product when i first received this backpack , i found a few loose stitches in the seams i simply clipped them short and applied fabric glue -- no big deal however , after several months of use at school -lrb- about a semester -rrb- many of the seams have started to tear up , and the bag is generally falling apart this is probably where the price comes in to play overall , my bag was crap after a few months of regular use *** note : read the positive reviews and notice that most of them seem to have been written after receiving the product , and not after several months of use .
i used this for my # & # # ; hp i was able to fit my laptop . power supply and lunch in there without it being too bulky which was great for a daily commute unfortunately it started coming undone at the seams within a month , and within a year was completely falling apart it is a shame this design ca n't be manufactured a little more sturdily , in which case i would buy another at $ # i guess you get what you pay for
it is a nice bag i put my laptop in it with the power cord and zipped it closed i picked the bag up and the seam between the two back straps at the top split thought that was poor
i bought this based on the weight of the bag , hoping to reduce my overall load this weighed about twice as much which puts it in line with the other bags this is very roomy and good for large laptops , the material is thin and light the bottom is good overall , feels solid other bags have <unk> surfaces , this one does not i have the caselogic <unk> bag and will use that instead since it roughly the same weight decent bag for the price though
bag is comfortable , with just enough space for my laptop , cords , mouse , and some papers my only complaint is that the zippers feel cheap they have held up for # mo now , but i was hoping for more higher end
i ordered this backpack because it seemed to be larger than the usual backpack however , after the purchase , i realized there is not much room left after you get a laptop inside even though i knew that , i still thought it would fit my needs it only has one extra pocket in the front and its a long , thin pocket inside is a divider , which i plan to remove and hope i can still use it as a normal backpack i suppose it would be fine if all you wanted to do with it is carry your laptop , but for carrying anything else , it wo n't work in my opinion
this is a good value for the price i was looking for a super light , small bag for my macbook air # `` but this bag was definitely bigger and deeper than what i wanted i dont like bags with a million pockets and this bag has just the minimum spaces for storing things its a good bag , just not exactly what i was looking for
i just got it because it is only lap top backpack looks cool my alienware m # x fits in perfectly , and i satisfy about this bag but this bag does not really have protection on the bottom , so you got ta be careful when you put your computer down also it does not really have many pockets i actually wanted to give # . # stars for it , but well , i can not
i purchased this as a gift for someone who travels between offices and needs to make sure the laptop is safely protected while flying this bag is a marked improvement over the previous - needed to be replaced the laptop compartment is separated from the general area which is now much <unk> in order to carry a gaming console -lrb- came with a padded case for that -rrb- however , if you do n't have a gaming console , you gain a ton of file space the recipient is very happy with the new bag
love the quality , bigger than i was expecting i love the interior color <unk> , but i was sure that on the product pictures show a kind of cover extra but never <unk> backpack for a
this bag is good for using as a laptop and supplies bag or a normal school backpack i used it for both and it is great the size on this bag is n't bulky or too small it is a great fit
very sturdy and is comfortable on your back or one shoulder functional pockets on the inside hard to loose anything since it 's made to keep everything inside larger than i thought it would be
i like the back but it 's a bit small it 's big enough to fit my macbook pro and perhaps a book or two but thats about it love the styling and how compact it feels on my back tho it 's perfect if you just need to carry you laptop and a few other items if you 're looking for a <unk> to haul # or more laptops and other load of stuff you may wan na look elsewhere
i used this to carry my laptop to and from work # <unk> a week for # months i never had a problem and the backpack straps are very comfortable the bag also looks more streamlined and clean with just a little color on it for design the interior pockets and division for the laptop helped to keep everything organized inside so i never had to dig or worry about my laptop being scratched now that i do n't need to schlep my laptop , i gave this to my teen <unk> and she 's been using it to carry her laptop
keeps everything nice and comfortable when walking around campus i love the design and the <unk> of it even though it carries at least two books and a laptop easily
this has been such a good backpack i looked and looked for a very long time for the right backpack to carry around my computer for school -lrb- working on my <unk> so my computer has been my other child -rrb- i looked for durability , compartments galore , good price , and versatility i needed the backpack style for a computer carrier because i carry many other things besides just my compute i needed my arms free to open doors for children , carry kids lunch bags , school bags , <unk> keys and preventing accidents along the way , etc . this has been such a good bag for all that i need i like the two outside pockets to carry my cell phone and keys because again , i need something that all my necessities are easy to reach , but are secure very good product for the price i highly recommend
i just received this bag but so far it has everything i want it feels very sturdy there are a lot of compartments to aid in organization it is very comfortable on my back
this product works just how i 'd expect it to it keeps my laptop secure , and i have room for my schoolbooks as well the only downside is that it 's sometimes difficult to fit a water bottle in the pouch other than that , this bag is just what i wanted
very slim backpack great for what i use it for -lrb- carrying a few things to and from the office also good for a light backpack when travelling , as in good for your laptop and a couple <unk> it is pretty small compared to most backpacks i 've had , but that 's what i was looking for
i bought this case for my husband because he was always carrying work home in folders and laying them around he didnt like it at first -lrb- being told he needed to become more organized -rrb- but he now uses it everyday and has actually admitted he likes it
easily one of the most sleak # & # # ; laptop bags i 've been able to find at any price the side pockets are just a little tight on my # l <unk> bottle , but it means i 'm not worried about the bottle falling out when bike riding
i was not happy with the quality of this product but the biggest surprise was the color blue i recieved i wanted the aqua color not a true blue color was pretty disappointed
i was very disappointed with this case ! ! it did not fit my macbook and it was not the color i expected it to be it was more like a clear colored case rather than a nice aqua blue color it was a total waste of money i just ordered another case from a different vendor and am hoping that it will turn out better than this purchase did
this was a real disappointment the case had a small crack when i received it but i figured , no big deal then i put it on and it was a tight fit when i tried to take it off a few days later , it was nearly impossible for me or the `` genius bar `` guy to remove he had to use a small tool then i noticed that my mac was scratched i could n't get it back on easily so i finally gave up and returned it i bought another type from amazon -lrb- a clear one -rrb- and it seems much more usable i would n't touch this one again you can do better -- -lrb- but i must admit , the color was nice ;
i was expecting the aqua blue case to be as bright and vibrant as it was shown , but when i finally got it i was extremely disappointment the actual color was a very light blue , almost no color at all it was also advertised that it was brand new , and the case had scratches all over the top and bottom i have never had a problem with anything i 've bought through amazon , but who ever is selling this is doing some serious false advertising
well this is a total bummer i thought i was getting an aqua blue case and instead it was the <unk> variation of baby blue i have ever seen and to be honest now i guess if all you cared about was that it protects your computer then you are in the clear otherwise if you are looking for a little style , this is not it good luck and beware
today i received my new cover the color was a washed out pool blue instead of the familiar <unk> blue i was expecting the cover does not fit my new macbook pro -lrb- march # -rrb- all plug ports -lrb- on the left side of the computer -rrb- and the disk slot were covered by the case it seems like this case is best suited for the first generation macbook air
the color of the actual case is n't the same as picture the case is almost transparent even when it said see thru aqua blue , when it put up against the macbook pro , it nearly become <unk> other than that , the case is great
i like it , it works the problem is that the color is n't the same at all , it is more like a <unk> wan na be light blue i do n't think it 's the same cover from the picture , because the cover i receive has a big circle in the middle what the cover in the pic does n't have anyway , it 's pretty and works
i had read before i ordered this case that the color of the case was not accurately represented in the picture - this is true the real color is a lighter blue , and the case is more transparent than i expected however , it is still a nice color , and i 'm not very picky about that however , i was disappointed in the thickness of the case i was hoping it would be a bit stronger - it is thinner and flimsier than other covers i have seen that being said , it still does a fine job protecting my laptop from the light bumps it gets from being in my bag , and i no longer have to carry it in an awkward soft case the thinness of the case also means it is lighter than others i have seen this is a great case for someone looking for cheap , basic protection , and wants to <unk> up their laptop with a light touch of color
the only complaint i have about this case is the color that i received was not the bright aqua color shown , although the color i received is n't a horrible color , by any means the color i received was a clear , light blue it almost looks clear in the packaging , but once it 's on the laptop it looks more blue and that was the only reason they did n't get all # stars i received my case within # days , and the case snapped on with ease , and has n't moved since i put it on
overall happy with product love the color , however , the <unk> portion of <unk> cover slips off very very easily i thought it should have a tighter fit , so that part was a little disappointing
i bought this a few weeks ago and i have been testing it out , it is truly a eye catcher many people wondered if apple made such a beautiful case but i must say the good people at top case are truly great engineers the case looks great and arrived on time it was packaged nicely , and used less packaging that others , which i think is great to save the environment i would recommend this product to anyone who wants to add some color to their macbook pro and wan na protect it from scratches and other blemishes
i 've literally had this cover on for nearly two years now i 've dropped it a couple times , and there 's only one little crack in the corner great protection and great color
i 've had this case for about # weeks now and i love it when i first got it i was abit confused about how to attach the cover to my mac , but after i got it on it has n't budged
i just received an <unk> aqua hard case for my macbook pro -lrb- silver -rrb- the cover came in short time and i was able to easily <unk> and instantly snap in place the color is exactly as it was described on the site i ordered from it was a perfect fit and worth the cost to keep my exterior from becoming scratched or damaged for years thank you , amazon and dealer
this cover fits my mac great however , in two weeks , there are all sorts of scratches on it just does n't look nice i know it is better than my mac being scratched , but i think there are much better options out there i would look into a scratch resistant cover next time would n't recommend to a friend
i got this cover for christmas , and it is already breaking i have never dropped it , so the only thing i can think of is that when i set my backpack on hard classroom floors , the case is n't strong enough the corners are chipping , and i will probably have to buy a new case soon , but i might get the soft kind this time i just hoped this case would be stronger
i 've had this case for # months , and the top case has really been doing its job apple logo is nicely cut , and the case prevented my macbook pro from getting scratches however , just now , i decided to take the case off and realized there are around # scratches at the bottom , caused by this case at first , i thought it was just dust , but after i tried to clean it , i realized it was n't i then checked the case , and realized it was not really polished from inside , which caused the scratches on the bottom . : / so , beware
this is a good cover , but there 's nothing spectacular about it it 's hard plastic and it 's clear it fits well and protects the computer from scratches , which is exactly what i was looking for pretty basic , and it was simple to snap on for the price , it 's a good solution for basic protection against scratches on the laptop will not protect against spills or drops - just not what it was designed for
the case itself is great , but the rubber pads that they include for the four feet on your macbook , do not stay on i have lost two of them and only have two left
this is a really great product ! i like it alot , it keeps it safe from scratches , and fits really well i have a palm guard on it , and it doesnt interfere at all it was fast delivery , and although i wish that it had come in safer packaging , i highly recommend it you will love it
it came in perfect condition and to my surprise , it had the apple logo cut instead of the circle cut i think the apple logo cut looks much more sleek the only issue is that it does n't fit completely on some parts but the case does it 's job it has n't fallen off yet and it was easy to put on
it might be too early to judge but i totally love this cover it fits my macbook pro perfectly , i saw on previous reviews on how parts of the cover tend to rub against each other but i have n't had that issue it feels durable and strong yet it does n't at much bulkiness to my macbook it looks good and helps maintain that `` clean `` look our macbook 's have the only thing i wish was that they had better pictures to see what it looks like before you buy it but i highly recommend it to anyone looking for a cover
i was looking for a protective cover for my # `` aluminum macbook pro and did n't want to spend a fortune on it after much research and reading <unk> of various user reviews , i decided to take a chance on this one it 's rated at almost five stars by a lot of reviewers , and at the price of only around eleven bucks i put my <unk> aside and thought why not i was very pleasantly surprised to see how perfectly it fit my notebook nice and snug all around and easy to remove and put back on should it ever get damaged -lrb- better than my macbook -rrb- i would n't hesitate to order another one
great fit and great price after all the $ $ $ i spent on the computer itself this is an awesome value another reviewer was disappointed in the scratches it showed , but i ca n't imagine there is an alternative clear cover as <unk> that could be so affordable for $ # bucks i 'd just buy another of these if this one gets too scuffed the only blemishes on mine after # months are the cracks on one corner the case suffered when i accidentally banged it against something the computer itself is pristine with a $ # rubber keyboard cover , cheap <unk> , and $ # neoprene case my mac looks great , is well-protected and is still compact when i slip it in a backpack for travel i would absolutely recommend to a friend
the finish and fit was perfect , had it for almost a month now and have no complaints got the clear for the mac book pro # the delivery was on time , came in very good packing will definitely recommend
quality , inexpensive item which was delivered to my door within a very short time , was easy to attach to the computer and was exactly what i ordered it also has grips on the bottom which help prevent <unk> if working on a slippery surface
this product is a clear winner for me i 've a macpro , suits perfectly to the unibody looks very classy too snaps fits without any trouble does not add too much of weight i was concerned about it but once i received the product and tried on my macpro , weight was manageable for me without a doubt a definite buy for <unk> laptops & price is affordable too
i expected this to have more of a metallic look , but it 's bright translucent green plastic and the only metallic aspect is the body of the mac showing through the plastic i probably should have expected that other than the appearance , this does the trick , and keeps my laptop safe from scratches , sticky hands and dings the apple cut-out is a nice touch
this product is okay , however it has already cracked on the sides all i was looking for was something to protect my computer , nothing really for style , and this case does that somewhat overpriced for the quality of the product
i just received my green macbook pro # `` case today it looks really good but up close you can see it 's not perfect i would recommend the buy to others , but as to warning , the product came just kind of thrown in a bag with no padding , receipt , label or return address but it was all in one piece it arrived with a small scratch and scuffs , but you can only see when looking closely other than that it came in less than a week after buying on amazon , and looks really good in case it helps i 'm told i have high standards and i still think it looks very good
the best thing i can say about this case is that it fits the macbook pro so seamless that people often mistake it for just a green mac my main concern is that the bottom casing , though vented , does allow the mac to heat up a little more than usual , but i have not seen this as a problem thus far also , the fact that it just clips onto the computer means that it can also clip off at <unk> moments , particularly when the screen is opened up as far as it can go but other than those few minor issues , this case protects my computer and looks quite nice the space for the apple logo is particularly aesthetically pleasing
this case is a cheap way to keep your computer in good condition the cover is durable , and the color green is subdued enough that you can give your mac a little color , without being distracting or unprofessional as with most cases , it is not as attractive as the actual body of the computer , and at closer inspection , you can clearly see that it is plastic however , i would highly recommend this case to anyone who takes their mac outside of their house or dorm often also , i would recommend taking the case off and dusting or cleaning it every couple of weeks so that any dust or debris under the case does not get sticky and stain your computer
this laptop case fits perfectly and the green color is soo cute compared to the covers on the apple website , i find this case much better because it has a cut out for the apple logo the price can not be beat and it 's a great cover
as soon as i opened the box it looked small sure enough , it does not fit my # . # inch laptop in fact , this case is only # . # inches long why do n't they give the dimensions
though this case is well made , it will not fit the # . # inch macbook air it is not wide enough , and even if you try to stretch it the zippers only have so much give would recommend a case made for the air
i buy this one is cute but unfortunately do not fit in my acer laptop aspire one # , the case is more small , i sell this to another
i purchased this for the arm chromebook series # although i was worried it would be too small , it did end up fitting well the front pocket has enough room for the charger -lrb- or in my case an ebook reader -rrb- , along with some microsd cards in a <unk> holder the sleeve feels thick enough to protect but not be overly bulky my only concern are the corners , specifically the two next to the zipper the way you need to position the chromebook under the # & # # ; flap seem to stretch out more than it should need to the benefit is that the zipper never comes in contact with the case itself and potentially scratch it
when i opened the package , i thought it was too small and wo n't fit my # . # `` notebook but upon sliding in my notebook , there 's no slack , not overly stretched at all , and the case fits like a glove there is a # `` flap behind the zipper to protect the notebook from zipper scratches -lrb- see the uploaded picture i posted -rrb- the side pocket has ample room for the charger but will be too tight to include an external optical drive there is the usual neoprene smell the tag inside shows young micro brand , made in china looks very well made and comparable to other brands that sells twice the price
this arrived today and i 'm not sure what i was expecting for $ # , but this is a very cute case with the worst black label right across the bottom you ca n't tell how bad it is from the pictures it looks like it was <unk> on very <unk> because it is crooked yes , the tacky black label is diagonal across the bottom of the bag returning it immediately this is a case logic knockoff -lrb- who has heard of casecrown ? -rrb- - save yourself the headache and spend a few bucks more protecting your electronic investment super cheap and the black label <unk> the bag ... especially when it is n't even on straight
this is a little too big for my hp , but the only real problem is there is not enough space for my headset i am afraid if there is much strain on the pocket , it will rip
love the color of the bag , a little on the smaller side for my # . # `` laptop , kind of snug but i still like it the only disappointment is that i wish it came with the shoulder straps that would have made it so comfortable carrying rather than always holding it in the hand like a briefcase it 's easier carrying a heavy laptop flung across the shoulder rather than holding it in the hand i wish they included the longer straps as i could not find matching straps any where
very sturdy case that 's well padded for protection & a close color match for my pink laptop i like that you can open the case & work on the laptop in the
i like the nice slimline design ... wish it was available for a # & # # ; laptop , because it 's a bit big , but looks great and i think it will wear well
i would have preferred a more neutral color , but this one was on sale it 's nice and compact , yet protects my laptop perfectly makes it easier to take on a quick trip instead of my big and bulky backpack
a little bigger than i expected , my fault though , i should 've read the measurements more carefully it 's good though , since my laptop is smaller , i can fit a book in with it the front pocket fits a mouse , my charging cord , pens , and my wallet color is true , good condition , maybe eventually i 'll get the darker one might be a while since this one is so sturdy
the case was girlie looking which is what i wanted for my wife the color is a classy pink and not gaudy it would be better if there was a more secure way to strap the laptop down when it is in the case there are just some elastic bands in the corners the outside pouch is not very deep and i have not yet seen it with the power supply stored in there
got this for my # . # `` sony vaio and it fits great outer pocket is big enough for the cord but not a whole lot more as it 's not an expandable pouch i wish it had one pocket big enough to store a separate folder but for my basic needs and trips , it 'll work just fine
