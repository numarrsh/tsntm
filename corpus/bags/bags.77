fits my macbook pro # inch perfectly ! great bag ! enjoy the pockets on each side of the built in case as well not to mention the soft material love built ny bags
the <unk> picture does this bag justice , same vibrant colours and well i am very familiar with the brand built , so i know this was a good choice for my laptop i will definitely buy from this seller again , i am very pleased with my purchase and no regrets at all great supplier , great product
this case looked nice when i got it it is slim and lightweight and you can access all ports however , bits of the case started to chip off shortly after i got it eventually there were no remaining parts to hold the bottom piece on i would not recommend this product
the design of the speck case is very nice it almost looks like the case is integrated with the laptop i 've had more than one person come up to me and ask `` how did you get a blue macbook ? `` not realizing that a case was installed on the laptop the problem is that speck choose to use a very hard and brittle plastic even after taking incredible care of the laptop -lrb- the entire laptop goes into a soft case which goes into a padded backpack , the speck case cracked in the first or second week i 've now had this case for about a year and there are at least # to # cracks in the case in various spots , including a gigantic crack that goes across the front the case looks fantastic when it is new , but that is short lived as it will develop cracks
i loved this thing when i got it - so pretty and i got lots of compliments on it after just a couple months however it started to come apart there are cracks in the top piece and the small pieces that cover the back corners are starting to fall off it also scratches like none other granted , i take my air with me everywhere , and it is coming in and out of my purse multiple times a day but for the <unk> price i really expected better quality than this i 'm irritated that i 'm going to have to buy another one this quickly
the product scratches and breaks around the corner so easily it looks great for only couple of days when there are not finger print marks and scratches on it if you are using the laptop daily taking it with you and moving it in and out of bag pack . . you will start to hate the product in a week 's time replaced this one with : http / / www.amazon.com/gp/product/b # <unk> # <unk> # so far so good
i got this case at the beginning of school last year within months of it being on the computer , it broke i got to a high school that requires all of the students to have a hardshell on their computers and most of the other student 's cases were broken too this case is also almost impossible to take off the only way the even think about it coming off is breaking it and that 's done for you i recommend incase or any other brand for that matter
i got the first shipment and put it on looked nice enough , but the bottom corners had hairline cracks in the plastic within days and the laptop did n't even leave my house i thought it was defective , so i returned and got a replacement within # weeks it happened again , both the back corners and the part that grips the screen are cracking off skip this thing and save the aggravation
i agree with all the reviewers who say theirs cracked i have had the same issue this macbook never leaves the house so it is not subjected to rough use at all ; still it has cracked in several places within # months of its life
pro : quick and easy install gives you some grip -lrb- the apple products are slicker than wet soap -rrb- con : mild protection might protect you from a dent to the top or bottom overall this was a good purchase i 'm pleased
i wanted something to protect my macbook from scratches and such it fits my macbook air perfectly it 's easy to get on i have n't tried to get it off , as i have had no reason to take it off i love the color it does what it 's supposed to do
the speck case protects my laptop from scratches , but it 's not worth the money i ordered one and it cracked when i tried to put it on my computer i returned it and got another , that also cracked i did n't bother returning the second one , but for $ # , you would think they would make a case that fits and does n't crack when you put it on the computer we 'll see how long it lasts i would not recommend to a friend until they can get their price down or improve the quality
i do n't understand how the plastic easily started chipping away on the corners and just kept chipping the moment # is visible i am kinda disappointed that it did n't work out but i guess since the macbook air is thin enough i can see why it would have barely enough plastic to <unk> the computer
i purchased the speck see-thru blue cover for my new macbook air # after # months , the <unk> <unk> teeny <unk> <unk> plastic tabs that are supposed to hold the cover in place broke off one by one next the cover itself started to show signs of cracking in the corners executive summary : this is a very cheaply made piece of plastic junk with a cute name that sells for about # times more than it is worth do n't buy it
hi - i bought this case in purple - it was super cute and light weight but the edges started cracking off within the first month , and now , # months later , the bottom half of the case is falling off i do carry this around , but not much - this is very disappointing given how gently i use this
i received my first one of these cases about # months ago since then i have gone through four -lrb- four ! ! ! -rrb- of them every single time it 's the same song ; the clip on the top left corner of the base piece cracks and breaks off within two months i call up customer service to complain , they tell me they are very sorry and offer to send me a replacement i tell them i usually love speck products but this one has given me nothing but trouble they tell me they will look into it but in the meantime accept their <unk> and a replacement i do , and then hit repeat on the song i am an idiot for <unk> everyone else 's complaints on this and dropping $ # -lrb- i wanted a special color -rrb- on this do not be an idiot get something else
when i first got it i fell in love , it was the perfect shade of purple after less than a whole week of use , its scratched up everywhere not happy with this purchase at all
my husband is a fan of speck cases he has their iphone , macbook and macbook air cases all in black i bought this purple case and the bottom part fell apart within # months just like another reviewers said i 've never taken my computer out of the house , never put it in my bag or been rough with it the computer is just rest either on a table or my lap when in use the case looks nice so i am giving it # stars for look and color selections
i purchased a speck seethru satin macbook air # - inch aubergine cover on <unk> # , # on jan. # a piece cracked off of it although the cover fit well the bottom would occasionally get dislodged and come off i contacted speck and they will not honor the warranty because it was purchased through amazon although the cover looks awesome i would not recommend it as it cost me $ # and it only last # month i think speck should honor the warranty on a product with proof of purchase as it is obviously theirs very disappointed in the product speck products see thru satin case for macbook pro # -inch aluminum unibody only , aubergine -lrb- <unk> #
took good care of my computer even with the case on the case is broke on both sides where it is supposed to snap on , on the bottom . the top case has n't been damaged or caused any problems the bottom piece on the other hand is a disappointment not worth # $ in my opinion . wish i could sent it back
i 'm super careful when it comes to my macs i had a macbook pro and used a speck case and not a single crack occurred over the # years i had it i got the macbook air the end of dec and immediately ordered a speck macbook air case -- within the first week two of the grips had broken off and a chunk broke off about the size of a dime since the air is so thin , the speck macbook air case tries to keep up by producing a lean case it definitely was worth the $ # it cost i 've had it less than # months and already need to replace it
literally within the first week , a corner on the bottom cracked rendering it <unk> since the corner is where it grips to stay on the top has stayed on but is cracked in many places the color is great , but in terms of protection -- and price ! -- terrible product
i am on my second one already the first one cracked putting it on the second one is in it 's first month and already developing cracks in the corners that hold the case on i do n't travel with my lap top and it is barely used i seriously think the material of this case is so fragile it will begin to crack on it 's own save yourself some money and stay away from the product i wish i read the other reviews before i purchased this
update : this thing cracked so easily , and i had to just altogether remove the bottom part within # months the top cover is cracked , but still <unk> on for dear life very fragile , and i would never pay that price for another one easy to snap on and completely protects my macair beautiful eggplant color looks great with the mac 's silver shell also bought the clear ` ipearl ' silicon keyboard protector
like many of the other reviewers on here , i bought this case because it looked nice , and i had good experience with speck products in the past unfortunately , this model is a piece of junk mine , like the others , started coming apart within a week of <unk> use the bottom corners cracked and one fell off , as did most of the tabs that are supposed to keep it on the laptop i could exchange it for another , but after reading these reviews , it seems pointless my air has been `` naked `` for a while now , and i 'm going to try a more affordable case this is too much to spend on something so poorly constructed
i was excited to get this case after reading the reviews the color is great and it feels good in my hands too but that 's the extent of the positives after having owned it for only a month , the case is already cracking not just a little , it 's cracking in four different places there 's also no vent for the fan , which is not good for my mba sad that it is a sleek looking product , but of crappy quality
the speck case is very poor quality this is the second one i 've had , and both have cracked and fallen apart with normal use nice idea , nice look ... but very poor quality
i really love speck products i purchased a speck seethru satin case for my daughter 's macbook pro it has been almost # years and it has held up wonderfully however , the speck see thru satin macbook air case began to crack # months after i installed it i started noticing hairline cracks on the top sides of the case i carry my laptop in an insulated lap top computer backpack which has not been dropped . i would go with another case this one cracks too easily
really cute , love the color does n't last long at all mine broke just putting it on then within a month it was totally trashed my macbook air still does n't have a single scratch i wonder if it 's worth getting the case to protect from scratches when its so fragile but if you do n't move your laptop much and just want it for decoration , this is worth it
had this case on our laptop for a few short months before the cracks and breaks all over the bottom and top corners of the cover finally have become so numerous that it barely holds on the case started to develop cracks in the corners pretty early - and they <unk> until chunks of two corners have actually broken off this machine is used very carefully but it is carried daily in a <unk> backpack this cover is far too <unk> to last - our last speck case for our older macbook is still going strong i will have to find an alternative as this one is no good - especially at this price
i like the color and the case was nice to begin its but it very easily started cracking at the corners now those corners are n't protected and its not neat looking
the color is great ; aubergine describes it well the matte look and feel is great ; much better than the `` plastic `` ones that are available the cover adds some weight to the mba -lrb- almost double -rrb- , so if you are looking for a lightweight option , it is best not to use a cover the cover slips out of place i find myself constantly snapping it back into place a covered mba may not fit into some of the `` thin `` cases or sleeves out there i purchased this along with the acme skinny sleeve and the mba did not fit into the sleeve with the speck case on it
the color is as shown in the picture i found this case to be affordable so i purchased it even though most reviews pointed out that the bottom lid does n't fit as it should those reviews are correct but i find that it stays on if you hold the laptop properly unfortunately the lower lid got chipped on the edge on the # nd week but i 'm over all satisfied with the
it does have a nice purple color and it is light weight but the top part of the case cover does n't fit right on the # `` macbook air in addition , the top case cover came in the speck package already with scratches on it
the description says `` soft <unk> inner layer protects against bumps and scratches textured neoprene exterior layer offers grip , protection and style . however , the case i received has neither soft <unk> nor neoprene but that 's okay - i was n't terribly unhappy with it - the case is matte plastic and fits well it looks nice enough , but the lower case cracked in the corner after a month or so of <unk> use also , one of the <unk> feet fell off and was never seen again overall , it 's not terrible
i just got this for my # inch macbook air and it fits perfectly it 's nice because it 's thin but not flimsy , has a really nice feel and does n't add much bulk the color is nice too and you can still see the light up apple logo through it
i really like this cover for my macbook air i spent two days searching online for one that was colorful -lrb- and purple is my favorite color ! -rrb- , thin but strong enough to protect the cover from scratches , and made for the # inch air it took me forever to find this one but now i have it and i love it it just snaps on really easily and it is thin enough that you can still see the apple light up through it , which i like , and it does n't add any weight to your laptop definitely great for people with # inch macbook airs
the bag will fit an ereader , ipad , or a very small laptop it will not fit an average sized laptop i do n't know why the description says `` laptop bag .
bag is too small for any laptop , but i bought it for my ipad . ipad fit fine , but no room for anything else looked like a purse , not too manly for a guy design flawed as it kept on falling off my shoulder with minimal items in it no room to place a small book or many papers on the positive side , <unk> look was pretty nice nonetheless , i returned it to amazon
the little magnetic closure ripped apart from the fabric the first week i tried to use the bag i still like the size and the style , but the materials are sub
the bag arrived on time , at first glance the bag look like a # `` laptop case , but when i tried it on my lattitude d # it gave my laptop a perfect fit it will be good if the bag have more padding
with the newest ultrabooks or tablets , it 's a perfect fit but , do n't expect laptops # and older to fit terribly well if at all but , that 's not a bad thing my microsoft surface rt fits perfect in there , and it looks like an ipad or the like would do well also it 's a smaller bag , with a <unk> finish to the top the strap is n't super heavy duty but does the job , and at least the fittings are metal very professional look for your tablet , paperwork and such while still showing some <unk> pride
the bag looks great , and i was very eager to use it but calling it a laptop bag is misleading the tags on the bag <unk> it as an e-reader bag , and a # & # # ; macbook air had no shot of fitting in it . # & # # ; , maybe great bag if you use a tablet though
i received my <unk> vertical messenger bag today and for the purpose i intended , it is a perfect fit i am a very large man , and the length of the shoulder strap is well suited for my needs i wish it was leather all around , rather than trimmed in prominent places with leather
this is a great product , and i am very happy with it this product is a labelled as a & # # ; commuter & # # ; bag , not a & # # ; computer & # # ; bag it 's perfect for tablets , but you will not fit a laptop in it someone at amazon or the manufacturer <unk> the description incorrectly
i got the product right on time it is brand new and it is great i truly recommend it because it has a great price and it is very useful and it is a very nice
not comfortable and not durable when wearing with both straps , it feels like all the weight is at the bottom pushing into your back one of the interior pockets has ripped so contents fall into the between space i do n't even use this for something heavy , like a laptop i 'd hate to trust it to something valuable
the backpack itself is nice , but the quality is seriously lacking i bought the pack specifically because it had the two cupholder on the side after a month of use , both <unk> have started to fall apart the webbing at the top has ripped out of the stitching
its pocket was teared right after i put a & # # ; highlighter & # # ; wow . it was day one ! ! ! just one highlighter made a hole at the bottom of the pocket ! i went to some kind of secret place where i can not even reach ! but i can still feel it no wonder this backpack was very cheap i actually liked the way they organized all the pockets , however , what is the point of having lots of pockets if it tears off that easy
i like the size , the pockets , the arrangement , the straps , etc . i like the color too it even does well in rain but , the seams break i returned one to get a new one after the seam broke during the # nd day i was using it this one has lasted a little longer , but i now see another hole <unk> by the zipper -lrb- same as before -rrb- great idea , poor execution
from other reviews and pictures at the time , i thought that this backpack would do well for my first year in college i did n't think that i had too many books considering most of them were smaller , novel size books however , this backpack does not fit very much i could fit a # -inch binder , a text book , a notebook , and some other smaller books putting my laptop in along with these was an extremely tight fit the side pockets were my main problem with the backpack being such a tight fit for my books , having a water bottle in the pockets eventually tore the bottom of them i would probably still be using it if the pockets were made of a stronger material and were still in tact overall , there is n't much space in the whole backpack , and <unk> it may cause the mesh side pockets to tear open , especially if a water bottle or small umbrella is stored in them i would only recommend if you know that you wo n't be putting much in it most of the time
i ended up returning the bag after getting it it was unclear by the description and reviews if there was padding on the bottom of the bag to protect a laptop when you set the bag down on a table or floor there is very little to no padding so the laptop is left unprotected if you value padding on all sides of your device while traveling you might want to look elsewhere the overall construction quality was good and i think had it had the missing padding i think it would have made a great little bag
i 've had this backpack for about two months while working in <unk> my # -lrb- really # . # & # # ; -rrb- laptop fits very comfortably inside the sleeve , and i like the smooth , aqua <unk> the material is easy to clean , and it can fit my laptop , charger , a paperback book , two <unk> , and some snacks while traveling however , the top handle had begun to <unk> from the backpack and fray very badly , so badly that i had to tape it and now it looks bad and no longer brand-new i 'm sad besides that one thing , this backpack is sturdy and usable at a great price
it 's a lovely backpack around the beginning i used it for a month and the top handle started ripping after only # months of usage , mind you i did n't have anything more than my macbook air and a few notebooks in it , the side pockets began to rip , and the handle came completely off
for the price it is a good backpack the material is very thin and the padding shifts around under the fabric i anticipate having to replace it sometime in the near future
good size bag , can fit by # & # # ; laptop and more , i feel the material is rather thin compared to the targus and samsonite bags that i have used in the past the straps although with the padding looking thin are wide and comfortable , good value for price
i should point out that the inner layer of the red backpack is a cheap-looking light green and it sucks and , the small pocket in the very front is not # % opaque , meaning i can see the color of the paper napkin bag inside of it but despite this detail , it 's pretty strong and steady i was carrying a # `` laptop and its accessories all the way to and fro china and it worked well
this backpack is great for me it makes me comfortable with my heavy laptop while my old backpack wo n't work like that this one looks not that big , but it 's really roomy and i love it with those convenient pockets the padding in the bottom and back make it stout it 's off good quality for this first sight well time will tell how good it is the only thing i do n't like is that the color is too dull and simple anyway it 's really really worth the money
i would have gave this five stars if this had a velcro strap to secure my laptop overall , the backpack itself is well-made and sturdy and has functional zippers and side pouches that i use everyday perfect for # textbooks , a notebook , and your laptop oh , and i went to wal-mart and bought velcro and elastic strap and made my own velcro strap so now i would consider this backpack perfect for me
i like the style and size of this bag when i was in college , it held a laptop , notebooks , a text book , chargers , a journal , and an bunch of pens it was pretty much the perfect size for me and it also had the benefit of looking not overdone - neither too sleek -lrb- where storage might suffer -rrb- nor too ` useful ' -lrb- and bulky -rrb- if you 're someone who actually wants to carry a lot of textbooks or something like that along with you , then this is probably not the bag for you if you prefer to pack what you need for a given day -lrb- assuming you do n't need everything every day -rrb- than it 's great only downside i have for this bag is that it 's got a way to minimize excess strap that result in there being little hard <unk> of velcro rubbing in the inner arm not noticed when wearing anything long sleeve , but it 's irritating in t-shirts and the like now that i 'm in an office environment and wearing long sleeves all the time , it 's not really a problem , but it was a constant <unk> in college
i really like this backpack i can fit my laptop -lrb- # inch -rrb- with it 's case , notebooks , books , my purse and my glasses the front pocket is great for keys , ipod , phone and snacks the two side pockets are perfect to carry the bottle of water i am very pleased with this purchase even though i carry a lot of things , it is still very comfortable and the strips do not hurt my shoulders or back
i love it it 's a great shade of red with touches of turquoise it 's sturdy and comfortable as well as spacious i will be using it for a long time
i was looking for a good backpack that i could carry my asus # & # # ; laptop and this is great it is sturdy nd the zipper to the main compartment is a big one that is durable and it has been great for me john # :
this bag is just right its the perfect size and has plenty of pouches and spaces to put accessories it is very durable and made well plenty of padding inside the bad to protect your laptop
oh my god that 's the only way i can describe this backpack it 's the <unk> backpack ever it carries laptops , it carries books , it carries the hopes and <unk> of a <unk> struggling through an <unk> <unk> and war if i were to chose a word to describe the enormous quality of this backpack , it would be <unk> my teenage girlfriend used to be pregnant , then she put on this backpack , and her period came no more baby this backpack man , this backpack
if you need this backpack just for books and a laptop you ca n't beat it it protects my # . # inch laptop from getting beat up and i can fit my <unk> book or two in it as well it also has some handy compartments for a laptop <unk> / whatever you might need i put my water bottle in the pocket on one side and my umbrella in the pocket on the opposite side it 's a great bag , but i would only use it for day use , not overnight , as it does not expand out very far to fit clothing
got this item for my son , this item is worth the money i paid for it and as a prime <unk> you get free shipping great value and a great deal this product is well constructed and we are very pleased with this
i bought this backpack specifically to carry my laptop it has held up great i have enough room for everything i need to carry and then some typically carry my laptop -lrb- # in macbook pro -rrb- # books and a note book water bottle on the side pockets pencils , <unk> <unk> , and makeup
the reason i bought this backpack was for its affordable price and amount of pockets when i received it , i though the color was darker than the pic shown however , it 's comfortable feel makes up for everything and i am able to fit my laptop , charger , # spiral notebooks , textbook , pencil pouch , and i still have room to put more stuff definitely a nice and useful backpack the packaging was great and the <unk> of it was superb
i absolutely love this backpack it is extremely sturdy i use it for everyday stuff , school books , and my laptop i am not worried about wear and tear due to my heavy books and i feel that my laptop is safe
this backpack is the best i highly recommend it to <unk> design students or whoever needs to carry a laptop everyday it is really comfortable and you can carry it anywhere
i needed a new backpack for my laptop , and after browsing a lot , i was convinced for the colour it is really useful and comfortable , and , on top of that , is not as pricey as any other i got to find so , to sum it all up : quality , cool colour and cheap . :
i read many reviews before choosing this backpack to carry my # `` macbook pro when i take public transit to work i also carry a book or magazines , a <unk> , and a purse , and the reviews reported that it was roomy since my mac is smaller than the advertised laptop capacity , it easily fits inside the padded sleeve , however the pack just is n't large enough to contain the other items my solution was to carry the most essential purse contents in a makeup bag that easily fits inside the front pocket and leave my purse at home -lrb- better security , anyhow -rrb- the straps are very comfortable and the pack contents are evenly distributed when i carry it on my back the side pockets are perfect for an umbrella and water bottle time will tell about quality , but so far i heartily recommend it
besides i love the color , it amazing it does n't feel like im carrying my laptop and books : -rrb- im happy with this ! go ahead buy it its a great
i have this backpack in red it is perfect for my ipad and laptop it also has more room for extras -lrb- books -rrb- <unk> quality product would recommend this to a friend
this case logic backpack has been a lifesaver for packing my laptop to class the interior padding protects the laptop , the pockets provide places for my cell phone and other supplies , and the material the pack is made of is sturdy and long-lasting highly recommended for anyone who is looking for a convenient way to carry all of their supplies in an attractive backpack
well i am not as excited about as some , it is a quality product it serves its purpose and was a great price no need to buy one of the over priced labtop bags , this will do everything those without leaving you broke
as i said , excellent backpack , so far i have no complaints it is resilient , very comfortable and in can fit my big laptop and gadgets easily it is not a travel backpack , is a laptop backpack and if used with that purpose you will love it
i 've been using this backpack for a while to carry my macbook air , my lunch , and a few items to my job overall the laptop is very lightweight construction is very good and the zippers are solid my old backpack had zippers that tended to come open when there was too much weight in the backpack these zippers are very good on the main compartment however , the zipper on the small compartment are a little small and tend to be a bit sticky the straps are nice and the excess length comes with come velcro straps so that it can be kept under control without being cut when i 've needed extra room to carry more stuff or even two laptops ; it has fit , yet the bag is not overly large or bulky
i use this backpack for carrying my laptop , <unk> supplies , food , and anything else i need to take to and from work during the week i often walk the # minutes and have zero problems with weight the straps and the back are well-cushioned i love that there is a dedicated pocket for my laptop within the main pocket
i bought this for my lenovo # & # # ; laptop there 's a nice snug sleeve inside to hold the laptop , and then plenty of space for all my other crap ca n't beat the price i think i want to buy several more of these and stash away for the future
this is a really great bag at a really great price i bought this for my step daughter for christmas because she is starting college soon and needed a bag for her laptop its a really pretty plum color and the material is a nice quality the straps are super padded and the bag has plenty of compartments for pens or accessories
i wanted a sturdy backpack that had a lot of pockets and room for travelling and this backpack fit all my requirements it had a inside padded pocket for my laptop , and an inner smaller pocket for accessories it has two side outside pockets for water bottles , more pockets in front , and a small outside top pocket for smaller items like my ipod for easy access it 's great and easy to use !
this would have gotten # stars if not for this one issue i 've had this bag for two days and the stitching is coming undone i have taken it to work and home twice and opened and closed it maybe # times and the trim around the flap is falling off good thing i know how to sew update - well , it seems the inside liner used the same low quality stitching as on the outside the inner corner of the liner has come undone completely , creating a large ragged hole the only thing i 've been carrying in this compartment is a # `` laptop and i have treated it very gently ; only carrying between work and home i would definitely save your money and look somewhere else for a bag if you want it to last for more than a couple months
my initial rating is # stars however , i had this bag for one day before i returned it , so i do not believe i have <unk> for giving more than # based on my experience i had been looking for a nice bag , visually and useful for its purpose , so i purchased the bag for my # . # inch laptop as well as a cooler about the same size the bag flap would not close more than half way with everything loaded this bag is more for a slightly smaller laptop and no cooler , not the stated # inch no big deal , amazon has a great return policy . i did like the quality of the bag and it seemed durable and put together well
would have been nice if it had a handle , the color of the green bag is off ; it looks more green in the picture than in real life , a divider in the main compartment would be helpful i will admit it is as advertized and i bought it knowing its limitations
i really like this bag but whenever it is on the ground it picks up lint & dust and i have to use the lint brush everytime i need to use may be because it is black , another color may work better , i will get a different color
i needed a new messenger bag for everyday use in nyc this bag is okay , but unless it 's full -lrb- which it rarely is for me -rrb- , it sags and is cumbersome to get in and out of regularly i do like the front two pockets , but finally wound up buying another bag to use every day , which works much better for my purposes i have taken this one on vacations -lrb- when i do n't have to get in and out of it multiple times -rrb- , but other than that , it sits in the closet on the plus side , i will add that it is very
i do n't see how it 's considered # & # # ; wide ... seems closer to # . # & # # ; to me i have a # & # # ; hp envy laptop , which can fit in the bag ... but if you put anything else in , it 's a struggle to get it all through the zipper
i know it came with dimensions but when i got it , i could n't believe how small it was my son has little room to put much else in his bag after his books but he does carry it
i 've owned this for over six months now , and use it primarily for caring my lunch to work used it to travel with , and it showed its flaw : the zipper pulls square zipper pulls always turn # degrees , making it a pain to close zippers pocket zipper pulls came right off , destroying the zipper other than the zipper problems , the bag is well built , with great pockets
interior has no padding , so it 's not a good idea to put your laptop in there it 's ok for taking a couple of books and notebooks to school although it does n't really have a compartment to hold pens and pencils just # zipper bags on the front , a velcro one on the back , two bottle holders on the sides and a small zipper compartment on the inside the color kind of deteriorated fast and it got a greenish hue after a while it 's ok for the price
a little smaller than the old bag i was using use it for miscellaneous items to take to and from work like the heavy duty type canvas material and side bottle pockets back pocket too small for my laptop but it i guess it was not designed for that wish it had a small handle on top time will tell as how it will hold up to throwing in and out of my truck
i bought the bag to carry my laptop in , and while the bag itself seems sturdy , well-built and classy , it is not particularly good for carrying a laptop in particular my # . # & # # ; screen laptop barely fit in the bag , and there is no padding around the main compartment also a handle on the top of the bag would come in handy with that said , it is great otherwise
the only problem i had with this is it is not padded enough for a laptop so be careful setting it down and the pull tab on the slider of the zipper is not rounded so it <unk> to the side other than that it is comfortable over the shoulder
this bag was a little larger than what i really wanted it was like the size of a diaper bag i guess i did n't read the description well i ended up returning it really did n't want to because i like the feel of it and it seems to be made of great quality
i like this bag but once i received it i realized that it did n't have the stiffness in the bottom so it seemed to sag it seems well made and i like the side compartments and the zippered compartments i am not completely sold on the big flap in front as it would be difficult to maneuver in a crowded situation like a subway under other circumstances i would have kept it
the bag ripped the first time i used it and the bag is & # # ; heavier & # # ; and larger i thought it would be the bag is good as a commuter bag but as a travel day pack , it is too big and heavy to carry around all day when you roll it up and put it in a suitcase , it takes up a fairly large amount of space plus i wish the straps can be shortened more so you can carry it on your back -lrb- like a day pack -rrb- rather than on your side by your hips
not bad , just average good quality canvas makes the exterior rugged , and even if you manage to get a tear or a good scrape here or there , it only makes it look better center compartment is roomy , holds plenty of stuff -lrb- macbook , two notebooks , charger , xbox controller , headset , and more -rrb- , two front pockets are pretty roomy as well side pockets can hold larger bottles pretty easily , and the loop that the snap is attached to makes opening and closing the compartment , well ... a snap not that durable on the inside the stitching in the interior zippered pocket is giving way after a few weeks , and the stitching on the inside edge of the outer flap was n't done well the canvas has begun to separate from the edge nothing that ca n't be fixed , but there 's no reason why i should have to fix it so soon for the price , it 's a good bag just not the best
i 've used this bag daily for # weeks and it really suits my needs casual use , in and out of car to office , but no flights i use the pockets for digital camera , mouse , ac charger , etc and they are handily accessible clipboard and laptop fit nicely in main pouch i like the zippers as sometimes i 'm a bit heavy on the breaks and it slides off the seat upside down on to the <unk> of the truck base is wide enough i can get it to stand open with nothing inside materials is durable and the stitching seems like it will last
