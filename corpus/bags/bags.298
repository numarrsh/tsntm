this case will soon hold many cards . . as soon as i find them i was very glad to find such a product on amazon , as i would love to have al of my sd cards in one convenient place all of the cases -lrb- including this one -rrb- i looked at had sleeves for little and big sd cards i only need the smaller slots , and found that this was the product with the most space available it is smaller than i thought from looking at the picture , but seems very durable happy with this purchase
this was a great add-on that is very useful for securing my camera cards i prefer to keep my original photos on the cards i shot them with as a backup the case lets me locate all of them neatly together and place in a secure location
about what i expected ... only surprise was it had a cf card section that i really did n't <unk> since i have a separate holder for those other than that , sufficient for now
i had a lot of memory cards which i use for my camera and other devices they get to be a bit cumbersome <unk> have more than one i like to keep the original material shot either movies or <unk> as a back up now that the cards are lower in price than they used to be there is one suggestion and that is there should be larger holders which could be use to store the memory card in its original case as they do not fit very well in the smaller slots
this is a good little storage book for your memory cards the nice thing -lrb- which i was n't expecting -rrb- is that it has some bigger pockets that fit memory cards with a protective case so you do n't have to throw them away this is a pretty good value as well and it seems pretty well made the quality is good for long term storage case -lrb- i.e . , if you do n't plan on carrying it around -rrb- if you use it a lot out in the field , it seems sturdy enough to hold up for awhile too
works as intended , no tearing of the plastic so far regular sd cards do slip out sometimes when i am flipping pages , but i just try to be careful and quickly put them back in securely would buy again if the need arises
i needed the cheapest basic case i could find to store some old memory cards that i no longer use but are not yet ready to get rid of if you 're looking for high <unk> , this ai n't it long-term durability in daily use ? -- that 's questionable but for what i needed , this puppy fit the bill
the item is as described and as it appears in the photos sd memory cards fit without a problem , and the last ` pages ' of the case have a bigger slot for bigger cards so far , happy with the product
it keeps my memory sticks organized and protected so i 'm happy with it it 's small -lrb- # x # . # -rrb- and not bulky in my <unk> i just wish it had pockets in the back of the cover to keep the cleaning cloth and the little memory stick cases . but otherwise , i would recommend i live in hawaii and received the item right away
has a hard plastic liner in the cover to protect sdhc and sd cards and two different sizes of pockets one pair of pockets is big enough to hold an sdhc ca rd in its plastic case , while the smaller ones fit cards without their case snugly also , fits neatly inside my case logic usb carrying case seems sturdy enough but have n't had the chance to use it great customer service by seller ; delivery on time , as scheduled ; item as described would purchase from this seller again
i found this product to be nice in style and completely useful to my needs i love the many pages i use several sd cards for different photo shoots i can now label or separate by type , size etc . i only wish there had been # more pages for my cf cards but for the great price i will just have to buy another
i have n't tried putting any cf cards in it yet , but it holds my sd cards just fine the quality of the construction seems totally fine a product improvement would be to have the exterior shell be <unk> to better protect the memory cards inside , but since i knew it was n't <unk> when i bought it , i ca n't downgrade it for that all in all , a great product for the price
i needed a small case to store and carry my numerous sd memory cards this case from eco-fused does it quite well cards slip in and out easily , which is convenient recommend to all
received this case on time and in perfect condition i like the fact that there are so many slots for the memory cards , and the microfiber cleaning cloth is an excellent bonus , included with the case if i have a need to purchase anything else in the future from this seller , i wo n't hesitate all went great and i 'm very happy with the purchase !
the product i purchased from these guys was just as described and it came surprisingly fast i did n't have to contact them because everything went smoothly good job guys , keep up the good work
the eco fused black memory card carrying case was just what i wanted it met all my expectations the slots fit the appropriate memory card sizes , there is room in the middle of the case to put a battery , if necessary very satisfactory product
this is a great product if you have quite a few memory cards needing storage in one place several slots for all different sizes of memory cards organized and small , this can fit anywhere , including in a packed camera bag great for travel will buy another if i need additional space in the future
the item came quickly and looked just like the pictures it was exactly what i was looking for to store those pesky small cards the cleaning cloth was a nice touch
this neat little case holds all my memory cards in one place , without fear of any falling out when i am digging around in my camera bag a very small price for that piece of mind let 's face it , some of us have quite a bit of money tied up on those photo memory cards i want to know that mine are protected from damage and loss as a bonus , the blue exterior is very pretty and easy to see inside my black bag i would not hesitate to buy from eco-fused again , especially since they are <unk> with amazon and i can get free shipping
this is a great little case to hold all of those memory cards , that tend to get lost when they 're not all together there are different size card pockets in it , so even larger cards will work with some of the pages very happy with this purchase

this is the perfect memory card holder for me ; it holds a variety of sizes securely the cards do not come lose in the case and the zipper is an extra layer of protection initially , i was a little worried about the quality due to the inexpensive price but it turned out to be a good little card holder as a little bonus it comes with a cleaning cloth i would recommend this memory card holder to family and friends

this is a great product i ca n't really compare it to others , but i am definitely pleased with what i got i ended up purchasing two because i wanted a way of <unk> my memory cards -lrb- empty , full , backed up , etc . . the fact that they come in different colors helps in this regard all in all , the card holder seems well constructed and durable it has a decent amount of capacity and it seems pretty slim i recommend it
solves the problem of having small items like sd cards disappear into cavernous bags and luggage my only complaint that it is also black like the bags which makes finding the case a little tricky when are the manufactures of bags and accessory containers ever going to discover that there are colors other than black contrasting colors would be greatly appreciated
nice case , great price definitely handy for my sister that does a ton of <unk> and has a lot of memory cards it can be hard to keep track of all your sd cards and with this case they are all in one place
i love this i do video work for a living , so carrying around a lot of sd cards is a must this keeps everything in one place and organized the construction is fine and it 's small enough to slip into a pocket during a shoot there are also two pages -lrb- four slots total -rrb- that appear to be for cf cards i do n't use cf cards , so i 'd rather all the pages were sd <unk> , but it 's not a big deal & # # ; handy if your camera can record to both <unk>
i recently bought a new boss stereo also from amazon and one of the features is the sd memory card so i have been busy <unk> all my music to sd card the sound is amazing never <unk> . and i do n't have to carry # cds in my truck i also love the carry case for the sd cards . keeps the cards neatly together i am not as satisfied with the usb flash drives <unk> there is no place to put the thumb

perfect for holding multiple memory cards safely and all in one place the item arrived as scheduled i loved that the product came in purple as well -lrb- instead of standard black or gray -rrb-
i recently bought some sd cards from amazon that did n't include the plastic case for storage found this as an alternative and i think it 's even better because of the organization there are four pockets for the larger cards and many more pockets for the smaller cards which i use the zipper keeps it safe the extra cleaning cloth is handy great price also
this case is small enough that i can easily carry it in my camera bag it also fits plenty of memory cards and i like that it can fit multiple sizes the quality is good i 'd definitely recommend it if you need an easy way to carry memory cards as an added bonus , it also works for nintendo <unk> # ds cartridges
this nylon case for sd cards is well constructed , the zipper does n't bind , and the sleeves hold sd cards securely the bright blue is easy to see across the room do n't run it over with a truck and your cards will be fine - it keeps them from getting lost in your bag
in describing the eco-fused memory card carrying case as `` adequate `` i in no way suggest that it is inferior there are more pricey cases on the market , such as the `` pelican `` brand case , but they provide features -lrb- like waterproofing -rrb- that one would almost never need the eco-fused case is quite functional it provides more pockets for memory cards than i will ever need -lrb- # -rrb- , and in addition has an extra four pockets that accept flash memory <unk> the cloth material on the outside is cardboard reinforced on the inside of the case , which is not a concern that i would have had , but it is nice that it is so , unless you will be traveling to areas with extreme weather conditions , such as <unk> or a tropical <unk> , this case will be more than `` adequate `` for your needs
this is the third memory card carrying case i have purchased from eco-fused i find it convenient to hold my & # # ; used & # # ; sd cards as well as my new ones while traveling the case is sturdy , light and well constructed i would suggest the company look into <unk> the case between holder size for sd cards and <unk> batteries for point and shoot cameras such as <unk> # it would be convenient to be able to carry both in the same case and because this is so well made it would be an excellent addition to my camera pac
this little case is a good size for storing and carrying sd memory cards it 's small enough to fit in a shirt pocket or tuck into a camera case oh , and the zipper is of good quality , which is one thing that can be problematic with small items like this but this one has a good zipper
this case is small , so it fits easily in a camera case what i really <unk> about this case is that it holds the memory cards securely i had other cases before that allowed the cards to fall out this one solves that problem
the camera case is well made the material and the zipper are sturdy , and the interior pockets are made of a heavy enough plastic to put up with inserting and removing cards for a long time

my car stereo has an sd card input , which is very convenient unfortunately , the larger the card capacity , the longer the read time before the first song starts to play a nice solution to this is to have multiple smaller -lrb- # gb or less -rrb- cards of different <unk> styles -- like a # st century version of a collection of gigantic mix tapes the only problem was what to do with the little cards when i was n't using them , so they did n't get dirty , lost , or broken this eco-fused carrying case solves this issue perfectly it 's big enough in capacity to hold more sd cards than i am ever likely to use , yet small enough in footprint that it can be stored in my car in any number of inconspicuous locations i highly recommend this item for anyone interested in storing a lot of cards in a small , easily accessible space
