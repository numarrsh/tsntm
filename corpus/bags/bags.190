i really like this case for its versatility and design i sometimes carry a few books and a microsoft surface # it can also stow my # in hp laptop which was surprising the bag does not seem very large though which i like for the price i think it is hard to beat
i had a messenger bag for over # years and was saddened when it finally became too worn to use after much searching , this bag filled the bill i 'm an educator and must carry a lot of things from building to building and this bag is strong enough but light weight enough to fit the bill with room for a laptop , tablet , accessories and still more room besides , this bag really stepped right in and fit my needs
excellent choice , i use it every day fits everything i need and more , lots of different places to keep your stuff . comfortable to carry and holds up nicely what more could you ask for .
this bag is just what i was looking for well made ; just the right size and the added bonus is the water bottle holder on each side every bag should have these
i got this bag as a gift and i 've been using it for the past week all the pocket placement is amazing and it works well i use this with macbook pro and an ipad and it has very comfortable the bag itself is very lightweight , but that does n't mean it is cheap feeling i believe it is slightly easier to use then my chrome bag as that one is quite heavy i have been enjoying hauling my gear with absolutely no uneasy back stress as well as shoulder pain this is now my go to bag for the week if you search around you can find this bag for under $ # , and just recently it was on sale at a big box store for $ # . # go ahead and check this versatile tech messenger out , you wo n't be dissatisfied
cheap , cheap , cheap case does n't fit properly -lrb- and yes i have the correct version for the galaxy tab that this is intended for -rrb- the front flag does n't stick to the device when closed , so it does n't protect the screen -lrb- flops off in my bag , leaving the glass exposed -rrb- save your money , seriously
the description of this product is misleading even though the case is very flimsy , i would have <unk> with that but it is not a # . # it is # & # # ; tablet case if your tablet is a # . # this case will not fit and the company that sale 's the product expects the customer to pay the shipping for the return it & # # ; s not worth it ! !
its super flimsy idk why but i was expecting quality like the iphone smart case ... . i need to read products more i guess anyway it sucked but the ppl that sell it delivers fast and they r reliable but dont bother with this case buy a better
i got this because it was inexpensive , and i liked that it had a tight fit over the tablet and would sit up easily it worked great the first two weeks or so however , after that the glue holding the sections together at the bottom started coming apart did n't work after that to hold the tablet up i guess that is why it was so inexpensive i ended up throwing it away
when i saw this cover case for the samsung tab , i was excited i ordered it soon after the <unk> did n't take long at all it got here , opened it , and tried to get my samsung galaxy tab # . # `` into it ... ... it would n't fit from what i was of the case -lrb- i returned it -rrb- , it is a good case that will hold up for a while the only other thing that i could say is to watch out this case will not work with the samsung galaxy tab # . # ``
lightweight a bit flimsy no way to keep it closed inside of a carrier does n't stand very well hard plastic does fit snugly opted for <unk> galaxy tab # . # `` # degree rotating case -lrb- purple -rrb- with stand by <unk> -lrb- tm -rrb- - b # it 's bit heavier , more versatile and secure than this
i was so excited when i first got it but once i put it on it started to crack and recently its been breaking at the corners and when i try to stand it up sometimes it does n't even work yes it covers my screen and protects it but its not all the great
this is my year round case except for a few weeks out of the year i wish i could order them in several more colors the only drawback is that the cover can not be closed while the tablet is charging
this is my third case for my samsung and it is the best case so far the fit is secure and the case is protective while maintaining the device ` s thin design the case is white and purple which i like but some people may not have noticed that from the picture it has a very strong smell to the case but it did n't bother me much getting the stand to work how you want take practice but it did n't bother me much either
i love the tablet cover it is functional and really protects my samsung galaxy # . # `` tablet it also serves as a great stand when i choose to have the screen vertically upright
i was very excited for this beautiful purple case , but once i got it and i put it on my laptop it soon -lrb- # weeks -rrb- broke in # of the corners i have to tell you this computer mostly stays at home , so i dont carry it around much and when i do it is always in the special case
do n't order this it was great at first , but now the corners are cracked and chipped it is also turning yellow around all the edges and i take care of my computer and keep it in my computer bag the majority of the time covers are great , but they do n't last i just ordered a new brand and am eager to see if it is any better
cover has n't lasted very long after a few month of gentle use , i realize that two of the corners on the bottom part have cracked and are beginning to fall apart i barely use my laptop , and usually do n't carry it around , i do n't understand why the cover has cracked
when i first got this case it was very nice ; even though it was a bit hard to get on at first i was pleased with how the case looked within less than a year one of the corners chipped and was sharp , so i had to remove it when i went to remove the top case , that was cracking as well , and was extremely difficult to remove i definitely never dropped my laptop or anything - the case was just poorly made if i could give this # stars , i would
this case is the <unk> excuse i think i have ever seen it does n't fit my # inch macbook pro right at all , which caused sliding and then scratching of the of my mac dont waste your money ! ! !
i have a # & # # ; macbook pro but this case is almost an inch bigger than my computer very disappointing as i liked the color and other brands do n't have a similar shade
i 've had this case for a couple of months i really like the color but it was disappointing the corners have cracked and sharp bits of plastic would break off but i guess you get what you paid for
cover has n't lasted very long two of the corners on the bottom part have cracked and are beginning to fall apart i am very gentle with the computer and do n't understand the lack of durability with the cover
it has n't been a month since i bought this product it fits great , and has no problem as far as doing its job which is protecting my macbook however , this get dirty very easily , and does look quite dirty i do n't carry around my macbook in rough places i just put it in my backpack and carry it to the school and back still it became hand stained
i like the color of this case , but it does tend to hold dirt it takes a bit of muscle and cleaner to keep the color bright i 've had mine just under a year my macbook has been dropped a time or two , and the cover protected my laptop well however , bits of it chipped off and the damage has weakened the entire cover i will have to buy another soon
i was quite happy with the fit , look and feel of this case until i noticed after a few months a crack had developed in the front right corner i 'm quite careful with my macbook and rarely leave the house with it so this is somewhat surprising for the money though , i still consider this case a reasonable value
it 's a cover and it 's cheap the green is n't as cute as i thought next time i 'd go with a different color and brand because this one does n't really snap on very well
it 's a cute case , but not durable at all i keep my macbook in my backpack at school sometimes i 'll drop it a little rougher than i mean to , but that 's about it after a few months the corners are busted off would n't buy this again
i just got it today which is way earlier then i expected , so for the shipping and all that i 'm very pleased onto the cover so first off i absolutely love the color which is like a sea foam , semi-transparent green and it kinda reminds me of the tropical ocean and the texture of the case is basically hard plastic but it does feel fairly durable as well as smooth so a few minor issues i have is that it gets dirty fairly fast my dog <unk> the case and literally , her lick mark sticked to the case and you can definitely see it -lrb- yeah , gross -rrb- and it was pretty complicated to put on , until now i honestly do n't know if its on the right way -lrb- although it is n't falling off or anything and it looks right and it fits -rrb- if i could , i would probably get it in another color , because although i love the color , it shows ever little speck of dirt
i love this case and it is true to color so beautiful and i get compliments on it 's color all of the time i have had it on for around # months now and it still is doing wonderful the one downfall is if it gets greasy or anything like hand lotion on it , you can see it that is really the only down fall to this case that i have found
i 'm new to the mac and since i tend to keep laptops as long as possible , i wanted a sturdy case to protect my new macbook the good : it does indeed feel like rubberized satin it 's a nice smooth but non-slippery surface while it does have those little smooth felt `` feet `` on the bottom , so far they 're not an issue and i plan to replace with <unk> from the hardware store if needed and the case wraps around the edges just enough to protect as much of the sides as possible the <unk> : while the top case cover is great , the bottom case has two brackets on the front edge of the computer -lrb- and two in the rear -rrb- that snap the case in place maybe it 's just me , but these sit exactly where i tend to place my wrists and i 've ended up with some sore and scratched skin because of it i am trying to <unk> how to hold my hands and place them away from those brackets , but <unk> if they were one inch to the left or right of where they are now , this would be a # -star rating
i had the speck <unk> case before i bought this case it 's pretty decent , the only down side is the back hinge of the laptop is fully exposed i like that the price was affordable and you get what your paid for the charcoal gray is a nice color too definitely recommend this , but the quality is n't as high as the speck brand
color looks just like the pic i love sea foam green / minty green . the back corners arent covered and could definitely get a little scratched or banged up if you transport your mac alot mine stays around my room or in a sleeve when i take it to class so i am not to concerned with that definitely a good price and quality and way less than a speck great buy ! get it
the case is nice but it cracked within one or two months i use it at college and do not bring it to classes and i would not say that i am rough handling it it still works with the crack , just a little sharp where the pieces broke off i would recommend investing in a more expensive cover that will last longer , but for the price i think this is good
this soft rubber case is better than most $ # expensive speck cases a little disappointing that it does n't cover the sides in the back , but it was made very apparent of its specifications
although the free bag is small and pretty useless , the product itself is beautiful , simple , elegant , and simply works it 's on the computer now , and we have had no problems with the case not much else to say this case is great , and a great deal too
arrived # hour after i ordered even though it was # day shipping the color is great the texture is exactly what i wanted as well , not that slick plastic , but the slightly grippy kind so far so good if it breaks i 'll update
i got this in the mail today & put it on right away i love the color & the rubberized feel of the cover it was easy to put on & it did n't scratch my macbook i have the # `` macbook pro # . # ghz <unk> intel core i #
great case especially for the price . stays on tightly . a little difficult to take off the bottom piece , but i 'd rather that than it constantly sliding off . worth it and it 's cute
you may think this will look too much of a cheap plastic but it looks really good once you wear it on your mac you can add some <unk> stickers on it . . :
this is the <unk> color case i ever had for my mbp the green is so fruity , and the color is light enough to let the white apply shine through very clearly it fits so well that it looks like my mbp came out of the factory this way
when i was looking for a case for my new computer , i was looking at a few different ones i found this one and it had the best reviews i received the case and i can see why it has the best reviews i ordered the case at # : # yesterday morning and as i am typing right now , at # : # pm i have the case on my computer it is so nice . the color is perfect and it matches all my other tiffany blue cases -lrb- iphone and kindle -rrb- definitely recommending this case to others buy asap ! you will love it
absolutely love it the only thing is the bottom piece is a little difficult to put on the computer but it is mainly a great product
it just came in today and i love it - the color is the perfect amount of fruity and almost is more like the caribbean sea its an unusual color which i love and the fit and feel is perfect so easy to put on and clean i got this for the late # macbook pro # `` mode hope that helps
this is the first hard case i have bought for my mac and i was a little worried about how the color would be in person as opposed to online and how it would fit my mac this case is a perfect sea green color and looks fantastic on my mac ! it also shipped super fast even with the standard shipping option
good material used for the bag but not enough space in it front pockets do not have twin zipper as shown in the pics and you need to full round to close the zip properly side pockets are useful to keep the keys and other small stuffs as you can open them easily with bag hanging on your back
i needed more cushioning to protect two computers -lrb- one macbook , one latitude -rrb- but the cushioning only extended to the main pocket sent it back for refund after trying it out otherwise , it 's great value for the money for someone who needs a <unk> pack
i have had this bag for more than a month now and it is a very reliable structure i went through many different bags because my laptop was too heavy this bag is perfect for the weight and the size it also has a good amount of space left over within the bag . the feel of it on your back feels a little awkward at first though the feeling goes away very fast it is also very affordable unlike other bags that are priced at $ # - $ # you get all the functionality for a # of the cost
this bag has a ton of pockets and different places to store things the adjustment straps seem sturdy and the all around construction of the bag seems well built i have an older targus black backpack and have put it through a lot in the past # years and it still is in great shape i only bought this new <unk> <unk> one because i wanted to have a bag for <unk> <unk> -lrb- that i could get dirty -rrb- and one that i could carry to work if you 're looking for a strong , well constructed back-pack this is it
i love all of the pockets and compartments one of the best features is the headphone jack on the shoulder strap there is a small pocket with a # . # mm line in so that you can connect and store your mp # player in the bag you then connect your headphones to the jack on the shoulder strap and you <unk> ' and <unk> '
a light bag with tons of interior pockets allowing quick access to everything it has a comfortable fit and would be easy to take to the office or on trips space for books , files , etc . is a bit limited , but still overall a nice bag
i really like this so far my old bag started to come apart , but this one seems to have a lot better construction it has plenty of pockets and compartments for all of the things i carry
after looking at about # bags , i chose this boy i 'm glad the bag fits my # . # inch hp elitebook perfectly it is a pretty big workstation laptop and i was afraid that the bag might have a problem its has loads of pockets the pocket for the ipod is very useful another interesting thing about this is that it has a # . # mm cable inside the bag which comes out through one of its straps i wo n't ever use it , but it is pretty cool a very comfortable bag , awesome purchase
this is a very nice backpack - it fits my # inch macbook perfectly with room for power cords and books it probably would fit a # inch laptop , but # inches might be too much of a stretch padding is sufficient , but less than my land 's end computer backpack it is lighter than the land 's end pack which is a plus lots of pouches and pockets for keeping things organized the stitching and construction is of high quality and there 's an mp # player plug which is quite handy for listening to your music while you <unk> biggest fault for me is that there is n't a chest strap to ease the load on my shoulders , but all in all , it 's a quality product and i 'd recommend it
just got my backpack and i 'm loving it already the feel of the padding is really great though i could really <unk> that the padding for the laptop compartment is relatively thin it has a lot of compartments which is really great especially when semester starts and i 'll be bringing the laptop with its accessories
i ordered two because of the price i 've been using one for my work tools and tablet for over three months and it 's still holding up it has lots of compartments which i love i just used my second backpack as a carry on for a week long trip i had all my cloths , # & # # ; laptop and everything you would need for a week long trip it weighted close to # lbs and nothing broke or torn
my grandson fell in love with this particular backpack in target , and i was not happy with the price ... so when i found it here , for considerably less , i was very happy quick shipping too it 's sturdy construction means it will last a long time i do think however , that it 's more suitable for an adult who travels with a laptop
this backpack is so comfortable it has enough room to carry all of my stuff for my laptop , a few books , and my ipad i bought this backpack to replace a briefcase type laptop bag because it never stayed on my shoulder it was constantly falling off and was really heavy with this backpack , i do n't have that problem when using just one strap
i 'm always on the go , i retired my oakley bag and was shopping for a new one i gave targus a chance and i do not regret it , even has a pocket for my sun glasses i recommend it very good
this backpack is nice with a few convenient extras there is plenty of room for my laptop and my nook on the inside lots of pockets on the outside , plus a place inside where you can put your ipod and plug in your earphones on the outside the straps are nice and cushioned so it does n't hurt my shoulders to carry all this stuff i will definitely be using this on business trips where i need to bring my laptop no complaints on this handy item
ca n't go wrong well made , clever design , good use of space subtle details like mesh on the inside of the back straps keep the pack from slipping off my shoulders without creating discomfort sturdy , and understated styling is perfect for carrying to the office without drawing attention
i use this bag everyday for school and when i went on a long road trip . it keeps my laptop and tablet in place very well i love the placement of all the pockets
it is perfect large enough to accommodate my day to day work <unk> and small enough not to be a burden to my # . # & # # ; frame sturdy look and feel with plenty of pockets to carry everything you need it is exactly what i was searching for
i hate to buy what i have not touched or experienced after inspection at the brick store i decided targus is a good name but that 's no guarantee this is a good pack there 's no strap accross the front but that means less complex , and the shoulder straps are <unk> shaped to compensate
this bag is everything i ever wanted to college the bag space and the extra pockets are amazing also the headphone jack is a <unk> for me since i 'm always listening to music this is a must buy for anyone that wants a good quality backpack
had all the space i needed there 's not a lot of padding for the laptop but i was able to put some foam in the bottom for a little extra cushion the tag does say & # # ; lifetime warranty & # # ; but i 'm not optimistic about making a claim down the road if i get a few years out of it i 'll be happy
this bag is made out of a good heavy material it has padded straps and back so it 's very comfortable hauling around i work as a technician traveling from broken machine to broken machine and it allows me to carry my computer safely my tools are stored in the many pockets it has oil and grease in one , towels , business cards , pens , glasses etc . all in different compartments it allows me to stay organized and still be comfortable and professional looking the headphone <unk> and compartment for mp # players is just an extra bonus i love this backpack for what i need it for i would recommend it for anyone that has the need to travel and carry allot of little things it is well constructed and ii expect it will provide many years of use
this backpack is well made and large enough for our # & # # ; laptop , a # & # # ; tablet and there is plenty of extra room for more the side pockets are perfect for a cell phone , a mouse , and there is still three extra pockets for other items you need to have ready on quick notice it is perfect for everyday use or travel
my son loves this backpack so far , so good very sturdy & well built the # inch is perfect for school . . not too small but large enough to hold all his supplies
backpacks are like glasses , you get use to the old ones and there is a breaking in period with the new one this is a nice backpack i did n't need the laptop compartment but could not find a backpack that did n't have one i like the little side pockets that zip much more functional that those mesh bottle holders the compartments are well <unk> out i really like the broader shoulder straps i can already feel improvements in my shoulders all and all , nice backpack
i like this bag it help my # & # # ; laptop plus a whole lot of other stuff i used it to fly from phoenix to <unk> and it went through tsa without a problem the straps were very comfortable a great buy
i ordered this product about two months ago , it took three days passed its due date to get here , i also ordered the screen protector finally it arrived and i was completely happy , until i tried it on my mac book it was the wrong size way to small so i returned it # weeks ago to get a bigger size of both the case and screen protector i start college next week and still have not heard word about if or when it will be coming
<unk> product is garbage does not fit the computer sung and there are spaces in between the case and the computer the case is not flush with the computer if you run you hand along the edge of the computer and the case the case will be higher than the computer when you put the screen case you have to push so hard to put it on that you fell that you are going to break the screen it still does not fit snug also when you close the screen with the case on it dose not close all the way and there is a space in between the screen and the bottom of the computer case is garbage does not fit well and is a waste of your money
this case , you may not be able to tell like me , does n't protect the back corners of your macbook if you 're trying to replace a speck i was not pleased i gave it two starts because the lid fit nicely but it also left a mark on my laptop when my speck cover did n't leave a single mark even after i bumped it on almost every surface i could i recommenced speck , worth the money , because i have and more than likely will again bump the back corners of my macbook and i need a case that will protect it all the way around
love love love love it its been way over a year now im still using it , yes over time the letters u type with more will lightly fade away but i love it
i am vey pleased with the orange macbook pro cover , hardshell casing top/bottom and keyboard skin the vibrant orange color i really love i 'm also pleased at the <unk> of arrival to my delivery thanks so much for your good service
i returned this bag it was cheaply made it looks amazing in the pictures but it 's not at all like the pictures i was extremely dissatisfied by the quality of this bag
i absolutely loved this bag and i got so many compliments on it but the metal rings that hold the straps attached to the bag broke ! ! ! i was so upset that is why i gave it a low rating i love this bag , but i wish it was better quality
bought this for my daughter she loved it until the metal rings on the straps broke less than # months after i bought it no return , no refund , no replacement , even though it obviously should be made to last longer
this is the only purse i use the size is great , the material is perfect , especially since it rains a lot where i live , and it has just the right amount of pockets : -rrb- i love that it 's
definitely extra large ... but i love big bags -- everything fits , kindle , ipad + + the color is exactly as pictured and the material is soft the only thing i am struggling with are the straps , they do n't want to stay tucked into the loops
absolutely <unk> love it , and it also doubles as a backpack now that mothers day is over , i will see if i can put on my list to get another one , in canvas this time for my upcoming birthday so many compartments , on both sides and in the front for everything to have its place my kids always said i was a organizer freak , and i am thanks for making such a great fun everything bag
do n't buy this backpack i 've owned if for less than # months and the straps are fraying and pulling apart this is not an expensive backpack , but it should last longer than # months of course , the warranty has expired i only carry a pc , charger , <unk> , lunch , book and pens ... nothing heavy i was very disappointed in rosewill and amazon for carrying their
the zipper on the laptop portion of the bag did not seal together it has a sturdy but uncomfortable feel on your back due to the & # # ; padding & # # ; the price was the main reason for the attraction and i got what i paid for
this backpack is lightweight and offers ample storage space for laptops , tablets , and other personal electronics and business tools features such as multiple zippered pockets and a pair of mesh water bottle holders add to the value i settled on a <unk> rating because the zippers tend to snag and the backpack often leans forward when fully laden
this is a good backpack zippers are <unk> the shoulder pads do n't slip , and the hardened back is ribbed to allow air to circulate love the channel to run earbuds through my complaint is that the pocket for the laptop should have been sewed on the opposite side of the padding the way it is now , the laptop has minimal padding and is exposed to the hard back of the backpack
i have been using it daily for over a month carrying a tablet and my macbook pro it has plenty of room and is very durable could n't ask more for the money i priced and tested similar backpacks that cost # x the price of this and the rosewill stood out if your looking for a quality backpack at a great price this is the one you should buy
nice backpack with good compartment configurations not perfect for me but overall useful design the # main compartments are really one compartment with a thin nylon separator that does not extend all the way to the bottom zippers glide like butter and seem high quality i could do without the bumps on the back , the back panel is too rigid for my taste -- but i suppose it keeps the back cool
this usage eat backpack price is excellent as well only improvement would be more pockets on the inside one or two more zippered inside pockets would make this a five star backpack
incredibly durable , excellent bag , a bit on the heavy side is why i took away a star , i believe this bag will last a long time i like it a lot and get good use out of it , lap top fits perfectly in it and is well padded tons of pockets
the backpack is a little small for anything else besides your laptop cooler and a laptop you will only be able to fit one large book in there if carrying just your laptop and no cooler however it definitely looks nice and does its intended purpose very well the laptop fits very snug
he likes that there are a lot of different pockets everywhere . the color is nice . his lap top fits nicely in the pocket , but he wishes it had it 's own compartment there are two holes in the front of the bag & # # ; maybe for ventilation he does worry if it rains & # # ; water will get in there
it has more than enough room for all your computer accessories and <unk> else you need to carry with you i like all the seperate pockets i just took this on my christmas vacation through the airport and it worked great for me
very pleased with this purchase ! out performs other backpacks which cost more and are not as well-made be aware the back side of the backpack is made of hard material which supposedly will offer more protection for your laptop a good feature for younger users
very well built backpack . very happy and the price is perfect . the bag was better than i expected it would be . i flew with it and carried it for # days around disney world and no
this backpack was so cheap , but it is the best laptop case i have ever had it has soo much space , it 's sturdy , it 's light , and it 's very affordable
it is perfect lots of storage space and when i am not hauling around the laptop its a perfect storage for my <unk> ! ! just love it the added pocket for the mp # player is nice but i use it for other items since i do n't use an mp # player the phone pocket is ok , i will never use it though if i was still near train for transportation it would probably be a different story good construction and i am
i am a tech guy who travels by plane all over the country , this product is fabulous for taking my laptop , kindle and tablet with me along with some back up clothes and tech goodies
bought this to lug my laptop back and forth to work pleased with the provided padding/protection for the computer also , i absolutely love the pockets configuration shoulder straps are adequate would definitely buy again
rosewill # . # inch notebook computer backpack is really good quality for high school or college students my daughter carries around # books , laptop , sometimes clothes and still have room for more the backpack is made out of good materials that will last for many years
