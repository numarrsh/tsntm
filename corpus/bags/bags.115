i think the bag is well made and meets my needs except after wearing it a bit the straps cut into my shoulders grant it , i am a larger woman and it will be difficult to find a bag that is <unk>
i bought this bag and while i do like the compartments and pockets and straps for all of the tripods etc . i find it is very big , but i do n't have much gear i use it more for storage i am not sure i would it for transport as it looks like a camera bag
i like this bag a lot , everything i expected it is not , however , anything close to waterproof in a light to moderate rain storm it will leak like crazy lucky i tested it before we used it
not as comfortable as any of my regular backpack ; however does the job : spaced enough to hold camera , wide , medium , tele lens and accessories strips on the bottom and on the side can be used for tripod or monopod it is n't weather protected , so keep it in mind several times zipper was not working , so i had to force to the end and then , i used pliers to readjust zipper
if you have lots of lens and accessaries this is your bag if you want something compact and elegant , you probably should keep looking i find this a bit <unk> and much too large for normal use
i like the size and flexibility of this bag , but just be forewarned that it 's not especially durable admittedly , i tend to abuse and overstuff my bags , but this one tore slightly at the seem near the zipper so it 's not built for abuse i repaired the tear and it 's held up fine since i do like all of the extra padding , but it would be even better with velcro straps to hold everything in tight you also have to make sure both zippers are closed all the way or the bag may come open at an <unk> time this is not good overall , i like the looks and flexibility of the bag , but considering my <unk> next time i will opt for paying more for a more durable bag
i 'm happy to have this small but convenient backpack in my <unk> space wise a full dslr with a battery pack is vertically challenged however , my full camera bag is just too much to carry on some outings and the larger backpacks are more than i want as well i am a full canon <unk> so i appreciate the logo on the bag this bag works just fine thanks amazon for carrying the bag at a reasonable price
not the best looking , or most feature laden pack , but pretty good for the price can hold quite a few lenses padding is not as thick as i would have liked , but acceptable pockets are not very plenty , but there a few , enough for a quick , light shooting
if you 're looking for a bag to do nothing more than carry your camera , flash , and a couple lenses , this is a great bag the construction is solid , the bag is comfortable , and overall it 's pretty <unk> -lrb- if you 've seen most camera bags you know why this is a good thing ! i ended up returning mine , simply because my needs did n't match this bag , but i nearly kept it just because it was such a solid bag the only negative was there was nearly no room to include even a small amount of <unk> goods like a wallet , or book
this is an outstanding bag . it is also about # less expensive than retail stores around my area for the cost and convenient size , it is very conducive for photography . if you wish to carry a laptop , and have something larger than a # inch macbook , i recommend something larger
stylish , high-quality , nice features i am very happy with this bag my only disappointment is that it does n't hold * quite * as much as i had been led to believe , but ideal for most
this camera backpack is affordable , has a nice look , and offers plenty of space i was not crazy about the <unk> of straps that came with it , but all but two of them can be removed , so it really was n't a problem overall , i am very happy with this purchase and ca n't wait to use the backpack while i am traveling it will hold everything i need and keep my camera safe and dry
i was pleasantly surprised that it was slightly larger than expected when it came in it also has easy <unk> slots in the main compartment did n't expect them to be changeable so that was cool it only received a four star rating because i wish it was a bit more comfortable to wear
this is exactly the backpack a <unk> needs good build quality , good material not too big but enough room for # lenses including a # mm zoom lens and my canon t # i with the grip mounted it 's comfortable to carry and looks really nice it 's waterproof by the way , already proved ! ! ! ! ! <unk> zippers have good quality , better than i expected the only complain are the rings in the front that came a little <unk> , but for the price it is a minor detail
i like this bag , it has a lot of space for all my stuff good back pack design the only thing i would say i do n't like it the inside <unk> for the <unk> are not as sturdy as would like them they fold in on each other and get camera spot makes it top heavy so it tips over all the time when you sit it down
was smaller than i expected , but works perfect for my current set-up case is relatively well made one of the zippers came off while in use , but not a big deal as there are two zippers to every pocket
i really like this bag , it fits my camera with the new # l lens i just got i do wish it had straps inside the bag to hold the other lenses etc in place that is the only reason it did n't get # stars
it is a little too bulky for my personal needs , but overall , great backpack , especially for international travels my notebook fits in it perfectly now i just need to buy more lenses to fill it
this bag is a nice design and holds all my accessories nicely and securely my only complaint might be that it is a little heavy , but i suppose in order to keep your fragile items safe , it needs to be heavy-duty i am happy with the bag and it is a lot less expensive on amazon than in the stores
the bag does as promised , so not very many complaints the outer sides could use thicker padding to give extra protection against accidental impacts so far i have been careful not to <unk> it on hard surfaces there are plenty of pockets to store other accessories like cords , batteries and such so you will most likely not run out of room i 've been looking at a few lowepro models and really like the `` sling `` design but for now this will do
i purchased this product out of necessity i need a segmented bag to place my variety of lenses and a couple of camera bodies it has been perfect for my situation it 's comfortable to carry and durable i encourage buyers to buy some velcro strips to strap in the top camera so it wo n't fall out upon opening well worth the money
i like this bag , it holds all my lenses and camera well . and their are lots of pockets to hold everything i used it to take my camera and macbook to london , while the back almost at limit for capacity , the bag held up nicely the back is also comfortable to carry around i walked around the city with the pack and camera -lrb- no macbook -rrb- it did n't feel heavy at all
bag has plenty of space for slr , lens and misc products . would rate excellent if it had straps , and a tad more room in the front . v good product , made well -- good price too
you just invested $ # or more on your slr ... where is it going to be kept most of the time yes , in a camera bag so you do n't want to go cheap on what 's protecting your investment as many other posters have stated , this back pack style bag is very versatile and fits my canon slr very well it has multiple compartments that are adjustable by velcro and can fit a number of different lenses there are also smaller areas for memory cards , cables , batteries , etc . great bag and it gives me peace of mind when my camera is in it
when fully loaded with # lenses , accessories & camera , the bag becomes annoying to carry due to the short height of the pack perhaps if there was a bit more height or a lumbar <unk> -lrb- the existing waist belt is worthless overall a quality pack , but uncomfortable for tall and short people alike on long hikes
once again amazon does an excellent job on delivery the pack was as described i like the fact that i can change the size of the compartments using the adjustable compartments i am able to fit my canon xti body and # lenses in with space left over i used some of the partitions to velcro on top of the lenses to hold them more securely the pack straps could be made better will be able to tell more when i have used it more the price was good so we 'll see
i was in the market for a new bag for my canon digital rebel xti i recently purchased , and happen to see this backpack on amazon i have always used the tradition camera bags , but decided to try the back pack style i am glad i did , easier to use and carry now i just sling it over my shoulder and off i go it has plenty of room for two cameras and accessories i would gladly recommend this bag to friends
i read many of the reviews here before i bought this bag and i admit i was a little worried some folks claimed the bag would <unk> itself , spilling contents to the ground and others dinged the zipper for being cheap but i have found this bag to be anything but cheaply made or insecure now that i 've taken it out on several photo <unk> , packed with lens ' , i trust it completely maybe there was a defective batch or something , but the bag i have is sturdy , easy to get in and out of , has ample room for my gear and is as comfortable as can be expected i love this bag if my best friend asked me to recommend one i 'd tell her to buy this one -rrb- -lrb- in fact * she 's * the one who recommended it to me ! -rrb- great value here if you 're looking for a convenient way to carry your camera and all its accouterments you 've found it
this case has plenty of compartments , and you can move the dividers -lrb- they have velcro -rrb- plenty of space for up to three lens + filters , speed light , and one camera body and charger <unk> , you could fit two camera bodies and a couple lens with your speed light and small hand held tripod it has a two pockets on the exterior , they note padded , so you ca n't carry any fragile equipment there there is a fabric cover that wraps over the opening and velcros , so is not real secure either when you open the bag , the inside of the cover has three zippered pouches , and there is another zip open pouch on the outside where you can store # memory cards overall , a nice pack
this bag has plenty of storage space by using the velcro partitions the partitions can be moved around the equipment to make it snug all of my gear fits nicely and securely i still have more space for future equipment there 's also plenty of pockets inside and on the outside of the bag i put all of my manuals , cables , caps , filters in these pockets still have room for more the best part for me its a backpack i do n't have to carry in one hand or strap over a shoulder , but i could if i wanted to it securely straps to my back with no worries of anything falling out and keeping my hands free
sleek look in black and green i 'm actually able to stuff a canon <unk> # <unk> video camera along with my canon eos # d with a # mm lens and a small # mm lens a few accessories and it 's a snug fit and takes care of my needs plenty of pockets to take care of small accessories and items an outside pocket on the front allows for quick access for notepad in the field or a magazine
very flexible compartments you can actually reconfigure the compartments you can carry even your tripod , blanket using the straps under the pack i only have three lenses plus the camera body and i use the other compartments for point shoot camera , extra battery pack , flash , extra flash memory , etc .
this bag has great quality i bought it on discount so it is worth every penny i paid it is water proof & has many compartments the only thing i do n't like so much is that : it is bigger than i thought -lrb- i just wanted it for carrying one nikon d # -rrb- in any case , it works great for the d # , plus much more stuff it is flexible as you can configure the interior as you want
great bag to carry while you are on a travel nice size and you can pack a lot as it has two extra pockets with zippers only concerns are that the shoulder strap loosens easy when you are putting on a bag and front pouch does n't hold well but these are only just small
a good camera bag if you are traveling my # d fits very nicely with two other lenses and a flash however , if you have a vertical grip like i do you will find that the camera is a bit snug also it is lacking <unk> compartments for things like flash cards and <unk> would have been nice padding is adequite but not great could have been thicker
this product performs exactly as described very roomy , lots of individual pockets , and well padded for fragile items comfortable carrying straps the only thing that would improve on this is wheels ... it can get heavy
bought this for a trip i love the storage capacity and velcro compartment adjustments the weight is evenly distributed when wearing the pack , however , the tops of the back straps are uncomfortable across my back at the shoulders i would never wear this for a day hiking trip as i had planned to do it was more comfortable slung over one shoulder but not for a long period of time
probably not quite the equal to my lowepro model of similar size , but quite impressive <unk> i purchased this for my wife , hoping to save a little money -lrb- do n't tell her -rrb- very sturdy , with added pockets i 'd have to pay extra for elsewhere the interior padding is especially sturdy do n't know yet how useful the tripod straps will be , but they are also well secured padding and strapping seem adequate
i 've had many bags , and this is my first backpack and it has proven itself invaluable while traveling for instance with air travel , a carry on bag and magazine ties up both hands with this canon backpack strapped on your back , <unk> <unk> , <unk> and plane boarding is a cinch the thick padded straps are comfortable and the gear is adequately proctected in the many padded compartments within like my title says , you ca n't beat the bag for the price
this backpack was a bit bigger than i expected , but just what i needed with several lenses and cameras there was plenty room for my dslr , # , and several other lenses there is also room for my tripod on the back which leaves by hands free i would recommend this backpack and will probably purchase another one the amazon price was half as in the local store
i purchased this bag for my # d and # lenses the bag itself is an excellent way to organize your equipment for short hikes or walks the straps are somewhat stiff , although if <unk> with the included <unk> , can be made more comfortable the padding between items and on the <unk> of the bag is adequate to protect your gear , but i would have expected more padding at the top area where your camera is stored dropping the bag upside down could result in damage also , be careful not to put the zippers at the top of the bag , as they can easily pull apart and allow your camera to flop out moving them both to the side helps this issue tripod straps are good for light <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> is a good place to store a reflector or your jacket at ~ # . # this bag provides # % of the performance of the much more expensive lowepro backpacks if you 're not planning on being too rough on your gear , this bag is just for you
just took a family vacation with this bag comfortable to carry , and handled my digital slr , zoom lens , and camcorder without any issues with plenty of room to spare since seeing mine , # of my co-workers have bought the same bag
i bought this to keep my canon rebel <unk> # in instead of a worn down pretty big satchel it 's a lot bigger than expected , but fits nicely in the backpack
i am very satisfied with this product great storage options - moveable dividers great for the recreational photographer i am able to fit my canon dslr , multiple lenses , video camera , digital camera , and all necessary <unk> that are associated with each piece of equipment , plus much more also has external straps , so taking a tripod along with you is no inconvenience not too mention , it was half the price of any retail store even has a hip belt , which makes hiking with this pack very comfortable awesome , awesome , awesome ! !
the bag just arrived , it has a lot of space compared to the tight fitting one i have it looks good , just have to learn to pack it correctly it is good for carring your equipment just remember to open it face up or everything will fall out to be able to carry a laptop it has to to be pretty small , mine would not fit as i hoped it would
i like the configuration and the conservative color scheme my only gripe is that the bag says `` canon `` on it in a couple places this is really no big deal # . # % of the time , but i travel internationally to some places with a high risk level for bag <unk> and <unk> i need to figure out a way to remove or cover the `` canon `` logo so that it 's not <unk> obvious that there 's thousands of dollars worth of camera equipment inside after all , what 's the point of traveling if you ca n't have your camera with you
i bought this based on reviews and the really good price it is a nice medium capacity bag for less than my full kit in retrospect , i might have opted for a <unk> instead , as i already have a full size pack however , i would have paid at least twice the money for such an alternative the bag is well made , and comfortable , and good , in my opinion , for a single body with lens mounted , and a couple of other lenses and some accessories great value for the price
the # eg backpack is a significant improvement over previous canon packs the design will serve film photographers , however , the layout and sizing of the pockets is perfect for digital accessories and media plenty of room for lenses , external flash , tripod , and extra camera bodies pockets are sized properly for cables , digital media , and charging gear the pack is lightweight , sturdy , and protective the pack also includes features that enable you to pack travel goods such as clothing , keys , and foul weather protection great for day hikes , sporting events , and general purpose photography
this is my gear storage bag and my travel bag it holds a ton of stuff , is sturdy and comfortable to wear i typically use my lowepro messenger-style camera bag on <unk> shoots or when i 'm just <unk> around taking pictures , but i keep # % of my gear stored in this bag at home when i travel , however , i use this bag because it holds so much i 've read other reviews where the zippers come unzipped during wear , spilling out the contents of the bag because of that , i keep all the zippers down the side of the bag rather than in the middle i have n't had a problem , but i 'm trying to prevent one if it happens this bag holds my camera , anywhere from # lenses , depending which ones i 'm dragging around with me , pencils , phone , books , straps , remote releases , flashes , and on and on and on it 's a pretty good bag it 's so big and roomy that i tend to lose stuff in it , forgetting which pocket i put something in
i am very pleased with this purchase the bag is a little larger than i expected , but for the price i got more for far less than most competitors ' products enough space for multiple lenses , cameras and accessories , and its fairly weather resistent , treated lip covers zippers at all openings i used it on a week long camping trip for its <unk> <unk> and everything was easily accesible and well protected from the elements
this slr camera <unk> is great i read one review about the shoulder straps not being comfortable however i must say that even though they feel stiff , they are very comfortable you can fit a good amount of stuff in this bag it is great for those who fly as it doubles as a nice carry-on i 've had my gear + an overnight change of clothes in this bag you simply ca n't beat the <unk> for the price
i initially purchased this bag for my own use as a commercial photographer i did n't pay attention to the fact this is a medium sized bag at best my wife uses it for her portrait work with a d # , a few lenses , and a couple of flashes
i wish that is was a litle larger there are straps on the bottom that hold a tripod which is nice but when a tripod is not attached the straps are annoying
i would rate this bag as excellent it has plenty of padding and room for my flash , lenses and other accessories i ca n't believe the difference in price of this bag and some other name brand bags for the money , there is no question of which bag is best i probably should have rated it a #
i really like this case but it is a little bulky it does hold a lot and comfortable to wear it is a little hard to get in and out of but for the most part it was a great buy
# - the bag got an <unk> strap with really holds up to you tight with a soft thick back for your back comfort # - i find it really useful in my <unk> mountain climbing adventures ... i 'm not worried at all about my precious equipement # <unk> also has several straps for any tripod to attach to # - it is totally adjustable to put on the separators the way u please # - very small <unk> , it barely holds my rebel , but to be honest it holds it firmly avoiding shocks # - u have to open all the zipper to be able to take off your cam , so it is never useful while u r standing , things may fall around # - also when the bag is full , the zippers barely move from the start , then goes on smoothly
this bag can carry a lot it can fit my sony a # dslr in there with a flash and # lenses and still have room left for my <unk> and batteries
i love this backpack it 's lightweight and is multi-functional i love all the pockets and straps to hold everything you need the one downside i feel is that the camera body pretty much has to be placed at the top of the bag the top area does n't have much padding around it and makes me feel like the camera body is n't as protected as the rest having the camera up top also makes the bag top heavy i tried <unk> it to have the camera loose w/out a lens attached , or changing the placement to have the camera on the bottom but the velcro dividers start to go past the zipper mark if you place the camera at the bottom if anyone else figured out a better way please let me know or post pix other than that , it holds all charges , batteries , lenses , filters , and i even have a spot for my manual for <unk>
this was a great buy all of my gear fits into the slots with room to spare the only issue i have found , is that the shoulder straps are awkward and uncomfortable
its a real good quality bag , but the problem is when you open the bag , everything fell off lenses should be strapped otherwise , i dropped my lenses couple of times but the bag is real good for the price and has a lot of
good build quality for much less than some of the other camera bags that cost much more - <unk> / removable storage <unk> storage <unk> <unk> like a normal backpack -lrb- does not scream `` steal me `` -rrb- <unk> do not like the straps for holding a tri-pod does not seem secure - no good way to secure a <unk> not found any use for the straps on the <unk> can not `` quickly `` access
i needed something to hold my eos # d safely while hunting this completely filled the bill with a few <unk> pros # -rrb- had good color not <unk> but almost just as good # -rrb- space for other equipment both hunting and camera . cons # -rrb- would like to have a place to put a water bottle out side the pack
i was wanting a backpack style camera bag for my canon rebel xti the majority of the bags i found seemed very expensive and i primarily bought this one based on price i 'm extremely happy with the purchase it seems well constructed and well designed the dividers for the different lenses can be customized to fit your needs and there are many pockets to hold everything else the only thing i 'm still trying to figure out is the drawstring on the front it seems to have no purpose and just gets in the way ... though i have used it to hold a water bottle , etc . all in all , i would highly recommend this bag
for the price , this is a great deal it 's got great shoulder straps -lrb- very necessary -rrb- , adequate internal padding , and many compartments for all of your digital gear the only drawback is the lack of padding on the outer pockets the <unk> version from targus -lrb- ? -rrb- . . is the exact same bag plus the extra padding -lrb- for more $ $ $ -rrb- . otherwise , this is a great bag that you can <unk> around with that canon logo to complete your canon kit
great value for the price it holds my eos # d with vertical grip , # , # , # flash , and # lens perfectly is it perfect , no the zippers could be better , but it holds my basic system perfect a friend saw mine and bought one the next day , despite already owning a much larger <unk> bag it holds enough to comfortably carry all day long
perfect for take your slr camera with all its equipment -lrb- charger , extra lens , cables , etc -rrb- , but canon forgot to make a compartiment for the laptop , anyway a really like my backpack
canon deluxe photo backpack # eg for canon eos slr cameras -lrb- black with green accent the bag worked out well but since i only have # slr body and # lens , the camera section has a lot of open space this caused the camera to slip around i used this for a theme park vacation and found the size very accomodating for the essentials i needed
this bag is fantastic we travel a lot and purchased this bag to use as a carry-on it has proved to be incredibly useful and keeps the camera safe and secure there are many compartments inside that you can adjust to suit your needs and use to store other items -lrb- ipod , cellphone , etc -rrb-
despite the negative reviews i 've read , i bought this backpack anyway to see for myself yes , the zippers could have been more robust , but they work ok and with the little strap mod mentioned previously from another reviewer , i feel secure that my # d canon wo n't fall out the top i have it filled with two dslr 's , three lens , flash unit , and other accessories i 'll update this review later after i put this backpack through some work update july # , # still working for me zippers still intact this bag works for me
nicely padded , reasonably well crafted someone said once it would fit a # `` ibook well , it sort of does but then the seam of the pocket that supposedly fits it tore , so i ca n't do that anymore i 'm discovering the backpack idea just is n't for me anyway , it 's comfortable but really inconvenient i 've almost dropped lenses trying to open the bag without setting it down first i know , my fault , but this is n't the bag for me , obviously if you want a good , cheap bag , buy it just realize you ca n't treat it like you would a $ # - $ # bag and you 'll be fine
the canon photo backpack # eg is definitely a plus for photographers it has plenty of room for camera and several lenses , as well as room for other accessories such as spare batteries , memory chips lens filters etc . the pack is lightweight and is comfortable to wear on those extended photo hikes the only down side is having to remove the pack to get at spare lenses or other accessories , but hey , it 's a backpack after all i would definitely recommend this item for those photographers wanting to get out and shoot pictures without dragging a bulky camera bag along with them
the bag is a little bigger than i expected but will work really well i am planning on taking this bag on an overseas trip with me and this will hold everything i need plus a little more i do n't have a lot of camera equipment as yet so this will be perfect for my trip
backpack works fine holds # d , flash , extra lens , and all kinds of misc . junk seems very well made is padded and provides protection for components padded <unk> are provided for in between camera , lenses , etc . glad i bought it
regardless of the great price this is a great pack has features of packs costing # or # times as much plenty of storage very well made would have given it # stars but i 'm not crazy about the big hard plastic logo
i recently bought a few new lenses so my sling camera bag just no longer worked for me to be honest the reason i bought this is the price compared to other backpack style cases the bag is sturdy and comes with plenty of padding for your investments it also has a number of very handy features for carrying all your gear in one spot all in all i 'm very happy with what i got for the price i paid the only downside i have experienced is that the bag sits a little high on my back , but it could be that i 'm <unk> tall so that is fairly common if you are looking for a fairly inexpensive , but quality system for carrying all your gear at once this is for you
if it 's a backpack camera bag with alot of room and alot of options that you want ... then this back will do the trick the bag reasonably priced , well-built , roomy , and can be modified to fit any mix of camera gear the only negative i find is that the bag must be taken off , put on a flat surface , and then opened to gain access to the cameras inside if you open it while upright , your valuable equipment may fall out in addition , there is a chance that the pack can open if you put too much weight in the outside top pouch finally , if you are looking for a bag to `` sling `` over one shoulder ... this is n't it
i bought this bag to carry # bodies and # lenses . # d & # d , # & # but it wo n't handle it my error as both bodies have a grip attached so makes them too high to close the top i do however use it with the # d and grip with the # but have to put camera in on it 's side to make it fit construction seems good enough it wo n't do what i thought it would but that 's my fault but i still will find good uses for it depending on the type of shoots i 'm doing pretty nice bag for the money lots of pockets etc .
this pack was purchased as an <unk> after buying more -lrb- and larger -rrb- glass main section has decent <unk> plenty of pockets good enough padding , both for the equipment and my shoulders / back construction seems very good straps can be adjusted to suit the user very good , especially for the price
this is a good backpack that will hold all of your camera things in one spot i have # lenses , and a canon # d they all fit fine lots of little compartments for little things , extra zipped pockets , no complaints i think i will still need to go buy a smaller backpack for when i do n't want to carry this heavy load and have just one lens in mind for using
this is a great case it opens easy and has a full opening top . lots of storage capabilities i have taken mine all over the world for my photographic work one problem is is zips open too easy and with the canon name on the bag it is a <unk> <unk> i use a shoulder strap with mine when i am shooting to give me easy access to the top and pockets it allows me to `` <unk> `` my camera tip : when not shooting , keep zippers down and front when in crowds to make it harder for people to get in the bag without you noticing
i 'm really pleased with this bag , it holds all my gear with room to spare there are enough adjustable straps to fine tune the bag to your comfort level it stays nice and tight against my back and does n't feel like a burden at all this is a great value compared to some of the other options the only drawback to this bag is that there is n't a convenient way of grabbing your camera without taking the bag off and opening it up other than that , no faults
a decent value camera bag for the money the bag has quality construction with a good amount of storage space i currently have the camera body and four lenses with an assortment of accessories that easily fit within the bag this is a great bag for the beginner or to use for a backup camera i 'd prefer a lil more padding for carrying this bag during an all day event but well worth $ #
this is a great bag if you are just trying to carry your gear around nothing fancy and no easy access type zippers to whip out your camera quickly , but it is roomy i can pack a lot in it i usually use it when i am traveling it works out well the reason why i bought it is because i needed a nice upgrade from the regular canon shoulder bag that came with my camera i wanted something that i could fit all of my equipment in ... and more
i bought this bag to replace a previous camera bag i had that did n't hold as much i love everything about this bag and then some easy to use and organize to the way you need it i made a slight modification to the bag i removed the tripod straps from the bottom of the bag and moved them to the side for a monopod doing the move gave me an easier access to my monopod and it also moves it away from the bottom especially when there 's people around you do n't want to bump into them with it other then that the bag is a great purchase
it fits for professional cameras with <unk> that have many tools . . but if you are a beginner this bag will be too big and you will find many empty areas in it for <unk> and other accessories
my experience has been consistent with all of the previous reviews that i read before my purchase for the money , it 's pretty hard to beat this bag there are most certainly better bags out there , but <unk> some of the issues that i remember reading about from others , yes , the tripod straps seem to be practically useless so i easily removed them as well as some of the other seemingly useless straps the `` steal me `` logo popped off easily unlike some of the other reviews , i find the quality of the shoulder padding to be consistent with other bags of this <unk> finally , one of my bigger worries was the issue of the zippers opening from the top allowing my camera to spill out - this is a non-issue while i 'm not wild about the camera body position being at the top of the bag , by simply leaving the zippers down to either side instead of at the top of the bag you have no worries i routinely carry a cannon # d with a couple of different lenses along with lots of filters , a large lens hood , and lots of other stuff with no problem
i really like the camera bag , it fits # bodies and # lenses with some extras the other features are perfect for cell phone , wallet , and some other personal items the only part i have difficulty with are the back straps , i can not tighten them enough so the backpack flops around more than i wish it would
easy to carry it has a lot of storage too the only downfall is that you ca n't use it as a regular backpack i 'm a student so i always had a book i needed to pack with me the draw strings on the front of the bag held it okay but i 'd rather put it inside also , there are no covers over the compartments so if you open the backpack the wrong way , all of your lenses and your body are going to fall out there is a small velcro strap but that 's not going to stop anything from falling out
i use this for my nikon camera because its good and its not expensive does everything i need it to i wish that there was more padding on the front of the pack i feel like its not well protected on the flap
this bag is great perfect storage for all you camera equipment the only draw back is the zippers are kinda easy to pop open so you need a little lock to stop that plus it can be used as a <unk> thing also also the bag could be more stronger , but ca n't really beat ~ $ # for a <unk> bag
this is a smaller backpack that can fit the basics i like it because it handles my camera with lens , my larger lens and a flash , then photo stuff this is a good day trip kind of bag will it fit all your stuff ? nah but can you carry it around all day on vacation the build quality is good though and has pretty good padding
i had seen this in best buy before i decided to purchase it through amazon , so i knew exactly what i was getting the price alone would have made me give it a high review , but the functionality of the dividers in the main zipper pocket led me to <unk> a star do n't get me wrong it is great and easy to set up for any style dslr you have , but the dividers themselves cause a bit of trouble the # main cushioned dividers provide great but have a strange velcro setup that allow you only to place them within # inches of <unk> in the main pocket because of a strange <unk> design they have it does n't exactly secure my equipment in place as well as i would like after some <unk> on my part they did eventually <unk> where i wanted them all in all still very useful padded very well and can hold up to some mild jostling
arrived on time as described price is right lots of room for <unk> plus lenses and several accessories only drawback is zippers tend to open if you are lugging the back pack in an inverted or sideways position , so must pay attention to unit when you do not have it properly on your back not a major prob . does the
i read the reviews for this bag , and the bad ones complained that it was too small , or that it fell apart after a week well , it has not fallen apart after a month , although i do take good care of it is it too small listen , camera bags are expensive , so if you pay around $ # for a camera bag and it can hold multiple lenses and two <unk> on your back , you should be happy the bag is smallish , but not at all tiny , and i would say that the bag is for a hobbyist and not a professional i can even put my tripod -lrb- which is in a bag -rrb- in the front part of the bag i personally think that this bag is the best bag you can get for the money and it will make your picture taking experience so much easier
this canon backpack appears small and compact , but will hold <unk> you can throw at it i know # people that have this same bag , including myself , and it seems like i ca n't buy enough equipment to fill it up two camera bodies , two <unk> lenses , # other lenses , flash and cleaning supplies i can even hang my tri-pod from the adjustable straps on the bottom of the pack recommend for any amateur photographer
this is an amazing bag given the price i only wish that it had a cover on it so that when you unzipped the bag in a vertical position , the contents did n't fall out
this is a nice bag plenty of room for lenses and your other supplies only drawback is that it 's awkward to put in a camera with a lens attached into the bag it seems more suited to camera bodies without lenses attached however , for this price range , you will probably not find a nicer bag
this backpack does exactly what i wanted it fits all my lenses , flash , camera , etc . no more wrapping my lenses in old socks light backpack when empty however , this backpack is rather uncomfortable the shoulder straps are too close together i have a relatively small frame -lrb- <unk> medium t-shirts , etc -rrb- but the straps really dug into my <unk> muscles after a couple hour hike i could imagine someone with a larger frame finding this backpack very uncomfortable for long hauls
while i do find this a little big and bulky , it is still comfortable to wear it 's not convenient for quick lens changes , but there is enough space for tons of equipment i have several bags of different sizes to cover all situations i love this bag for travel or if i 'm going out and want to have everything with me , just in case my favorite travel feature is the front pocket it is the perfect size for my mac book i 'm able to keep all my resources together and do n't have to carry multiple bags on the plane
i really like this bag , and for the photography i do , it 's perfect i do mostly <unk> photography , and i do n't have any # / # mm lenses to carry around the bag does not have a ton of extra room say for a laptop and whatnot , but it does have two front pouches that are very useful , and two small pouches inside if you want to purchase your first camera backpack for a great price , grab this
