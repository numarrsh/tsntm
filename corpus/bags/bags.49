i love the bag , it holds my macbook pro # . # `` perfectly , but i gave it four stars due to the color which is just okay i read the reviews for this bag and only now realize that everyone was reviewing the hot alligator pink and not this color i guess the color will grow on me especially as the bag is serving it ` s main purpose - protecting my computer the bag is well made and i have no problem with limited space , all my cords - charger with apple extension , ethernet cord , cleaning cloth and manual can fit in the pocket additionally i can use my computer while its still secured in the bag
my computer is # . # inches and it fits perfectly the memory foam is great i had plenty of room for my power cord the material is beautiful , not cheap at all the strap is comfortable you will love this bag but be aware it is not a bag that will fit notebooks and a lot of extra stuff it is for your laptop , cord , and small items when you are on the go i am very pleased
i ordered the # inch casecrown memory foam pocket case for my # . # inch toshiba laptop , and it fits perfectly very nice quality with a pocket for the charger and a detachable shoulder strap . very pretty pearly pink color . holds the laptop in place while in use
i got this carrying case for my macbook pro -lrb- i use this for general <unk> purposes with my laptop , and a padded sleeve for airline travel . let me just say that i love it it protects my computer really well , and there 's plenty of room in the front pocket for my adapter and mouse and a few other necessities it 's a really cute shade of pink - super girly - which i love it 's a very slim carrying case and can fit into all kinds of small spaces when not in use i highly recommend this case
i have a # . # inch computer it fits great i am very pleased with this product i do n't have to remove my computer , all i have to do is unzip and i 'm ready to use i am very pleased with this product it is just what i wanted and better than i expected thank you so much
fits my vaio perfectly the front pocket is even big enough for the charger and a wireless mouse not to mention is it <unk> pink seriously one of my best finds on amazon
i was looking for a cute case for my # & # # ; macbook pro , and this bag is perfect it 's a little thicker than i expected , but in a good way the memory form protect my <unk> , while the front pocket are spacious enough for my mouse , notebook and other accessories overall , i am very satisfied with my purchase :
i 'm always leary about the quality of products that are inexpensive but this is a really great bag i could n't find anything similar in the retail stores i live the way this looks and feels it seems very durable i bought the # in bag for a # in macbook air laptop it 's a little big but that gives me a little extra room to carry accessories i really like this bag it was a great value
i have been using this product for several months now and still continue to receive almost daily complements on its appearance in addition to it 's rather attractive appearance , the case is wonderfully protective for my computer i recently dropped the case , but no damage was done to the computer : -- rrb- this case is roomy enough to be able to hold a laptop , ipad -lrb- in an otter box -rrb- , the cords , and a mouse i would highly recommend this product
it fits my # . # laptop perfectly , the color is lovely and i 've gotten many compliments the front carries my charger and its just the perfect carrying case for someone who likes to be
this case looks really beautiful and much more expensive than it actually cost it perfectly fits my laptop i can get the power cord in the pocket but its a case so it ca n't hold much more than that
love the laptop case excellent price for the quality of the product if anything i thought the color looked even better in person than the photos -lrb- i bought the light pink one . even though its a very girly pink i do n't think it looks `` little kiddish `` at all , which was a slight concern buying it i also like how it fits the laptop with room to spare but is very thin and sleek , some laptop cases are huge like carrying a freaking briefcase around so i was really glad its not bulky would definitely recommend
case is a pearly pink and is very pretty arrived promptly too it fits just right on my macbook pro # . & # # ; not sure why anyone would give it a bad rating unless it just did n't fit
i 'm really enjoying my mamba shift ; practical and very easy to access compartments , very well thought-out and sturdy design , great carry handle -lrb- small feature but extremely useful -rrb- i 'm confident that my laptop is very well protected my only <unk> are that the central compartment is not as roomy on the base as one would imagine - it can be a bit challenging trying to zip it up with anything with a bit of <unk> stored inside and as a petite woman , the shoulder straps are not particularly comfortable if they could design a version with <unk> shoulder straps and give it a little bit more depth , it would be brilliant having recently bought a north face <unk> with women 's specific shoulder straps , i can vouch for their superior comfort factor particularly for us small <unk>
i highly recommend this mamba shift l over the m , even if you have a # `` <unk> i have a mba with the booq vyper sleeve this keeps the mba from moving around while adding rigid protection the material and manufacturing quality is superb , typical for booq i wish they used the rubber zipper cover of the m on the l -lrb- is is a fabric zipper cover -rrb- the storage capacity is lacking if you are planing to use this for more than just gadget transport -lrb- do n't expect to fit books or binders -rrb- this backpack desperately needs an expandable zipper feature
i bought this bag for my mba classes i needed something to carry a # in laptop which was comfortable but stylish and would fit my books without being bulky this bag is great the area for the laptop is well protected internally with fleece and from my back with an <unk> <unk> -lrb- no back sweat stains -rrb- the large carry <unk> fits my books well and has spaces for my ac charger and cords as wells as other need the only request i would ahve is for a larger `` pocket `` on the strap for my phone and maybe a more useful outside pocket
i bought this as a present for my husband after his laptop bag -lrb- and laptop and ipad and various other items -rrb- was stolen his new laptop fits beautifully inside he , being an engineer type , loves the easy organization and simplicity of styling the nylon ballistic material is extremely sturdy and well constructed his laptop slides in and out of it 's own pocket which has been the big selling point for him no need to unzip the main compartment to pull out his computer quickly he walks to and from work since we live only # mile away , and this is the perfect way for him to carry all of his computing paraphernalia with him it is a bit pricey , but i think his <unk> with it definitely makes it worthwhile
i bought this bag when the model was new it has been about two years and this bag is amazing i use it constantly , and it has shown no signs of wear -lrb- not a rip , or tear , or snag the only signs of wear are dirt from being placed on the ground the construction of this bag is perfect i ca n't imagine buying a bag from another company i hate to sound like an advertisement , but this bag is really that good i have a dell # in a booq hard shell and it fits into the laptop compartment snugly , with enough room to carry misc attachments if you need a laptop bag and do n't mind paying for perfection , i ca n't imagine a bag that would be better than this one also , it looks great too
i bought the ilugger case for my # `` imac a few years ago and used it only a # or # times the carrying strap broke the last time i used it <unk> a piece out of the computer frame and denting it in a couple more i had a <unk> friend sew the straps back on , reinforced with leather i plan on buying a new imac soon but will not be buying an ilugger case for it
earlier today i was thinking i needed to get online an post a rave review about my new ilugger , then i noticed a big chip on the upper left hand corner of my screen i drove across three states with my <unk> and handled my computer with care , stowing it in the trunk upright between suitcases so it would n't shift i 'm thinking this happened when i was rolling the bag or setting it down seems that the bottom is n't padded enough i 'll still use my ilugger , but i 'll be sure to add extra padding to my imac , especially at the top -lrb- the imac fits upside down in the ilugger -rrb-
i purchased a brand new imac and needed to get it over seas - fedex and ups shipping costs were just plain silly and there was no way i was going to put the mac under the plane i learned about ilugger , bought one with wheels and it could not have been simpler security and storage in the overhead all went flawlessly and the mac arrived perfectly
i use this protective case for my imac # . # inch -lrb- it is the # model -rrb- and it fits perfectly and is very protective , as it is padded and protects the imac very well it is also much easier than carrying an imac than without a case this case is great for the imac # . # inch
this bag is great . when using it for my imac , i do n't have to leave that awesome machine at home i just bag it up and in no time at all i 'm out the door now i can use that fabulous screen on the go to do presentations without using a small laptop there are a variety of ways to carry it from shoulder straps to carrying handles to backpack straps it stores my keyboard , mouse and cd/dvd 's i would recommended it to anybody who wants there imac to be portable
this is a great product strong and well padded a little awkward because you put the computer in upside down you can carry it like a backpack , <unk> or on your shoulder or just holding it by the strap worth every penny
great product which transports your computer safely i recently <unk> overseas , so i needed a secure way to carry my computer i was able to get through security and fit my imac into an overhead bin securely it works perfectly as it was designed to and i highly recommend it i was carrying a # . # `` imac with associated cables , apple tv , remote and <unk> pad definitely worth the investment when traveling with your imac
while walking one of the straps slipped through the metal latch resulting in the laptop falling from shoulder height and causing some damage to my macbook pro retina three things to take away from this : # the metal latch may have been defective , # -rrb- the bag has barely any padding to protect your laptop # -rrb- thule customer service is trying help me get the laptop repaired if you want a nice looking bag then you 've found your match if you want a bag that is going to project your expensive gadgets ... look else where
it fit my macbook pro perfectly and it was secure in the backpack however i returned it due to the lack of padding in the shoulder straps it was very uncomfortable carrying it
i am not sure it was worth the cost for me i wanted a reliable backpack for traveling the pack was too narrow for me at the straps when i use the chest clip it becomes really uncomfortable other than that its really handy i still use it , , its a solid built backpack but if you are like me # ' # & # # ; and wear a size # jacket you may want to try it on first
the search always is on for the perfect <unk> <unk> <unk> 's book `` a <unk> look at # `` spends almost # the book on it this is as close as it gets the hard pouch is perfect for not getting your <unk> damaged
i have been using bags for work for more # years this is by far - the best i have ever had as you can expect - the materials are really good and the bag looks very cool the size is great and although they promote it as a casual bag it is good for & # # ; business & # # ; as well i am happy with the backpack with # cons - the upper internal pocket -lrb- the one for the phone -rrb- is heavy and once you open the bag it falls down into the bag ... can be annoying - there is no strap in the back to hold the bag on a <unk> that - the size is great for # inch laptop and all the daily stuff you need
well constructed , good color selection excellent zippers , pocket layout , water protection , etc . the only complaint is the lack of bottom cushion , so the computer needs another neoprene like case to protect it when you set the bag down on a hard surface
this is the best backpack i have ever owned i took away # star because it is not waterproof and did not come with a waterproof cover my tall clean <unk> fits perfectly into the side pocket and is secured with the side strap the top carry area is very convenient and well thought out the other compartments are all well thought out material is durable the zipper is <unk> maintains a good shape especially with a laptop in it
this is a great laptop bag excellent craftsmanship , quality and good number of pockets for individual items and how can you beat the # year warranty but please be informed that this is strictly a day pack it can not fit more than a laptop , a pair of clothes and other electronic items this is not suitable for a overnight travel bag unless you travel really light i have returned this and ordering <unk> #
the thule backpack is ideal for the what i needed it for , everyday commute with my macbook air # and ipad the bright color is also great being able to distinguish from others it has a lot of room and still low profile sturdy construction and easy to adjust for best fit
love the color and the contrasting orange accents everything feels quality , from the zippers to the cinch straps the hard compartment for glasses , etc , is nice , but makes for an awkward <unk> in the main compartment i wish this hard compartment was a little less deep to <unk> the main compartment and , the vertical front zipper is a little awkward i find myself avoiding that compartment because it is n't deep enough for much because of this , i gave it # -stars instead of #
thule pack ... honestly i did n't know they made bags until i decided to order this one the bag itself is made of high quality materials and the zippers are also top quality it is a thoughtful design with two grab handles , top and bottom , and useful compartments the bag is on the small size , but fits me well -lrb- # r jacket -rrb- fyi - i am carrying an older # `` laptop and the sleeve area is close to being tight i 'm sure a # `` macbook will fit , but your run of the mill bestbuy # . # `` is probably the max
i bought this backpack mainly for school but i found that i can use it for many other things it has stood up to the rain , heavy books , heat , and spills yet it still looks almost new my computer fits in it perfectly as well as my school work the straps on the side work great to tighten the backpack and the water bottle holder is fantastic as well i have yet to use the bottom strap of the bag but when it comes to a time which i need it - i will have it i found use for it when travelling as well i find it useful to put a couple pairs of clothes and some necessities - i am good to go considering the quality and usefullness of this bag , i will have to purchase the # l backpack duffel bag for long distance travelling i trust that it will be good quality ca n't go bad with thule
not much to say , very good quality i have msi ge # . # <unk> and fits perfectly witch is why i bought this backpack in first place and i love it honestly before i did n't care that much for a backpack and i bought cheap chinese <unk> , but this one is just great organization compartment is great good fabric quality and awesome safe zone for my iphone all in all great backpack for # $ ! !
this backpack is about the perfect size for me i need to carry my laptop and my ereader with me on trips and this keeps them both safely stored away but easily accessible the top has a hard case with zipper to keep your <unk> ... perfect for knowing exactly where they are located the straps are cushioned so even carrying around my # inch laptop is n't a chore i really have nothing negative to say about it , it fits my needs perfectly and seems sturdy enough to last for a long time
great product , compact with enought space for carrying the <unk> & <unk> ; <unk> high quality and durable materials , just great as for all backpacks i have use , this is the best so far
great for travel and school i like it so much i 'm thinking of getting one for my fiance the straps seem a little narrow for a broad mans shoulders but they 're great for a young lady like me
i absolutely love this backpack it serves its purpose very well i has so many features that make it the most amazing backpack i 've ever owned the straps are comfy , the hard protective case is my favorite feature , and it fits my macbook perfectly the color is great also this is just an all around great purchase
if you want protection and storage , look no <unk> this backpack is sturdy , durable , and offers plenty of protection i did a lot of research before purchasing , and i think this may be one of the best out there
the backpack is really very good it has space to carry all of my notebook accessories . . space for the notebook is accurate and well protected a capsule for storing glasses is excellent and with all this backpack is lightweight and comfortable i am very satisfied
the quality is awesome its solid , <unk> and very handy i just cant imagine my life with out it i always cary things with me , <unk> macbook , camera , ipad , and staff and that baby boy can handle all of
saw the black version in the store but , blue looked more unique , and you know we are all unique has lots of pockets , but not one of the largest bags it suites my purpose perfectly the only thing it does not have is an integral name tag well constructed and the internal hard <unk> case is great oh , it also could use some rings to attach hanging articles overall , i love it , carry it every where
i have use this for one year and it is the perfect size for me , for the beach , for orlando trips , to take my pc from one place to another <unk> <unk> conpartments also helps a lot sorry for my
i love this backpack the build quality is great it looks beautiful and does not have a & # # ; school & # # ; feel at all i use it everyday in business , school , and even in church i ride a <unk> <unk> and was really concerned with having a backpack the <unk> sits snugly against the body and is very streamlined most of my other & # # ; streamlined & # # ; backpacks did n't have any room for anything practical this one can seriously carry a lot of stuff it is much taller than most backpacks and leaves you tons of
i was al little worried about this backpack looking too big on me but even with my laptop , books , lunchbox and whatever else i never felt like i looked weighed down . lots and lots of pockets nice comfy straps and cushioned back part . color is better then pictured . shipped
it <unk> like it is built very well , both the material and the zippers it has plenty of pockets , zipper pockets inside the <unk> compartment , and plenty of protection for the computer section also i love the safe zone pocket on the middle of the top of backpack it is very strong so it will not break easily at all , and big enough to fit a couple of things -lrb- sunglasses , phone , wallet , etc . overall it came as expected , and was definitely worth the money
the size i needed for my body size is very confy to use the volume is just enough for the regular day use : laptop and accesories , a notebook , and some pens
this is a great back for any activity either it be casual or a physical activity it is very comfortable to wear , and has great compartments to put your stuff although i do n't have a macbook pro laptop or anything , i bought it to carry around when i travel , and it has done it 's duty i would recommend it to anyone
only have had it for # months , but it has been great so far lots of useful pockets , some not so useful pockets i have the large # `` hp laptop that i was hoping would fit in the sleeve , and it did not i slit one side of the sleeve and it works just fine overall , i would definitely recommend this product
high quality backpack strong , rugged and surprisingly light very comfortable to wear i walk an hour # times a week with it filled with a laptop and some gear and it is rests really nice on the shoulders and back highly recommend even for the somewhat higher price
so far what i expected . cheap price yet seems to be durable . have n't had the chance to use the rain cover yet . use it for on the motorcycle , work and class and take it everywhere not going to use for a computer and never was the intention do n't know how it would perform carrying a laptop
very nice , stylish , simple backpack the only thing i did n't like was that the laptop sleeve inside did not cover the top edges of the laptop when stored the corners are still unprotected in the end , i had to return it anyways since the left strap was put together reversed so the strap would not lock
fyi this bag can not hold a lot of books i 'm a grad student and carry very few books with me to class ; however as an undergrad i carried lots of books and this bag would not have worked well good : very <unk> <unk> - nice when traveling on <unk> stowing compartment for rain <unk> # `` laptops will fit fairly <unk> a lot of excess room for larger <unk> of pockets is poor - all pockets are deep which = all your belongings getting <unk> in the bottom causing headache if in a
the style of this backpack has to be my favorite part about it it has plenty of ways to organize things also it 's very comfortable to wear too , even when completely full the middle pocket can sometimes seem not to fit much but other than that it 's just perfect i 'd recommend it to anyone looking for a stylish and convenient back pack
<unk> speed rain bumper <unk> the best backpack i 've bought it 's very comfortable to wear and so far seems very strong and durable it has a myriad of storage options and offers a padded compartment that can fit a laptop and an ipad there are lots of little pockets and compartments to help organize your backpack plus a headphone opening for use with and mp # player and two pockets for water bottles you also get vents or <unk> for improved airflow along the back which helps reduce sweating the waterproof layer is neatly tucked in at the bottom and kept outside in a zippered compartment i have no reservations about recommending this backpack for someone with a # `` or smaller laptop you 'll have space for all your accessories and then some
it is made of good materials and has a pocket with zipper i like the simple design however , one -lrb- big -rrb- problem is , it is quite oversized than actual # -inch macbook pro so it is not anywhere close to snag fit i can put two macbook pros in the case
you might as well put your # `` macbook pro in a pillow case this case is well built and reasonably attractive unfortunately as others have stated , it is far to large for the # `` macbook pro i was looking for a fairly snug sleeve that would provide some basic protection and could be put into a backpack or suitcase this is more like a floppy bag to drop your laptop into if you do n't mind a really loose case , you will probably like the quality and aesthetic of this one otherwise , look elsewhere
cool case with nice beige <unk> inside good thing it 's reversible because the orange is so bright , i ca n't look directly at it for a long time also has nice pocket on the inside
fully protects my laptop bought # of it as i could n't find one that fits my asus <unk> # fits perfectly and served my purpose for a laptop sleeve to protect from dust , scratch , etc . when i travel around
i am using this for a # `` hp computer most cases do not fit my laptop even typical laptop bags do n't fit my laptop this fit perfectly and i was even able to zip the charger in the small compartment in the flap of the case
i was a sucker for the price and got what i paid for ... this case is loose on my # & # # ; mac and smells like rubber i got rid of it a week after it arrived :
somewhat stylish -- thin and flimsy good to protect from scratches , but not good for protection from a drop or fall this is very flimsy made of thin neoprene with a felt lining it smells of neoprene , and a few weeks after receiving it the smell has not gone away i ca n't stand that smell , so this is not being used it does not fit the mbp # `` in a <unk> way , with over an inch of slack at the top of the sleeve i lost my tags that came with it , or i would have returned it
i ordered this case in # -inch when i received it about # days later the packaging slip said it was a # -inch but it was actually a # -inch amazon did pay for return shipping but would not refund , only exchange i have mailed my return and am still waiting for the new one to arrive one month later i called customer service because the estimated delivery date has passed and the # -inch still has not shipped they gave me a different number to call -lrb- the seller -rrb- which i did and they could not find any record of my order usually i have had positive experiences with amazon but this experience is making me extremely skeptical i will use it if and when it does get here but i would not recommend this item it was pretty flimsy and did not provide much support but i do like the design it is very stylish
the carrying case is not bad , its just a little tooo <unk> for my tastes the main color is a lighter blue than expected and the trim is very light guess i have male confidence issues so be it nothing functionally wrong with the case , though seems sturdy and of good
was not large enough to fit samsung netbook that is <unk> # . # `` although it was a suggested <unk> made and nice looking hard case is actually pearl white <unk> shame it did n't fit
fits your ipad in a case plus more , like a notebook the elastic bands kind of sucks but i 've just stopped using them it 's just a great case to take your stuff in and out of , protects really well , and does n't look half bad for the price
this is a great case for the # `` netbooks but fyi , if you happen to own a dell mini , this will not fit your netbook -- the computer is a little too thick at one end for this case , which is why i subtracted one star other netbooks that are the same # . # `` screen size fit this case just fine
this fits my note perfect with a & # # ; case & # # ; on it i am not sure what # reviews problem is , the & # # ; huge rubber logo & # # ; on the front is the size of dime , and not all have a logo on the inside i got the black damask and inside is red quilted padded fabric this really is a great little product and i feel my note is just tha much more protected when i have to travel with it with my note in a case inside this case that leaves little room for anything in the back pocket that is not flat , but nothing that will make me rate this any less ! love this item !
i received my cover today , i have a # macbook # `` white unibody , bottom fits fine , the top <unk> n't stay on at all trying to return it now <unk> from <unk> ...
when i recieved this item i could tell right away that the item had be previously open because the package seal was ripped and not in the package properly once i opened the item it had scratches inside and out along with finger prints i am very <unk> and hesitant to order a replacement from this company
i bought a speck see thru satin in red for my white unibody macbook i 've had it on for just a couple of weeks today , i popped off the <unk> case to install ram and i noticed # red stain rings which appear to be from the `` feet `` of the casing i 've contacted speck regarding this issue and i have n't heard back this is a big problem for me because i only bought the speck case to protect my macbook from <unk> and maintain the resale value of this computer i bought this macbook less than a month ago and i am very annoyed i <unk> amazon to stop selling this product thanks , <unk> <unk> ,
this speck see thru satin did not fit my mac # & # # ; and it was difficult to put it on everything fell apart i did n't even last # mins waste of money do not buy no matter how inexpensive this is we just threw it in the trash we were so so so disappointed
i purchased this item while i was in <unk> and once it arrived , it did not fit as previously stated the return shipping from overseas cost as much as the product , so i basically had to eat the cost i would not recommend this product if you have a white macbook pro , the older model
it was pretty but the top part is peeling it was really difficult to remove it left four dents from where the case was attached i have to return it
this deep <unk> case stained the bottom of my brand new macbook -lrb- not even # weeks old ! ! ! -rrb- now it 's all pink unfortunately , i did not discover this until i popped the bottom casing out do not purchase this casing for your macbook
the product looked great when i got however the top layer of the cover that gives it that dull finish scratches right off revealing the shiny layer underneath giving it a <unk> appearance
bought this for my friend 's macbook she had a purple one from the same company of the same make , but decided to change things up with this lovely red color we got it , we put it on , and barely a month or two later we notice that the plastic shell is `` peeling . weird <unk> , scratchy plastic started to come up all over it made it look like the computer , which was working in almost perfect condition , had been through a <unk> or something not too happy , but i would be willing to try the speck brand again as a matter of fact , the computer i am on now has a speck case , and i have never had problems something about this one was bad probably a lemon
you have to be very careful because the thin soft plastic covering flakes off very easily and looks tacky , i ended up peeling mine off however the design is good and it snaps on easily enough -lrb- its harder to get the top part off though , but that is a common problem with plastic computer cases like this -rrb-
this appeared to be a very nice case , but it did n't fit my # -inch macbook that 's not because there 's something wrong with the case however - it 's just that the finer print <unk> that came with it stated that it would n't fit a slightly older version macbook i just wished the online description was more specific so i did n't buy it , only to return it the color is great - but i 'm still looking for a red case that will fit -lrb- and is in stock somewhere .
it was just as the description said i truly love the color even though i had been a bit worried but my worries were not necessary since it was an awesome red the only bad part is that my mac is not working at the moment . boo <unk> .
hi , this product seems to be very useful , but the case i bought did not fit right on my computer how can i return it ? and do you have one that it could be replaced with to fit my computer it 's a new mac
i read several reviews before purchasing the product and i was concerned with the difficulty of attaching the case and removal i received my case today and i have to say that i am very pleased it snaps on easily and is easily removed as well the look is great , it adds style to an otherwise dull macbook would definitely recommend this product to anyone
this is a great laptop case looks stunning in the red feels really neat however , keep in mind that it is for the newer style of the macbooks i did n't know this , and ordered it , and it does not fit at all for my old macbook i returned it easily and the seller was very efficient i would recommend this product for anyone with the new macbook , i wish i could have had it for mine ! !
i was initially , skeptical about the product looking at the review on the red speck cover but then looked at other reviews for the same product -lrb- different colors -rrb- and found it very helpful this cover <unk> perfectly on the new mackbook unibody -lrb- white -rrb- red on white looks beautiful and will save the white mb from scratches and smudges
this cover is a great protective covering for a laptop snaps on easily comes in a variety of colors best of all the cover keeps laptop from getting scratched
this speck case fits the new white polycarbonate unibody mac excellent fit , easy to put on although i have not tried to take it off yet good grip , does leave finger prints on the case overall a good buy i have not noticed any scratching of the mac but will report back if i do
my kid 's old white macbook had a big crack in the cover plastic . this cover made the cover more rigid and will prevent it from cracking further , i think . kid 's love the bright color
looks and performs well goes on easily and stays on the macbook my grandson loves the red glowing apple on the see thru cover he made a `` <unk> `` <unk> right to it ...
i accidentally purchased this case for my friend but the color of the product was amazing . the shipping came in fairly decent and overall it was a good product just not a product that was made for her
i love <unk> cover by speck it is well made , fits my mbp perfectly and protects it from scratches and dings i love the red color and when my mbp is on , the apple lights up in red i highly recommend to anyone so you can protect your valuable asset
imagine the inside of a camping tent this is what this bag is like on the inside and the outside do not like the cover , do not like the clasp , do not like the cheap feel of it bad choice and poor taste was a mistake to buy this
wrong <unk> item i received was a targus # & # # ; laptop backpack bag , my # & # # ; hp does not fit in the bag although targus bag is well made it just wo n't work for me .
this bag looks professional , but after carrying it around for a few weeks with a small laptop in tow , the top zipper completely came apart am returning to amazon ; would not recommend
i bought this for my asus g # series laptop the bag seemed nice enough , but my computer would n't fit maybe this bag holds other # . # `` laptops with no problems , but the fans on the asus make the computer thicker than the average laptop because of this , the computer barely fits into the bag there is no way the zipper will zip all the way shut , either
i like the sleek look and feel of this bag , as opposed to a lot of similar bags that fellow <unk> use however , i do n't think that it 's particularly <unk> , which is what i need for a work messenger bag the clasp on the outer flap is relatively difficult to hook and unhook , and the zipper pocket on the outside is small and hard to access also , the swivel joints on the straps squeak pretty <unk>
i bought this and took it literally around the world its been really sturdy all the way and the clasp is not the best design choice but it works it holds when you need it to it took a bunch of <unk> , my # `` mac , a pretty thick book , all my cables and a little more <unk> <unk> stuff overall , a good value almost # months after i started using this bag , the zippers broke it makes an annoying sound when you walk -lrb- the strap 's plastic hook scrapes the plastic it is hooked to -rrb- , bumping down the stars cause of this
