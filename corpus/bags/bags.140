i bought this for my new macbook in a nutshell , the case was easy to put on , fits like a glove , protects my macbook in addition it looks nice what more can you ask for if you need it , buy it ... if you want it , buy it
it looks really nice like its expensive but my problem with it is that i bought it to be a computer bag and hold my school supplies and it can do that it all fits but it was uncomfortable and almost painful had to go buy a backpack if all you wanted to carry was a laptop then you should be fine
just got the bag it has nice sleek look to it but material looks cheap i was expecting a more cream color as shown in the picture but its more of an olive <unk> color with a lot of shine other than the looks , it is pretty sturdy and has a lot of different compartments for different things i like that it has small pocket on the back not shown in the picture where i can keep my metro cards for easy access without ever opening my bag in public but i really wish material and color would be little better maybe in black it would nice
this seems to be a pretty decent buy bought it as a gift for my aunt it 's really stylish what i do n't like about it # . the material , why does it have to crease like that ? # the middle compartment is a tight fit for whatever , your laptop and charger might be getting to comfy with each other , little space for much more what i like : the number of pockets , it stands on it 's own and just looks good generally four stars , yay
overall , great product the fabric is n't as nice as i thought , and it is a stiff bag , but it works great for what i needed for the price , you ca n't beat it
i bought this identical bag about # years ago after heavy use and many flights for work , the handles were beginning to fray a bit other than that the bag still looks good however , i decided given the price i 'd buy a new one -lrb- # years is a long time for a bag after all -rrb- the price is about the same as it was # years ago , and now i know why -- the bag was awful the material is far worse , the workmanship and details disappointing -lrb- what used to be a magnet close was now velcro , there was no zipper to slide the bag over a carryon rolling bag -rrb- the bag reeked -lrb- as other reviewers warned -rrb- and the outside material was a much more coarse and <unk> synthetic material the prior bag , while not leather , looked much closer to the real thing , and had a nice , soft feel how disappointing that the bag has changed so much i returned this item and am just keeping my old bag and seeing if i can repair the handles
i like this bag except # things ... # -rrb- straps are fraying . # -rrb- it slumps to one side regardless of how much is out into the bag i do like the space and the internal pockets if i had to do over , i 'd skip purchasing this
i had really high hopes for this bag it is cute , and functional -lrb- i do have problems getting it stay upright -rrb- but the handles starting shredding with the first use , and continue to shred every time i carry it i am on the hunt for yet another new bag , hopefully one that wo n't fall apart
i really like the size , look and pockets in this bag it is pretty comfortable even without padded straps and it fits computer plus office things nicely only negative is the plastic smell was awful i have aired it out a lot and a month later there is still a mild odor hopefully this will clear as i really like the bag otherwise
this is a great looking bag well made and very fashionable however , it is not a bag that will last long if you need something heavy duty to carry more than your laptop and a few light papers
this bag looks good and professional i bought it for my # . # inch laptop and it fits well i can also carry other stuff in the same bag i tried fitting in my # inch laptop in this bag and it fit perfectly initially i was thinking of carrying one laptop bag and one hand bag but now with this bag , i dont have to worry about carrying other one only concern i have is the height of the bag as it looks big
i use this for my nc- # and i like it a lot it 's well padded and <unk> 's itself to the notebook with straps you open it up like a clamshell and just start working only issue is when you put a drive in the top pocket , it makes a bit too much weight and the notebook may tip over or the screen will go all the way back simple solution is to take the drive out of the pocket which you will normally be doing anyhow anyhow ... it 's a great product , get it
i ordered this bag for my # . # `` asus eee pc -lrb- # <unk> -rrb- the case fits with some wiggle room , the straps to attach to the lid and bottom work fine the ` memory ' foam is soft and seems supportive , though i would hesitate to use the netbook while it 's sitting n the foam due to it blocking the vents on the bottom i keep my power supply , a small microsoft wireless mouse , earbuds , and a thumbdrive in the side pocket and never feel like it 's putting any undue pressure on the netbook materials seem decent , though the <unk> material has scuffed a little in light use construction seems solid the zippers have a little curve to them which makes gripping them easier
i bought this case for my new asus # ha eee pc the screen is actually # . # `` but the case is n't too big for it at all i dont have to worry about the zip scratching the corners of my netbook and the corner straps keep it in place the front pouch also holds a lot i 've got the adapter , # usb sticks , a usb cable and and # -port usb adapter in there ! it 's also very sturdy and the design looks quite executive another winner from casecrown
i was looking for a netbook case for my samsung nc- # for some time , but just could n't find what i wanted until i came across this case the double memory foam padding encases my netbook securely unlike the thin neoprene cover that came with the netbook i put the power cord in the zipper pouch and can probably add a couple other small things if i needed to the case really sets my mind at ease when i lug it in my duffle bag , carry-on , or back pack the only thing i did n't particularly like were the handles , but that 's just me for the price the handle issue is something i can just ignore
fits my samsung n # netbook perfectly nice extra storage compartment for external disk drive -lrb- that 's what i use it for -rrb- or whatever you want to keep in there ultimately , knowing what i do now , i would purchase this same case again if i had to do it all over
i bought this little bag for my samsung nc # and it fits perfect at first i thought the zippers would scratch the sides as i would zip and unzip but they dont the memory foam does a good job at keeping it in place when its all zipped up also theres a big flap of covered memory foam in the fold of the case which is nice addition i like the fact that i can just slip it in and out like a bag or when its all bundled up you can just open the computer by grabbing the two handles in the pictures there are clips to attach a strap there are non thank god the outer pouch is nice for the power brick or bt mouse and cell phone i love this case # stars -lsb- ... -rsb-
this sleeve is desing for casual carrying if you are planing a long trip i would not advised using it in the other hand , it is very light and easy to carry around i purchased a leather briefcase and use both depending the <unk>
i guess this is what it advertises , but i 'm not all that happy with it its a neoprene sleeve with straps , i would n't use it as my sole means of carrying my laptop , but it would be pretty good if you were putting it in another bag its good for occasionally carrying the laptop around its not holding up as well as i had <unk> , but for the cost , its holding up as well as can be expected
it is way too large for a # `` laptop , but it is well-padded a little more organization in the secondary pocket would have been good , but it serves its purpose well enough
i bought this case about # weeks ago to carry an asus # n netbook i bought at the same time it is very light and holds quite a bit of stuff , like a power cable and various usb accessories it has a handy little pocket inside the main compartment into which my kindle ebook reader fits perfectly i was unsure about which case to get , but this one is perfect for my needs and i recommend it
this is exactly the size i needed there is a pocket seperator inside the main bag to store the ac adapter from the notebook and a zipped pocket on the outside to store the portable dvd writer and a mouse
i bought this for my son to take his laptop to school overall , good product the case is light weight and not bulky i would buy this type of case again
this sleeve fits my hp mini # perfectly , and seems to be more than adequate for keeping it safe from scratches and minor bumps its odd shape keeps the netbook snugly in place , and i think it probably would stretch easily to fit almost any netbook my one worry is that i think the zipper scratched my netbook 's cover maybe i 'm just being paranoid , but now i 'm being careful to hold back the zipper so it ca n't do damage
i have n't bought this case yet , but i found it in rei and <unk> that it will fit a macbook air # `` my only concerns are that the zipper could could cause some scratches and that the <unk> shape results in some wasted empty space in the corners
this is a good netbook sleve that serves it function very well built and durable i wish it had a small pouch or pocket for a usb , cord , headphone , etc . . what i like is that this laptop sleve does n't add bulk to an already small netbook i mean afterall , is that the point of having a netbook in the first place
this is a great sleeve , and my dell inspiron # -lrb- mini -rrb- fits perfectly inside the sewing is done very well and there is extra fabric and stitches on the corners the zipper also seems very rugged the inside is a sky blue color and the sleeve does have a little padding
i got this for my white # `` macbook -lrb- # -rrb- and it fits really nicely i was a bit skeptical at first when i got it , but i love it more and more each day the bumpers are very useful , i feel that they do in fact help to protect the edges of my macbook when bumped also , the zippers are very smooth and do not scratch laptop thick , sturdy , cool , no regrets in getting this case
i 've had this case for over # years now , and its still in great condition , and my laptop still looks new it protects it nicely with a nice squishy foam . and its in my fave colour
this product is great if you are looking to fit your mac into it the design of the bumper sleeve helps absorb a lot of bumps and bruises from daily accidents i bought the sleeve in purple which catches people 's attention it fits my # inch mac perfectly and is light a plus is that you do n't have to take your laptop out when your going through airport security
i love the unique shape , it fits my # inch macbook perfectly - and snug with just enough padding i love the color and bottom line , the price on amazon beat out everywhere else
the cover is great for my macbook pro # `` laptop the color was a bit darker than the picture shows , but it 's still a gorgeous color at first i thought the design was to quirky for my tastes , but i find that it 's really helpful in <unk> my laptop overall , great purchase
after two weeks of getting this from mail , i reordered another set simply because this one is so slippery not recommended for those who are always on the go and need to move from one location to the other it might slip while you 're holding your laptop
i got this cover with the full keyboard pad at the mac store they were pushing for me to get the same cover for about # times the price only drag was the bottom shell at the power adapter jack is a little to big for the new ac adapter configuration and i i had to get a small file to adjust it i took that corner off and its working fine now didnt mind the # minute repair to save # bucks
i purchased this shell so i could have color for my laptop , and protect it from scratching and such i does the job , but i must say that it seems a bit cheap i did n't even pay # for it so i suppose i should not complain it does seem to pop off if you pick up the laptop with one hand so that was concerning . but overall , i think it does the job well cheap but effective
it does well protecting against scratches , and the feet on the bottom come in handy sometimes too however , dust and bits of things still collect in between this case and my laptop
i did n't see the bottom shell for the base of the laptop before i bought it so when i received it in the mail it was a surprise the top half is pretty much the same in the picture , but the bottom half has sections and slits for computer fans since i have a mac its an awkward look if you need a shell for both a mac and pc , this is a good offer
i was looking for a case to protect the computer as it is a work computer and does not <unk> to me this one came <unk> by a fellow teacher i do n't mind the creaking sounds , but the bottom cover extends above the edge of the computer by about # inch i find it uncomfortable when i am using the <unk> and sometimes when i am typing
this item is okay , i like the color and style but feels cheap and somewhat weak i havent dropped my macbook yet or dont plan to drop it but , its more of a decoration
while the case arrived on time and in good condition , it did n't fit my computer properly and kept sliding around , scratching the computer it 's just not as solid as the apple cases have been
i purchased this to protect my new macbook pro i love the color is a bright vibrant orange which is nice if you like bright colors it does serve its purpose which i to protect the metal of the mac from getting scratched more than necessary unfortunately when i received it it had scratched already on the cover due to how it was shipped it is easy to get on but once its on that is where it is staying i could not get it back off which is a shame since i am the kind of person who likes to switch colors depending on mood it is definitely not loose . after a day of having it it did look like it was getting bubbles on the top of the cover like from heat or what not it did not have that when i got it if it is from the heat they should find a way to resolve that issue since yes , laptops do get hot , these should be able to withstand some of that without falling apart that easily
i 've had this case for several years now it is hard and sturdy and protects my laptop well enough it is a little bit of a fight to get on to the laptop but once it is on it does make me feel like my device is very well protected the back legs pop out to elevate the macbook to give the fans room the blow and it helps to take stress off your wrists if you are <unk> for longer periods of time i love this case it 's been banged around and scratched and it is still hanging up there the one thing i wish was different was that the bottom ` <unk> ' did n't pick up so much excess trash from the desks and table tops that i place my laptop on when i remove the case there is dirt and residue that is mildly <unk> on to my laptop that i have to rub off
saw the speck cases in the apple store and did n't want to pay $ # + for it with the ipearl i got the case and a silicone keyboard cover for a great price so easy to put on looks great , too at this point , would buy it again i just got it out of the box , but like the looks of it great vent holes on the bottom and it has little feet that elevate
i love this case , it covers all areas that could get scratched -lrb- minus the inside -rrb- and does n't cover any ports the color is vibrant and great , and i especially like that you can still see the apple logo there are still two things that i think are problems , however the newest l-shaped macbook charger does not fit that well with the case on , you must turn it so it is covering the ethernet cord as a college student , that is a bit annoying to work with one other thing that makes it a hassle to use this case is that using a laptop lock is impossible in order to lock my laptop , i have to remove the case so that the lock is flush with the side of the laptop this is n't that bad if you do n't mind taking off the case whenever you must lock up the laptop i find it a bit annoying but still like the case all the same
i love this product got it in # days after ordering had to flip the top cover around because it would n't snap on the # st way i tried it , but after flipping it , it snapped on after pushing on it with quite a bit of force makes my laptop look # % better & i can now tell my laptop from everyone <unk>
this is a very good skin for your new macbook pro it fits very well , all except you are slightly limited on how far back you can put the screen the legs are very helpful to prop up the notebook to make it more comfortable to type the cover is hard enough to protect the exterior of the notebook , but not very heavy or clunky it is also transparent enough for the apple light to shine through , giving a cool effect all in all , a very good product for a very good price fashion and protection in one
very nice but it does add some height to the laptop because of the option to be on an angle i have no plan to return it great cover . it does come with a keyboard cover but it is junk get the cosmos
i just got the cover today and i 'm pleased with the quick delivery , the price , and the ease of installing it however , i was a little bit bit surprised about the shade of orange it looks a bit `` neon `` orange to me compared to what is actually shown in the picture of the product however , i like the color but i would 've preferred if it were closer to the one actually displayed on the picture overall , i must say that it was a great bargain and it also comes with a light orange keyboard cover
completely <unk> the outside of your computer , and i am very pleased with this aspect of the product the only thing that i find a little odd is that there are only two slide buffers underneath , making it a bit slippery atop a desk still an excellent product all in all
recieved product before estimated delivery date shell keeps my macbook safe from dents and scratches , but dirt sometimes slips underneath i do need to take it off occasionally and wipe off some dust that <unk> between computer and shell the shell when on the computer looks nice unfortunately , one rubber foot has already slipped off and causes one side of computer to slip when not on balanced surface -lrb- tilted desk , etc . -rrb- this review written six months after product was recieved
this summer i went to a technology conference held by my school district and i noticed that some of the <unk> had colorful covers on their computers wanting to protect my mac , i decided to order one there were two companies to choose from ; however , the price and the reviews made me choose the mcover i wanted a unique color so i would be able to identify my mac right away i chose orange after just # days i received my mcover yes , it 's a bright orange but i love it because it 's unique it fits like a glove and i love the little feet the only drawback is that i ca n't open it all the way <unk> issue
i like the product , and it serves the purpose , but i wish it had a glossy finish this is more matte the sides are glossy , but the top and bottom has a slight texture on it would 've been nice if it was glossy all the way through
the mcover is strong , looks great , and works perfectly for the # macbook pro # inch , except for one minor issue with the redesigned power adapter -lrb- the <unk> -rrb- , the thickness of the case prevents the adapter from fully clicking in it 'll fit if you flip it , but the stiff wire ends up covering the firewire # port -lrb- in my case , blocking my external hd . i 'm considering buying the older power adapter just for this reason otherwise , it was a wonderful deal
i ordered this product for my # ' macbook and are very pleased with it it fits perfectly and the color is as shown on the website it 's a hard plastic , no gel or rubber i thought it was a little expensive for the product , but am pleased with it
so the case i was sent has a weird brick pattern on the lid that i was n't expecting from the pictures it 's not a solid color like shown , but is a translucent <unk> look with the aforementioned brick pattern it 's not bad , just not what i expected seems sturdy , though i 've only had it a few weeks
i just received the case today , and after a few hours with it on and using it : i am fairly happy with the case the top part is very hard , definitely will protect the top from dents the bottom clips on nicely to the bottom of the macbook there are a few little issues with the case to me i would of enjoyed a satin feel , but the case is just hard plastic it does n't look special the bottom is the <unk> thing as seen in the pictures , there are slots and holes for no apparent reason , since the pros have n't had an open bottom for some time now also is you have an <unk> from <unk> or another company , the plastic sticks to it , and makes a weird sound when moved around over all is a good case for the money
i love the way this case looks , but ever since it has been on my computer it gets so warm that the fan comes on much more frequently than before i had the case if i use the little feet to prop up the back it makes it better , but it is a little bit worrisome for me that it gets so hot i do n't think it is such a big problem that i need to take it off , at least yet
this cover makes your mac look sweet get your favorite color and snap it on . it takes a few minutes to put it on right so that it does n't unhook the bottom piece i highly recommend this item for your mac
the orange mcover hard shell case is great because it 's sturdy and truly protects your macbook it is also easy to apply and remove however , the case is a bit bulky and obnoxious the top part of the case it created so that you can not open your screen larger than approximately a # degree angle overall , it 's a good case , but i wish i would have saved my money purchased a better one
easy to use , easy to put on wish i would have bought this when i initially bought my mac the two rubber paddings under the front part of the bottom covering does not seem to stay on too well but they 're not really needed anyway in my opinion i would reccommend this item to others
great cover to protect the outside of the laptop only complain is that one of the rubber feet broke off within a month or two of owning it now one side slides around while the other stays put
i really liked this case and for the price i did n't think i could go wrong it 's a pretty color -lrb- i bought the orange one -rrb- and fits perfectly my only issue is that the top of the case did n't snap on very well and still i feel like it could fall off at any moment i 'm still very pleased with what i got and will definitely consider buying another
this product is great it 's a great cover for my mac and it protects it very well the product fits perfectly and is sturdy i love the color selections and the price was great i would recommend this to other customers if they want great protection , stylish look and a great
this a great product i love the case and the color your mac will look great in it and the apple logo looks so bright and awesome however , i have to rate it with # stars because the free keyboard cover is awful the quality is very low and i will probably throw it away
really really fits nicely thinner than i thought it would be at first i thought this might affect its durability , but after about an hour surfing through the critical comments on multiple sites i could not find one mention of the case breaking i 'm generally pretty hard on my personal items , but the case is holding up fine the vents on bottom and little feet really put it over the edge typing for a long period of time feels so much better at an <unk> sleeve # for macbook # `` is the case i use for it and it fits just right
this case worked as expected and the company was great about taking care of warranty issues when part broke off i do n't use it anymore since i have a different carrying case now that wo n't work with these cases , but i still keep them on hand if i <unk> want to use them
it arrived in # days very speedy shipment and the thing is just beautiful it makes me macbook look like a limited edition created just for me the company is very professional , courteous and trustworthy the hard case is of high quality and a sleek design i always get questions and complements on my macbook when at borders , starbucks or barnes and noble do n't hesitate buy yours now ! !
shipping was amazing and shell is even more amazing ! ! not only is it protective but extremely stylish and fits the macbook so nicely full access to all your ports and not one problem ! the value was also great since you would pay almost twice even triple the price anywhere else ! highly recommend and i will be ordering from them again ! !
great bang for your buck this does exactly as specified & is so cheap the keyboard cover is awesome and looks great no more scratches on the outside all though it feels cheap on both sides it wo n't matter what you get as long as you do n't abuse your mac . this is great for minor dings . wo n't take a major fall . love
i ordered this case for my daughter she absolutely loves it and now she wants it in other colors too the case slipped on very easily -lrb- # macbook pro -rrb- ordering was a piece of cake shipping service was excellent this is a must have item if you have a macbook pro this cover is an absolute must have , it makes macbook look fabulous the hard case is of high quality and a sleek design do n't hesitate buy yours now ! !
this cover was super easy to assemble there was a youtube link sent along with the cover for video instructions but they were n't necessary i 'm so happy with this orange cover - it fits perfectly and all my friends love it :
this case was given to me as a present for christmas , and i absolutely love it the case is clear enough that you can still see the apple logo , and looks awesome when it is glowing it also has openings for all the different plug-ins and is not bulky in anyway overall it is a nice protective case that definitely sets my macbook apart from a majority of people
this is a great product i 've yet to find other cases better than this definitely protects the product from scratches and this goes well with a keyboard cover w / matching orange also helps from the heat that macbooks provide and prevents legs and hands from being burned would highly recommend this product in any color
i purchased this hardshell case to provide added protection to my macbook this shell was a lot less than the name brand shells but provide amazing coverage and protection i love the fact the macbook is not <unk> in anyway -lrb- you can fully open the top -rrb- and the new design allows for more heat distribution on the bottom i do n't really use the retractable feet on the bottom , but that feature is nice to elevate the macbook the color is vibrant and allows you to also see through it some , so you can still see the glow of the apple great item and i highly recommend !
i brought my macbook pro about a week ago and the same case was in the apple store for # dollars i went home to amazon and quickly found the same case for only twenty i am completely satisfied with the case and believe that it <unk> serve its purpose as to protect my computer this website is trusted and i am a well known customer and am very satisfied with the case
the shell arrived in a timely manner no problems with billing i love my mac case i tend to `` beat up `` my laptops pretty good , and this will be a <unk> for me
wow , i am surprised by how simple and how well this cover works it is so easy to install that it took all of about # seconds it has worked perfect and has completely kept my macbook in perfect condition no scratching or damage of any kind while using this cover and the orange color rocks i highly recommend it
i love the orange mcover hard shell case i got for my macbook i can tell that it really protects my laptop and i even take it to school with me without putting it into another case , just the cover the cover looks great , fits and stays on perfectly however , my only complaint about this cover is that it is somewhat difficult to put on and by that i just mean that i needed my boyfriends help to get it to click into place besides that it is perfect and i am so happy with my purchase ! ! the orange is pretty <unk>
`` i got my mac book case withing # days , in great condition i would always recommend buying from ipearl-inc the price is reasonable and your product comes before the estimated time
i love the color of this case it is very vibrant and has been great so far i also enjoy the option of having the & # # ; legs & # # ; on the bottom the only thing was that the case is n't just a solid smooth finish , it has almost like a & # # ; brick & # # ; pattern to it it does n't bother me , and it is kind of cool but i was not anticipating that
the orange cover is the way to go ! ! ! it is so cool ... easy to put on and it 's reasonably priced ! i was surprised and so happy ! now if i could just get the <unk> logo ... ...
love the case , i was worried it would not be as good as the expensive ones but its great i have had it for more then a year and have had no problems the lil grips did come off but i havent needed them and i am sure you can super glue them or buy new ones if yours fall off
my ipearl macbook pro cover makes my macbook stand out from the crowd and <unk> up the grey metal finish recommended to anyone who owns a macbook and likes to show off their colors
love the orange it keeps your computer protected and you can still plug everything in and access the disk drive love the feet that hold it up while i type planning on ordering another one in a different color just so i can change it up whenever i want
i bought a new laptop so i needed a new case i prefer this one to my old one as the old on only had # tab on each side hooking it to the laptop and this one has # close enough together that it seems more sturdy also , i prefer that this one does n't have the shiny finish that just gets scratched up as it 's more of a matte with a bit of texture
my son ordered this for <unk> computer when he look on line and saw the color he thought it was nice when it arrived he was thrilled as he originally wanted it in neon and was so happy it was neon the price is very reasonable it is made of a heavy weight plastic this will work out great as far as style , quality and price
this shell is wonderful it wears well and is resilient the keyboard cover is great , too and the numbers do not <unk> when in contact with oils on the skin great price and outstanding protection if i could , i 'd get one in aqua
this product arrived within # days it was easy to put on my mac it comes in great colors it helps to protect my computer people always compliment me on my mac i really recommend this product
i received my product on time from the seller the product was exactly what i ordered plus more ! ! i am in love with my product and i ca n't wait to order more from seller ! !
i got my order fast and in mint condition the color is fantastic , better than in the picture , and it 's easy to put on your laptop too i just love it
save your money and purchase this cover for your # & # # ; macbook pro my friend owns a speck and paid twice as much and like my cover better durable , reliable , and perfectly priced love amazon prime too was at my house in one night
the case is very reliable and sturdy it snapped on easily and comes with # attachments that allow it to stand at a slant -lrb- very useful -rrb- i bought the case in # colors and they are very interchangeable
this is a great case i have barely had it for # day and i already am in love just two problems the top part has a little space between the case and the computer and also you ca n't figure out which side is up or down on the top part but otherwise an amazing case
i get compliments on my ipearl mcover fairly often , and it beats most of the rest of its <unk> in price i particularly love the snap open and closed feet
snapped on easily ... a little tricky to remove , but i guess that 's the point leaves access to all input areas , allows me to open my # & # # ; macbook pro almost the whole way -lrb- not like i do that often but it 's still an option ! -rrb- have seen it protect from scratches already i would definitely buy this again if i got another computer ... or if i just wanted to change color no problems with it falling off , fits into my computer sleeve -lrb- which i was a little concerned about since the sleeve was designed for # & # # ; computers -rrb- adds just a little extra weight but totally worth the extra protection
i purchased this case because everyone at work got this macbook and i wanted to be able to quickly and easily distinguish my laptop from all others well , it does the job , in fact , others have asked me where i got it and purchased one -lrb- different colors , of course -rrb- as well i never worry about picking up the wrong laptop at meetings
i was a little confused when i ordered this case i was wondering what it would look like here 's the deal where the apple logo goes it 's all smooth plastic meaning there is no cut out but you can see the apple logo and with the orange one at least you can see it glow when it 's on overall great cover , no complaints and i like the color it looks like what i imagined it would
this case has worked great for my laptop only complaint is that the rubber `` feet `` fell off after a few uses , but for the price i do n't mind maybe replacing them i have some friends that paid almost <unk> dollars for the same product with the same quality great deal ! !
my first experience with the ipearl mcovers was with my macbook pro the design is flawless , the fit is perfect , the price was right and shipping was fast based on this experience i expect nothing less with all of their offerings definitely would recommend to anyone interested in a hard case for any of your precious electronic devices keep up the great products and service orange mcover hard shell case for a # aluminum unibody macbook pro # -inch model # a # -lrb- # . # -inch diagonal display , black keyboard
i was n't sure of which case to buy at first when i was looking for one to cover my macbook but after reading the reviews of the mcover , i decided to try it and i am really glad that i did the case was delivered soon after i ordered it and it is very easy to use not only that , but i really feel like my mac is protected from the possibility of damage from everyday use this case also makes transporting my laptop much easier overall , definitely worth the money
