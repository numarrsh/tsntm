this is a great piece of carry-on luggage it has room for a laptop , and a tablet with accessories and a change of clothes i bought it for an overseas trip and it performed perfectly the backpack is very well made , durable and is comfortable to wear for long periods of time <unk> through airports , train stations and subways this was a great purchase and since i was able to get it on a daily deal , a super value swissgear makes good stuff their whole line of travel accessories are well designed and manufactured to the expected level of swiss quality this backpack is a good example
it has solid quality and looks sharp it has a great sleeve for laptops , it held my lenovo u # and has room for larger laptops i 've used it for a semester and there are really no signs of wear of weaknesses
when i looked at the price i was a little suspicious , but then when the bag arrived i was surprised that it is pretty good i looked good wearing it around school and it carried my heavy textbook and netbook i personally loved this product and its price
this backpack is very well designed and the workmanship is excellent the zippers feel solid and smooth and do not come apart if <unk> any <unk> it fits my computer -lrb- # . # `` -rrb- with its sleeve on and it secures it nicely i am still discovering new pockets and ingenious straps all over the outside and inside of the sack when carrying just the computer , it is noce and flat and does not bulge out excellent for any kind of commuting , from foot to bike to <unk>
i got this bag recently for my <unk> its just again a perfect swissgear bag and # $ wow it fits a laptop which is # . # `` wide which i was skeptical about when i bought it as it says only # inch has good room for laptop books and i just loved it its more than worth the #
have swiss gear luggage and this was a perfect match the only down side is that zipper others talked about now i know what they meant when you get to the top you need two hands , one on the zipper and the other holding the teeth parallel so the zipper does n't stop before it 's closed
i really liked this bag and its look but , the chain broke after i bought it i somehow managed to fix it so it is working fine now but sometimes it gets difficult for me to get along with it it is spacious and the fabric used is very good
it is a nice school bag for students , you can put a lot of things inside , and organize them however , i hope there are more compartments with zipper because i have a lot of little stuffs
i bought this backpak to replace my old swissgear this backpak is amazing because it has more than enough space for a student to put all the stuff in it has an isolated notebook pocket and it is paded to protect your notebook well worth to spend money on it
prepare for disappointment if you 're expecting it to look like the one pictured the one i received is a very pale , see-through purple with no apple cut-out not at all what we were expecting to get
i ordered this case thinking i would get the apple cut out , like in the picture i received it within a few days , which is great , but it is not what i thought i ordered they need to change the picture if they do not intend to sell us the right product if i knew that i would be getting this , i would have payed $ # at a store for the same case , not $ # + tax and shipping the see through color is nice and it fits my daughters # `` mac also the packaging could have been a lot better with padding , not just a thin envelope and plastic sticky <unk>
pros : love the color , love that it is a hard case and feels very sturdy and well made cons : the bottom of the case has ridges that dug into my wrists when i was typing i do n't know if i just have poor <unk> or what , but i 'm actually using the bottom of my old case and the top of this one overall : i would not buy this case again simply because i can only use half of it the ridges that hurt my wrists are part of the case 's construction and can not be adjusted however , the bottom part of the case does not hurt my husband 's wrists , so this issue may be unique
i have a mac book pro # inch unibody and this case fits perfectly , i spent weeks looking every where for a mac cover with the apple on the front cut out , and finally stumbled upon this one purple is my favorite color and the case helps keep my computer protected exactly what i wanted
i absolutely love this case it highly elevates my computer 's awesome factor , and it is very durable i have dropped my computer off my bed onto the wooden floor a few times and it and the case were not damaged the price is quite fair , and the actual case is very similar to the picture i would definitely buy this again
i absolutely love this cover for my new laptop it has a cutout for the apple logo on the front and it 's such a pretty shade of purple that i am totally in love the package came very quickly even considering that the holiday shipping rush was in full swing
i got this as a gift so i ca n't return it but this bag is made from awful thin leather that smells strange spend a little more and get something decent
i ordered this backpack for my birthday on november # th , i still have n't received it after placing numerous calls to luggage point and getting two different stories , i have been told that it would be another two weeks i asked if i could get it in another color but they do n't have any i also asked if i could get a different bag that was the same value of the original at the sale price i was told that i could n't the only bright spot of this so far has been the customer service rep that has worked with me she <unk> been nice i ca n't say that i would order from these people again or recommend them to anyone else
bag looks nice but after # weeks interior dividers have ripped the adjustments on back pack straps keep loosening during use nice for a weekend stay but no good for daily use
very nice bag , looks very very nice for me the leather is ok only complain is to grab the bag without hand strap if the bag is heavy there is just shoulder strap as i said , looks awesome
it is a very nice bag make sure you read the description because it is gray and not brown like the picture the leather is sturdy and is a rough finish which gives it a different look than most bags for the price it is a good deal as even in nicer stores they charge like $ # for a bag out of synthetic materials
i love this bag i use it as a school bag - which means textbooks , laptop , and all other personal items fit inside -lrb- pretty much as much as i can carry on my back -rrb- it has lots of space without being cumbersome the leather is wonderful it 's soft and durable -lrb- which is why i bought the bag -rrb- the other reason i bought the backpack is because of how versatile it is it 's a school bag for a grown up and it also doubles as a great pocketbook for travel i 've had it for at least # years now and it shows no sign of wear i get compliments for it everywhere i go
i got an notebook by this same name but when i got this cover i <unk> it was bigger than the original notebook i have . now i have to return it
the picture is completely misleading it 's red in the white box but once you put it on your blue or black net book it 's not the bright red color you hoped for returning it , sorry
i thought this laptop cover was soft instead , it was hard plastic and too big for my acer laptop i ca n't see this protecting my computer if the case is hard and can crack or a piece break off
pros : lightweight , tough , handles well , good zippers , good looking overall cons : texture kind of rough and i wish it had one half pocket on the front top like other carry ons it has straps to convert it to backpack , capacity is for # days of clothes
so far am very happy with the product looks and functionality seems very sturdy for all those who said the handle was too short , they must of only pulled it out half way works perfectly for my needs
i guess i expected more from a thule product first off , even though it is called a carry-on , it may not fit in to the <unk> of several airlines due to its dimensions - it 's a little too wide and tall second , in my opinion , it has one major design flaw : when you unzip it , there is a slope to it basically , one side of the compartment is taller than the other when it 's zipped you do n't notice it because the cover is built the same way so overall you get the same size all around , but it makes it difficult to pack you ca n't shove things in because there is n't necessarily a side to hold it in also , while the dimensions are slightly bigger than another <unk> shaped -lrb- # `` -rrb- carry-on that i have , this one actually holds less this is really only good for a weekend trip , and for that i still think a duffle bag would hold more and take up less space overall i definitely expected better from this
thule has a good reputation and this bag meets that reputation head on it is perfect for short <unk> and is really durable while my initial reaction was that the inside was small , it held all i needed for a # night trip
the thule carry-on has worked very nicely in the two trips i have used since acquiring it i was pleasantly surprise at how much i can pack in there good design , wheels feel solid i have not used the backpack feature , but its nice to know its there as a backup
i was looking for a minimal rolling carry-on that could also convert to a backpack the thule was both more stylish and could go from rolling <unk> to backback faster than both the osprey and eagle creek i only wanted the backback feature for navigating city streets or public transportation if you need bag to act as a longer wearing backpack look for something like the osprey or eagle creek with a hip belt the telescoping handle is only held in a collapsed position with friction i have n't had an issue yet with it opening , but i fear it could loosen up and get damaged during future baggage handling if it locked properly i 'd add the # th star
excellent for a weekend this bag is stylish and rugged i travel almost daily and this gets the job done there is a safe place for my glasses a cushioned sleeve for my laptop and the large wheels make for excellent ease of movement i do n't normally go for brand names but this time i felt like it was money well spent the double style handle makes it much more stable , especially when attaching a computer bag , purse or any other bag to the suitcase if you tend to be an & # # ; <unk> & # # ; this bag is not for you if you plan on using this as a carry on this bag is perfect it is light weight and fits in most overhead compartments
great little suitcase looks sleek , had random comments from strangers in airport -lrb- sad , i know -rrb- but sturdy bag looks the part and again looks awesome my only fault is that the handle bars are noticeable through the middle of the bag , so you have to get creative with packing if it was a little bit deeper , this bag would be a killer - however it keeps it sleek and inline for this very reason , perfect for carry on
i already had the thule larger rolling bag but wanted a carry on size thule makes terrific quality luggage , and it 's <unk> to boot although some reviews complain that the bag <unk> space for the backpack straps , i do n't find that to be an issue it 's tough as nails , the retractable handle is plenty long for me at # ' # & # # ; , and it 's not & # # ; tippy & # # ; when standing the black is actually a tiny black and white <unk> pattern which reads black from a distance but is easy to distinguish close up in a rack of other black bags on that note , smaller jets -lrb- <unk> commuter -rrb- sometimes ask me to check the bag in the <unk> , as it does n't meet size requirements for all planes again , not a problem for me since there 's no charge in that event it 's very light , and i love the hard-sided internal glasses compartment accessible from the outside
upon arrival i opened the box unzipped the sleeve and was unable to zip closed again returned the item the following day color was nice , fabric seemed nice but the zipper was stuck
i bought this for my daughters new laptop an asus # . # & # # ; although she loved the cover it was too tight for the laptop she loved it so much she did n't want me to return it but it should be a bit bigger if you wanted to use this product often
i bought this product because of how absolutely adorable it was honestly , it 's so cute the case itself is fantastic , and everyone loves it -lrb- myself included -rrb- but the loops that hold the shoulder straps are already ripping , and once it rips the sleeve will be next to useless for me this is a great sleeve if you 're putting it into another bag , but not so much if you want to just carry it around
i 'm highly disappointed that it did n't last longer this item was really cute , but not much longer than three months later , the cover fell apart first the eyelets unraveled , then the zipper came a loose if you want something durable , i would n't get this
the material is a little thin compare with my <unk> for ipad the color is cute and nice but overall , it 's a little lose , i guess if you have addition cover for your mbp , you might be okay with this cover some part of the inside is roll to protect the zipper but there 's not enough at the side where your mbp is still sliding against the zipper when your sliding the laptop in i have to admit , i love the color and design and the back is a different view so you may still make <unk> of top to bottom if you put your mbp into the sleeve however , i think i may need to buy another cover if i want to put this into my backpack as the material is really thin , but i guess what do i expect for the price i 'm not sure , i 'll use this for a couple month and may update my review
i got this to house my <unk> # there 's a bit of room left over , so i would say a # or # slim lappy would fit just fine it 's adorable and padded nicely , though i would n't say it will break a fall or anything it has those side loops to connect a strap which would be way awesome if it were included , but i knew it was n't and i still think it was an awesome choice so why the ding that would be because one of the zippers broke off <unk> a month of using it granted , i take my lappy everywhere and whip it out on a moment 's notice as if i was pistol <unk> , but come on i still got the other one and that 's been worked for almost a year all in all , i 'd buy it again
well , not a lot to say it is a sleeve , it works , zipper seems to be good quality a little tight with a usb adapter for my mouse and i wish it had a carry strap but i knew it did n't have one when i bought it the kitty design is cute too
purchased for my # year old daughter she really loves it the only thing missing is a place to carry her charger however , i purchased this one just so she would put it in a case when she is n't using her laptop
the case is so cute the only bad thing is that you have to have your own strap i think it <unk> be better to invest in something that has all of the components needed
i bought a new # `` laptop and wanted a nice case to protect it the design is really adorable , which is the main reason why i like the case this particular case was too big for my laptop , but the size smaller is too small i really wish it came in a size fitting for a # inch , but i went ahead and bought this one because of the design on it although it 's a little bit for my laptop , but still protects it well
product is good it was a little big for my laptop , although i believe i got the correct size of course , this means i should have room for the charger cord which i completely forgot about when purchasing this case the neoprene has a strong odor , though , that i hope dissipates with time
i love this case because it is so cute and it is pretty soft and durable for a laptop case that does not have straps that is the one thing that i wish it had and that would be that it had some sort of strap that came with it
love the case it seems like a great quality i would def purchase it again there are rings on the side where a strap can be attached which i like zipper is heavy duty and the padding is adequate
this cute case with the kitty front and back view has rings on the side for a strap it is used for the toshiba nb # netbook the netbook 's battery sticks out so i had to really stretch the zipper to fit it in i 'm glad for the neoprene that stretches hopefully the zipper will last it is perfect for other netbooks that do not have this bulging battery like the toshiba has but it will do fine for protecting the netbook from bumps and handling
i am owner of asus gamers republic # . # with full keyboard which makes that laptop in to size of # inc. so i am very glad that i 've decided to get one of this cases even though it 's slim i can perfectly fit my laptop in it and of cause it 's sooooo <unk> i just love it the reason to buy soft case for me was that i am traveling a lot and there is to much hard time at the security gates with all the electronic equipment and additional carry on so i 've decided to keep it in my back pack less luggage and easy to get in and out take my advice and have one of those
it 's <unk> pretty and so many compliments : -rrb- : -rrb- : -rrb- it arrived early too everyone asks where i got it but if i tell them then they all will have one
i ordered this case based on the size listed i did n't need a heavy duty case as i am pretty gentle with my laptop and use it mostly at home and only occasionally at my office i did n't want something plain and boring this one is very cute and so far have not seen one like it ... safety and style
i purchased this item for my daughter for christmas because she was getting a laptop from santa i was so pleased when i received this it 's just too cute and adorable most of all it 's durable
the case arrived and when i opened it , everything was better than i expected the laptop sleeve is made of very high quality materials , as is the design on it plus there are two metal hooks on each side in case you want to attach a strap fit my laptop perfect and snugly so happy to be carrying around my notebook in this uber cute case . :
my daughter is a computer geek and a cat lover she put this on her wish list after she bought a new laptop it made a great gift for christmas i was i impressed with the quality and the speed with which it arrived , and she was thrilled to recieve it
i bought this # . # & # # ; kitty to go cover to fit on my tablet to keep it from getting scratched i 've tried book type cases & no matter how well taken care of , something always seems to sneak in to try to scratch my screen eventually i think this type of case will take care of that problem since it zips all the way around fits my ipad # just fine i plan on upgrading to a # . # & # # ; android soon & it looks like there 's still plenty of room in there to put that one in instead the material seems cushy enough to protect a tablet & the picture on this is very cute i love the claw marks & the little mouse on the back all in all , a nice cover
my wife loves the looks and the size is just right for the netbook plus a few accessories -lrb- mouse and charger -rrb- i can only hope the asus netbook it is holding works as well
bought the # . # inch sleeve for my # . # inch laptop because i was afraid the # inch sleeve would be too small obviously , it 's a bit loose but ca n't complain since # inches is a weird size for a laptop i guess i feel more at ease carrying my laptop around inside this i love the design because there are # different pictures on each side the cat is thinkin about the mouse and the mouse is thinkin about the cheese . . hahaha funny ! ! good quality as
purchased for my wife 's netbook it works ok , not so much as a protection from shock -lrb- after all it is just a neoprene sleeve -rrb- but she likes it because she can stuff all her wires in it and it 's cute
this sleeve fits my hp laptop perfectly i had another sleeve that was supposed to fit a # . # & # # ; laptop , but it would n't zip completely this sleeve zips with no problem and still fits very snugly
ordered the # . # `` version for my new macbook pro retina display version since the retina display version is slightly <unk> than its aluminum unibody counterpart , the case is just a tad on the tall side there 's probably half an inch of wiggle room at the bottom -lrb- or top -rrb- of the case , but that 's fine with me since it gives you the ability to slightly grip the top of the case the width of the case fits perfectly though great product , super cute print , love it
i bought this sleeve for laptop , it 's so cute and also allows for me to travel with it and not worry about it getting damaged i will say that the case could have been more padded , but i have a hard case on my laptop , so it 's totally fine i love how even with the hard case , the sleeve still fits perfectly
i saw this product and was immediately drawn to the <unk> <unk> between my cat that aside , i just received it today , and am very pleased even with the hard-shelled hard candy bubble case the macbook fits nicely into this adorable little sleeve the `` fabric `` is light , but durable and there is enough of a cushion to pad a medium fall -lrb- now my mac can survive when it decides to fall of my dorm bed -rrb- on that note , great product , very cute ... great fit totally go for this one ! :
i think this laptop cover is cute the backside shows the back of the cat , a cute touch i have n't used the buckles for a strap so i do n't know if they 're weak as some reviews have pointed out for me , it does it 's job with a pop of color the cat seems to <unk> some people though , which makes it even better for public use ! :
absolutely recommend ! great materials , true to design , the computer fit perfectly i shopped around in person and was very displeased at the quality of what i found , was skeptical about online purchases , but soo glad to have gotten this highly recommend you purchase this , you will not be let down
my daughter will love this its extremely vivid , made well and has the # latch hooks on each side to add a strap it would be cool if they <unk> a strap
i bought this bag for my # year old daughter its a nice little bag , it serves its purpose well it has enough cushion to protect your machine , without being heavy it is made well , and the design is very cute it has a different design on both sides if i had one complaint it would be that it does n't come with the shoulder strap , it has the loops for one , but that was a minor issue i just used one from an old bag i would buy another if i ever need one
i just got it in the mail today amazing fast shipping was here a day early fits my toshiba mini perfect with the # . # size . looks just like the picture and seems very well made i love it thank you :
the quality is good and my laptop fits well inside true to size i love the <unk> it is also just as bright and colorful in person , which is what i love the most
looks good and has been durable the wife loves it , just could use a better strap , but for this style of case it is better in a backpack or messenger bag for better
this sleeve is as good quality as it is adorable i had a shoulder strap from a laptop case that i attached to the side links and now it 's a carrying case it 's sooo cute i love it
i had to wait a couple extra days to write this review this case arrived before my laptop i have an hp g # , # . # `` pc , and this sleeve fits <unk> it is not to tight , not too loose i will be able to put in a couple papers in there with it just no room for the charger but that is ok love love love it
i give this # stars because i have finally found a sleeve that was the size -lrb- # . # & # # ; -rrb- that i needed i tried to find one in the stores and was unsuccessful i love the design and color also , the fact that it is soft not to scratch my laptop and durable enough that my cats can no longer leave their own <unk> prints all over my laptop
i needed a protective container in which to carry my tablet and so ordered kitty to go it is perfect as it is padded on all sides as well as having an additional foam piece inside which can be removed as needed it is also very cute i love it
i needed a case fast so i picked out a cheap one until i could get a more durable one later i am actually happy with this purchase and i do n't plan on buying another . it 's very nice quality and very vibrant and cute . people ask me about it all the time
recieved my lap top case just last week , and am so happy with it . it fits my laptop perfectly i have a # `` macbook pro and it is like a glove for it thank you so much :
i bought a cute coach bag that is very versatile for a laptop , diaper bag , etc . my # `` laptop needed much more protection so i ordered this off of amazon it was sturdier than i expected , and the design is very cute i like the back of the item even more ... . . it has a big x for the kitty 's <unk> hole i get many <unk> from my co-workers not good for a stand alone item , you must purchase a separate strap and there is no place to store cords , mouse , etc . however , it is great for protection if you own a separate carrying case
i used this on my macbook for about two years , and you can tell it leaves a lot of scratches all over your original case , which completely defeats the purpose of buying a protective case in the first place do n't waste your money
great case at first and kept my macbook looking new and great and kept the bottom from getting filthy <unk> after taking great care of my computer and using this case , just from regular use of opening the lid and toting around it scratched and cracked very easily if you do n't want to keep buying more and more cases invest in a quality and more durable product that will last and look nice and protect your investment
this is the first time i 've ever come across a speck case that the bottom half does n't fit properly it does n't have any locks on the front of the bottom half so it 's just loose and it makes an annoying sound when picking it up if you push down on the front it moves the case you can pick the macbook up and hold it on it 's side and just slide the case off with ease i 'm slightly disappointed i own a macbook pro with two different speck cases and they both have locks on the front half of the bottom piece it still makes the mac look wonderful but because of the looseness of the bottom i am giving it three stars
this case will protect your laptop in case you drop it , but since it is n't made with the matte material that some of the other speck cases have , you will see scratches on this case a lot
very good product it fits the new white unibody mac it snapped on very nicely and easy to do had it for # months , i see small <unk> in the plastic , only noticeable when <unk> hits it just right but it 's still protecting my mac
bought in # for my macbook unibody style and i love the protection it provides i always leave this on b/c it has saved the corners soo ... many times ! as i am writing this review on my macbook , the same case i purchased in # is still protecting it and looking awesome i have taken it off once at the beginning of this year and my two year old macbook looks brand new still thanks to the protection this case provides ! i would highly recommend this case for anyone looking for a little extra protection for their macbook !
i just bought a new # inch white macbook and want to keep it in better shape than my old one this fits perfectly i wanted a case that did n't hide the computer so this was the right choice glad i bought it
i 'm happy with this purchase it protects my macbook from scratches definately worth the investment the only reason why i would n't recommend it is because i do n't want everybody having the same one as me .
product snaps right onto my # `` white macbook -lrb- october # unibody model -rrb- it fits perfectly , appears strong , is crystal clear and thin back of package <unk> that product `` does not fit <unk> white macbook or # `` aluminum unibody macbook/macbook pro .
this is great quality , and i love that its clear and you can still clearly see the apple decal i bought this came amazingly quick too , in less than # hours , couldnt believe it
we accidentally got # -lrb- from different sources this is what happens when you do n't communicate about trying to ` help ' one another out . -rrb- so there will be a spare works well , fits perfectly , no problems <unk> to amazon for its packaging <unk> that said , speck makes very good cases my mbp has had the same red speck case for the past four years and it has thus been saved from scratches and nasties in <unk> traveling adventures if you 've invested the money to get a mac , do also invest the money to keep it from looking <unk>
i ordered this for my white # `` macbook does n't fit at all apparently it will not fit the previous model of this same computer -lrb- the original # `` white macbook , which i guess was made up until october # when the model was changed ever so slightly . i was not aware that there were two models with slightly different dimensions i found the description for this product confusing since it does not mention this either , it only states that the case will not fit a macbook pro what i found especially irritating is that it explains about the case only fitting the later model of macbook right on the box for this product , which obviously i could not find out until i ordered the product amazon really needs to learn how to write better product descriptions the consistent hassle i have experience from this company and even private sellers hardly seems worth the few bucks i might have saved before getting annoyed and shopping elsewhere
i ordered my cover online , and i looked if it would fit the white macbook , it said it would , but it did n't now i already opened it , and ca n't return it anymore not a good buy , i 'm sure people with black macbooks would be very happy with it though
when i received this product it appeared to be in good condition however , after trying to fit it onto my macbook , i realized that it would not snap and stay on i was very disappointed to receive a <unk> product hopefully it works better for you
it was horrible it didnt even fit on my mac book and i dont have a pro i have the original white mac book its terrible dont bother buying it ...
i like the case and it fits on perfectly , however i noticed that things tend to get trapped between the case and the macbook leaving small scratches this bothered me since the whole point of buying the case was protection and it did n't live up to that expectation it 's a nice color though and does protect my macbook from serious <unk> -lrb- from dropping things on it , etc -rrb- but i do think i 'll get a sleeve as well for extra protection
love the color i bought the macbook in december # and it fits just fine , but when you open the computer , the bottom pops off kind of defeats the purpose of having a case on i just kept the top on and took the bottom off
it 's easy to put on and remove the shade of pink is really nice if you 're a pink lover like me it fits my new white unibody macbook perfectly my only complaint is that i wish that this color of pink came in the satin finish for the new white unibody macbook i think that it would n't look as cheap if it was in a satin finish still , it 's very cute
i ordered this pink case to spice up my white macbook , and it does just that it is very sturdy , the color is vibrant pink , and it snapped into place very easily and has stayed put i was worried that it might trap dust and dirt between the cover and the computer but it really stays quite clean i remove the cover every month or so and clean all of the surfaces and so far i have been very pleased the two legs on the back underside of the case can be pulled out for venting the underside or can be folded up , a feature that i really like i would recommend this product to anyone who wants to add a splash of girly color to their macbook note : this cover is for the older body style macbook , not the most recent release
i was a little hesitant when i decided to buy this product because of some of the reviews this product is exactly what i wanted , it is see thru as described and fits my white macbook perfectly
this is a really cute cover , but unfortunately i had to send it back i did not realize that it fit the newer macbook : -lrb- otherwise it would have been a keeper !
my macbook has to been to hell and back ... it rides in my backpack everywhere by bike , foot , bus , etc . i even dropped it out of a trunk and this case cracked and my macbook was golden . i 've even accidentally gotten <unk> that burnt little spots on the top of my closed computer now this is n't an otter box ... but my computer looks brand new underneath it obviously anything you drop is going to crack , but it certainly does the job protecting my computer
overall the speck case is very light weight and gives a pop of color to a plain white macbook the color in the photo does n't actually <unk> the actual color of the case , but i had originally wanted a darker pink so it worked well for me so if you are expecting to have that exact color pink , you might be a bit disappointed to see that it is n't the type of pink that you were hoping for
i bought this case for carrying my ipad -lrb- now ipad # -rrb- around at <unk> the ipad slides easily into one side of the case and there is a second section that fits cables and whatever else you need to carry i like the case a lot , but the strap is another story mine broke on the second trip with only normal use
my chromebook fits just great in this case i am highly impressed with the very soft lining of the pockets it provides excellent protection , and also would be a great case for an ipad or any other tablet the grid-it is very convenient for my <unk> however , the grid-it is a bit tricky to get into it 's compartment . the zipper just covers it , if pulled right that was what caused me to take a star off , since i 'm sure someone would find that a hindrance
