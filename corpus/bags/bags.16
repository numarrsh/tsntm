i bought this bag to replace a larger , <unk> bag for my macbook this one is much smaller and compact the pockets are great and i love having the elastic pockets for power , cords , remotes , etc . the computer compartment is very well padded , so there 's no worry about my computer getting damaged it does n't fit all the stuff i used to carry in my other bag -lrb- like lunches , water bottles , etc -rrb- , but it definitely does the job and is more portable this would be an ideal bag for students who can go <unk>
the cushioning for the laptop portion is perfect the pockets in the other portion are great for their intended items or other items it is not conducive to have the slit for the headphone jack unless you are wearing the messenger bag for long periods of time extra storage pockets on front side zipper and back side slit are nice touch as well
i have a lot of laptop bags before but none better than this it fits my # inch and i am able to put whatever that is in my pocket in it love it ! !
this is a great carry all for my ipad and accessories i can put everything i use with it , including a keyboard , in isolated places so they do n't move around and damage each other it is sturdy , secure and lightweight i do n't carry my laptop around any longer as this is a much smaller package and easy to move around fully packed this one is a winner
i 'm a city commuter <unk> and often need to take my macbook with me ; this is the only vertical bag i trust i 've taken a couple of <unk> with it , and the bag has n't shown any damage -- much less the mac -lrb- ca n't say the same for my hands and knees ! the fit is snug , but i have enough room for a # `` mac -lrb- in a speck case -rrb- , plus iphone and both power cords
this computer bag rocks it 's a vertical computer bag that holds tons of stuff and rides nicely on your side i appreciate that its not big and clunky , making me go through openings sideways i rides tight to the body making for maneuvering around crowds and <unk> a breeze it 's comfortable to carry too it does n't flop about like the horizontal computer and book bags do it has specific holder pockets for the mouse and your ipod or cell phone i 've receive lots of compliments on it with people asking for information on where to purchase it i like that it hold my computer , yet will fit in my office desk drawer i highly recommend this gem of a bag
this is the perfect bag for traveling with a macbook air and also squeezing in an ipad and the few necessary cords , your passport and maybe a pack of gum it 's well padded but tight do n't get this for two laptops they wo n't fit i probably only was able to get my ipad to fit because i have a macbook air instead of the thicker pro also i only have a smart cover and not a thick case
if your intention is use this for office and short trips , this is the bag you <unk> for the # & # # ; inches lap if you are planing to use it for long trips and / or adventure look for something else
this bag , as others have stated , is specifically designed for the macbook i appreciate the <unk> pockets for the macbook power adapter , ipod , and mighty mouse however , the durable targus <unk> closure is the one feature that stands out , and makes this bag worth an extra $ # over the stm small alley cases and their velcro pads
i love this bag because it compact , sophisticated and fits my # & # # ; macbook air perfectly also stores my mouse , charger and has more compartments for my iphone and even my keys
i am super big on organization this bag was made specifically with the macbook pro # `` in mind the pro fits perfectly in the zippered compartment the back slip pocket i use a lot for thin books or documents the interior is where this bag really shines above the rest my mouse , ipod , charger all have their proper place there 's another slip pocket next to the charger , that i 'm not sure it 's used for , but i just throw my small external hard-drive in there is also a zippered net pocket on the flap that fits my <unk> <unk> # + charger there 's even a protected earphone opening so i can listen to music with my ipod secured inside the bag
i 've carried laptops for the last # years i 've had and have just about everything out there from backpacks to rollers to traditional bags i use a macbook air because i want as thin and light as possible this bag fits my mba , console cable , battery pack for my phone , mifi and power cable perfectly i came back to buy another one as i got this the week it was released and i 've used the hell out of it this is by far the best laptop bag i 've had
this is the perfect bag , all my necessities fit neatly and compactly in the front compartments i have looked at other bags for alot more money and this beats them all its size is perfect , its small , but smartly fits everything its well padded too
perfect for my ipad , it is such a nice bag that i might use it all the time in terms of space is very good , could have more organizing items , but it is such a nice product
i looked at a lot of bags before i chose this one this bag is great it has pockets to fit all your macbook accessories the bag is very neat and slim looking not large at all like most of the laptop bags the fabric is water-resistant and the inside compartment is lined with <unk> so your macbook wo n't get scratched amazon has the best prices most of the time and there service was great ! i would recommend this product to anyone who owns a macbook get it while it 's on sale at amazon for $ # . # thanks amazon for charging no tax or shipping for this item !
this is my first laptop case , and it 's great the laptop fits securely in the bag , and there is plenty of room for the accessories i especially like that there are separate compartments for each accessory the style of the bag is professional , clean and comfortable to carry although i wish there was more room to hold papers or a notebook , and my first thought was that it was rather expensive , it 's well worth it i would definitely recommend this bag to anyone who is looking for a bag with a snug fit to the laptop and does n't have a lot of excess compartments overall , great product
i bought this case because i did n't want to spend a lot of money on a sleeve for my laptop when i received it i was pretty impressed and thought it would last a long time after using fairly often for about six months , the seams have started to rip everything else appears to be holding up pretty well decent product , but bad <unk>
this sleeve fits if you force it , but i thought it would be a little better of a fit this was the cheapest one , and i just need something to cover my laptop in my backpack
it is a nice case i would not suggest it for real protection as in if you are an individuals who tends to drop or hit their laptops into objects while transporting it this is a little flimsy for that purpose
it is a bit <unk> , but it fits my dell latitude e # perfectly i just left it in the garage for a couple of days as reccomended by some other buyers and the smell is almost gone by now it 's not very thick but it is ok if you carry your computer in a backpack
first was the awful & # # ; neoprene stench . & # # ; i 've aired it out a lot and that 's no longer bothering me as long as i do n't get it near my nose it stretches a bit to fit to fit my # . # in laptop and is just cushiony enough to protect it from dust and scratches it does n't add much thickness so it does n't take up much room in my backpack it has a big flap , like a messenger bag , that gives an extra layer of cushion on one side it has a fairly slick knit material inside and out so it 's easy to get the laptop in and out of the sleeve and to get the whole thing in and out of my backpack i did n't want to spend a lot on a sleeve and this one works fine for me now that i 've let it air out and the stench is mostly gone
cheap little sleeve seams are well done and i like the fact that the front sleeve flap extends down all the way to the bottom of the sleeve . . so you essentially get two layers of padding great buy and looks very durable only quibble is that it is definitely cheap neoprene , if it is neoprene at all definitely not the quality of wetsuit neoprene , or even the `` neoprene `` used in incase sleeves , but for the money , i ca n't complain
this works great i use it for my # in macbook and i love the stylish look not really what you see everyone else using and that 's what makes it look better it fits the macbook almost perfectly not sure how it would fit on larger laptops though i mean as long as they are n't much bigger than the macbook pro # inch you will be fine because its kinda stretchy the only problem is that it smells really strong it 's sort of a <unk> smell once you air it out for a few days though its fine great product for the money i would recommend this as a case
for the purpose i bought this product i found everything was as described of good quality and the shipping had been relatively expedited ... would recommend this as a shopper for the value
this is a great bargain on the sleeve it fits my # . # macbook pro like a glove however , just like the other reviewers said , this sleeve smells like a burned rubber tire upon opening the packaging i had it outside for a few days and the smell finally was bearable so it does air out over time other than that , it is a great product , fits perfect and i recommend to anyone wanting to save some money
i was concerned with the sleeve 's size because my laptop is asus # . # `` . but because it is elastic , my laptop can fit in ! but it stinks ! well , with this price , you can not complain too much
love the product except mine came with an <unk> that does n't seem to go away , also wash and air out before using this product , has a very strong distinct odor
the sleeve fits my # `` macbook pro perfectly and so far it seems to be a sturdy product that will hold up well my only complaint was the extremely strong <unk> odor it gave off when i removed it from the bag it was so strong we had to put it outside in the garage because we could smell it no matter where it was in the house after a few days outside and another week or so in use , the smell is so faint that it 's no longer a problem , and it really is a great sleeve for the price
for those who had bought <unk> on sale , this one fits like a glove , no stretch required i tested my friend macbook retina # and it fits normal , not as glove as the vizio but it does not look bad at all
i have been using this product almost daily for the past # months and it is still in good shape i use to protect my laptop when inside my bookbag it will keep anything from scratching or denting the computer , for sure you just ca n't drop the laptop from more than a foot high , as it would n't protect it in that case
i bought this as a slipcase for my wacom tablet in order to keep the bumps and bruises away from it when traveling it 's stretches just right to fit the width , and the height of the flap is just perfect to keep the main components extra protected -lrb- two layers of the material in the front -rrb- it seems well made , and for the price , i just found the perfect `` glove `` for my wacom intuos # medium tablet
this item was exactly what i was looking for i had looked in stores for something like this but all i could find was the briefcase style or something with a zipper -lrb- which could scratch my laptop -rrb- i have a dell # studio laptop and it fits perfectly i would recommend this product to a friend definitely worth the money
this sleeve is absolutely perfect i love it , it 's made out of a nice , <unk> material and absorbs water really well one time , i placed my laptop in the case and accidentally spilled some water and it did n't even reach my computer i recommend it for anyone who is looking for something simple and extremely cheap
this items fits a dell inspiron # . # screen perfectly -- not too tight , not too loose it arrived in less than a week , which was great given the season it does n't smell bad at all , just new the quality is very good , the thickness is just right , the stitching is solid , and i really like that it does not have zippers or anything that will scratch the computer i could n't find anything online that really said it would fit a dell # , and like the poster before , this was exactly right for the size it was a lot of bang for the buck
wonderful gift for someone with a new compaq laptop . prompt deliver and very nice . <unk> alot of laptop bags and decided on this one because of the price , very very good decision on my part my sons laptop is perfectly covered like a glove , very pleased with the case and the protection that it provides for the laptop you will not go wrong with this case , cover or glove -lrb- what ever you would like to call it -rrb- just perfect thanks to the amazon staff for the great job
i purchased this bag less than a month ago and the strap is already broken i examined it and it appears to be held into place with about five threads unlike the other reviewer who got this bag for a child , i am an adult and carried at most a paperback and sandwich in it daily and yet it still fell apart while simply walking with it i do like the pocket design and the aesthetics , but i would like something that lasts more than a few weeks avoid this product if you desire to carry anything in it
i bought this bag for my # th grader it did n't last two weeks the side ripped from the seam it has great pockets , it 's made from durable material and it fit our needs , but it did n't hold up and that 's very upsetting do n't waste your money
have used the bag for about nine months in the beginning it seems to be constructed well never carried anything heavy in it , just clothes the nylon material on the inside has started to fray and come apart no problems with the shoulder strap , just the interior unfortunately it ca n't be repaired looking at the canvas `` jack bauer `` type bags as a replacement
works great for my macbook and other paperwork that i want to slide in the pouch has some nice little pockets for other things like my mouse and work phone . an open pocket in the front makes it easy to slide a book in for the bus ride to work works great , thanks
love it , love it , love it i wish <unk> and the school i go to would carry it i am finding new compartments for storage everyday <unk> , i needed something that would not put stress on my shoulders i got <unk> and <unk> from carry bag the traditional backpack way great product ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
enough pockets to <unk> with backpack single strap makes for ease in carrying on one shoulder more color choices would be nice though pockets for my kindle , mobile phone , zune or ipod <unk> and earbuds fit securely through hole below strap
i purchased one of these nearly two years ago when i went back to grad school it has lasted me this long , toting around # + lbs of books on a nearly daily basis it looks more professional than a backpack , and can be used as a briefcase type bag too lots of storage pockets for organizing your stuff my small laptop fits in it with no problem and extra books besides because of the heavy workout it 's gotten over the last two years , mine has developed a small hole from wear - not at the seams though the seams on this thing are tough the woman whose child went through it in a week must have been dragging it on the ground i 'm getting ready to order another one i would recommend it to someone who is looking for a sturdy bag
one of the foot rests broke off on the second use the telescoping handle also jammed and wo n't pull up it was only used twice as carry-on luggage , never as checked baggage , so how it fell apart so easily is beyond me sending it back
i 've had it for a couple months and so far , no problems i use it every day to transport my two laptops back and forth to the office even though the price is cheap , it does n't look cheap in fact , a coworker who had paid a lot more -lrb- $ # + -rrb- for his rolling briefcase was admiring mine and complaining that he got ripped off
stupid handle breaks and wo n't go up and down this thing would be a # star if they used <unk> materials for the rolling handle so the pegs did n't get stuck
before this bag was even # months old , both wheels split open basically rendering it useless since it 's not worth the extra effort to pull dead weight added to that is a broken handle - it takes # attempts before you can get it to come up the whole way the storage of the bag is good , lots of space and the front pocket is great for organizing items my # . # laptop fits perfectly i had such great hopes for this bad and instead feel like i wasted my money
bought # bags for # members of my staff and it seems to be falling apart the handle is loose and the bottom of the case , the stand , is now coming apart
i never travel with just a laptop case so it is very important to have an attachment strap or design of some sort that enables stacking the case on my carry-on this is the first case i have seen in years that does not have this feature , this is a no-brainer ; return to store and go buy another brand with some sort of common sense invested in the design
just received my case it is poorly made the & # # ; telescoping & # # ; handle does n't telescope one length handle which is way too tall for me as i am # feet tall the handle is very wobbly and i just ca n't see it handling pulling any weight at all this is going back first thing in the am what a waste of money and time i am requesting a refund and will spend the extra money on the samsonite
the first one i received had issues with the retractable handle after the first trip the replacement i requested arrived quickly but <unk> only <unk> # trips not it will not extend at all and i am outside the replacement window for amazon i will call to see if i can get a refund towards a better quality bag be careful ! ! ! i would not have another one of these ! ! !
i grant that this a nice bag for the price , my # `` laptop is a pain to lug across the parking lot every morning this bag has plenty of room for cables and files , plus all the peripheral you could want however , the handle virtually never releases or retracts without a fight it 's completely stopped working after a mere two weeks of use it might <unk> loose every so often but its not worth it at all i am so irritated by this thing you have no idea waste of money , if you want to lug around a laptop with a carrying handle you would get a lighter one without wheels and harsh edges that bang into your legs as you walk
i owned this identical bag for years bought it at the same price point at a box store only replaced it in april because i had worn the wheels down to nothing and the bottom of the bag was starting to drag on the ground totally got my money 's worth out of that purchase , so i was thrilled to find the identical bag on amazon when i needed to replace it , and purchased without hesitation due to my great experience well today , with totally <unk> use , the handle got stuck down it wo n't extend all the way anymore and since i bought it # weeks ago , i 'm outside amazon 's return window it 's junk now and i 'm shopping for another model
i am on my second bag second because the wheels are not replaceable targus offered a replacement bag for the cost of $ # , so i took it . # months later and a wheel is on the verge of splitting i do not feel like replacing this bag on an <unk> basis it 's really a shame the wheels are not replaceable because the bag itself is in perfect condition and fits my needs i have to hate it because of the <unk> wheels -lrb- otherwise what 's the point of getting a rolling case ? -rrb-
the measurements given for this item are conservative in reality , it 's as big as an airline carry-on ; whereas it 's described as more of a laptop and file carrier for the workday
if the wheels were actually durable , this would be a good bag my last rolling bag lasted a year and a half , and only needed to be replaced because the bottom wore out i thought this one would be a good replacement , because the bottom looks so durable i had it for # months and the wheels shredded to pieces , and it is no longer usable as a rolling bag kinda defeats the purpose , huh
the bag is the perfect size and all the pockets make it easy to organize your items , its like having a rolling desk however , the wheels did n't hold up and have come apart definitely not worth the money i spent
this is not a quality bag -lrb- wheels squeak when rolling , material is cheap both inside and out , handle is not sturdy -rrb- need i say more i use a bag similar to this as a business instructor and was looking for a replacement sadly , this is not it i am sorry that i purchased it
generally , it is a very good product very spacious , sturdy , and just what i was looking for however , the wheels are misaligned and the bottom is bowed down the misaligned wheel drags and will probably soon wear out not sure if the bowed bottom will affect anything also , i am not sure if these defects show up in all of the units of this lot , or just this one , but i do not have the time and energy to find out i sent this bag back
this case was decent while it lasted , but it did not make it # months before falling apart i did not even use it daily and the wheel started separating from itself instead of rolling , it drags along the ground now side pouches for water bottles would be nice # the telescoping handle does n't extend evenly
i bought this roller case with the intent to be my go-to luggage for those overnight business trips , in which i would need not only my laptop , but a change of clothes as well this is good for storing the laptop , files , and even basic necessities , but shoes/clothes - not so much
i purchased this bag # months ago , and i was happy with it until this week the left wheel just broke in # pieces and fell off the bag also dragged on the ground when i had several books in it , the bottom looks horrible the handle for pulling it was great until about # weeks ago , and then it developed a lot of looseness , like it would fall apart at any time i really hoped to use it at least for a whole semester , but now i 'm shopping for another rolling book bag wo n't be another targus metro
the case itself is extremely roomy it has plenty of room to store all of my college books and my netbook , and still has enough leftover for a bunch of <unk> as far as a bag goes , this is extremely roomy unfortunately , i ca n't say the same about the wheels on this case the wheels on this case have to be the most shoddy wheels on the market considering that this is a rolling bag , you 'd think that they 'd put that into consideration and get you some decent wheels , but they did n't the wheels wore in just over a month of daily usage , and much to my surprise changing them out is nearly impossible because they 're riveted in how very convenient of them to do so , especially after putting in such bad wheels now if you 'll excuse me , i 'm going to drill out some rivets and replace them with nuts and bolts , the way this case should have been manufactured
the bag is great i had plenty of room and could not ask for better organization but after a month and a half , the wheel broke i went to their website , but after waiting # minutes for a live chat was told all <unk> were unavailable i will go and buy another brand - wish i could just replace the wheels
i had two of these bags so far and the wheels make alot of noise ... will probably have to try for something else . . too bad ... it was a very good price and good construction
the wheels on this bag have completely worn out with only # months of use - the wheels were the whole reason i bought it in the first place it 's a disappointment
i wondered why this product was so much cheaper than other rolling briefcases after owning this product for # months , both of the front zippers broke and one of the wheels started to drag do n't bother with this product invest the $ $ $ in a better product
i really liked this bag it fit all my stuff and had plenty more space but the wheels lasted about # month my bag still looks brand new but the wheels are all worn out wish i could buy some new wheels
the quality , delivery and service was great , the only thing is that it was bigger than what i needed . it almost looked like a travelling case not a regular laptop roller case .
its everything i wanted but a couple of problems after # months one of the inside pockets is torn already the zippers are still working but feel like they are not going to last the handles are so floppy , that getting this out of the planes overhead , you have to use # hands , since the handles have no control over the direction when it comes down you have to support it so you do n't hit anyone when getting it down on a positive note , the balance is fantastic with my laptop and other travel junk loaded up , it wheels around with me only <unk> it no lifting or supporting is needed while pulling it is very well balanced
i have had this bag for a little over a month the pull out handle is not as sturdy as i had hoped now it is getting stuck when i go to pull it out
i gave this # stars but not because it 's not a good product ; this one does n't have as much storage capacity as i was looking for the times when i am able to use it , i find it works very well it does have some very useful compartments but not all work for me so do n't discount it for that reason alone the handle does extend well but if you are a tall person it may not be long enough the price was very affordable and having the option to carry or roll made it a good purchase choice for me
the bag is great it fits everything that i need and is very easy to pull however , the wheels do n't last very long i have been using mine since august # th and i 'm ordering a replacement just two months later you pay for what you get
great computer wheeling bag for the price the leg broke on the first use but amazon replaced even though i was a few days after my # day return policy amazon was and is wonderful ! i have had no problem with the replacement bag and i love it i keep my dell notebook and portable hp printer in it it fits nicely
overall , this bag is decent the bag itself is solid and well made the wheels are a bit small and do n't seem as solid while i have not had issues with durability yet , this is where i see problems occurring the handle has a little play -lrb- loose -rrb- , but not overly so , and while it may feel flimsy at points it has held up well i was a bit disappointed with the size i have read how `` roomy `` this bag is , and it is ... provided your electronics do not expand past a single laptop and charger after than it starts to get a bit cramped and things do not fit neatly as the bag , despite having two zippers is really just a single compartment with a # % divider small items can -lrb- and do -rrb- slip under from front to back -lrb- or vice versa -rrb- overall , it is an ok bag for the money , but if you need to lug around more than just a laptop , you may need to look for something a bit larger
was n't as big as i needed it to be also , the wear and tear has already started to show and i have n't even had it for one semester of school
i bought this bag specifically for traveling that i am scheduled to do in the up coming months while i have n't had a real big issues with the bag , the zippers do n't do well with stress and the structure of the bag gives easily , granted it doens ' t have hard sides or not for an every day commute this would do great , however , if i were to continue traveling i would need a more sturdier back for those overhead compartments on the plane
under $ # works great this one is not as stylish or made with the same quality as the bags that cover over $ # but works i do n't think it would take the abuse the other bags can handle it meets minimum needs though and prevents me from carrying all the items i was carry into the office
case is not as sturdy as i would have liked fabric is thinner than what i 'm used to wheels seems to be cheaply made and not well balanced not a bad buy for the money though shipping was fast and the case did work & # # ; in a pinch & # # ; works well if you are n't doing a lot of walking with it over rough surfaces
the handle sucks after a couple of months - it takes many attempts before you can get it to come up the whole way the storage of the bag is medium , as i do n't like the space divider lots of space and the front pocket is great for organizing items my # . # laptop fits perfectly with a <unk> biggest issue with the bag is that the handle does n't have a cup for water whenever it rains the water goes down the handle into the bag destroying the bottom of all my books and
in a first view it looks great but when started using it , become obvious , that wheels rolling outward , as if they badly need an alignment so , no wonder some people complained that wheels got broken i doubt it 's going to work for couple of years , as i expected , unless i 'll do this `` alignment `` myself it 's just o.k . for the price
been using it for # weeks now and it has plenty of room and works well so far no sure about the wheels they do seem to be showing a lot of wear for # weeks use but only time will tell
took awhile but i received a replacement laptop rolling bag from the company not the easiest to deal with but they did come through . # wheel split and no means to repair ; a pity because the bag is still in excellent condition
at first this appeared to be a great case , but after a while the wheels split you had two rings where the wheels use to be and sometimes the thing would roll ok and sometimes not the longer i used it the more often it would not roll properly it took about # months for this to happen , so i did n't figure there was n't any warranty left on it i cut off the old wheels and added new ones as well as adding new longer legs in front , this allowed the case to roll well and was now higher so water was no longer a problem this case did travel over a lot of rough <unk> as i did field service for a large medical equipment company covering a <unk> area , so it was dragged about # <unk> every day # days a week overall this was an `` ok `` case , if you are handy and can make some repairs to it otherwise buy something else
case arrived in great condition and timely pull handle is loose and poorly constructed when you pull the handle up it is very loose and wobbly also would help to install a shoulder strap
the bag itself seems well made and holds a lot of books my # complains is that the handle does n't lock into different positions and when fully extended it 's pretty
it is not as big as i thought it would be and it needs more <unk> compartments other than that the item is fine i 've used it for around # week
i purchased this product for my wife , she uses it daily and is very happy with the case i found that the price was right compared to this same item at other <unk>
at first i thought this type of roller was too ` masculine ' . since i started using it , i have noticed many similar roller bags in use by <unk> the various sized compartments hold a tremendous amount of material it works well for taking the main files in the office with you
the only disadvantage is it does not seem as sturdy as some of the rolling cases i have used as long as it gets me through law school then it will be definitely worth every dime ! !
i like it because it is quite roomy , but the zippers are not great quality already i see i 'm going to have a problem with the one on the front smaller pocket , so may end up having to return it it rolls great and is lightweight without anything inside
first of all , it looks far more fashionable than its price would imply the wheels run smooth and were more solid than i expected for some clothes , some electronics , and a computer it works just great the only time it felt a little weak to me was when i tried to save a few checked baggage pounds by putting some heavy things in it if the contents are too heavy -lrb- and i mean getting up over # pounds or so -rrb- the bag does n't handle nearly as well as it does when just packed normally although the description <unk> using it with laptops , it is our go to overnight and carry-on bag now
i got a little concerned at some point that maybe my laptop was getting damaged with all the bouncing around when i carry it with my sling bag , so this rolling bag was a good idea that is until you go through a bumpy road
this product is very nice and functional i needed something to tote all my books for the class i am taking back and forth to work and this metro roller works perfectly
good for # computer or a computer and tablet the handle is sturdy most importantly it 's thin enough to fit under the seat if you are the last to board and all the overheads are full
good bag for the price , but the pulling arm is made kind of cheap like the ones on cheaper luggage i am hoping it holds up the arms like this on luggage has broken fairly easily so far , so good
i read the reviews and was a little scared to purchase i did and i have n't been disappointed i have had this since december and i must admit i do sometimes overstuff , but it is still holding up and no problems with the wheels
not bad for $ # . # , but it is flimsy the rear zippered compartment is pretty much worthless the two compartments are separated by a thin piece of nylon i would not pay more than $ #
my husband is a <unk> and has to carry his laptop and portable printer doing house calls this carries it all just wish it had a little more space for books the wheels are n't bad it 's common sense this bag is n't & # # ; off road & # # ; capable use common sense and carry it when necessary
i purchased this rolling notebook bag due to the distance from my car to my classroom at our new facility as i tend to often carry several heavy books home along with my laptop , i needed something sturdy ; thus far , the targus bag is holding up well i can stuff it full , load even more bags on top , and it still moves smoothly the one recommendation i would make to the manufacturers would be to add the wheels which would make the bag <unk> maneuvering around doors -lrb- and kids -rrb- would be easier
this bag is a great value i would have given five stars , but about a week after i bought it , the fold-out handle began to stick and now i have to fight it to extend it still comes out , i just leave it extended all of the time now it is generally a good bag and i do n't regret buying it
