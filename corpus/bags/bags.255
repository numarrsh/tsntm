the laptop bag is stylish yet durable it is also lightweight and easy to place out of the way when it is not in use my friends have all commented on how different the bag is and useful i would defintely recommend purchasing the bag
i do n't actually use this for my laptop , i have an alienware and it 's much too big to fit in the bag but i do use it every day for school the strap is really strong and all the compartments are good for separating books and notebooks there 's a pouch on the front that also has areas for pencils , erasers , and all of that stuff i 've gotten a lot of compliments on this bag and i love it
i chose this bag because i wanted something a little more ` fun ' and not so clunky like the bags they suggests when you order a new laptop it is easy to carry and i just like the look of it i have a # . # inch laptop so the fit is a little tight but it does fit i figure if it 's a little tight then is just better protected : -rrb- i do wish there was a little more room to carry the bulky powercord but i am able to make it work it 's a great laptop bag
i really like this bag very stylish and comfortable to wear across my body goes well from work to home would n't suggest for long trips but great for a daily commuter
i really love this messenger bag it has compartments for everything i need to carry and i am impressed with how well it is made and how easy it is to carry
i ordered this product a couple of months ago and am very pleased with the durability of the product and the light weight density of the item i love the look and style and have had many compliments on the fashion i also love all the extra storage space in the bag and am able to take many items i need to work from anywhere with me on the go overall i am very pleased with this product i recommend it to future customers
i absolutely adore the pattern on this bag it has a good number of very convenient pockets on the inside as well i think my only concern is about the sturdiness of the strap , but it seems to be holding up very well so far , so i 'm sure it 'll be fine
this bag has been great it protects the computer extremely well and still allows for other items like chargers , other electronics , etc to be all in the same place it 's great for traveling
this bag works great for me it looks exactly as pictured and has enough compartments for me to carry whatever else i need to bring with me in addition to my laptop
have had this about # months now and it has held up very well to a lot of use , and has thus far kept the contents well protected currently used with a # . # inch widescreen acer laptop , which fits in very snugly probably would not fit anything larger however , as the fit is very tight lots of storage space for adapters , mice etc . and even holds a medium-sized wacom intuos # tablet too drawstring around the top of the main pocket is a nice feature and helps to keep everything in place overall great , would definitely recommend
the laptop case is of great quality and very cute the strap adjusts nicely and is comfy my laptop can only fit in the big compartment part , so i just put the charger in the laptop compartment has good amount of pockets and space too
this bag is amazing my laptop fits perfectly in it i love how it has a seperate compartment for the laptop it fits my books and everything i need the zip pockets on the front hold pens and my charger with extra room for other items it seems very durable so far i highly recommend this item and seller i used standard shipping and still recieved within # days i am very happy
i 'm not really a purse kinda girl so i like the look and feel of messenger bags more i use this as a diaper <unk> i put my tablet wallet phone and anything else i need in the laptop sleeve pocket and use the main part for diapers toys and snacks for my kids has plenty of functionality for me so i love it
i bought the black & white <unk> # . # inch laptop padded messanger bag for my new sony vaio laptop and i have to admit that i love it my laptop is well protected in the padded sleeve part with a velcro latch it is a better quality than the picture makes it look and it has a beautiful corduroy liner on the flap which gives it a little more pizazz i love having the extra compartment inside where i can store my power cord and mouse and the extra zip pockets in the front are really convenient overall ... highly recommend
this bag is so much nicer than i thought it would be great storage compartments for mouse , cords , etc . padding and separate compartment for laptop is great i would definitely recommend this
this bag has everthing you need for carrying your <unk> it protects your computer while still offering plenty of storage for folder , pens , paper , or books what ever you may need to have w / you for work , school , or just <unk> the web also offers adjustable strap so it will fit you short or tall
i love this messanger bag it was such a good price that when i received it i was really surprised to see what good quality it is i have been using it for nearly a year now and it has held up well , still looking new i often get compliments on it and people asked where i got it i highly recommend this bag you wo n't be disappointed
side pocket is perfect for power cord and more laptop is # . # inch and just makes it in with the zipper cute and stylish , love the memory foam inside very happy with purchase
this fits my macbook perfectly it 's very sturdy and looks adorable i carry it by the handles vs. using the shoulder strap -lrb- just a personal preference -rrb- my charger fits nicely in the front pocket so happy with this one
i bought this for my # inch macbook pro knowing it would be a little big its a perfect case i would recommend to anyone , and i do n't mind having it a little big for extra room in the bag ! nothing wrong with the product and arrived on time :
bag is durable for price , for the macbook pro # , it def fits fine . it slides under the seat well in a aircraft and is easy to carry the front pocket is not huge , but i can get my charger in there , as well as my laptop in the main part i occasionally have a magazine or my ipad inside to
i got this because i work with a lot of men i can always find my bag never had to worry about someone walking off with it very nice protection light weight , but strong have traveled with this everywhere
i say old but it is a beautiful <unk> case that i love cause she loves the one that i gave her she is a & # # ; <unk> & # # ; loves everything in pink she <unk> and <unk> this lap top case and thought it was just perfect for her use she had to leave the tree gift giving to go and put the lap top in it right away
i absolutely love my case for my computer i get complements on this all the time from the shipping to the price to the product i was very satisfied and would recommend this to anyone
i love this thing it 's adorable and the perfect carrying case for my macbook pro i really like the memory foam on the inside and the alligator skin appearance the pocket on the front is slim but still has enough space to store my charger and the shoulder strap that comes along with the bag
this a fine case of excellent design , sturdy material , and quality zippers made in korea i recommend it without reservation one big plus is that the extra zippered <unk> is the right size to take the wacom bamboo tablet -lrb- with its stylus in place -rrb- plus its usb cable , plus the mac power supply with its integral cable there is a double carrying handle and also an adjustable shoulder strap with soft shoulder pad gives excellent protection and is a classy looking product i have not seen anything better bought through amazon
despite the reviews i read , this case simply does n't fit my laptop - not even close i have an acer aspire e # guess i 'll have to buy one especially designed for that model
i bought this case for # reasons - it was cute & it had the memory foam inside the case serves its purpose & is adorable , but it could be improved there is only one storage pocket & it 's not big enough when i put my charger cord inside , it is hard to zip & looks awkward i would n't return it , but if i had to do it again , i would probably choose a different case
this was cute , but after having purchased it i wish i had gotten something bigger the product is as described , but really small and if you put the power cord in the front of the case , it bulges out and looks messy good if all you want to carry is your laptop and nothing else
when i opened up the package i was so excited because this case it just beautiful nice quality , like the way the zippers moved , etc . then ... the bad news my # . # asus wouldnt fit correctly it just barely fit inside the case , but the zippers absolutely wouldnt zip my laptop was too thick i had to send it back so , if you have a # inch slim laptop i 'm sure you 'll love the case i 'm thinking of trying the # ' size instead , but not sure if i 'm willing to risk it
the case was beautiful and well made , however my laptop would not fit my # . # lenovo was too large & this case was for a thinner laptop if <unk> fit i would not have returned it
for the money , this laptop bag is pretty nice the downside is that i 've had it less than # months and the shoulder pad on the should strap is now split and frayed time to look for a new strap or a new bag
i got this for my # & # # ; laptop , which measures exactly that it looks nice and was light weight , but would not close with my computer in it also , the front pocket is not large enough for a slim clipboard and is very thin , just to give you an idea of the size there is only one pocket inside the bag , so nothing else can be carried there , unless it 's maybe one or two sheets of paper they padding is very good . though it is being returned since it will not hold my laptop
this is a light weight , no frills laptop case the foam inside is very protective , my laptop stays in place and does n't slide around inside the external pocket is very basic , no compartments for pens , mouse , etc . just a zippered pocket
reading all the reviews i thought this might be too small and ordered the # in . version after receiving , i decided to order the # inch as well my # in macbook pro fits perfectly in the # in . case the color is a very bold , hot pink definitely makes a statement good looking , well made , super fast shipping ; got here one day before expected
loved the color it fit my # & # # ; laptop exactly with no room to <unk> put the power cord in the outside pocket the outside pocket might fit some pens and may a mouse ; but deck <unk> nothing else this is not a carry all
i love this bag the design is nice , the alligator skin makes it look great the colour is abit too bright for me , i guess i have to get used to it the bag fits nicely a laptop with some documents , & power cord & mouse in the front pocket it is abit too big for my # `` laptop though this size is the smallest , it has the # `` version nevertheless , this is my favourite laptop bag so far
i love the case , and it fits my # `` sony vaio perfectly at first i thought that it might be cheap looking but it 's very tasteful and classy for hot pink <unk> skin ... if there is such a thing the shoulder strap is a little <unk> but it will do the job nicely i hope all in all it 's a very nice case and the memory foam is very thick , however the customer service and communication from this company is terrible , so buyer beware my case was delayed from arriving a week past the expected delivery date due to a company error and when i tried to contact them i never received any responses
i ordered this for my # st laptop i really like it and my cat enjoys it as a <unk> bed so , it is a cat bed and laptop case in
it is a cute case and seems like good quality , although it does n't fit my computer snug like i thought it would the case is too big causing the straps to not fit around it properly although i do like the looks and it seems as if it will protect my computer it came is fast timing and overall i am pleased with it
the bag looks just like the picture for the most part , however the actual color of the bag is a little brighter than the picture it 's a nice laptop bag , i believe it will last me a couple years before i have to buy a new one it appears to be durable but not extremely durable i have a # inch dell inspiron and it fits just right only con is that the laptop does n't have much extra space for things like books , pencils etc . i 'm a college student and do n't want to have to carry two bags if anything , buy it a little bit bigger than your laptop i wish i bought a # inch
this case is so pretty in person i bought it as a gift for my mother and she loves it i think the only complaint would be that it is very slim that is a good thing in most cases , but it could use a little more room in the pocket area for the laptop charger but otherwise , it seems to be made well and she is very happy with it
this was a nice case to put the laptop in that i was giving my granddaughter i was a little snug for this particular laptop but was able to get it in very nice color and material for a girl or woman
hot pink color , no <unk> whose case it is has a handy zipper pocket on outside , nice carry strap for your shoulder the inside holding straps could be tighter because i usually have to push the laptop into the case snugger again the inside upper straps however , it has an excellent price and good function for protecting your laptop from damage
i absolutly love this case everything fits in very snug i like the idea that i can open my computer and use it without taking it out of the case if need be
the case fits my laptop perfectly i am also able to put several folders inside as well the outside pocket is able to fit the charger and other school supplies this was a great
i love this item it 's a nice quality and i like the color it 's very padded so i feel secure knowing my laptop is secure it 's very stylish & i 'm happy i purchased this
i was very happy when i received this case for my laptop it is very & # # ; girly & stylish & # # ; and also me to tell my case from others at work i love that the color is a hot pink and i can see it from across the room i like that it has protection for my laptop and a place for my cords and i also can carry a movie or two in it i was also pleased with the delivery of my item and i would use this seller again
this bag is everything i expected it fits my laptop perfectly also , nice storage pocket for my cord , etc . and with the straps to hold it in , i never take it off the computer and it acts as a nice cushioned cover

this case is great it 's very well made fits the dell inspiron # r n # & dell inspiron # i 'll test it on other laptops when i have the chance to some said that the straps are not good quality but i think they are good the only problem is that the front pocket is not wide enough for the charger , the mouse and any other <unk> i can get them in but it 's very tight but i love it anyway ! i shared some photos , i hope they help -lrb- they are for the light pink case
i got this for my laptop , and it keeps it really secure the memory foam is great i can keep my <unk> and my earphones in the front pocket the strap is also in there as well , so it is a roomy pocket it 's so nice great buy for the money

i just want to first say that this item has been in my `` wishlist `` for several months with school now well into the semester , i felt it necessary to make this purchase after reading the reviews , i was pretty confident i would be satisfied , being the only negative aspect was the obnoxious hot pink color -lrb- which actually sounded lovely to me . not only was the # day shipping a day early : -rrb- but it was exactly like the picture and it fit my # . # inch laptop ! the memory foam and inner padding is awesome ; and the shoulder strap is legit -lrb- adjustable too -rrb- ... the additional pocket is just the right size for the computer 's cords and cables overall , i am beyond satisfied i cant wait to take it to school ! ! :

very please with the color and durability zipping my laptop in does take some extra effort because it is a very snug fit . fits # `` - # . # `` laptop casecrown double memory foam padded laptop case with front pocket -lrb- alligator hot pink
great case ! my laptop fits perfectly inside it the memory foam offers a great amount of cushion and protection the exterior pocket is big enough to carry the charging cords and software the pink is a beautiful , bright shade love it !
the case came as shown on amazon its just what i wanted i am very pleased with the product . would suggest it to anyone looking for a very nice case for their computer its also durable , and comes with a tote strap so you can carry it on your shoulder
i ordered it in pink and it 's very bright - i love it the quality is excellent , i do n't foresee it wearing out anytime soon it 's very compact and slim which is perfect for my # `` screen laptop - with extra room the memory foam padding keeps it very well protected the outer pocket expands enough to hold my rather large charger and i still do n't feel like it 's too bulky would definitely recommend
i love this bag ! the hot pink is super cute , though i would have <unk> bought one in red had one been available the extra front pocket is helpful and holds my cord and laptop accessories i have a # -inch and its nice and spacious for my laptop with room for <unk> also thanks for such a great product
i bought this computer bag several months ago this is a great back with protection for my new $ # laptop very stylish and cute i totally love this bag i can wear it cross body rather on my shoulder
this is really a lovely case and i would highly reccomend it it is a case <unk> to be used mainly for laptop not school with a lot of papers etc . but overnight with school friends etc . very <unk> and very pretty in black it would look quite <unk>
this is the first time that a product has come to me broken one of the short handles was torn out and i am not sure what to do with this product as i really need it
very disappointed in amazon quality i expected more from amazon especially given all the good review i guess you can not trust all the reviews on amazon either i wanted to buy a case so it will protect my valuable laptop the case is so thin it offers very little additional cushion from my cheap reusable grocery bad if you want protection , look elsewhere # -rrb- the zipper seems like good <unk> # -rrb- very thin and offers little protection if hit # -rrb- limited storage -lrb- almost like a thin sleeve with a handle this product might go back
the amazon basics netbook bag is an <unk> , inexpensive bag for ipads and netbooks i have had mine for several weeks and both of the zipper tabs have fallen off they are constructed with unbelievably thin wire that literally wore out within a few weeks of moderate use even though the bag is inexpensive , the shoddy zipper tabs have rendered the bag useless
if you want a bag that functionally has different compartments , zippers and such , this is your bag but if you want any padding at all for your laptop , this is not the bag for you the interior is made up of little vinyl pockets that have no barrier between them and where your laptop sits so if you want to put some adapters and power brick in these slots , they will hammer on your laptop i do n't mind the layout of the bag , but i do n't want my pockets as thick as <unk> material i understand it is $ # but with all the positive reviews i thought i might get something useful but i do n't know what people are looking at i will be returning this
the product is well built , and has good padding in terms of construction , it 's a # but considering it is advertised to fit an ipad , buyers should be aware that it is a lot bigger than an ipad i have an ipad # with a logitech ultrathin keyboard attached , and i felt like i could fit a whole other ipad in there there is about an inch on the sides and # inches on top left over this is n't a huge problem for most people , but i prefer my sleeves snug in order to keep my electronic stable and not be sliding around
this is a quality bag at a very good price unfortunately the ipad air practically swims in this bag i had to return it but i would not hesitate to buy amazon products again
the external build quality it great and feels sturdy , but the internal material is <unk> and thin , which makes it feel cheap if amazon would replace the liner material with something thicker and work on the pocket size and rigidity , this could be a great product
i bought this bag for my recently purchased # inch ipad air the reviews were good and the item looked great on amazon 's site on placing my ipad inside , the case appears way too large my ipad shifts around with any movement the material feels flimsy and there is little padding i am sending it back immediately the case logic <unk> - ! # bag i also purchased at this time is a much better fit and i will be keeping it it is also this same non substantial neoprene material with little padding , but the size is appropriate
if you 're buying this specifically for an ipad air , this is n't the bag for you it 's just way too big if you have a couple of different netbook / tablet sized devices and you 're looking for a cheap bag you could use with more than one of them this is a good option
i have a # th <unk> ipad with a smart cover , and this sleeve is just way to big for it maybe if i had a true case on my ipad and a keyboard it would fit better , but by itself , there 's too much room for sliding around that being said , construction and padding are nice as i would expect from an amazon product
the description of this item describes that it is for the ipad air fitting # to # in tablets , however the bag is way to large for the ipad air it swims in this bag , too big and bulky , defeating the sleak design of the ipad air it was even too large for the ipad # in my opinion i returned the bag and will be getting a bag that properly fits
i liked this bag when it arrived it looked solid and stylish however , after < # <unk> over a period of # months , one zipper tab broke at the ring when i tried to zip it the <unk> of the broken `` ring `` looked very thin i returned it to amazon and got a full refund
i like this bag because it has a nice handle and a zipper compartment for the cord -lrb- or whatever -rrb- it did smell awful when i first opened the box , so i aired it out for a few days it seems like it will hold up well i didn & # # ; t care for the color of the inside but for # bucks , its a good deal
<unk> bad , - but good to keep around the house - i would not take it out on public transportation , etc . you could <unk> i pad , as the casing is not that hard
this is a decent enough case and ok for the price asked it gets the job job but the cheap materials detract somewhat and the strong chemical odor is a turn off i 'm letting it air out , but it will take a couple of weeks , i think , as the odor was pretty strong i may be a bit more sensitive to this , than some , but it 's a sign of cheap materials that were not allowed to air and dry properly before being assembled -lrb- imho -rrb- i guess you get what you pay for , this is an inexpensive case if you understand what you are getting , it 's a fair value
