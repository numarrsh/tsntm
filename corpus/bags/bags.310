my mac air # inch fits pretty good it is a snug fit , but i can still squeeze my ipad , charger and smaller electronics without it being bulky looking the bag is not real leather , but that does not matter to me i was not shopping for a leather bag i like that the bag holds my stuff , it 's simple and looks professional and can work for anyone i would recommend this to a <unk> member
i am really glad i purchased this bag the only complaint i have is that i do n't care much for the strap even though the bag is n't made of real leather it looks authentic the strap makes the whole thing look cheap other than that ... it really works well
after reading the previous one <unk> reviews , i was really afraid of what the product would look like and smell like but unlike the other buyers , i really love this bag i ordered the large bag that can hold a # inch laptop and it looks really great granted , it is very light and thin because it 's not real leather , but i 've always needed a messenger bag that does n't flop or fold over this one stays upright and does not smell at all i do n't smell anything <unk> , but it does have that fake leather smell , which is n't that bad overall , it 's a great product i just wish the strap was n't nylon
i have been using this bag for the last month straight since i 've gotten it it is a great bag my # & # # ; macbook fits in it perfectly and i really like all of the different compartments for organization i had read reviews that the material was too plastic , and while it is definitely pleather , it was n't as cheap feeling as some of the reviews made it sound so far it has held up very well to every day use and it is super comfortable to wear i 'm definitely glad i went for this bag
excellent quality and size for the # inch laptop the bag has room for papers and accessories without being bulky the shoulder strap is adjustable and be crossed over your body for extra security
i love this bag it 's slim , but still holds a lot of things i can put a # inch computer , a notebook , the computer 's accessories , a wallet and it does n't look like the bag will <unk>
i use this for college i have a # inch macbook and an ipad both fit nicely and are protected i fell off my <unk> going around a corner and neither were harmed -lrb- i later learned to never ride with a messenger bag -rrb- anyway , it looks great , is durable , and is super classy at a great price * # months later i have put this bag through a lot it is not as durable as was shown in the beginning of its life the strap is torn off and is impossible to replace still a great bag , but if you plain on stuffing it with a laptop , ipad , # inch binder and/or more , look elsewhere
for the price i actually expected this to be a lot lower quality however i can find no faults with it i logged about # miles or so travelling with it and it still looks like new and just so you know i am not a person who is easy on their luggage
very well made but i bought it as a gym bag for bike and you ca n't even get a pair of shoes in it without struggle , would not buy
the previous generation -lrb- icon <unk> # -rrb- was by far better , mostly because it had so much more room ... but it only came in military orange . this is not the worst , just so tiny
my only issue with this great pack is the placement of the <unk> holders on the straps there 's one on each side and they 're just set too high up , held in place with industrial strength velcro they feel uncomfortable , so i 've removed them and do not use them as intended
this is my first modern motorcycle backpack i really like the way it straps in the front i does not hold as much as a conventional backpack does but i think it fits and looks better
bought this for my asus # . # `` ultrabook and it works great ! my little ultrabook just slides right in , fits nice and snug , and it 's really easy to take with you when your going to be out and about beats the high dollar sleeves at best buy
this case fits my samsung chromebook well it would be complete if it had a small slot inside for the sd card , since putting the chromebook in the sleeve with its protruding sd card is asking for damage my solution was to velcro an sd plastic carrier to the inside of the sleeve , just below the zipper an earphone pouch on the side would be nice , but really unnecessary , since you can just put the phones in on top of the chromebook
perfect snug fit for a samsung series # chromebook , pretty well made with first rate materials you can not go wrong with the price just make sure to get free shipping
works perfect for my samsung arm chromebook nice fit , looks good and does the job it 's supposed to do , protect my chromebook while traveling great value for the price also highly recommend it
this case is a nice fit , and has a <unk> side pocket , for flash disks , etc . but the handles are sewn inside the zipper , not on the outside , so that you have to have the case slightly unzipped to carry it this is a big design flaw , in my opinion the reason i bought a case was to make travel with my computer easier i should be able to zip my laptop into its case , and carry it the ipearl case does n't allow that if you just want this case as a place to store your laptop inside a backpack , this will do
this says it will work for a # inch but i could not get it to go on my acer aspire v # at all too small to zip otherwise , seems like a good quality
i initially loved the case , and would 've given it # stars , but a few weeks ago the zipper separated on one side making it difficult to zip it up all the way around of course that can happen with any zipper , but if the split covers the entire length of the opening , it will eventually make the case unusable
the quality and looks of the bag is really good i really like the handles on the bag for carrying however , the bag that i received was at least an inch too wide and an inch too long for my # inch laptop i wish the bag would have been smaller , as small as the description specified it is not nice carrying around a big bulky laptop bag in which your laptop keeps shifting and sliding from side to side
fits my # . # by # inch <unk> <unk> laptop perfectly other laptop cases sized for the ubiquitous macbook are slightly too small for my laptop , so this was a welcome find the zip sleeve on the side is great for holding my wireless mouse , thought i do n't think my laptop 's power cord would fit
unlike many sleeves , this one has storage for the power chord it 's a solid color which suits my teenage son , but is a break from the boring black or gray of most laptop sleeves fits our # & # # ; lenovo
exactly what we were looking for fits perfectly and love the added handle i do with it was on the outside instead of the inside but my son still loved it
i am really impressed with this case great value with high quality the only reason i 'm giving it # stars is that its states the charger fits in the outside pocket yes , it fits , but it is very tight and my charger is not that large i highly recommend this
i love the outside pocket for the charger while i also like the sleeve because it 's soft enough that i can fit in my backpack and sturdy enough that i feel that my pc is protected
i love this cover i 'm glad i bought it and i bought two , one for each of my families new laptops it 's good quality and has a convenient side pocket
i needed a case for my new ultrabook that was protective and had space to store materials this case is perfect my ultrabook fits perfectly in the main pocket and i 'm comfortable with it there the front pocket has enough space to fit the power cable for the ultrabook as well as the usb cd/dvd rom drive i have not tried to fit my mouse in the front pocket , but i do believe that it would fit overall , i really like this case
do n't get me wrong , if you are looking for a laptop bag that looks good , this one fits the bill i had several people compliment me on how nice it looked the problem is that i could n't stand using it after # weeks # -rrb- the biggest problem is that there is n't a handle of any sort on the top or side of the bag this creates a problem when you want to take the bag off your shoulder and lift it up -- say when you are getting into a car or something or even if you want to lift it up off the ground and put it on your desk or something , there is no where to grab to do this efficiently you end up wrapping the shoulder straps around your hand to make them short enough to actually lift the dumb thing -- incredibly annoying # -rrb- the second problem -lrb- and i kind of saw this one coming when i bought it so it might be my own fault -rrb- is the buckle closing device on the front of the bag yes , it look pretty cool , but if you have anything more than a laptop and folder in that bag it makes a chore to try and close unfortunately , because of lack of usability , this great looking bag is currently just sitting in my closet :
when i purchased this bag i was really excited it is put together very well and does not take up a bunch of space the draw back to the case is there is no handle , just a little metal hook for when i just want to lift it to move it
stylish and slim bag for my retina macbook pro i 'd like it to have a little more cushioning but otherwise is a very stylish messenger bag it has space for the computer , a tablet and a charger , it would n't fit more stuff but if what you want is something slim , this is a great
this is my go to bag when i want to carry my # `` macbook pro , charger and not much else if i 'm feeling really determined , i can also sneak in my ipad forces me to keep the bag light and looks sleek i 'm not the world 's biggest fan of the clasp it can be a bit of a fumble , but at least it does n't open accidentally also wish it had a little padding on the shoulder strap cuts into my shoulder if i wear the wrong top otherwise , solid bag very happy with the purchase
it fits a # -inch macbook pro perfectly there is a pocket for the ipad you could also fit a few sheets of paper and a pen this is n't going to hold much else this is a laptop case with a strap , not a <unk> carryall i jammed in a copy of & # # ; catcher in the <unk> , & # # ; but that was a stretch i like it because i do n't need a bulky bag that fits text books , etc . i just need my laptop
i was looking for a nice case that would hold laptop , phone , & ipad this does this and more room for keys , pens , chargers it 's sleek and very professional looking , but also modern love this ! ! the price was excellent for the product
i have a # & # # ; macbook pro and it fits perfectly inside this bag the only thing missing would be a handle on the top of the bag , but i knew it did n't have that , so i 'm not letting it affect my rating it 's light , but feels like it protects my laptop nicely i can also fit my ipad in the other pocket inside
this is a very nice looking case and a great price easy to get laptop in and out -lrb- in contrast to cases that have zippers which block ease of taking laptop in and out -rrb- has the perfect amount of room for accessories and a full size notebook
my wife is a school teacher and has a surface rt . this bag works great for her - plenty of room to carry her tablet , but seems very protected when doing so plenty of room for her charger , mouse , etc . big pocket area for her to carry papers and folders back and forth from school does n't look like a boring black laptop/tablet bag plenty of room for a # & # # ; tablet user was a little wary of the price , but i feel now that it 's worth it verdict : worth it
i like simple , and this delivers a padded pocket for the # inch macbook pro , a smaller one fits the galaxy note # . # edition perfectly some earbud headphones and a couple of pens is the only room left and get the buckle closed if you need to carry lots of stuff , consider other options if <unk> and minimal is your game , very nice
this bag is exactly what i was looking for , a slim bag that safely holds my computer and a few other things fits a # & # # ; macbook , agenda , and some paperwork quite nicely i get compliments on the bag quite frequently as others have mentioned the lack of a handle on the top makes it a bit awkward to maneuver in certain situations but nothing that hinders me from carrying it daily
this bag is great i can fit my asus g # inside just snug with an older asus g # it does not zip all the way the hand strap seems to flimsy , and the weight of the laptop may eventually bring it to its breaking point but completely satisfied with the clean design and price best bag for your buck
i actually saw and bought mine at the local best buy because i needed it right away for # . # + tax . so you save around # $ on amazon the backpack is great it is extremely spacious and was exactly what i was looking for the laptop compartment is huge , it fits my # . # inch easily and will fit your # inch as well the front pockets are excellent and well designed the side pockets are great as well , i just wish one was for water , but i guess the & # # ; netting & # # ; look is a bit aesthetically unappealing the backpacks main compartment is also very big , mainly due to the <unk> of the bag - excellent design bigger than the # $ <unk> backpack i had before also way bigger than any timbuktu messenger bag i had and the crappy roll top <unk> backpack i had before good buy , great price , bigger than the samsonite 's , looks great , and cost #
i am a <unk> student carrying lots of books , lunch , my laptop and this backpack is so good ... it is light ... and i dont feel anything when i am carrying it i am happy with this product and it is also cheap ! !
i really like this backpack , for two reasons , # - it is a very good quality backpack with a lot of space inside # - i got much cheaper in amazon than if i bought it from best buy
this is a really great bag i was using a briefcase for a # inch dell lattitude m # laptop with # gb it was a pain to carry and i looked for a slimline backpack that allowed me to carry this laptop to work and have other compartments this bag stays upright really well i do not like the interior color -lrb- orange -rrb- but that is a backseat to functionality i love it
the quality is good coming from samsonite but the looks are very average . on the picture it looks very stylish and classy with a bronze metallic finish but when it arrived it looked very dull some one had a comment about the handles and that 's probably true that the handles do n't have any padding or cushion and might start digging into your shoulders if you carry the bag for a long time
bought this for an international business trip because i wanted something that could take the place of both my heavy , bulky laptop bag and purse i read the great reviews and gave it a try it was perfect for my laptop -lrb- # . # & # # ; -rrb- and accessories the pockets on the inside were plenty for keys , passports , wallet , etc . one review mentioned the straps as being too thin and hurting ; i did n't experience that i thought they were a great length to put over my shoulder and never dug in , even when i was running through a terminal love it ! highly recommend it
nice color even though darker than the picture shown on amazon light weight so you can fill it up with all the essentials i got this for myself , a student , and i love it
i love this bag great value for the price my co-worker and i both got one and are very pleased sufficient room for files , pockets are functional and useful and the padding is good we were concerned that the thin straps would be uncomfortable with the weight of our laptops and accessories , but it 's actually fine to carry and travel with
i love this bag it 's big , but not too bulky it 's got many pockets inside and what i like most about this bag is that it 's so light in short , it 's a good , functional , lightweight bag
bought the brown and when i came in i thought i got the black by mistake still liked it and didnt mind , but when put next to something truly black i could tell it was actually a very dark brown
it 's the right size for my computer and a few files i carry around it looks very professional without trying the outside pocket has lots of compartments for everyday items
i was looking for a briefcase to help slim down my commute -lrb- on the train and in the plane -rrb- , and this bag has been working out perfectly the bag is perfect for my macbook air and my ipad , plus chargers the zipped compartment on the back side keeps my keys , headphones and misc loose items i 'd definitely recommend this brief
this lightweight backpack fits a lot and has lots of pockets for organization i love the back pocket so you can store your valuables when you are traveling and wearing the pack i 've never noticed any discomfort from the pocket i can easily fit a # `` laptop , ipad -lrb- in an otterbox -rrb- , books , snacks , and a few toys for my youngest trying to put a # `` laptop in , is a tighter squeeze but i was able to put my macbook pro in great for a day outing when i need to keep the kids busy and need my laptop too btw , it 's pretty stain resistant we 've been using it for almost a month and no stains , or other signs of wear
i like case logic for their simple but useful styles i bought this to replace my <unk> # laptop backpack that was getting worn i chose this for its new design and also the addition of the buckles - which unfortunately go around the chest as opposed to the waist although it is missing the sunglass zipper at the top , it does have a nice padded zipper pouch in the back my main complaint about the backpack is that it is missing the slots for a pencil/pen in the front pouch and the <unk> in both the front compartment and main compartment seem to be difficult to access this may partly be due to the material which is of course more sturdy <unk> , with amazon 's price , i do n't mind and i would still recommend it
my husband has a really large backpack that carries his laptop or notebook when he travels but the bag is looking pretty rough i liked the look of this backpack and wanted to try it out for him when it arrived , i was surprised at how light weight the backpack was -lrb- in comparison to his old one -rrb- and how nice the fabric looked he likes it but it ca n't carry nearly as much as he likes to cram into his carry on there are two different compartments that you can put your laptop/notebook in it 's strange to have one of the padded compartments directly on your back and the zipper under the straps there is one large zipper on the outside that has a pocket for a small notebook -lrb- definitely not for our larger laptop -rrb- and other small compartments they are all useable just not for anything bulky it 's a great for daily use but do n't plan on using this for long trips
i enjoy using this backpack everyday i 've had it for sometime now , and it shows no sign of wear or tear after traveling thousands of miles i recommend it for use with # inch laptops only it protects my lenovo ideapad y # p very well
i bought this backpack for a trip , i needed a backpack to fit my hp # . # & # # ; laptop and a camera insert i had the laptop compartment held my laptop with a little room to spare and the storage area fit my dslr camera insert perfectly , which holds a camera with lens and extra lens i do n't have anything negative to say about it
quality is superb i specifically was looking for a smaller backpack that still had good organization pockets and a sleeve for my ipad this fulfilled all that and more the security pocket will be very valuable as i travel the roll up strap ends <unk> the deal i did a lot of shopping and this is definitely one of the best backpacks for a person who travels heavily
i bought this pack to use as a carry-on bag for air and cruise travel i was amazed at how much i could fit into this backpack and still be well under the <unk> limit for overhead storage compartments i was easily able to pack # full sets of clothing and a windbreaker jacket in the larger compartment with ease and the full opening access was absolutely wonderful the rear pocket easily fit all my many travel documents as well as my ipad without adding unwanted bulk the front pocket is also very roomy and functional i managed to fit # cameras -lrb- in cases -rrb- , # chargers , # pairs of sunglasses , # qt ziplock bag with airline allowed essentials and also # -lrb- yes # -rrb- ball caps the side pockets easily held my phone and another <unk> camera or water bottle with all these items , the bag was still not too heavy and the wide padded straps made it very comfortable to carry even for my bad # yr old back i am so glad i purchased this quality made bag that i know will give me years of good heavy use
got this as a commuter bag to hold a few binders , essentials , and my laptop pretty lightweight and i like a lot of the features , especially the pocket on the back padding and the velcro that holds the straps in place
bought this to use as a diaper bag -- the shoulder bag stopped being handy when the baby started walking i like that the big pocket has zippers that go all the way down to the sides you can open it up all the way to pack efficiently and get to things easily
my # & # # ; laptop , my samsung tablet , ipad # and my son 's # ds xl ! plenty of space for all those things plus a couple notebooks , coloring books and <unk>
these cases were purchased for my kids boogie boards at christmas but they are way too big they are for a laptop , not a boogie board there are other designs that probably fit much better do n't waste your money buy a sleeve that fits very disappointed with these
this is way to big for the boogie board i 'm not sure how good of a job it would do protecting it i returned it and bought the sleeve instead
love the case but the shipping to way to long it was supposed to be here about a week before christmas and got here a week after as for the case it seems really nice and has held up to my # year old
amazon matched this up with the boogie board as a good match for a case , however it is way too big for the boogie board i would much prefer a more snug fit to keep it safer
i really like this cover my only complaint , which is n't really a complaint , is that it is considerably larger than it needs to be i would certainly buy another if and when i need one
i bought this for a gift for my niece to accompany her boogie board it was well made with a strong zipper and fit the boogie board perfect , she loved the color
it does what it 's <unk> to do it protects the boogie board very well and even has a pocket to place loose <unk> inside the shipping did take almost # weeks tho also looking at this picture i believe my case is & # # ; hot pink & # # ; instead of the light pink as shown but still works great and look great
this would of been perfect if the the pouch on the outside of the case would of been a bit bigger it 's a tight fit for the power supply and cord and if you have a mouse with it then it 's really a tight fit other than that it 's a great case
if you 're looking for protection in a fall , this is not it however , this sleeve is well made from thick , quality fabric , is lined and has a pocket for the cord whether or not my teenager will actually use it is <unk> to its great
i bought this for my macbook pro # & # # ; macbook pro with retina and it works great it does have some wiggle room because i thing it was originally made for the non retina mac books but it still does a great job at protecting it
i 've been researching for weeks for the perfect # & # # ; macbook pro retina case it was so difficult to find one that can fit both the charger and the extension cord and still look slim and beautiful i was n't # % sure that it would fit those extra parts , but i took a chance and i am # % satisfied with my purchase the front zipper pocket does create a bulge when you stuff the cords in , but it has enough room and i can even fit my mouse in there it makes me so happy that i do n't have to deal with the hassle of carrying a separate bag for the cords and mouse the material is very high quality and has enough cushion to protect your laptop from any kind of fall i would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a simple stylish case for their macbook pro
this seems like it is made for an # -inch macbook air i am going to try to return it or sell it , because i can not use it at all seems like it would be a nice protective case for a smaller computer , though
zipper broke in the first week i bought it as a temporary replacement for a similar case with a broken zipper it was not the experience i was hoping for
i needed a sleeve for my lenovo ideapad yoga # , which is one of the ultrabooks listed as fitting into this neoprene sleeve unfortunately , the yoga # is at least half-inch wider than the sleeve it would not fit , period i understand there 's some <unk> in sizing , but come on guys , do n't list a bunch of laptops that you think might fit and hope for the best
this is a bit snug on my laptop , but with some effort , it does fit the material is great inside and out however the side storage is pretty worthless , and the velcro that holds it shut is really flimsy but , at this price , you really get what you pay for if you can spare the extra $ # , get a better case
this bag is decent it has a soft inside to protect the laptop i wish it had longer handles , though i knew it did n't come with a long strap , but i regret not ordering one with that it 's hard to carry on just the wrist when you 're carrying several other things another thing i do n't like is that it attracts pet hair ! : -rrb- it 's not too easy to get off either this bag does the job , though
does n't fit the # inch macbook air needs to be slightly larger simple as that i will be returning this product immediately . -lsb- update -rsb- after leaving a single star review , easyacc contacted me immediately and offered to send me out a different case in their <unk> while not exactly what i was looking for , i have changed the review to # stars purely based on easyacc 's response willingness to go the extra mile
the bag is in good quality considering the price but it runs a bit too tight for my vaio pro # , which is already smaller in size than the macbook air # inch it makes me wonder how the people with macbook air # squeeze their laptop into this
i give # stars , did not give # since its not the best but fair enough given the price good quality for this price good decision to buy overall recommend to buy if you want a sleeve to use before placing inside a bag or something
light ; handles that can be put out of the way so that it is both a sleeve and a carry bag -- this is an excellent product it arrived in a very timely way and so economical compared to other products
it was tight for my # . # macbook air i just have a <unk> shield cover on it , however when i removed it and tried it still looked very tough and didnt want to force my new air into it the material looks good so i would say good for < # . # inch laptops but the extra star for the seller indeed an a + seller
this was a great price compared to ones in computer stores came quickly and was as expected the only thing i do n't like is the chemical smell hopefully , it will wear off like the outside pockets for charging cord , etc .
a bit flimsier than i imagined , and not that much padding , but otherwise pretty good it 's a nice snug fit , which means i ca n't just `` toss `` my mac air # `` into it in a hurry , but rather must ease it in with two hands but it 's also not too snug not only can i fit some papers alongside the laptop in the bag , but i can also carry a small water bottle in a side pocket with no problem i chose this one because of the price and the retractable handles , which i quite like i would buy it again
the bag is fine for the low price and i have no problem using for my macbook air while i do n't often carry my charger and cables with me , when i do they fit nicely in the side pockets what i do n't understand are the small size comments from other reviewers it 's not a tight fit for the air and in fact there is more than enough room to put two air 's in it even a macbook pro with a case would easily fit
i just got this hard case for new mac book air , and i have to say that this case is awesome ! ! ! it fits well on my mac , and brings a safety belt across the laptop that hold it it also has many compartments for your dc cord and movable hard drives and etc . greats investment in this hard case is all i can say about it and zero complaints , i would definitely recommend this case to all of
i bought # of these for my # . # <unk> tablets and they fit perfectly the best thing with the handle , my <unk> can carry around wherever they go
it is thin and provides minimal protection but it works for me since i carry my computer in a rolling case with a projector land other equipment and handouts for my classes i just wish it had a place for the charger and cord this is a minor inconvenience and on balance it is probably better the case is slim - the charger would probably compromise the limited protection the case offers
it 's a nice case for the lenovo yoga # . # & # # ; previous reviews are correct - this offers great protection , even against spills however , most people purchase the yoga for it 's smaller size , and with this portfolio , the size is more like a # & # # ; laptop when carried still lightweight though
although i have not used it <unk> often you can feel that the padding helps to protect the laptop price was very reasonable and came fast color is a little discrete so it will not work for very young people looking for more colorful envelop
the case shown is not the actual case they are selling the case they claim to be selling shows a second zipper that allows access to the charging port this is noted both in the description and in the photos the product that arrived was not what was advertised the product that arrived was the basic sleeve that did not have this second access zipper
i like it , but it is not what i ordered it does not have the extra zip to charge the laptop when inside the sleeve -lrb- as advertised -rrb- other than that it is great , love the color , love the fabric , and really fits like a glove !
this cover is a good weight for protecting my laptop , the zipper is a good quality and promises to continue working for a long time i love the color as well thank you for your product
this lovely neoprene case covers my computer with it 's hard case on it with no problem it gives the extra added protection that is expected like the faux fur lining and that it can be <unk> from either direction this protective sleeve has beauty and function does what i need it to do , so have no complaints
the product was not the same as in the description the color was correct , but this case did not have the extra zipper for charging as was stated in the description that said this is not a big deal for me i load my mac with the back toward the zipper side and get the same effect as for the positives , the neoprene is nice and thick providing great padding for my laptop the interior is a great faux fur it fits my # & # # ; macbook pro retina like a glove plus the last time that i looked at the cases direct from incase this one is a better price overall , i am happy with my purchase
you ca n't navigate buttons on side the case extends too far also the black on inside cover is running into the opposite side so it 's staining it black
this case is so well made and protective i 've gotten many compliments on how attractive it is but the inside edges block the right and left edges of the screen it makes it very difficult when there is a button in this area
this is a pretty case for the ipad mini but it does n't allow you to see the buttons on the ipad the case is too thick i love the case but they designed it all wrong for the ipad mini
it was a very cute case , and good quality but the cover went over the edges of the screen a little too much , made it difficult to hit some buttons on my screen i sent it back , cause i got too annoyed with it i did like the way it looked
i love the weight and quality of this product - i previously had this cover for my larger ipad i was delighted when i found it available for the mini however , when the mini was installed , the <unk> around the tablet obscured too much of the screen , rendering it <unk> sorely disappointed , but if i find this issue has been remedied i will order another
