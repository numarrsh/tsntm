this case took awhile to arrive compared to other orders i placed with amazon at the same time but luckily this was not a <unk> item for me only complaint is that an item should be in <unk> to ship if the website indicates as much
i have a # . # & # # ; laptop -lrb- lenovo yoga -rrb- at first this case seemed a little tight for my computer it does fit , but it needs to stretch a little i 'm hopeful that it will stretch out more with use there is n't really any extra room in the case ; it is just a sleeve overall it seems pretty sturdy
ca n't beat this item i use it for protecting my macbook air # & # # ; when i 'm walking to class fits nicely within my backpack and keeps the machine safe recommend to anyone
i ordered the black sleeve because the case i had was just a little too small for my laptop this sleeve ended up being a little too wide , but whatever ... it 's a sleeve it was giant though , and i left the foam in so my laptop was n't sliding around whenever it moved aside from it being quite large -lrb- i have a # & # # ; laptop -rrb- , it works fine and has n't given me a reason to hate it yet
i was expecting the material to be different and not as stiff but all in all this case works well for my macbook it 's a little big , but i can just fit more things in which i like too this is a good buy the shipping was very prompt and i 've experienced no problems thus far
this case is just what i need to put inside other cases or carry by itself it is not as thick as the case i bought a few years ago , but it works that 's why only # stars
perfect for my macbook pro i have the # inch one and i like this sleeve because it gives me some extra room to throw in the charger or a book without being so
i bought it for someone else so i do n't have personal experience with it in my opinion , it did n't seem heavy duty but that is n't an opinion based on usage
i 'm using this case with a # inch macbook air i 'm a little disappointed at how much extra room there is for the computer to move around i thought that it would be a closer fit because the title of the product specifically <unk> the macbook air however , it 's a very small complaint when considering the cost of the case if you want something to slip in your backpack to keep your computer a little more protected , i 'd buy it and that 's all i need from this case i 'm glad i did n't spend the $ # or so on an incase
the product is of really good quality , the <unk> is quite good -lrb- the material is soft , the zip seems nice and reliable -rrb- the product price is also quite decent and does n't make you feel too bad overall , i 'd buy the product again
for the money this is a very nice case however , if you 're looking for a <unk> snug fit , this is n't it the case is larger than a # & # # ; macbook pro , but just by a little it 's enough that it does n't feel quite right
i bought this to keep my mac from getting scratched on the table and something light and easy to tote around i do wish there was a pocket to keep my power cord , but it seems to fit in the main pocket overall , it is a good travel and carrying case , for the light use that i need it for i would say once a month i would travel with my lap top i would n't want to drop my lap top while it is in the case though
this fits my samsung chromebook quite well and i am happy with it over all i will say that the foam inserted into it to hold it 's shape is rather stiff and makes it feel cheap i have a belkin neoprene sleeve case for each of my kindles and they are much nicer as they do n't have a stiff foam in them i also have two incase brand neoprene sleeve cases for my other laptops and they too do not have the stiffness of this case the incase brand cases also have a softer material inside , much like fleece all that said , it works well and protects my computer from scratches as desired
bought it for my chrome book it works great i wish it had a pocket for the charger but it does the job well even though it feels bulky when you have the charger in it with the laptop
this sleeve came in much earlier than expected and with a light yet durable exterior and plenty of room for my # . # inch toshiba my only complaint is that the top of the sleeve is a little loose which can be a little annoying because it means that my laptop will around when in reality it should n't besides the looseness the sleeve in general is very good
very useful in keeping a laptop protected from dust , dirt and other foreign objects but would n't stop damage from a drop or fall however , it was n't advertised to do that so it deserves four stars as the quality is very good for the price i have always found case logic to have good quality items for the price
case is fine , good materials does not snuggly fit # inch macbook pro with retina display , there are gaps of space between the computer and the case still usable , and for $ # is fine , could n't find a better alternative
overall the case is pretty good except i would love to see a thicker foam in it that way if the computer is dropped on a hard way , greater shock <unk>
not much to say here , descent price , probably could be a couple dollars less , but this fit the asus # . # inch laptop we purchased it for very well and thats all i can ask for
this case is a sleek , nicely padded , elegant product , but it is not a good fit for the # macbook pro with retina display it is at least # inch too large in length and width which leaves the notebook sliding around inside the case what 's the point in purchasing a small , light , thin computer if the case is too big
i am using this case with a # macbook air # & # # ; it is an ok case for the air especially considering the price but would be better suited for a computer thicker and less wide it works but you can tell it is sized <unk> and not <unk> for the air as a plus the extra thickness is perfect for carrying a magazine or two pro 's : <unk> quality <unk> side pockets so it 's bulk is <unk> padding on the large flat sides without being too <unk> ` <unk> carrying <unk> narrow ends and bottom corners lack padding it 's a bit snug side to side for the macbook air # & # # ; and with the optional plastic snap on shell the width is quite tight yes , that extra # & # # ; in width makes a very noticeable difference case is too thick for the air , wasting space
i did not know the fit so i took a chance on the # inch it was a little small for one laptop and more than i needed for the other nothing wrong with product but i wish i could have seen one so i could figure the size but i learned a lesson i will trace my laptop on paper and take it into a store to size it up then i will purchase the correct size
i bought it to fit my # mac book pro and it is a very then padded case i use it to make sure my mac does n't get <unk> inside my backpack or luggage it works for
this case mentioned that it will fit until # . # but if your laptop is # . # this will be very tight ... any way the material is nice ... still a good
i love the design and the protection it is a little big for my # inch macbook pro retina display if it were just . # inches smaller it would be the perfect protective sleeve for the pro
this is a nicely made computer cover , but it is about # inch bigger than the mba in all dimensions ... including in thickness that makes it a bit sloppy it served its purpose , but really would like to find a snugger case
i got this case to protect my laptop as i started to drag it to and from school on a daily basis it is a nice , sturdy case and the perfect size for my # . # inch samsung laptop my only concern with this case is that you have to be careful when zipping the case around the corners of your laptop it does have a protective rim around the inside of the zip to keep the metal zip away from the laptop but , the first day i zipped it too quickly and scratched the corner of the laptop slightly :
seems to offer solid protection could be a little more form fitting but this is n't made specifically for that laptop only real negative is dust and dirt show so badly on this case
it is a little snug and it scares me sometimes i am a little ocd with scratches and such but , it protects my laptop in a sense i , also , put it inside a bag that makes me feel even more safe with it since the bag has padding and straps and handles it is nice to protect from dust and scratches but , not having a handle and more padding , i need more
my only problem has been scrolling when i scroll to see something it <unk> too far down or up , & cuts off <unk> am trying to see it is n't adjustable can it be remedied
i travel a lot and wanted extra <unk> for my new # & # # ; laptop this is exactly what i wanted to add an extra layer of protection and to carry it around when i 'm at remote locations it 's padded , it zips up , it fits
this case is not the greatest , but it gets the job done the material is like a stiff , hard foam , and should protect my computer from drops overall i am pleased about the fit of the case i went with this cheaper case since i already have a hard cover on my mac my # `` macbook with the hard cover fits perfectly in it
this case was just what i needed it fits my # inch macbook pro though there is a little wiggle room for it i thought it would be skin tight . it protects my mac from scratches and is easy to carry around it is not bulky so it fits perfectly in my bag i only wish it came in different designs
unfortunately , it is pretty tight on my asus g series notebook but it does -lrb- barely -rrb- fit it 's a good quality case that seems like it would offer some protection in the unlikely event that i drop my computer it seems to be pretty well built too and has n't shown any signs of wear even after having to squeeze my <unk> laptop in all the time i wish i could find a case that would fit my laptop properly but this does the job well
the gel filling provides protection without being over bearing i have a # & # # ; macbook pro and i had one of these for my # & # # ; macbook pro because it is accommodating similar sized laptops , the fit is not as snug , but i like the convenience for going through air port security checks
i use this sleeve in addition to a hard-case on my new -lrb- late # -rrb- # & # # ; macbook pro with retina there is plenty of room , even with the hard case if my computer did n't have the hard case , it would probably be swimming in the sleeve as it is , there is at least # -inch between the edge of the computer an the sleeve 's zipper
i would say that wind is a factor for damaging a laptop battery , so i bought the sleeve to protect it sleeve is inexpensive and does the job for that
the sleeve looks great and was very reasonably priced the color was very true to the photo on amazon the fit is very snug there are no pockets to hold anything on the inside or outside there are also no handles or straps for carrying
i really like this case i have a large swiss army style backpack but often i just need to take my macbook with me this sleeve is low profile yet offers good protection i was so pleased with it - it 's a great value compared to other products also - that i bought # additional case logic bags one just for my ipad or netbook and a large one that will hold my macbook and ipad or netbook for trips well done case logic construction seems sturdy and yet fairly lightweight
i bought two of this laptop sleeve but i had to return on because it only fit my hp pavilion # inch laptop i am sure it will fit all other hp # in laptops including the hp envy series it also fits a # -inch toshiba satellite laptop but if you are buying it for a dell , laptop , it wo n't fit so consider other sleeves it is not about case logic 's design this is about dell 's designs dell 's <unk> # <unk> laptops are as big as a # inch laptops i like the sleeve , i was only disappointed it did n't fit my dell laptop
nothing to outstanding in terms of design but a well put together simple case that fits well and adds very little to the overall weight of the laptop from a price perspective it is hard to fault , it just does it 's job nothing fancy but
we bought a pair of these to fit asus -lrb- q # <unk> # -rrb- # . # -inch laptops for our high school kids it fits very very snuggly around the laptop and is sometimes a bit hard to get zipped i guess that you want it to fit tightly though it is padded very well and should provide adequate protection for these new laptops in their book bags
this product was exactly what was said my macbook pro fits snuggly in this case the only disappoint is the case not being very soft compared to the ones that you get at the apple store , but that 's to be expected you get for what you pay
it 's not as snug as i would have wanted for the macbook air dimensions are perfect , and the chain is well padded to avoid contact with the laptop itself but kinda <unk> a little and feels <unk> it would be a snug fit for the retina display mbp , but not for the mba
i use this for a samsung series # ultrabook it is a little loose for a laptop that thin but does allow me to carry some other items like pads of paper or even the cord -lrb- though this might stretch it out a little -rrb-
if you carry a laptop in a backpack , most backpacks have enough padding that this case is not that important i just graduated and now carry a messenger bag , which has very little padding , so i am happy to have a bit of extra protection i only wish that the case had some means to store my power cord as well , but other than that , it is just
i needed an everyday sleeve to keep my macbook protected while i traveled the macbook fits into the sleeve however there is about an inch of space at the side and top of the case , making the macbook move around inside the case i do not see this being much of a problem , just do not expect this to be a tight fitting case protection seems to be good as the neoprene is about a # & # # ; thick
this is a great sleeve it protects from dust and even from accidents it is a bit big for the # . # in lap top but it is ok i have a # in sleeve as well for a different <unk> and in that case it fit roughly but still ok so , when buying consider also the volume so you can predict if it will be a bit big or small overall , great product and great sizes considering they are made to fit all computers general sizes
i like this case a lot because it fits like a glove and its not too bulgy , its also protective cause its spongy although it does feels a little
an outside pouch to keep power cord and pen might come in handy overall good product and material the case has form which is great to protect mac from getting scratches
the quality is fine , but the only issue with this product is that it 's a little bit loose for # . # & # # ; laptops but generally , it 's pretty good sleeve to protect your
its a good case , fits well it is slightly softer than i wanted , but cushioned enough i wish it had a pocket for all my papers , etc . however , it was a good price for what i got shipment was super fast
i was looking for a way to protect my laptop in my work tote bag without having to buy a new tote bag specifically for a laptop this fit the bill perfectly it fits my macbook pro snugly - but not too snugly - and is slim enough to carry in my bag without taking up too much room the sleeve feels sturdy and looks like it should last quite a while
i wanted a simple laptop case that would protect my laptop and that 's exactly what i got i might caution people with a larger laptop mine is # inches and it is a snug fit
well do n't get me wrong this case is good for anyone who wants a case that going to protect there new notebook i mean with such a great price its hard not go with this case great buy thank guys
used it for my surface ii i cut the styrofoam piece and stuck it in with the tablet for extra padding it 's slightly larger than it needs to be for the surface but i like that i do n't have to fight to get it in and out
this laptop protector is everything and more the only back draw is the foam material if it takes a direct hit does n't absorb much of the impact but for everyday use and carry it is everything i looked for and needed
have used for # months now and its helped protect my laptop on all my business trips , which happen every # weeks a plus is i can just pop this out of my bag without pulling my computer out at the tsa checkpoints
i wanted to get an inexpensive case for my <unk> chromebook the # . # wifi chromebook fits great in here -lrb- note : if you have an sd card or usb drive , it would need to be removed from the chromebook to fit in this case -rrb- i doubt that the case is fully waterproof , and it is certainly not a hard case , but for the price , this is a solid buy this case would protect against any light drops -lrb- the <unk> , <unk> inside foam padding is about # - to # -inch thick -rrb- and scratches it also has a solid construction and sturdy zipper ; the case appears to be very durable a small pocket on the inside or outside would have been a nice feature , but , if you want an inexpensive computer case for your small laptop , this case fits the bill
this sleeve fits my # . # & # # ; chromebook perfectly and seems well made and of good quality however , sleeve is just that - a sleeve no compartments for a charging cable , a notebook or writing utensils
i actually use this unzipped , inside my laptop bag in essence it offers a protective pocket and additional divider in my bag it is an effective inner sleeve that fits my # . # macbook pro wonderfully and works great for my purposes i have not used it as a main carrying sleeve or case on its own and can not speak to it for those purposes
it 's not sexy , no technical <unk> , just a nice , snug protective sleeve for my little notebook and thanks to it , my notebook does n't have any of the damage it would have had , had it been naked both times i <unk> and dropped it works just fine for me
bought it for hp dv # notebook # . # `` and it 's great just be sure to select the right size my only complaint is that the padding was surprisingly thin i have a high-end laptop and would rather it be safe the padding is about a few millimeters thick , but it 's of light-weight , foamy material i was thinking it had a hard-plastic exterior with foamy interior oh well , good buy <unk> and keeps dirt out
case logic fan here as they have been making quality products for years this has a nice feel to it and fits my laptop with a little room to spare -lrb- you can throw in a couple magazines , presentations , etc as well -rrb- the material is durable and does a good job protecting the laptop , especially the time i dropped it at the airport when pulling it out of my bag ... oops i recommend picking this up if you need a nice , durable case
the zipper closes smoothly , the color is true to the picture and my shipment came promptly the case is exactly as i expected it i only give # stars if i 'm absolutely blown away by a product , and this is sufficient
i bought this sleeve for an hp pavilion dm # us it is just <unk> , one must be careful if one leaves the little dongle for a wireless mouse etc . in a usb port it has simple minimalist styling and seems well made and offers good protection - good zipper and <unk> firm foam there might be room enough for two sheets of paper plus the notebook , nothing else ; and being a ` sleeve ' , no handles or outside pockets you have to make separate provision for your charger or whatever if you are considering this type of protection you should consider whether you really would be better served by a case that although <unk> has provision for your extra bits if a sleeve is really what you want this is a perfectly good one and attractive
feels kinda cheaply made , but it gets the job done fits my # . # inch case with almost a inch to spare length wise there is no fuzzy inside like my last one though this one is thick enough fits into my backpack laptop sleeve no problem
i have a # & # # ; # macbook pro that fits in the spacious sleeve with about an inch to spare otherwise it serves as a fantastic carrier of said laptop and a notebook and at this price it 's hard to complain about the fit too much
i bought this for my # ' macbook pro without retina display and was satisfied - seems very <unk> seems as if it would provide good impact resistance in case of a drop , but i really do n't want to test <unk> works <unk> - a little loose on my <unk> few indents in the foam -lrb- could be from anything from production to shipping etc . . so it could be a little better , but for fifteen dollars i would buy it again
this appears to be a really nice , budget sleeve for protecting a laptop , but it does not fit the asus g # vw rog laptops the <unk> fan is too bulky and you will not be able to close the zipper it 's a great product for smaller laptops , just wanted to let you know i did n't want to be one of those reviewers who reviews a good product poorly just because it did n't suit my needs for my # `` laptop
we have other case logic products and this one is just as good as the others quality material , stitching , zippers , etc . padding just the right amount for the small # . # netbook it was designed and used for so far it has worked well and has protected it while traveling
this is n't first of my owned case logic product the case logic provide best quality for their items and this one is n't exception i think , that it can fit all # -inch laptops and
it came in the mail a day early , i was very surprised and happy as well the material is lightweight which made my day if i carry it in this case it will feel the same as if there was no case on it i am very happy for what a recieved thanks case logic
fits my dell pro # & # # ; tablet wonderfully and is very protective easy to get in and out and i can leave the keyboard on too great buy and well
excellent fit and good construction this is the second cover i have purchased and both worked great the sleeve is a little loose for my macbook pro , but leaves just the right amount of room for the charging cables another wonderful amazon transaction
after i got this , i realized i needed room to put some accessories like my power cord and external hard drive i found out that i could easily fit those items and a couple more in my logic case the only thing i wish the case had was a handle it 's hard to hold onto with one hand , and a handle or strap would make it a lot easier
i decided to purchase this sleeve for my # . # `` asus notebook as i plan on using it while i travel for business my notebook is exactly # . # `` x # . # `` x # . # `` -lrb- width , depth , height -rrb- fits like a glove you will need to carry your accessories -lrb- mouse , power adapter -rrb- separately as they will not fit in this sleeve -lrb- i suppose you could jam them in there , but you will probably scratch your notebook -rrb- you should be able to slip a usb drive next to your notebook
this was a very good acquisition for my lap top . it is very tight and protects the laptop it has a & # # ; little hard foam & # # ; , protects very well i can put my laptop on my backpack without problem
loving this case it 's durable and it <unk> itself -lrb- i happen to place a heavy object on it and was worried the dents would n't go away , they did ! it fits perfectly in my ibex # inch notebook backpack , too
dont know what else i would do if i didnt have this . i run around all day and this case protects my wonderful netbook thank you case logic for being practical and
it fit every requirement it is light , safe for my laptop , look cool also it 's not expensive if you already spend # dollars in laptop , why do n't you spend # dollars on a good case
i wasnt expecting much but this case definitely gets the job done shipped quick and really good quality for the price . the case itself is about a centimeter thick and feels like a dried up
this netbook sleeve was a perfect fit for my hp # inch netbook i had terrible trouble locating a suitable product here in australia and was thrilled to find this on amazon it is well made , sturdy and perfect to slip into my handbag
quality of sleeve is excellent bought for college son and thoroughly likes it can travel to class with it without fear of damage case logic products are very good have bought before and will buy again bought with case logic laptop carrying case amazon , you rock
the case fits my acer chrome book perfectly it also looks nice and has enough padding to protect my little computer quick delivery and low price what 's not to like
very good quality sleeve has enough padding to protect laptop and is made of very good quality material i expect to get a lot of use from this case does not take up extra space in my briefcase with laptop i use it all of the time
this is for my new laptop so that i can hopefully prevent extra scratches in its transportation it 's lightweight , but definitely does the job i intended for it plus you have a little room to throw some paperwork in with the laptop the only real con is that i 'm not sure i would put a charger in here too though
i just bought this case and it was a great price for me , considering a case with equal <unk> would cost me $ # at best buy or so the case seems very protective the material does not leave you worrying whether your computer will be safe when it 's put in a backpack or held in your arms plus , it is comfortable when you 're holding it unfortunately there is n't a handle so you 're gon na have to hold it like you would a book , but that really is n't a problem it arrived earlier than expected , so i 'm happy about that too overall , i would recommend this :
this case fits my # `` macbook air perfectly just the right thickness , not too tight , not too loose a great additional layer of protection inside my laptop bag perfect ! !
i really love the minimalist design it seems to be waterproof -lrb- so far -rrb- the padding is adequate , it 's enough for it to be safe from bumps or scratches but not bulky i love it
i got this because i got a case for my thumb drive by this brand and it was pretty neat this one lived up to that , the colour is just as <unk> or even better , a rich bright red , fits my my mac # . # inch perfectly and is well cushioned only set back is that you ca n't really put a charger in it comfortably but there are other designs for that
i needed a very slim protective case for my laptop which just barely fits in a <unk> on my motorcycle this bag was just the ticket perfect for my needs
this protects my mac , and it fits snugly , so it does n't move around inside the protective cover it is professional looking , and easy to toss into my bag when i go home
i love this product it is lightweight , the perfect size , and easy to use it also looks professional , and is easy to slip into another go bag you have i saw a friend had one , and i needed to have it . :
i purchased this case for my new dell inspiron # based on the product dimensions from amazon 's description , i was n't surprised when the case was just a touch too big front to back side to side it fits great , front to back there is about # & # # ; of space for the money , i would recommend it
used this as a replacement for the <unk> bag i was <unk> my laptop in definitely way better and protects my laptop i have a middle compartment in my tool bag that this sits in and works perfectly
the quality on this product is great i have bought many other case logic products before , and this one was just as good as all o the ones before it after receiving my macbook air for my birthday , i searched for something that would suit my needs first , it had to be well made i give this product a # stars for that second , it had to be portable this also exceeded my requirements i think that you should buy this product it was great stylish , well built , and overall made me want to buy more of their products
this case fits perfect for my new samsung chrome notebook it is padded for protection the nice thing about traveling , you can leave it in its case when going through security at the airport
this sleeve works great and helps keep my laptop protected its great since i commute via subway in nyc and the occasional bumps and pushes cant be avoided during rush hour this sleeves helps me have an extra peace of mind that my laptop is fine
i just bought my mac book and wanted to keep it looking as fabulous as when i first bought it saw this and ordered it -- exactly what i thought it would be great color pink , case is shaped so it wo n't loose form over time , and is thick enough to protect my precious laptop
