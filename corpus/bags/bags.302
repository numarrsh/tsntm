we 're a timbuk # loving family our favorite bag by far is the timbuk # command laptop messenger bag that bag is a great bag it 's not it 's just shiny black canvas with a timbuk # label no padding , no form to it , no frills , little to no reinforcement at connections which makes me question its longevity this would be worth it if it were # dollars or so at the current price , it 's definitely not worth it
i kind of wish i had <unk> a medium because it 's a bit too small for me , but the quality is fantastic it is comfortable to carry and has plenty of pockets to hold things the computer sleeve is small when i leave my laptop cover on , but will still go in snug
i bought this bag a month ago and so far it is holding up the big down side of it is that there is no support , and it tends to be very uncomfortable if there are any not flat object in it , for instance a bike lock , or a water bottle i like the adjustable strap a lot , it 's really great for quick access to the items inside
this is a no-frills messenger bag it has two large pockets and one very small zippered pocket it is lightweight and durable it has no real form to it and the large pockets are not padded and do not have zippers i have a bunch of messenger bags and do n't like this one any more or any less than the others i do n't understand why it costs so much perhaps the brand name
this bag is easy to use for a <unk> like me i can find my things in it and i can fit a whole lot of things in it if i am caught in a downpour or if by chance they turn on the water jets while i am in the park , it stays dry inside , which is a feature i unfortunately need the wide shoulder strap is great for a klutz as is the easy <unk> for strap length it also balances well through life 's twists and turns great for a <unk> individual , like me trouble is , i have to write this review before the item has had to endure a month of my heavy usage we shall see i wonder if it can stand a whirl in the washing machine ; i am guessing not
yes , it 's a low priced timbuk # model and for what it is i really love it just what i was looking for carries a # inch macbook pro in a sleeve with no issues i just really wish it had a carrying handle on the <unk>
she loves it she loves the size and the color and just the entire thing in general and i 'm glad the quality seems to be pretty damn good timbuk # makes good products so i expect this to last a while the bag is n't very big but it 's big enough to fit a travel mug , her macbook and a couple of notebooks
i bought this bag for my son my boy 's height is about # cm , so this bag is just the right size -lrb- <unk> -rrb- for him it has a <unk> cam buckle on the shoulder strap to eliminates the need for daily fit adjustments i have been using a crumpler messenger bag myself but this is the first time i bought a timbuk # bag and i must say it is very well made and just as good as a crumpler
just received this product and really like it i travel with my # `` laptop and this bag affords me room behind the main part of the bag for a safe place to store the laptop truthfully , i could take my # `` laptop in this bag too because laptop space is large enough to accommodate it meanwhile the larger section of the bag is good for my kindle , paper notebooks , presentation folders etc . or that larger space can be used to hold a sweater or a lightweight jacket in addition to any other stuff that i need when on the road i like the zipper compartment with the strap and snap hook for keys plus there are pockets for pens , phones of any type etc . i always carry extra contacts and glasses and there is enough space to hold them too nice padded shoulder strap i 've already tossed the bag that i previously used for this purpose as this timbuktu bag is lightweight and has more functionality
i 'd call this the minimalist of courier bags , and i owe a few light weight with no extra padding a simple <unk> sleeve with a few extra pockets for organizing no hardware on the front , the cover is held in place by hook and loop pads simple shoulder strap with the buckle at one end that timbuk # is know for , plastic instead of metal to save on weight should be more waterproof than say the <unk> bags since the strap does not <unk> water into the bag
i give talks and <unk> where all i need is my laptop , a few notebooks , and some stationary supplies and small electronic devices this is exactly what i needed its durable , snug , and most important , incredibly comfortable
i like this bag a lot , it 's very comfortable and useful i carry my backpack to and from work -lrb- # minutes -rrb- every day and i do n't get back aches but it looks like a slightly <unk> version of a little girl 's bag the first day i wore it around nyc , two people -lrb- two people -rrb- thought i was a tourist , which is more people than said that in the prior # years
i am on the shorter side -lrb- # ' # & # # ; -rrb- and often find backpacks hit my butt this one does not it stays tight to my back so i do n't have to hunch over to keep from toppling backwards it is slender , and only fits a binder , and one textbook , but that 's what i was looking for i could not be happier this is a fantastic bag
big enough to carry all my things -lrb- my laptop , sometimes my work laptop , a notebook or two , a snack bar , a drink -rrb- but i was n't expecting the benefit of having to think about what i put in it due to size <unk> do i really need a bottle of hand <unk> another two notebooks just in case my laptop 's power bricks it makes you think and it carries them beautifully , and is lightweight i love this bag
this backpack is perfect i am a college student who <unk> to school and this pack holds everything i need for the day and the ride the pockets are roomy and have a spot for my laptop and my tablet the phone pocket is great as well , it is easy to reach while wearing the backpack
i was looking for a minimal backpack to put my laptop in and a few cables and then be able to <unk> on my bike this back works perfectly , its not too bulky and yet still has plenty of room to put a # pack in it
junk , its just a very large plastic bag i have it in my school bag just in case i 'm caught in the rain with my cpu the problem is if you fold it it leaves creases that causes weak points , which eventually the product will fail do n't want my # k mac get wet so just like in undergrad , & # # ; you got ta double bag it & # #
the seal on my sleeve finally gave today the inner seal seemed to rip from one side without detaching properly i purchased this item on may # th so it lasted approximately six months i really appreciated the waterproofing of the sleeve during <unk> rainy summer weather as i walk to school daily it provides security of knowing you have something protecting your laptop inside your backpack i did fold mine so it would fit better and the product listing does warn that seals will wear out so i plan on purchasing another there are no other waterproofing sleeve for laptops other than the ones involving diving equipment all of the others are either & # # ; water resistant & # # ; or are waterproof messenger bags if anyone finds a better option , please let me know
i walk around campus a lot and when it rains i always worry about my laptop after all my belongings were completely soaked a few months ago i bought this to keep my new laptop safe its a great product which fits my # inch macbook pro with case perfectly i 'm contemplating ordering some more to keep my important <unk> in as well
i used this for my # & # # ; macbook air , but i put the the laptop and the case inside it i went on an # mile motorcycle trip from san <unk> to the arctic circle and back , and it worked flawlessly
i check to make sure i had the right model , and it does n't fit after we went on vacation and got back it was too late to return it now i 'm out the money for a cover that does n't fit
the cover came with a small crack and some scratches , even though the packaging was professionally done unfortunately the keyboard cover does n't fit my keyboard since i have the italian version and the key shape is different anyway the hard case is very nice looking and working very fine it also provides a step in the back of the laptop i always use surely it would have been best if i had the chance to use the keyboard cover , but i had to fly back to italy in a few days and had no chance to change it
i just got a retina , and was looking hard for a case at the moment , spec , mcover and kuzy are the only ones with cases . mcover the only one in orange spec has only # colors , so nope , not <unk> does not protect the corners . . mcover looked great , but it is the <unk> in the details the top lid has # dots that act as feet to keep from scratching the top <unk> they just look bad and i would rather run the risk of scratching the case but the big issue is at the wrist pads are tabs that hold the case in place they are big , and the dig into my wrists . yes , i know i should be typing without resting my hands but i am not and after and hour i have indents on the wrist and the tabs are sharp doing any sort of <unk> gives you a nice scrape i really wanted this case to work , features and color and price were right on but <unk> i think the case is going back
for the price i was a bit worried . turns out , i really like it it 's not flawless like the apple product you put it there , but it fits well , holds well , looks real good if your not too picky i 'm less thrilled with the extra thickness of the bottom panel due to the folding feet which i have never used so if your trying to maximize slimness for travel , maybe those extra millimeters will annoy you i may buy another color for me and one for an <unk> friend
i got this case for my first ever mac and it works great it snaps on easily and stays on nicely it 's a great color and the little feet on the bottom half were a great part , keeping it titled just right for typing
protects my macbook pro # & # # ; with retina does n't hinder any sort of movement for my laptop at all the free keyboard cover takes some getting used to , but overall a very nice case
cover fits perfectly snug as could be on the backside of the screen the bottom of the case fits well side to side but does allow for some movement , probably for ventilation as it fits perfectly side to side purchased the orange case , and it looks just as cool in person as the picture good buy for your mbpr
fits feb. # & # # ; mbp with retina display like a glove bought for # year old <unk> # st computer , hesitant to cover up beauty of the silver cover ... but he loves the bright , translucent orange color the apple glows orange ! ! pop-up legs in bottom of cover used every day for # weeks without a problem no scratches on cover so far and he also really likes the included keyboard cover makes mom feel a bit better with some protection on that expensive keyboard : - -rrb- quick shipping , packaged well also bought green cover for the twin brother , he loves the green definitely a great purchase , very good value for the price would not hesitate to buy another
from looking at these reviews i can only assume i was shipped the wrong item bought this as a gift for my daughters # & # # ; mac with retina display and it does not fit at all way too small
i love to accessorize my items the case fits snugly over my macbook but the finger prints that show makes it look like someone with super oily fingers touched my case and <unk> it for life # / # - i wanted to provide an update after having this case for a year let me be clear that my macbook is my baby and is protected as such although the case has protected the laptop , it has cracked all over with pieces near the corner chipping away some of the cracks have spread like a cracked car windshield after use my laptop is put away securely in a cabinet so it 's not like it 's left out in the open and subject to fallen items or any kind of bumps / bruises i 'm in the market for a new case but i do n't think i will purchase this brand again
the shade of pink is awesome the key board cover was a bonus with the order , and <unk> well on the keys i am glad i got this particular cover
it 's a decent quality case i would have given it # stars but it came with a small star shaped crack does n't hurt the functionality so i did n't take the time to exchange it i would buy another , , , the pink is a very nice color
the case is perfect for the new mac laptop i especially love the feet to keep the laptop cool the only issue with these new laptops is that the spacing around the keyboard is smaller than the old mac laptops -lrb- without retina display -rrb- , so it does n't really fit the keyboard cover was free , so no harm done
this fits the macbook pro with retina display perfectly love the color and price wise i ca n't complain either bought a different brand last time and the case did n't fit very well and cracked in several places within weeks and i treat my stuff well this case is great , i can only recommend it i had this for several weeks now and it is still in perfect condition great color -lrb- i got pink -rrb- , great fit i would absolutely recommend it
this case fits perfectly on my # `` macbook pro with retina display it snapped on very easily i love the color , though it is a hotter , warmer shade of pink than the picture the rubber feet work well enough i like the built-in foldable feet they are convenient when working at a desk i very strongly recommend this product
sent it quick , love the little feet its a really nice color , its a little off from the image but i like the colors even more then what the image looks like , and i love the pearl sheen to it
this was as very nice retro looking backpack however , i 'm returning because it just does n't have the small pockets and pouches that i need zippers looked very strong and it seems to have been made well i just could n't use a pack that is mainly just two large compartments
very sleek design and high quality <unk> you like a ton of pockets this is n't the right backpack for you but if you 're looking for a minimalist design i highly recommend
this is probably the coolest laptop bag / backpack i have ever purchased not only does it look cool , it feels cool , it also fits comfortably on the back when fully loaded it fits everything i need for my laptop , with enough room left over for a textbook and a couple notebooks and room in the front pocket for an extra cable or other small accessories i find it to be most useful as an overnight pack , there being adequate room for clothing and supplies for a short trip the rigid body of the pack helps to keep your bag looking crisp as well as providing ample protection for your laptop and other breakable items contained within overall , unlike the <unk> of my review , owning this bag just makes sense it looks cool , stores what you need , and fits comfortably
i wanted a compact pack to replace a computer bag i wanted one that was trim line and carried my # & # # ; macbook pro , ipad , limited accessories and papers the mamba meets the need the water resistance works i would like to mention how great the amazon logistics process works delivery as promised every time i recommend the mamba and getting it from amazon
this is the perfect bag for the essentials my mac book is well protected , and looks clean and organized i was trying to find a bag with sturdy protection without zippers and compartments all over the exterior of the bag ; a minimalist look if you will the bag came in on time and in great packaging the bar code idea is great , but that means you have to put a little faith in society for it to work properly i carry this bag everyday and is perfect for my lifestyle very sturdy with high quality fabric , stitching and webbing and zippers my # dollars was invested well
travelled with the bag for the first time this week and the design made my life a lot easier going through airports very easy to lift out the computer and lots of pockets for storage i 'm very pleased with this purchase
this is n't the best bag out there but i like it so far fits all of my stuff but it is actually pretty small the only thing i really do n't like about the bag is that it is really stiff but it is nice quality and i really like the material i have the matching laptop sleave for my # & # # ; macbook pro retina the laptop has a speck shield on it , and fits in the sleave , and still fits in the laptop slot in the bag nicely all in all , i really like it
i ordered this for my new air it came # days early which was a great surprise it fits well , i have no complaints as of now it is very plain , nothing too fancy i kind of wish i bought a case that gave more personality to my laptop , but the protection this seems to provide is good for now feel free to get one , it wo n't hurt
i just purchased the macbook air # & # # ; to be used when traveling i 'm <unk> the old ipad i do n't like the exterior surface of the air it 's like that <unk> sensation i also wanted a little protection . for the air as well as prevention of scratching the surface i did extensive internet & amazon searching before i tried the stm it 's a perfect fit , gives plenty of protection without adding much weight , and i like the firm grip - without the scratching sensation only downside is hiding the logo but that may be a good thing too
overall , i really like this case i 'd recommend it it seals nice and tight , and protects the laptop but , there are some issues ... pros excellent <unk> <unk> case scrapes laptop metal when opened past # extra weight on top display can cause laptop to close shut with extra
i 've had this case on my mid- # macbook air for a few months now i liked the added grip provided by the ribbed surface versus a smooth surface it fits fine , and has n't popped off or broken i 'd buy it again without hesitation
great protection without adding bulk to my macbook air very easy to install and i do n't hesitate to shove my macbook into my messenger bag anymore -- i know it 's well protected
i took a long time deciding which case to get for my # `` macbook air i have the late # version this case is amazing -- very easy to put on , very protective it does not interfere with the screen angle at all , which was my main concern looking for a case the case is very sturdy the only possible negative is that my macbook does feel a bit heavier now , but it 's definitely worth it for the protection
just what i was looking for keeps my mac air protected and still thin & light the inside liner was and extra awesome touch ca n't go wrong with this great design sidenote : this case does cover the apple logo on the outside , if that 's something that is bothersome , you may want to keep it in mind but if you do n't care to show off the logo , this case is a great way to go
have purchased two of these despite some reviews , this case does fit very tight and may be a little difficult to get off however , it would rather have it fir tight than to keep falling off offers great protection
the case does not fit a galaxy tab # # . # like it says it does the case kept popping off it is a cute pattern but useless as a cover
i really liked this case when i got it then when i tried to take a picture outward there is no hole for the camera i will be returning this case tomorrow
i like the fact it covers the tab , but it does not secure the tab in place it falls out of the case and i do n't like it for that reason i feel i wasted my money on something that not satisfy me
this is a very cute case my daughter was very excited to get it for her tablet unfortunately , the fit is loose and the tablet moves around some not a snug fit feels as if the tablet could drop out of the case maybe adding a velcro sticker or something to help the tablet stay in place
just received this case today so far i love it , it looks and feels well made love , love , love the cheetah print fits my samsung galaxy tab perfect over all very happy with purchase , price not bad either
shipping was fast i really love the case it 's perfect size too meaning it does n't make the tablet really bulky or heavy still very light weight like the pen holder as well has a lil markings on the side black part of the case but not that big of a deal overall great case that 's very stylish :
this ipad cover is very colorful and stylish i like it a lot i do prefer having # that i can stand in an angle and watch sideways though . it does the job and protects your
bought this case to use when i travel it is perfect at the airport while i am waiting for my flight very <unk> and stylish ca n't beat the price too ! see this item at department stores for almost triple the price
this is a good looking case with a rubberized feel but it shows grease from finger prints easily but the bigger problem is after only a few weeks the bottom case is cracking
i really love this cover the red is awesome and i love how the rubberized outside makes it easy to grip let 's face it , apple just looks good in red the problem is that after six months it has started to crack around the edges and has even got a chunk out on one corner all the cracks are in the bottom and not the top i thought it might have been caused from carrying it around in my laptop backpack but i always put it in , in the same direction so it should not have cracked at both ends when it gets too bad , i will order another one not sure if i will order the same exact one but will definitely get one similar without the cracks it would have gotten # stars
i love my new case . . this was deff an awesome cover . it looks great . . feels great -lrb- very high quality material -rrb- and the best party is this case does not cover the apple symbol
not what i expected much larger that i expected not well described on the website and there was no way to get a hold of them with my questions i think there should always b a way to get a hold of the seller
i have been looking for a medium sized bag to hold my phone , keys , <unk> , lighter , and plethora of other miscellaneous objects i end up with when i go out this bag was what i could find that i could determine would meet my needs i wanted leather , and this is leather it is roomy , and has a pocket for your phone -lrb- although it is not too snug for the new iphone # -rrb- and two holders for pens it is roomy as well overall , it is a nice bag the only complaint i have is the top zipper it is sometimes difficult to unzip because of the cloth area on both sides of the zipper pushes it outwards and up , which interferes with ease of the huge <unk> of the zipper being able to freely unzip for such a small bag , a zipper with smaller <unk> would have been more aesthetically pleasing , and may also make for easier unzipping outside of this , the leather is shiny and the bag is certainly stylish enough
the size is perfect for my needs and fits a # / # & # # ; x # & # # ; sketch pad , ipad , large wallet , change purse , phone . pen & pencil inside a zippered compartment holds all the <unk> needs a guy can have or need i use this every day and i only wish that the outer pocket and <unk> outer pocket had zippered enclosures i 'm always a little worried that my heavy # / # & # # ; x # / # & # # ; wallet , or smaller heavy change purse can fall out if the bag tips over i would also like more internal pockets to hold my business card holder would also like a ring of some <unk> to clip a spare set of keys to
i bought this bag as a gift for my husband to carry our small camera and accessories as well as his kindle the item arrived quickly it is very attractive and perfect for this purpose my husband loves it the only reason i did n't give it # stars is that , especially when it arrived , it had a <unk> odor similar to that of cat <unk> fortunately , the smell has worn off i would suggest letting it air out a bit
excellent made product . easy to transport the small stuff during trips = = helps in airport security inspections . convenient to extract items when before i was dragging a thick wallet out of too small of pockets many thanks . : -rrb- -rrb- : -rrb- -rrb- <unk>
exactly as advertised good quality leather and just the right size for my needs the top zipped opening is great and the side pockets are perfect for items one does n't want to lose track of
i purchased this product and when i received it i found that it will not fit on my # inch screen it is just a little too small but just enough not to fit
i ordered this case hoping it would fit my computer because i have a macbook pro # inch retina display but when i got it in the mail today it did n't fit my computer
it does n't fit the macbook # inch it 's close but it 's not enough to match up and fit the computer you 're better off going to the store to make sure it can actually
the case did n't fit my # `` macbook pro when it arrived it seemed about # `` too short , so i do n't think that i ordered the wrong size , it was just poorly crafted , i guess very frustrating , it looks like # others have had this problem as well , which is a shame because the product design and marketing is great
i felt this item to be bad because i ordered it in # inches and it did not fit my computer at all the case did not fit but the silicone keyboard cover did
it didnt fit my macbook pro like it said , and i havent gotten my money back and i returned it with in a week of <unk> i am a very unsatisfied customer
this cover does not fit the macbook # `` pro as advertised the keyboard cover is so cheap and thin plastic , it rips in half taking it out of plastic package when you return the product , they do not return your money someone from the company calls your home and <unk> you asking you to remove your truthful feedback from the amazon website
i was excited to receive this until i i tried to put the cover on and it did not fit my # inch macbook the keyboard cover is nice , but i wanted the whole cover so i wasted $ # on this because the case is pretty much useless
i ordered this and i have a # & # # ; mac pro does not fit i did not get the keyboard cover too i tried to return it but i would have to pay to ship this item back not worth it took the loss and will never order again ! ! disappointed with what i recieved the quality was ok but not all that
this did not fit the size it of mac laptop as stated it also had a grease stain on it that made the color of the protective case non existent in some areas was n't happy
did n't receive the product when i was suppose to , contact with smacktom was required i was then told it got lost in transit and would receive a new one in a few days this <unk> turned into another week and when i did finally receive it , it did n't fit the quality seemed good of the product itself but i ca n't use it for my macbook pro # & # # ; , too small
would have been fine , came on time , color was as described , but was the wrong size i ordered a # inch cover . the billing statement noted that it should be the # inch , but in fact was # inch i did n't realize it until i opened the package , so now ca n't send it back and am stuck with a cover that is # inches too big
the item did n't fit to my macbook , i did n't make any attempt to return it because it had a protective case that i installed first , so the combo was <unk> the quality was alright and the price was good the delivery was sooner than expected
smacktom has great customer service but this product leaves a lot to be desired it is nice to think you have protected your computer but the keyboard skin makes it hard to type -lrb- tolerable if it really protects it in the long run -rrb- the hard case skin has edges that scratch your arm as you type or use the track pad -lrb- we will see how long that is tolerable -rrb- the screen protector does n't fit the full screen it is designed just to cover the image area so that leaves the outer # inch of glass unprotected and creates an edge to catch dust -lrb- unacceptable so it will not be used -rrb- this is my first experience with these items and i have only had them for a short time so this is my first impression hope this helps you make a decision
there were some areas where i did n't like the product the keyboard skin is perfect except for one thing the power button is replaced with a eject button the screen protector is great but after you applied it onto the screen there are a lot of bubbles it takes some time to get rid of . the hard case fit the laptop perfectly
two other colleagues of mine purchased the same thing and we all like the product except for the keyboard cover the cover is sticking out on the sides of the buttons and makes it harder for typing i also had another issue when i put on the screen protector , i tried to peel off the tab at the end and it was so hardly stuck that it left a glue mark on it
perfectly fits and protects my macbook retina # `` google ` tiffany blue ' for a more accurate color <unk> the actual color is not as matte looking but i 'm still quite happy with it keyboard cover is great , too wish i did n't spend an extra few bucks on getting a separate one from another seller arrived quite quickly as well , happy with my purchase and will order from smack tom again
works well , has saved my macbook pro from many dings just not as well as i need , though i realize i am rougher on my laptop more than most as i have been through two <unk> cases in a year dirt sticks to the keypad protector and has lost it 's color
i 'm surprised at the negative reviews for this product i have the # `` retina macbook pro and it fits perfectly i 'm not a fan of the keyboard skins , they make typing feel spongy and this one is no exception i do n't use it i have another # `` macbook pro with a speck case and the quality on this smacktom one is comparable
the case fits well , the keyboard pad fits well , and the screen protector is the correct size too had only one minor issue since the macbook retina does not have a cd drive , the button on the top right is replaced with the power button rather than the cd drive button this keyboard pad has the cd drive button instead of the power button so clearly it was n't meant for the retina display macbook other than that , everything else was perfect
i love this product super pretty teal blue that my husband does n't even mind using i use the keyboard protector and the screen protector and both work great do n't use the case though because we already have one the case is a lighter , more transparent color and i do n't really care for it great product overall and very fast shipping
great hard case for macbook pro # inch retina display protects it very well from scratches and scuffs dont know how well it does against drops and falls but i dont want to find
overall quality is good i find them to be thick enough to do their job two for the price of less than one with most comparable products is a bonus but as others have said , they do have an odor not sure if i 'll be able to get rid of the smell or not have them airing out in the garage for over a week now if i ca n't get the smell out , not sure how useful they 'll be to me time will tell
i received it on the expected date it came with two turquoise sleeves and a cleaning cloth the sleeves were a lot thinner than i thought they would be i guess im used to my thick incase case so this seems a little thin the color is definitely pretty but if you want good protection i do n't recommend this . overall i am satisfied with the products
like a couple reviewers mentioned , they do smell kind of funny i do n't really mind though it 's faded in the couple weeks that i have been using mine i gave the other one to my friend and she washed it in the washer and it did not fade , however they are nicely constructed they provide light padding for when i have my laptop in my purse i like not having to mess with a zipper definitely worth the money
this product does the job for carrying my macbook around however , the stitching on the product is lacking , and i was expecting the sleeve to have some sort of velcro closure rather than the sleeve to just overlap the cleaning cloth works really well though
i use this item to hold my laptop it fits good and the color is so fun and bright enough so when i misplace my computer i can always find
when i first received this messenger bag i was pleased with the looks and the quality of the leather but then after a short while the shoulder strap metal clips started coming undone and kept breaking leaving sharp edges of course that happened right after the time frame of the return period was expired
i purchased this for my son the leather had a loud smell and after only carrying it a few times with just his laptop in it , the strap pulled loose the screws on the hinge that keeps the strap on do not really go through the leather , they just go to the leather and not through it
bag is well made , but color as received was much lighter than pictured and the logo much more prominent in contrast the case had more of a woman 's handbag look exchanged for a different type of bag
this leather is such a high quality it looks , feels , and smells good there are not a lot of inside pockets , but it is a good brief case enough room for my # `` laptop , my ipad , and my cell phone i have gotten a lot of compliments on it totally worth the money update : i have to return it i love it , but it has to go back the clasp , which is the most used part of the bag just fell off of the back . it came unstitched with little use be careful when buying
i purchased this bag for my husband he was interested in a <unk> looking bag this bag is a great size , looks sharp and seems to be good quality i am very pleased given the price point of similar bags
