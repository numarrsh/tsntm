provides just enough protection for the computer without being too <unk> in a backpack for traveling very easily the product is put together well with the seams and velcro but the string to wrap around the button came off quickly all in all though , great product
i was unable to get my # . # notebook all the way in which is such a shame i would love it if i can find this in a slightly larger size
i ordered this case for my daughters new computer it was too small so , instead of returning it i have found another use for it : -rrb- the color is just beautiful i should have read the dimensions more closely if they make a larger size , i surely purchase another for the price
i did not receive the stripped <unk> <unk> crystal case i ordered i received an all black plastic case it was not what i waited for or expected i want to return this <unk> did not receive any paperwork to return this product
the case is pretty , but it cracked shortly after i got it , and i carry it in a protective case i do n't think it is high quality i would n't recommend it
i love this item it is my favorite part of my mac book pro i love the way it makes the pc look and it make me feel like the pc is worth a million bucks it is one of my favorite amazon ordered items
aesthetically pleasing but not functional for an # -in macbook air i could hardly squeeze my computer in and out the padding is minimal , so i would not trust using this cover for protection when on the go
holds incredibly well i will say if you use it for and air macbook - which i do , and you drop it on the <unk> even on carpet , it will not protect it i just wish it offered better protection which is why i purchased it
fits my new macbook air well without adding to much bulk i now wish it had a flap to cover the back of the laptop against spills and light rain i walk with my laptop under my arm and if there is rain with wind water may reach the back of it -lrb- where its actually wide open -rrb- and cause damage i guess it is meant to be put inside a briefcase overall i do not think its worth $ # i would not buy it again
this is a great cover for your macbook air it does not add a whole lot of bulk to your air when carrying it also it provide a lot of protection for it the only draw back i can see is that the elastic might stretch out over time making the case useless -lrb- the elastic is used to hold the air in the case -rrb-
this a very nice sleeve for the macbook air # & # # ; unlike some neoprene covers it does n't have a bad odor provides extra protection for my laptop when going through airport security
i just need it to place into my bag , so it does n't get all scratched up the cover is snug and you do n't really need to use the elastic part either i 've turned it around and tried to let the air fall out it 's snug alright also , i 've been using it for the past # months and i have a decal on my air the decal is still there
i really like this sleeve however i had a hard case on my macbook air and it was too big to fit in the sleeve , it did work once i took the bottom of the case off also after only a couple weeks of use , it had smudges and finger marks on the case but that does n't really bother me overall i like that it 's thin and i feel like it offers good protection , i also like the elastic band that goes around it definitely the best sleeve that i have found so far , but i do think $ # was a bit expensive
sleeve is obviously well thought out it protects well against normal bumps and scratches and is very easy to carry the macbook air # & # # ; around one handed in but do n't expect it to be an otterbox if you drop it would be nice too if it gave a little <unk> on the sides so little usb bluetooth dongle could say attached to the macbook without taking it off each time
the sleeve is lovely to look at and well assembled , things not to be taken for granted because it is designed to be such a close fit , it 's not surprising that the protection it offers is limited i 'm ok with that since i put this in my briefcase which offers more protection but i must say i 'm surprised at the work involved in getting this case to allow easy access to the mba as someone who worked with leather for many years , i 'm used to the notion of needing to break in a sleeve like this the process is pretty straightforward and with some effort , it 's done in a few days of use what i find very hard to understand is why acme would not alert people that this is required ultimately it 's a benefit because it allows for that tight fit the first few times you use this case , you may well struggle to get your laptop out once you managed to get it in i would still have bought it if acme had let me know about this breaking in process - but i would have <unk> more pleasant things about the company under my breath as i worked on it
the elastic band gets pretty stretched out that said , it does exactly what i need it to , protect my mba inside my leather briefcase and its not a deal breaker i would still buy this case over other options on the market as it adds almost no weight and is extremely functional . update -- have this about # months -- holding up well to daily use no issues on stretching out further for the neoprene the elastic is holding its own as
in my opinion this sleeve is probably the best sleeve for any computer . the computer slides in and out easily and it is cushioned and protected by the neoprene exterior no zippers or flaps to deal with slides easily into any attach & eacute ; bag i would definitely recommend this bag
yes , it 's designed for the air but , it fits the mbpr perfectly and slides nicely in and out of my bag it is comfortable enough to carry outside the bag when i do n't need all the other stuff
weight was the main reason i bought a macbook air weight was also the reason i bought the skinny sleeve it adds virtually no weight to the machine , is soft , light and idiot proof there are sleeves that offer more protection , perhaps , but they all add bulk and/or weight i carry mine in a dedicated messenger bag pocket , so the added protection of the skinny sleeve is all i need
i bought mine from apple , but value amazon reviews this case is well made , and fits the product with precision the strap seems secure enough for <unk> from any side as long as necessary my point being , the spaced saved by <unk> the zipper is worth it to me however i do plan on using this sleeve within a bag , protected from the elements ... not that i go out in <unk>
very happy with the sleeve very snug fit on my # & # # ; macbook air -lrb- i have a # or # mm usb flash drive that barely fits -rrb- and it looks very well constructed with extra stitching near the opening
this is the second acme made sleeve i bought for my family the macbook air slides effortlessly into the sleeve - i prefer having the thinner end in first to prevent the sleeve from stretching i use the elastic band for extra protection when i have it in my purse and backpack , but the macbook stays put inside the sleeve even without the elastic band plus no zippers that could potentially scratch up the macbook it 's also thin enough to not take up too much additional space in my bag because it 's a snug fit , make sure you get the right sleeve for the type of macbook you have
this is a terrific product it 's well manufactured and provide quality protection for your notebook in a way that provide quick and easy access to your machine and this purple is rock and roll not exclusively feminine so if you dudes out there like something a bit more <unk> , this is not an <unk> colour
great product , great variety of colors and sizes for my various apple products easy to use and safe to store , without any zippers to scratch your macbook would recommend and continue to buy
this sleeve is exactly what i was looking for for my new macbook air # & # # ; the fit is very snug , almost to the point of being difficult to get the computer in and out , but lets be honest thats what its designed to do the elastic strap is my only negative wish it was a little tighter when in place , or had an additional strap at the bottom because of its looseness it is basically for show other than that this sleeve is light-weight , has excellent protection from everyday travel , and i would highly recommend it to anyone looking for protection for their computer
this is my second acme made skinny sleeve i previously had a black one for my # & # # ; air when i upgraded to the # & # # ; , i wanted to buy this case and no other it fits great , offers protection , and adds minimal bulk i do n't have to worry about bringing a bag with a dedicated laptop compartment i 've had it for # months now and so far , so good
this case is great for my macbook air it is really cute and is easy for my computer to get in and out the only downside is that because it has such a super fit , it only fits the computer without another protective cover -lrb- like a snap on cover -rrb-
i 've had this for about # months now and it 's held up very well with use about # days a week i use it to store the laptop around the house and also to throw the laptop it in my large handbag and lug it around this is a great case if you are carrying your laptop in another bag of some sort or just around the <unk> it 's great if you want to stuff it under your seat or in the seat pocket on the plane - makes a good pad for on the tray table or your lap too i would be nervous using this to carry the laptop out on the street as it 's not made as a solution for dropping your laptop - more as good padding for light <unk>
the lower case where the battery goes does n't fit right and i ca n't put in even the upper case does n't fit right but i can put it at the end
this cover is very nice and fits like the description says it will i was not expecting it to be opaque - my hp pavilion dm # is a darker color , and the pretty pink of this cover does n't show because the cover is opaque overall , i am pleased with the cover - the little legs that tilt it are a bit flimsy and can pop off if you 're not careful , but they do make my keyboard more ergonomic i would purchase this cover again
i purchased this case because i had a small dent on the lid of my laptop & i wanted a hard shell case to protect it i love the pretty pink color & the top shell fits perfectly the bottom shell , however , does not fit my laptop at all i have an hp pavilion dm # & the bottom shell seemed almost to be too short -lrb- in length & depth -rrb- as far as shipping -- it was practically immediate i saw it on my front door step the day after i ordered it overall , i do like this product as it works for the intended reason of purchase however i was disappointed that the bottom shell did not fit :
this product is very light and easy to snap on it is hard to get off the top cover i 'd recommend this product if your looking for just a little more protection for your laptop it fits great in my # `` sleeve case that i also bought from amazon . http / / <unk> # <unk> # <unk>
the item came super fast it was easy to snap on , and looks great on my new lap top i 'm happy that it really has n't added any weight to the computer either great purchase ! the reviews from others were right on the spot about this purchase ! ! :
i received exactly what i thought i would the price may have been cheep , but the quality of the product is definitely high i love that the case came quickly , and it snapped right on to my laptop with no problems i love the pink color , it definitely gives my laptop more color i bought the case , because i have a tendency of knocking my laptop off my dorm bed , and this definitely protects it when it falls i high recommend this product to anyone who needs a cute , and durable laptop case
very sturdy , cute and fit perfectly for the price , the product is excellent the color is the same as in the picture only a bit more pink , which is a + + + overall great product to protect my laptop i would definitely purchase this again
i really like this case the pink color is very pretty and it fits my computer perfectly and securely great way to personalize your computer it does add some weight to the computer but the protection is worth it
this cover fits my laptop perfectly i love that its not bulky and still very sturdy i recommend it to anyone who likes to add there own style to life and there electronics ; - -rrb- also the the stands are very sturdy and make it a lot easier to use my laptop
product is exactly as described it fits perfectly and does not add any weight to the my hp pavilion my only concern is that one of the rubber grips on the bottom fell off within a few days other then that it is perfect and i love it
this sleeve measures # / # inches on the top only if you lay it flat , and measure the sides that stick out , does it measure any where close to # `` i have a very slim # `` laptop , it hangs out at least # `` i cut a # `` piece of paper , and even it will not fit into this case it is very pretty , but do not order it if you have a lap top of # `` or you will need to return it , just like me
it was too small for the laptop for which it was purchased ; it had to be returned was very disappointed it had been intended as a gift for my wife who loved the design
i absolutely love this laptop case i had been hunting for this pattern for quite some time and i was finally able to find it for an affordable price on something that i really needed the padding is just enough to protect your laptop , without being too bulky , and the little pocket on the inside is very convenient just a heads up that this case really is for smaller laptops it fits my # & # # ; perfectly
ladies if you ever want to give yourself an extraordinary gift , go to vera bradley 's website , choose a pattern and start collecting pieces i have four pieces from the happy <unk> line , i am using it as my summer work laptop love he <unk> and light <unk> in this pattern
i ordered this laptop sleeve for a new sony vaio with a # . # `` screen it fits great and makes it easy to keep my laptop protected there is one small pocket inside to hold disks beautiful bright purple colors , if you liked the purple punch pattern , you 'll probably like plum <unk> i was also very glad to save on shipping by buying through amazon , as the vera site is kinda pricey on shipping
i 'm still giving this product # stars because aside from my laptop being too big for this product , it was still exactly as described and was brand new and beautiful ! i could n't remember the size of my laptop so i bought a size up and a size down , unfortunately this was the one i had to return ! love this pattern , definitely recommend for those needing something cute and very protective
this did n't work for me on a # & # # ; macbook pro any time i tried to copy anything onto the second drive i got error code # i bought owc caddy all is good now spend the money buy the owc caddy and save your self a lot of trouble shooting time
do n't fit with my <unk> t # very well i tried really hard to cut some part from it what 's worse , one of the two screws falls off itself and i could not get it out from my computer ! ! ! i am very disappointed with
it could be okay depending on the design of your laptop for my purpose on z # lenovo , it was terrible there was a tiny difference between the actual drive and the caddy -lrb- probably less than # of a inch -rrb- but that made the installation extremely hard i eventually got around it by giving up a screw -lrb- applying just one instead of two -rrb- you probably do n't get what i am saying , but my point is that there is a very small error on the size i would recommend a different caddy to a friend it might work out fine for your laptop though
i know not to expect much from a cheap thing like this , but they should make it so the holes do ' t get bigger everytime you screw in the part where it is <unk> onto the laptop after one time , the hole gets big enough where you would need bigger screws if you get it on the first try though , good enough
the adapter works i had a little trouble getting my hard drive in at first i thought that it was a problem with the hard drive but after trying two other drives i realized that there was a problem with the adapter after taking apart the adapter and <unk> the connector i was then able to put my hard drive in so i 'm giving it three stars cause this is something that the manufacture should have realized and fixed with the product , but all in all the product does what it was build for perfectly
pro : simple installation and windows <unk> it with no problem con : extremely slow <unk> speed when <unk> files to a different medium i have a # rd gen ssd in my main bay and a # tb # <unk> hdd drive in the adapter if i copy files from the ssd to the adapter hdd , it will write at # mbps max which is well below spec if i copy files from the adapter hdd to a usb # . # flash drive , it will write in the <unk> range which is pathetic summary : purely reading an hdd from the adapter is perfectly fine and is a huge convenience if you need to <unk> files to/from a drive in the adapter , be ready for some long wait times i 'm not sure if this is due to a small bus in the adapter or on the mobo
drive is not as fast as it should be and was when connected directly in hard drive port i am using # <unk> hard drive and the performance is bad when using with his adapter ****** update *** i have noticed that it <unk> differently every time system boots up . sometimes the speed is acceptable and sometimes it just <unk> i have tried # methods that work for me . once its working fine , do not <unk> the mac - havent <unk> mac since # months now if at all you want to <unk> use command + option + <unk> when powering up . it will <unk> and reset the <unk> i think the <unk> of this caddy is not well accepted by macbook pro
build quality obviously is n't top notch for something this cheap , but it gets the job done it comes with # screws but there are only two holes for screws very easy to install if you just follow the instructions printed on the caddy removing it from my laptop required some prying with a screwdriver the plastic underneath the faceplate has a few holes that can be used as <unk> to take the caddy out i 'm afraid if the plastic breaks , it 'll be a pain to remove
this caddy fits in my laptop perfectly but its speeds are slower than the hard drive i get with crystal disk mark v # . # a speed of # <unk> read and write which is slower than when i have this hard drive in an external enclosure through usb # . # the sata port is running in sata iii mode so it should be faster but i think that has to do with the <unk> connection
pros : very easy to install , replaceable faceplate , and screwdriver included cons : the light that indicates drive activity does not work on my unit not a huge deal , but it would have been nice if this worked . the construction feels very flimsy , but since it 's entirely enclosed in my laptop , it does not really matter overall : the unit is inexpensive , and allows me to have an ssd and a standard <unk> drive in my laptop people seem to be impressed with that
this have decent built quality but i had to modify the pcb to fit into my laptop comparing this pcb to the optical drive pcb , the optical drive pcb near the connector is not protruding as much as this caddy 's pcb i had to <unk> off part of the pcb near the connector in order for the caddy to slide into the laptop properly you can use your <unk> 's faceplate aluminum instead of plastic surrounding found on other <unk> pcb had to be shaved off a little to fit into my laptop
this is currently in my dell laptop , replacing a <unk> optical drive the second drive now stores backups of critical files without bothering with an external drive the drive was a sata iii backwards compatible with sata ii , which works fine it took a bit of fiddling to get the latch and cover from the laptop fitted as well , but every computer is different and all of the latches i needed were present on this caddy the only difficulty i had was in properly <unk> the screws that go into the side of the hard drive so that they went neatly into the slots on the side of the drive overall , i 'm happy with my
it fits in my # macbook pro but there was a little free space left and since it just has space for one screw -lrb- instead of the three -rrb- to attach to the motherboard it wobbles a little bit i just put a small plastic piece in the empty space and it <unk> it
came with little screws that took me a while to figure out they go on the side of the ssd to hold it in to secure the entire tray , i have to puncture # holes on the metal so i can screw the tray into the notebook computer i suppose the location of these screws are not standard for all notebook computers maybe that is why they are not <unk>
nothing & # # ; cheap & # # ; about this thing good construction , matched up perfectly with my machine , and even came with a face plate to use you can pop off your original face plate from your odd and put it on this in ten seconds universal in every respect this allowed me to turn an already <unk> laptop into a <unk>
i installed this in a hp pavilion dm # and it works perfectly even the original face plate from my dvd drive fit nicely on this caddy i was able to boot from the drive in the caddy on my system the price is the best around if you want to add a ssd to your laptop and keep your original hdd for storage , this is for you
the whole setup is really well thought out and very simple to install i especially like the clip that snaps in behind the drive to hold it in place and keep it from moving around the mounting hardware and bezel from my optical drive were easily mounted to the caddy , giving my laptop a completely stock appearance once installed now i have switched my os and programs over to the ssd and everything is running much faster than before
this was my first attempt at installing an hard drive to replace my cd rom drive the fit was perfect and was very easy to install i do n't recall any instructions but it was simple enough to figure out
this worked perfectly for my fiancee 's laptop i had to remove the clip from the back of the existing dvd drive and reattach it to the back of this caddy , but it was very easy , and the installation was quick
it is n't fancy , but it worked with my laptop 's <unk> optical drive bay and i was able to mount my disk drive faceplate on it my new ssd seems to be working fine and i have had no issues thus far minus a temporary glitch which i think was the ssd 's fault plus why would you need it to be fancy if you are going to screw it into your laptop then probably not touch it again in the <unk> future , this product has no significant downsides that i can tell
purchased this product twice to implement <unk> into laptops -lrb- ssd in <unk> , hdd in optical bay -rrb- product works great transfer speeds are optimal -lrb- dependent on hdd spec -rrb- however , you should go into power settings and disable putting the drive to sleep , as this will cause your optical drive to disconnect , requiring a restart
the first item i received was of the wrong height , they sent me a # . # mm caddy , so i requested a replacement and got it in # days the replacement caddy was bent in two places , one right where the thin part starts and the other right in the sata connection the metal was thin enough that i was able to bend it back its original shape yes , it 's thin but this does n't bother me at all as it 's not meant to protect the hd shipping was fast , and although they shipped the wrong item the first time , it 's not the product 's fault i could 've taken # star as well since it was bent when i got it but i <unk> that off against the packaging packaging is flimsy , it 's just a white thin box carton packed in a plastic
as soon as i figured out that the cd drive in almost every notebook can be replaced with one of these <unk> , i replaced all of them place an ssd in the regular hd slot and the old hdd in the caddy i use the hdd as a backup for the ssd it helps turn almost all notebooks into a much more powerful setup offering high speeds through the ssd and also mass amount of storage that an ssd does n't offer
i used this with a ssd drive in my mac book pro it replace the optical drive with ease i have installed secondary drives in two mac books , both installed with ease and work great most <unk> do n't need an onboard dvd drive , adding a second hd for a mac book helps with adding more storage space and battery life . worth your time and consideration
came with tiny head screwdriver , which you need but not all sellers provide this installed flawlessly into a dell inspiron # laptop the original bezel from my dvd drive snapped in perfectly
bought this to install in my asus k # ta it worked as it should have with no problems now i have my ssd and my # gb hdd in the system as i wanted it was an easy install i swapped the bezel from my optical drive though to this case so it would look like it was suppose to be in the laptop this was not a problem or a reason to lower the stars also this came in # days earlier then i was expecting it
when i began to run out of storage on my alienware m # x r # , i decided to switch out the cd drive that i 've used twice since getting my laptop the installation process is extremely simple , and works like a charm solid product , going on several months now with a mechanical drive , and not a single problem to be seen
works like it says it 's good quality stuff fits my asus m # <unk> laptop well , but the drive goes in a little deeper than the edge and probably looks a little funny but since i ca n't see , it does n't really bother me
i have used this backpack lightly for about # months i carry around my laptop , its power supply , and a few notebooks the <unk> # <unk> in the straps has started to fall apart i have sent targus support an email about this , but i have not gotten a response if you are looking for a backpack that will last longer than # months look elsewhere
strap broke with in a four weeks of use the grey support strap tore out the seams it was comfortable and has plenty of space when in working order uncomfortable and unbalanced with out the strap
i really like the design of the backpack there 's plenty of room , multiple compartments , and it 's comfortable to carry the only thing wrong is they used very cheap zippers more often than not i find that the two on the main compartment have split open revealing the contents to everyone
i loved my last targus backpack , so this one is a huge disappointment to me i purchased it on march # th and the straps were literally coming off in late june i am sure that i am tough on items , but i was no more rough on the last targus backpack i owned and it lasted for # years i <unk> targus for a warranty replacement , but they wo n't send it until i ship this one back to them -lrb- at my cost -rrb- if this one is such junk why would i sink even more money into shipping it back for a replacement that 'll last # months i 'd avoid targus backpacks , unless you want to have to get a replacement every few months
i bought this backpack to replace my old one -lrb- the bottom actually wore through -rrb- and to lug my new # inch laptop around it was smooth sailing for a couple months a seam started to tear here and there , but my laptop is pretty heavy so that 's pretty much expected just last week the right shoulder strap seams were really starting come apart , and i noticed that the gray strap piece was starting to come out of the rest of the strap it turns out the the top part of the straps are not one continuous piece i expected a back to have a continuous nylon webbing strap , especially if they <unk> it as a backpack for a # inch laptop to <unk> : the straps are not one continuous piece of nylon webbing and _ will _ rip apart over time anyway , the backpack was cheap , so no huge loss , but i 'll never buy any targus product ever again as a warning , swiss has the same type of straps on their backpacks also
i had this bag for two months and the handle came apart from the base of the book bag i was so upset after spending a descent amount of money on this bag it big and can hold allot of items but what 's the sense if it 's going to break
i was really excited to get this product in the mail it is extremely comfortable and it fits everything but the kitchen sink unfortunately , one of the straps broke a seam and it is falling apart i am disappointed because i have owned this for less then # months and i only use it to carry books to and from a single classroom once a day
i 've had this pack for two months , used for carrying a laptop and change of clothes while traveling the shoulder strap is pulling away from the pack , i 'd expect that kind of ware after a year or so not
i have been using this back pack for # months and i have experienced more than normal wear on it first an eyelet came loose and fell out next the stitching on the shoulder straps is coming loose my previous targus backpack lasted me for over # years the zippers wore out on it this one is not going to last # years at the rate it is coming apart
it looks good and sturdy when you buy it , but when it actually comes to day to day usage it will break in less than # months this is a bad product to buy
i 've had this backpack for less than a week and it 's already tore at one of the seems do n't buy - i should have trusted the other reviews complaining of this problem
for a $ # backpack this should not happen my son has only used it for # and # months per amazon , i no longer can return but i hope so as it is defective ca n't figure out how to get beyond the sorry this item no longer can be returned notice for $ # backpack which i <unk> we would use for years , this is frustrating
this back pack is nice , and the straps are very comfortable when you walk with the bag it just feels like the bag is floating except after about a month of normal college wear and tear the elastic part on the strap where the back pack is stitched started falling apart i do n't recommend this for school but it does have the pockets i wanted and used tough call , ca n't carry # college books , and a lap top for a month
i have yet to contact targus about this , but i bought this backpack a few weeks ago and it is showing signs of major wear the straps have a material that & # # ; caps & # # ; the sides of the straps if you will the stitching on this has ripped and the material is falling of the strap also - on the large middle pocket , the material has ripped by the zipper at the bottom and it is difficult to zip/unzip your best option is to stay far
i have a # `` macbook pro , some cords , a few folders and a notebook recently added a nexus # to the list the first backpack lasted the longest , over # days till the stitching on the straps starting popping out amazon did exchange it for me even though i was outside of the # day window number # only lasted # weeks or so number # the first time i picked it up the seams started popping i have moved on to a different brand i am disappointed as i really liked this pack , but it kept falling apart i also talked to targus , they offered to exchange it for a new one , but would not send it until they received mine to amazon 's credit i never had to send one back till the replacement arrived and they refunded my money after # # so i could purchase a new one right away
i was looking for a heavy-duty backpack , and with all the metal reinforcements -lrb- and glowing reviews -rrb- this looked like a good pick unfortunately , a lot of it is just appearance & # # ; the back straps are n't reinforced at the point where they actually bear weight instead of helping hold the bag together , the metal just makes it heavy it 's a surprisingly heavy backpack for being so poorly made after # months , one of the straps was ripping where it connected to the pack at # months , both of the straps are ripped where they connect , and the main zipper is broken , as well it was used several days a week to carry a laptop , papers , gym clothes , but not a load of textbooks per warranty , it 's on its way to targus to be replaced -lrb- for the cost of return shipping -rrb- i do n't have high hopes for the second one , but they wo n't exchange for another model
my initially impression of this bag was great it is has plenty of storage and seemed like a great value however within a week of the purchase the straps literally fell apart at the seems this was not one of the straps , but both of them so it is clear this was not a rare <unk> dont fall into the value trap otherwise you will end up like me and throw # $ into the
the first targus laptop backpack i bought a few years back , the shoulder strap seam ripped after the first use although this annoyed me , i did not bother to return it and figured i just happened to get a dud i kept this bag for the past few years and slowly the strap seam has ripped more and more until finally i decided to look for a new laptop backpack i came across this targus bag and initially hesitated before purchasing it i had hoped that over the years , the quality would have improved , however just as the previous bag , after the first use , the shoulder strap seam ripped i did not overload the bag and it was not particularly heavy so why the seam ripped , i can only <unk> is due to poor quality so after two attempts to use targus bags , i have given up and have since returned this bag for a refund thankfully amazon is great about returns but i will not be buying any more targus gear
within # days the stitching on many parts of the backpack came undone including important areas such as shoulder straps and zipper closures amazon wo n't take it back since its past the # day window my last targus backpack lasted # years targus must be manufacturing in china now garbage product and poor seller -lrb- amazon.com
initially i was happy with my targus drifter ii backpack but then the stitching on the shoulder straps came undone and the stuffing inside the straps has become exposed the plastic handle at the top of the backpack also broke quite disappointed that it 's starting to fall apart after such light use what was even more disappointing is how targus is handling my warranty claim they are asking for the backpack to be sent to them first before they send me a new one , leaving me without a backpack for weeks you would think it would make more sense to send me the replacement first so that i wo n't be without a backpack for how many weeks it takes them to process my warranty claim now you 've been warned about the quality of the targus drifter ii and targus customer service
the shoulder strap stiches started <unk> out within day or two i just stiched them with had otherwise the bag is okay the quality does not match anywhere close to the price
after # months of ordinary use with normal load -lrb- laptop , charger , bottle of water etc . -rrb- , the shoulder strap tore apart on the right side other signs of wear as well , but this means that the bag can not be used at all the <unk> of the bag is excellent , but the durability is extremely poor
bought this backpack for my son for school from a brick and mortar store because i needed it right away the back pack has <unk> space for his laptop and school gear - however , the shoulder strap ripped out of its seems in less than # months the brick and mortar store will not replace -lrb- `` that was not easy `` was the store -rrb- i have an email into targus to see if they will honor under their warranty
i had ordered this to replace a previous backpack that was falling apart it was to be used for carrying a # inch laptop and a medium sized hardcover textbook after only a month , one of the straps has nearly come apart just from sheer usage it may be a useful bag if you are n't planning on using it daily , however you should be very careful when considering purchasing this product , and evaluate your needs if you use your bag constantly , it will wear down very quickly
purchased this in july # and used it every week after three months i noticed the thread separating on the shoulder strap i continued to use it until dec when i sent it back to targus who accepted it without too much difficulty after promising a quick turn around to send me a replacement i finally received the new replacement # <unk> later two days later i added my stuff <unk> it on my shoulder and all the stitching came out of the same strap after less than a month of use the stitching is much worse than the first back pack which i returned i think i am going to take it to an <unk> to fix it correctly no other real choice
definitely not a swiss a guy i work with bought one and i thought it was big enough for what i needed does n't sit straight up when you put it down , stitching is already falling apart and the straps are loosing the foam stuffing the plastic on the handle is cracking and i 've only had it about # months i travel for a living and on the road # % of the time and always carry a lot of stuff around the back pack before was a swiss and i had for over # years before it started falling apart
i ended up giving this to charity because although it fits a lot inside of it , its super hard on your shoulders it can handle a lot of stuff , but its not very well built to help you carry it - this is coming from me and my # ' # boyfriend also its falling apart
i purchased this after my high sierra 's zipper gave out and needed a replacement yesterday i noticed that the threading in the shoulder strap was fraying really disappointed with the quality i am contacting targus for a replacement since i ca n't return it through amazon
