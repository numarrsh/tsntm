i love this case for my laptop computer , it is very handy and convenient but the light aqua color i chose is showing the dirt terribly , <unk> and smudges seem permanent and do not wipe off my case is only a month old and looks dingy and dirty already and i 've been very careful where i set it i will eventually have to replace it and wo n't be choosing the same brand
this case is small , fits the chromebook like a glove , and does everything it is advertised to do the only downside is if you use a mouse , there is n't really room to store it within the case
i bought it for the helix , but it was nowhere near fitting ; i think the measurements posted might be a little on the generous side i like that the <unk> can sit inside while the case is opened , and it has some webbing holding it from flopping over completely but i had to give this one to my mom since my machine did n't fit and hers did theoretically the smallest macbook air might fit , but i did n't try it
this case is very nice looking and it fits a netbook up to about # `` it is well padded inside and has a strap to hold your netbook secure when the case is closed it 's a very durable case with a hard outside shell however , there are no outside or inside pockets for holding your charger , multimedia cards or anything extra so i think that 's a con plus there is no shoulder strap , only two handles , making it harder to carry if you 're carrying anything else i believe for the price there are better options out there because most people want to also carry a charger , cards , etc .
my chromebook is very secure in this case , but i rarely use it it adds a good deal of bulk when carrying without providing any way to carry the power cord
con : there is no where to accomodate the power cord and other accessories something about the same size but with <unk> depth to carry a personal hard drive , the power cord etc would be nice
this case is able to barely fit the asus # . # & # # ; vivobook it 's extremely snug , but it does work unlike some of the other cases out there , this one protects against drops , etc . and it 's not terribly expensive looks like there 's some protection on the rear of the zipper to prevent scratching , but not sure if it 's effective
this was a tight fit on my # . # `` q # but decided to make it work love how you can use your notebook in the case wish the corners and edges had a bit more protection should n't be a problem for those with notebooks smaller than # . # but the edges of mine press firmly against the seam of the zipper :
well built case that fits the # . # inch samsung ativ # t with the keyboard dock perfectly with no play there is no space or extra compartments for any accessories though the strap that is provided internally holds your <unk> in place if it is smaller than the case so that it doesnt bounce around inside the case , sweet
solid , lightweight protection for my samsung # . # & # # ; chromebook which fits perfectly the case is semi-rigid and seems well constructed as has been mentioned in previous reviews , there is no room for the power adapter
this is a great design and the case offers a much better protection than the average ` sleave ' that is available however , if you add a <unk> keyboard as we did with the <unk> , then this case will not fit and we had to buy another similar case for # & # # ; ultrabooks to accommodate them unfortunately , than means there is also an extra # & # # ; in depth on those cases -lrb- but still quite snug -rrb- it 's a shame that the designers of these did n't think that through and give the market a product that would fit how most actually use it still , this is a good case for its design , -lrb- we now use them to carry books -rrb-
gave it as a gift to a family member to protect their samsung chromebook does a good job as a protective sleeve and is very lightweight and fits inside a backpack easily if you do n't want to be so conspicuous about carrying a laptop with you
this was the perfect case i was looking for it fits great for the hp <unk> # which i got it for compact case and with a handle ... great for travel only wish it had some room for the charger ... but i can deal with it
i purchased this to store an acer aspire netbook and it fits perfectly the molded case has ribs that help protect the netbook from bumps and overall it is well made i wish it had a small pocket inside with which to store small cables -lrb- usb , ethernet , etc -rrb- but otherwise i like it for its size and durability
i like its slim design while still being padded to protect my machine the only thing i would change would be possibly small pokets on one side for business cards and ink pens
i like that this is a firm case i bought it for the chomebook that i got for my wife it fits in the case great i do wish that it had a small pocket on it for the charger , other then that very happy with
purchased for my husband 's notebook . so he could keep the notebook in a protective case when not in use . he never uses it because he very seldom puts the notebook down
this is such a great case when you are just going out for a quick trip , or packing your laptop in your bag along with other items it does n't hold a mouse or the power cord , but is slim enough to slide into a bag along with your other items when that 's what you 're looking for also love the color
purchased this to go along with my chromebook and like it alot it is padded for good protection i particularly like the fact that the chromebook does not need to be taken out of the case when using wish there were two more features - a shoulder strap and a pouch to hold the charger those two things would make it perfect
it keeps my chromebook safe , and it 's great for traveling it 's efficient , and i can use my chromebook inside the case however , the case has no room to put anything else in it , i usually bring another little bag for my chromebook 's accessories by the way , the case is not just for chromebooks it works for any # . # inch notebooks i hope you enjoy it ! :
this is a very good looking case . very light and easy to carry . the color is beautiful , i bought it for a female and she just loves it it also <unk> & eacute ; <unk> the laptop for impacts . i recommend it
this case fit my chromebook perfectly and i like that it 's firm , but flexible material helps to protect it a place for the charge cord would have been a nice addition , but still a good case for the buy
this bag fits my acer chromebook perfectly the only problem , as others have written , that is all that will fit in it there is no space at all for the adaptor
i really like this case a lot , the only complaint i have is that there 's no place to keep your adapter if you think you might need it i like the material though , very slim fit and it seems to be fairly tough
it is a perfect fit for the chromebook , but there is not enough room to include the power cord with the charger i also use a mouse with it , so i put the mouse in a phone carrier that i hook onto the strap not a perfect match , but it works
this is a great case and fits the acer chromebook perfectly the only reason i did not give # stars is because the interior elastic hinge is <unk> where the power plug is this does n't impact function , just a little awkward to plug in the computer while leaving it in its case
i bought this case for my daughter 's samsung chromebook , and it fits perfectly i would have given it # stars if it had a place to <unk> the charging cord otherwise , this case looks just like it does in the picture and is holding up well to my # -year-old daughter
i find this case to be excellent for my chromebook it is exactly as seen and is really a beautiful color it also protects the chromebook very nicely
all that matters is the wife loves it it 's oddly her favorite color it 's build for great protection for the new chromebook it 's inexpensive but should be built to last
this is sturdy and will protect the computer i do wish it had a separate compartment to store the cord also , the person who packed this one must have been <unk> , as i ordered blue and received green but these are minor points , and the case should work fine
i purchased a new netbook and this sleeve protects it when it is n't in use i like this particular sleeve because it is very firm -lrb- not soft neoprene -rrb- and i do n't have to be extremely careful with my netbook when it is in this i am very happy with the product , and i would highly recommend it to anyone who just needs a sleeve for the storage of a netbook it does not have any pockets in which to put the power cord , etc . , but this is obvious in the listing i am very happy with this product
i use this case to carry both my ipad # and the wireless bt keyboard that i have to go with it it fits very securely and is padded well for optimal protection
fits the chromebook perfectly and as advertised , you can use the computer without removing it from the sleeve its a perfect fit for the computer but keep in mind there is no room for the charging cord , etc .
i keep my netbook in it all the time it helps keep it -lrb- and my lap -rrb- cool and the fit is just perfect i 'd highly recommend this item
this case logic product is extremely well made , much better than the hp case i <unk> used for the same laptop i wish it had a side pocket , but i assume you ca n't get that for this low of a price
i got my chromebook case in today i really like it the chromebook fits snugly , and i feel like it will help protect it in my backpack as i take it to and from my college classes i will say , the color does not appear the same to me irl as it does in the picture it appears more sea foam green to my eyes than the image in the picture this does not bother me one bit
it fits my new <unk> chrome notebook i feel like the chrome is safe in this case really , that is the most important thing does not feel cheap in any way
i 'm really happy with the quality of this sleeve it fits my samsung chromebook perfectly , and seems very well made there are several grooves for circulation the case is also held on the sides with two elastic hinges these hold the case open in the correct position when i 'm using the chromebook i 'm happy with it , overall , and i 'm happy i went with this product when i purchased my chromebook # . # & # # ;
this fits the lenovo thinkpad x # e perfectly -- very snug really like the handle and the air venting <unk> on the bottom it makes it easy to use sitting in your lap it 's very sturdy and well constructed i definitely recommend this item
this case is hard and protective for my chrome book the cover is hard i wish case logic would have the same case for # inch laptop however , this case has on room or external pockets for accessories
this case is perfect for my sony vaio <unk> # . # `` notebook computer it even fits the relatively large extended battery too i can use the computer without even taking it out of the case it has semi-rigid sides , so it can withstand some occasional knocks and bumps i own several other cases and this is the best one i 've ever purchased
having purchased a new mini-laptop -lrb- acer aspire one # -rrb- , i struggled to find a carrier that would not swallow it this case logic sleeve is a perfect fit i carry my laptop in a messenger bag , so i needed something that would fit inside my bag but protect my laptop if you have a similar setup for portable computing , this is the sleeve for you as other reviewers have mentioned , there is no room for peripherals in this carrier however , this sleeve should prove durable ; i own a camera case in this same design , and it has held up well over the long haul -lrb- with numerous trips in my luggage -rrb- i highly recommend this product
i do n't take the computer out of the house but when i leave for a few days or just do n't use it the case keeps my computer dust free and updates all the time when i go out of town i take my # . # `` hp which i love all in all the case is very handy and good quality for the money
after a week of school , my son broke his laptop screen from the weight of his books pressing against it we had to pay $ # to fix it they suggested a laptop cover i wish they 'd suggested that before he broke it no problems since then he does n't even have to take it out of the case to use it
this case of a perfect match to my samsung chromebook it fits it perfectly and leaves no room for it to bang around it is a semi hard case so it provides great protection while not being to big as a result of this , however , it has not room for a mouse or the charger so it did n't work for my needs however , i gave it to my daughter to bring hers to school because hers was being thrown into her book bag and was looking worse for wear she uses it on battery and no mouse and so it is perfect for her
i got this to go along with the samsung chromebook i gave for christmas the quality of it is amazing , its a nice color and is really strong it has a hard outside so that way the computer wont be crushed its not to bulky and has a strap inside to hold down the laptop ive seen these in stores for atleast # bucks and got it here for a great deal
this is a very well-built and sturdy case perfect size for my acer aspire i love the case logic brand , so far i have not bought a single thing from this brand that i am not happy with
i use this case for my small for my samsung chromebook -- the $ # laptop computer for everyone for just a few dollars , i can protect my favorite toy i may take the laptop out of the case to use it , but always return it to the case when i 'm finished more than once the dogs have tangled up in the computer cord and pulled the laptop and case off my table this case is built with a hard plastic shell that really does a wonderful job of protecting you laptop or larger tablet i 've only traveled with it once but any travel requires protection for laptops and tablets only problem ... no room for the power cord that 's ok if you take your computer to work every day and bring it home long trips last longer than my charge so the power cord must be packed separate from the laptop but hey , the price is great and the protection even more dope
my acer # fits perfectly in it one thing that i can probably point out is that the color in the picture is a little more blue than what you really get what you get has a more greenish tone , but i do n't know , that 's just how i see it it 's a great case though i would recommend it : -rrb- worth the buy
this sleeve is the perfect size for my chromebook it is roomy enough to carry a few additional items in it but even without anything else keeps the chromebook secure with a # & # # ; elastic band handles are sturdy very good price and prompt delivery definitely recommend it
best product for the price , i am really happy to get this product from amazon . it fits well and the product looks really good i would recommend this product for even hp tc # with # `` , it fits well and protect your hp
this case is wonderful it looks great and is built well i got this for my acer chromebook and it fits perfectly in there and i know that it will be protected in this i 'm glad i got this instead of just buying a sleeve because this adds the extra protection that i was looking for the only thing that would make this even better is having a place to put plugs , headphones , etc . but other than that , the case is perfect
i have an hp pavilion dm # and the hp case was just made out of neoprene this case logic is able to fit the hp pavilion dm # , the power supply , and a small mouse just fine the molded eva case provides much better protection
this is the perfect case for the acer computer it is easy to open yet protects the computer we had no problems taking the computer out quickly while going through airports when traveling
i like the semi - hard shell , i 'm pretty sure it can take a beating it has nice elastic straps inside to keep it in place even if it 's not zipped
i use it to carry an asus # & # # ; laptop and its respective charger , the back is padded and the front is semi rigid , looks good and seems durable , recomended for
received notebook case in perfect condition outside is rugged constructed and durable inside has nice padding and elastic band to hold notebook into case very please with the build quality for the price
no brainer to get this for my chromebook # perfect fit and i do not need it to have pockets or whatever to stow my charger , cords etc . that would defeat the whole purpose of lightweight and sleek design the case protects and encases the chromebook like a glove now when i open my laptop because of the case it does not slide on my lap like when it was just the bare computer alone and the # zipper pulls allows me to put a small lock on it to prevent prying eyes
purchased this for a new # cell lenovo x # e netbook fits like a glove i wanted something with a bit more protection than a sleeve , and this fits the bill case is not waterproof , however it does provide significant cushioning & protection from small drops looks nicer in the photographs though you can use the netbook sitting in the case but not recommended due to heat buildup no space for a power adapter but i was not looking for one either get a bigger case if you need to stuff that in as well if you are looking for a case for a # . # inch netbook , want something more than a sleeve and want a snug fit look no further
this case is large enough for an ipad with an external protective case my ipad has the plastic shell , with the magnetic folding cover it fits inside with plenty of room , so that the power cord and stylus can be included i could probably put the ipad in a neoprene case and it would still fit the color matches the photograph , it 's a pretty magenta pink it seems strong enough to protect the ipad if you dropped it
i recently bought the microsoft surface computer which i love ! i wanted to get a case that would close completely and be protected from any water at my flower shop this case is perfect super low-profile , very light , not too thick i like that it has a little elastic inside which holds the computer to one side when you open it i want the teal one too now
nice carrying case with a roomy fit for my surface pro with the pen and type cover attached no pockets for accessories but if you 're desperate enough , it can also hold the power supply and cord on top of the flat side of surface tablet put a thin mouse pad or other separator in between to avoid any scratches
love my new laptop case it 's hard not soft so i feel like it 'll last longer i love the color and it 's the perfect size came in just # days
the case works great with the new samsung chromebook the laptop fits perfectly into the case , and the combination of low heat from the unit plus the great fit make typing while in the case a breeze the padding is more than adequate for this device i highly recommend it to anyone searching for a case for this unit
just perfect for added protection when carrying around my asus tablet i 'd recommend this case to anybody looking for something to carry a tablet just wish there was a shoulder strap option too
this case is perfect , i can carry my chromebook and kindle fire in the same case and it will protect it from dings and hurts that happen when you have to carry something one place to another
use it for my surface pro i 've been using it for almost # years and it looks like new very protective as it has a semi-hard lining very good for light drops
this is a great case to protect your chromebook i got it for my middle school child the best part is you do n't have to remove the computer from the cast to use your computer
quality : awesome color : teal is true to picture fit : perfect does it make the samsung chromebook heat up not from what i can tell i had my chromebook on a poor quality cloth lap stand and it did heat up on that thing i am using my chromebook as you read this , and it is not getting any warmer my only complaint is that there is a little bit of glue showing near the seat belt design down the center -lrb- looks like mustard -rrb- otherwise i am totally pleased
very pleased with this case i purchased a new netbook at the same time and wanted to protect it case is very tough but attractive and offers good protection one feature i really like is that you operate your computer while it 's still in the case i travel quite often and i 'm sure the computer will be free of injury during my trips
i ordered this case for my new ipad # i also ordered a cover for the ipad and wanted a carrying case big enough to handle my ipad covered , along with a wall charger and <unk> cord i may also fit a car charger in this case the case is sturdy and protective this will do the job for me and i am happy
alright , slight exaggeration there but it 's really a wonderful case perfect weight , very durable , very attractive and professional it 's exactly what i was looking for to hold my # inch acer netbook
<unk> - fits snugly great , great , great we even order another one for our other computer i would have liked to have ordered a different color but it 's still great
love the color - it 's very fun when i am busy working on the go the handles are comfy to hold and it 's nice that you can use the laptop while still in the case fits the # . # inch acer perfectly this is my travel case and i could n't be happier
i purchased this case for my new netbook , and it really has protected the unit not too great if you need additional storage space , but for just the unit it is nice
i purchased this case for an hp pavilion dm # z notebook and it fits perfectly as advertised , you can open the case and work without removing the notebook , although i do if i 'm working for awhile `` just in case `` it might get too warm i bought the grey one and it is a classy looking case i 'm very please with the purchase remember this is a case for the notebook only , there is absolutely no room left over for anything else , including power cord
i recently bought a acer aspire one ao # # . # -inch , amazon recomended this case , and let me tell you , its excellent ! ! its a semi hard case that fits perfectly my netbook i absolutely recomend it , the only wish i would add , its some room for the ac charger , but i guess it would make it bulky hope this help you all
this case fits my # . # & # # ; lenovo laptop perfectly it seems like all the nice cases and sleeves are perfectly sized for macs , but a search of my pc by model name turned up this case it provides significantly more protection than a neoprene sleeve , but still has a slim profile i 'm so glad i found it per the advice of another reviewer , i plan to treat the outside of the case with scotchguard to give it a bit of water resistance and make it easier to wipe clean
i chose five out of five stars because it is exactly as advertised , well made , and a perfect fit for my # . # inch acer chromebook i like that i can leave my chromebook inside the case and still open it fully only potential drawback is that there is no external pocket -lrb- would be helpful to carry the power cord -rrb- . other models that had the outside pocket were flimsier i prefer this case over those
this is a beautiful , well constructed laptop bag but i found it to be too small for my # inch laptop maybe it was my mistake , but the measurements stated in the description are # x # . # inches so i thought that my # inch laptop would have plenty of room well , those measurements are outside dimensions not inside which are actually # x # ... one inch smaller in both directions i can barely get the bag zipped and there is absolutely no room for any accessories such as a charger or mouse as much as i love the bag , it will be going back
i smile every time i look at this case it is truly beautiful the only complaint i have is that there is absolutely no extra room i ca n't even leave my -lrb- short , tiny -rrb- wireless mouse usb in the computer there are two pockets on the outside of the case , so i can store the mouse & usb there , but barely there is no room at all for the power cord , so since i have to carry an extra bag for the power cord , i just store my <unk> in that bag but i would n't change it i just ca n't use it for anything other than my laptop - literally but i do love it it is sturdy and extremely well made , as you would expect from vera bradley
this bag fits my # & # # ; laptop perfectly it has a hard shell hidden inside the <unk> fabric , and the inside fabric is plush and soft the handles are sturdy , and it has a removable and adjustable shoulder strap a velcro bar is included to customize the interior and keep the laptop from moving around the outside pockets fit close to the bag , so they will accomodate flat items like papers my only complaint is that there is not room inside the main compartment for my charger , and when i squeeze it into the side pocket , it bulges out i would prefer to keep it inside the case next to the laptop a smaller laptop probably would n't have this issue the mocha <unk> print is prettier than it appears in the photo -- the colors are rich and the case is much more attractive than a generic one from the office store
the bag is beautiful i got it for $ # when it is normally $ # the only problem is that one side smells a little burnt i 've been trying to get the smell away but it 's hard
i bought this lap top case , not sure what to expect ... but it turned out amazing this case is wonderful for my large lap top . . it 's hard shell case is very protective , but yet very stylish the colors are awesome as well great <unk> worth the money
i researched portfolio 's and decided on vera bradley it fits my # inch dell perfectly i love the <unk> pattern i chose blue <unk> i would highly reccomend this product
i absolutely love this bag i use it for a # `` macbook and it works perfectly the hard shell makes me feel comfortable carrying my laptop around without additional protection there is limited pocket space available -- enough room for a cell phone , charger , or similarly sized items
my daughter was excited to get this zebra backpack , but within a few weeks of receiving it , the zipper kept getting stuck and the pack would n't close correctly so disappointed , going to return it
the zippers are hard to open and close the backpack with , i have had it a few months and one zipper is broken due to me having to pull so hard to get it to close
the bag is really good quality , the padding is thick and sturdy , the straps are a little big , and am not to sure how the opening for the ear phone works -lrb- someone please tell me others who reviewed the bag , said that the zipper is problematic and they were right it is hard to zip , but , u get use to it , once it does n't burst am good ! : -rrb- other than that , it is definitely worth buying ps : its really spacey inside
the zipper broke the first time i used it the zippers are stiff at first but once you use it they get better i like the book bag itself , except for the straps , they are a little rough i seriously thought about returning it , but did n't feel like going through the hassle of not having it
used this briefcase two times and it fell apart the zippers are no good the little straps that allow you to easily pull the zippers fell off poor workmanship and materials
i did n't realize but seemed to recall someone mention the zipper i now understand the zipper pull is a nylon string that can come off the zipper mechanism the pull is not fixed to it and actually came off while i unzipped the case i like the bag , the weight design compartments , but if i knew what a poor zipper design it was i would have kept looking in the end i will crazy glue the clasp so it can not come out ... but for $ # . # why am i fixing anything ? ? really sad that they would produce this like this do n't buy this bag
i like the amount of pockets and storage the shoulder strap is a plus as well i currently carry a surface pro # and plenty of usb hard drives for photo back up it handles all of my equipment nicely except for the zippers i have only had this for a couple of months and the inside zippers are already broken i really like this bag too bad it has a weak link
great briefcase for those of you who travel bag is light with a comfortable strap going through security is a breeze without the need to remove my laptop i only have # real complaint at that is the zipper the metal piece that zips and unzips does n't fully secure the small rope and tab that you pull to easily zip and unzip so it can come
the checkpoint friendly feature works great , saves time and hassle at security , and for that i give # stars as others noted , the big flaw is the zippers the string pulls come off the zipper way too easily i have lost any yet , but it is a matter of time i would much prefer metal zipper pulls other than that , the bag is well constructed and comfortable to carry it 's big enough for my laptop and assorted computer gizmos but not much else but , that 's fine with me
at the beginning of the year i bought a dell precision m # , which is fairly thin i travel often and was shopping for a new case and found this on amazon one nice feature is the handles stand up as shown in the picture , which makes it a lot easier to pick up the case with one hand
this bag is well built and seems to be very strong the carrying strap is very comfortable it has plenty of pockets and places to easily get at your tablet and cell phone as well as places to keep accessories and cables and chargers the scan fast feature is excellent just unzip the case open it and lay it on the tsa scanner and no need to remove the laptop and put it in a separate tray the bag has a lifetime warranty which also makes it a great buy
i have tried many computer bags and travel -lrb- fly -rrb- often . this bag <unk> all , and even seems lighter than the others with all the same stuff in it . has a place for everything awesome , wished i found it earlier
i bought this bag immediately after buying my macbook air , as is was quite difficult to find a bag that would securely hold it due to its unique size i have had it for about three months and it is falling apart it was very inexpensive and served its purpose well i have had time to shop for a more durable , higher quality bag
fits my macbook air # . # `` perfectly , just wish it had more cushioning lots of storage capacity and allows me to have all my accessories in one spot w/out being a bulky hassle would give # stars if there was more cushioning , however i do enjoy this bag
