on the internet this is considered the ultimate road warrior briefcase it 's built out of great material but i do n't like the hidden sheath pocket under the front strap when the bag is n't full and you carry it on your shoulder it opens up very wide , <unk> for someone to stick their hand in there it might be convenient for airports but horrible for commuting also while there are a good number of pockets on the front panel . the main compartment in the front half is just one giant pocket . there should be some sort of wallet pocket or something lots of things just bounce around in that compartment should be great for work like holding brochures and phones , and business cards , but not designed well for commuting
this is a great bag and once you get used to it , it 's tough to beat between its tsa <unk> , expansion ability , relative light weight , and overall durability and comfort ; i believe this was the best choice for my needs as a business <unk>
years ago i used to make fun of all those <unk> in suits carrying their expensive tumi bags then i started working internationally , wearing suits and trying to travel without ever checking a bag this little <unk> is awesome for that right now i have my mac air , ipad and my kindle in it , with all the cords as well as a pair of running shoes , a sweater , some t-shirts and <unk> this , coupled with my duffel , means i go abroad for up to two weeks without ever checking a bag face it , tumi makes a great product with a lot of thought put into what you need it 's durable and well organized and perfect for extended business travel resistance is <unk>
i 'm so glad to purchase this laptop bag as <unk> is too good only thing its expensive but worth it i 'm in fact thinking to <unk> the backpack as well
the computer is safely <unk> in a protected section there are a number of dividers next to the computer section that allows you to organize your work the other side -lrb- and there is a zip out extender -rrb- is perfect if you have lots of binders to carry or bulky items in fact , i organized my whole <unk> in this bag which takes me from home to work seamlessly the product is durable and has lots of internal and external storage the front storage sections fit many of my things nicely some are on the small side , but i carry lots of erasers and pencil leads , so they are perfect for my needs
so far i love this bag lots of compartments , included accessory case and it looks very professional very roomy and holds laptop , folders , ipad , phone , and can be expanded i wish i would have purchased years ago instead of buying multiple less expensive bags that did not
i have a mac laptop i think this screen protector is a little too thick to fit between the screen i think when it comes to the key board it is n't a problem but my mouse button started <unk> strange -lrb- like stopped working -rrb- so i stopped using it for the last few days and the problem went away i am planning on cutting the protector around the mouse button maybe my <unk> is n't the protector i am not a computer <unk> i am just figuring it out through trial and error
this is a great item for the right size laptop keyboard just be sure that it 's not too small for your machine before purchasing it if it 's the right size , it 's a great product and will protect your laptop screen
if you want to protect your laptop led or lcd go for it , and at the same time use it as a mouse pad perfect for any laptop or ultra , even they have sizes for netbook
great product fits perfect in my # inch notebook slim and soft very portable does exactly what i need it too and it has a large enough surface to work
good quality cloth that seems like it will protect my screen way better then the little cloth i have been using as of late feels durable and my screen will last a lot longer now the mouse pad was a nice bonus as well and i keep is as my travel one now
i recently got this bag for a # `` laptop the bag itself seems well constructed and easily holds all of the misc items and accessories for my laptop unfortunately , i have one complaint , and it 's fairly large , in my opinion the friction lock on the strap is garbage the strap itself is fine , and seems to be of reasonable quality however , it is essentially <unk> the strap will shorten , but as soon as you let the bag weight settle on it , it will slip back to the fully extended length this is with a # `` laptop and cords , but not much else the problem -lrb- i think -rrb- is that the bar in the friction lock is extremely thin and it does not provide enough grab to keep the strap from slipping the strap itself is fairly long , so this causes the bag to hang very low and somewhat awkwardly
- excelente bolso , de muy buena calidad y <unk> - tiene <unk> <unk> <unk> para <unk> <unk> - a <unk> de <unk> lo <unk> <unk> el <unk> <unk> me ha <unk> muy <unk> , <unk> <unk>
great laptop bag i like all the pockets and space it has with a # . # inch laptop , it fits pretty well with a little adjustment only thing i do n't like about this bag is that there 's a squeaking sound when i walk , haha the metal ring and clip for the strap rubs together making it squeak not a big deal overall i 'm satisfied with this bag =
color in picture seems <unk> metal description says black its definitely black nice bag ... very big plenty of padding for your laptop and room to spare for files or other items
this bag just fits my asus # `` laptop and its very large brick , plus a full size mouse the media cord zipper along the shoulder strap is kind of useless , but i do occasionally use the mp # player pocket to hold my iphone after # months of daily <unk> use , the bag is wearing well overall , it is a functional and stylish bag , at a very reasonable price i would suggest # improvements - # buckles to hold the main <unk> closed instead of # with just # buckle in the center , the corners <unk> a bit when the bag is full to capacity and while it 's secure enough , it does n't feel <unk> as other bags do also , it might not be secure enough for road warrior weekly travel - the rings that attach the straps to the body of the bag should be <unk> , to prevent the shoulder strap from sliding into a corner and bunching up since i do n't change the strap length a lot , i might even sew the base of the strap up to keep it from bunching
i only needed it for grad school and now that i 've graduated i do n't really use it anymore it did a great job of keeping my laptop protected and i still had plenty of room for a two small texts , notebooks and a few file folders and it has a neat compartment for the ac cord it looks awesome after two years of use and it 's easy to clean
looking for a bag that can hold a huge laptop and then some ? this is the back i used it for # years in college held # text books and a # ' laptop . best bag ever
got this as a gift for christmas it 's a stylish , lightweight bag for day use just enough room for notebook , mouse , power brick and a book or magazines also carries your mp # player and earbuds in the sleeve comfortable handles and straps all seem to be of good quality in stitching and manufacture laptop sleeve is a little awkward for initial fitting , but is nice to have one so snug with little movement of the laptop inside
bags is well constructed and is pretty easy on the eyes have been using this thing <unk> since i got it and it 's a trooper this product suits my needs and situations perfectly and i 'm sure it will suit yours too
bought this for my new laptop which is # . # `` the bag says up to # `` my lappy fits but it 's quite snug , if you want to put more in the bag it 's a tight fit but that 's alright with me , i love the bag it is black -lrb- image is gray -rrb- all the pockets and compartments are nice i would def recommend this for people with # `` or smaller lap tops
everything i hoped for and more there are so many pockets i do n't know what to do with them all seems to be constructed very nicely my new # . # `` toshiba laptop fits like a glove , i did n't even have to take out the usb port for my wireless mouse
i 've had this bag for almost a month now , and i love it my # `` laptop is perfectly protected inside there are just the right amount of pockets for all the things i need with me on the road the zipper concealed bottle holder on the side of the bag is very convenient it 's just the right size to hold my laptop , several file folders , and all the things i need to carry with me -lrb- external hard drive , headphones , writing utensils , power cord , etc -rrb- construction seems very durable , it still looks brand new after a month of pretty heavy use
bought this for my senior dad , as one of his christmas gifts i own an older version of this laptop bag , and it has served me well , for years this a a high-quality bag , and has plenty of room for a charger , wireless mouse , ipod or other music device and more this version has several choices for interior colors -lrb- i selected blue -rrb- which might match your # inch -lrb- or # inch , for that matter -rrb- computer great padding , and easy to carry very similar -lrb- <unk> twin , in fact -rrb- to a high-end luggage brand some may not like the microsoft logo -lrb- it is small -rrb- , but there is nothing not to like about this bag packaging is high-end , making this a most welcome gift for guy 's or gal 's nice for most any age , too
i bought this sleeve for my newly purchase lenovo ideapad u # & # # ; this sleeve is advertised for # & # # ; & # . # & # # ; laptops the seller should write the ads as for # . # & # # ; laptops instead it 's way too big and too loose for a # & # # ; laptop
i am very happy with this product i use it mainly to protect my laptop in my backpack while i travel to class and my laptop seems very safe from my being scratched by my notebooks and books - it is made with strong material that does n't seem to wear easily - my # `` laptop fits fairly snug i guess it could be a tiny bit more snug seeing as this product is also for # . # `` models - on the pricey side there are definitely cheaper options but you will most likely be happy with this one
very nice interior and exterior , and a perfect fit for my # inch lenovo g # my only regret was not buying a sleeve with a pocket i bought a couple nice microfiber wiping clothes with this purchase , but because of the computer 's tight fit in the sleeve , it 's not easy to store the cloth with the computer something to think about if you have a similar idea
looks good , works , and fits my lenovo thinkpad t # s i like the protective sleeve inside the case which prevents the laptop from accidentally falling out when unzipped no complaints here
fit my lenovo thinkpad edge # like a glove quick shipping too smells kind of funny at first -lrb- neoprene does this when it 's fresh -rrb- , but the smell goes away after a few days of use the faux fur interior is incredibly soft and the sleeve also has an extra flap on the inside to hold the laptop in place better i highly recommend this sleeve
i needed a new sleeve for my new work laptop and this one fits it like a glove the laptop is an hp elitebook # p which has a # . # `` display the overall quality of the sleeve is very good the inside is very soft and there is a small flap the folds over the laptop so that the underside of the zipper does not touch the laptop itself the writing on the outside of the sleeve -lrb- on just one side -rrb- says `` notebook second skin `` i would prefer that it said nothing at all , but it 's no big deal
simple neoprene screen that protects like it 's supposed to pros : protects screen , holds notebook securly -lrb- extra neoprene lip inside -rrb- , inside covering prevents scratches cons : laptop nubs poke neoprene tightly so the bottom of the laptop -lrb- part with nubs -rrb- has a <unk> <unk> : no real complaints , it does what i needed it to do
this is a great sleeve for the $ $ $ i needed a case for my # . # `` toshiba and this one fit the bill perfectly my laptop fits in it like a glove with no movement whatsoever based on other reviews , i was a little nervous that this would be too small but it was n't especially nice is the flap that goes over the laptop so the zipper does n't scratch anything if you need a sleeve for your laptop , get this one , you wo n't be disappointed
i 've tried laptop cases & sleeves galore and this is the best i 've tried , so far it 's really well made and of sturdy material the faux fur lining is great because it not only prevents scratches , it actually <unk> the surface of my <unk> notebook i have a # inch widescreen sony vaio <unk> series laptop and it fits perfectly inside the sleeve i highly recommend this to anyone with a # . # inch or # inch notebook
i bought this sleeve for my sony vaio <unk> laptop -lrb- with a # -inch display -rrb- the fit is about as perfect as it gets - not too loose or too tight -lrb- that 's what she said -rrb- the neoprene is good quality and the soft lining has a nice hood that fits over the laptop , shielding it from the top zipper it looks to be a much better and less expensive sleeve than the one sony advertises for this model on its website for those trying to <unk> the line of text at the top of the sleeve -lrb- which i did , <unk> , before purchasing -rrb- , it says `` notebook second skin ``
got this case for teenage daughters new pc lots of padding and smooth inside she loves it and i feel like some protection is now there when she goes off with it to school or <unk> fits # . # `` dell or hp laptop perfect i looked at others at target and best buy this is by far the best padded
this is the third variety of hard case i 've had , and it 's terrible the satin finish is nice because it does n't scratch as easily as the other hard plastic cases but the case itself is ill-fitting the bottom section seemed warped , and finally cracked because it was so stressed by the bad fit and the top part falls off every time i touch my computer i 'm going to have to invest in some double-sided tape to keep the case on i much preferred the satin incase cover i had on my old laptop it was just as light as the `` feather `` weight of this one , and it actually stayed on my laptop
i 've owned the case for less than a year the first one i got i exchanged because it would n't fit the second one i got fits , but has been breaking on both sides of the bottom case there are also cracks in the corners of the case i like the matte surface on the case and i especially love that it is totally opaque it does n't interfere with the laptop closing and is pretty decent with letting the laptop breath in general , it has all the right features , but does n't hold up it 's not worth what i paid
bought this case a couple <unk> ago , and when it arrived i was disappointed to find that it did n't fit the computer properly the top fits fine , but the bottom seems warped it bulges away from the computer in a couple of spots - so badly that the computer does n't sit flat on a table i exchanged it for another one , thinking that i may have gotten a defective one but the second one had the same problem as the first i 'll be returning for a refund on the plus side , the case is very lightweight , and it looks good except for the fingerprints
the case is very nice from a quality stand point , it 's pretty well made and comes with an extra sleeve to slip your mac into however , i was expecting a much different color than what i saw when i opened the package it is probably best described as the color of a <unk> <unk> bike i was expecting something a lot less vibrant when you snap it on to the macbook pro , i felt like it did not stay as well as other cases i 've seen but it still worked the quality of the product is great , it 's just probably not exactly what you expect when you order it
have had good luck with these in the past on other machines i know to be very careful when first installing , but ... still got a # in crack in top left corner during first install hoping it does n't spread further otherwise looks good , and adds a little tacky feeling to prevent slides , drops , etc . a little heavy though
thought this cover looked great to protect my macbook pro , but now i 'm not so sure it comes in annoying packaging , with no instructions its now on my computer , but the left top edge of the top part of the cover got a crack in it while i was putting it on so much for hard shell the crack has n't spread yet , but looks like it will slowly continue to get worse : -lrb- the apple also does n't shine through the cover , its completely blocked out maybe not the greatest choice for the price , and be super careful when you put the cover on your laptop
this case looks great at first but it show finger prints and marks its keeping my macbook safe but i need to clean the cover down to make to look good a couple time a week also the cover makes the laptop <unk> on the bottom with it 's on a desk top
i like this case it is nice and light it feels very smooth , which i prefer over the other hard plastic cases the only sad thing was that the top portion cracked a little when i put it on maybe it is n't that strong but i did get it for a cheaper price than buying from incipio directly i do like it , however , and would purchase it again although i might go through incipio next time
ok so the color is n't really the fluorescent green as shown in the pics if it 's really important you get that color , you may be disappointed it 's closer to the actual name - lime green but the fit is fantastic it does n't shift around and gives the macbook a nice no-slip feel , while adding no bulk whatsoever do n't expect it to protect your baby from a drop ... it 's really just to protect it from scratches
i bought this case supposedly for my new macbook pro # & # # ; and it was on sale at the time i 'm really into <unk> because colors can sometimes be trendy and i will tire of it easily however , when it came , it look looked more masculine than i imagined so i gave it to my husband who has the same laptop as me he instantly loved it and was pleasantly surprised that such a product existed he does n't go to mall as much as i do he liked the idea that not only can it protect his macbook , but that it enables him to identify which macbook is his there are three of us in our household who has # & # # ; macbooks i eventually got myself a more <unk> raspberry incase shell which is just as good , but this incipio is a bit more lighter to carry than mine
while this is lightweight and durable the cutouts on the side block the sd card slot , audio plug-in and one of the usb ports i liked it well enough to actually modify this with a very sharp knife and some effort the sd slot is still blocked , i did n't want to cut too much off the side for fear of the bottom not fitting well so do n't buy this if you have the new # `` mac book pro -lrb- bought mine in <unk> # -rrb- it wo n't work well unless you want to modify it yourself it is made of a very hard plastic and it is not easy to cut i knew if i messed it up i had just tossed $ # away once i modified it i have been very happy with how light it is and i have n't taken it off to see if it has protected the cover well , but i am assuming it is fine the bottom is a little difficult to get off - so it is not a case that i would recommend taking on and off if you need to use the slots on the side this is pricey and there may be other options out there that now work for the version of the mac book pro
it 's a good product , but when i got it from amazon the bottom half of the case was a bit warped which makes the computer uneven but i 've gotten used to it it kinda got back to normal from heat love the color
this cover met most of my expectations , easy to install and very good looking my only <unk> that it does show fingerprints , but it does clean up very easy i would recommend this product to <unk> wants a cover for their macbook incipio macbook pro # <unk> - dark
like some others have said , the color is way off from what is displayed here on the picture it 's a bit darker , which is kind of a disappointment because it makes it look less trendy i almost sent it back when it seemed that it did not fit very well then i found out you actually need to snap it on the back of the macbook , and everything was fine then i was a bit worried about the macbook heating up , because it has been showing a higher temperature but , i am working without the cover now and the temperature shows the same as it was with the cover on it must be the new os x <unk> that 's making it hotter than it used to be i guess
i like it a lot , but the color on the <unk> looks <unk> <unk> than in <unk> <unk> there is no cover above the <unk> , like <unk> on the
like several reviewers here , i was <unk> by the interesting and unusual yellow-green in the picture of this case -lrb- also , by the promise of a <unk> texture -rrb- and as others have said , it 's not that shade in person happily for me , i 'd also bought a green <unk> silicone keyboard cover/protector from amazon -lrb- -lsb- ... -rsb- -rrb- , and the colors are a very close match i never thought i 'd get such a kick out of having a green keyboard and a green cover for the macbook pro , but i ca n't stop looking at them both and enjoying their matching spring <unk> and as for the color difference : i noticed that using a flash when <unk> it causes it to look that cool yellow-green it 's pretty much the same as the color change you see in certain lights , in the green `` <unk> glass `` from the depression <unk> -- pretty weird
literally just got this - went on perfectly it 's the soft <unk> shell case that 's so awesome love the green so great - recommending the brand and the case already
the color is called magenta but that does not do it justice it is more the <unk> color of black raspberry <unk> everytime i look at it , i <unk> it is so beautiful -lrb- should i get a life ? ? ? the fit is perfect on my macbookpro # & # # ; and cleans off very well i had put hand lotion on my hands and could see the marks it wiped right off with no problem i highly recommend this product
i have had this case for about a year now and love it it fits very good and keeps the macbook 's & # # ; <unk> & # # ; factor the apple logo still shines through a little bit , charger <unk> is fine , and no over heating issues just snaps on and takes maybe # seconds to put on i have not taken it off since i put it on and simply clean the case with some alcohol <unk> case is a rubberized material that feels great great buy and would n't use a macbook pro without one
specifically wanted a cover with rubberized texture , so this fits the bill the <unk> colors are a nice change from the typical steel color pretty durable , fits like a glove
this is the best cover i have used so far ! ipearl is the worst and speck being average compared to this one it looks great , feels great and is extremely light ! !
i have never owned a laptop so i did n't know anything about covers and such researched online and spoke to friends product arrived in great condition and i really am glad that i decided to order this one it has a bit if a grip to it so you never feel like it will slip from your hands while carrying it great price too about # . # less than the direct store
item was delivered on time and in great conditions color is similar to the picture , did n't disappoint the logo is not visible which is okay for me since you can tell the product is high quality and it gives it a more mature and professional look
this bag is very cheaply made ... my husband used it only # times before it started falling apart even though it is very inexpensive , it is not worth it because it just ca n't stand having anyone actually use it avoid this bag
this bag arrived with an obnoxious odor due to manufacturing process , i assume it was so bad that i could n't stand being in the same room with it even after washing in a washing machine , it still retained that chemical odor i am returning it right away unless you intend on keeping this out on your porch , i would pass on this one
i know this product is n't that expensive but i was really hoping for something better than this it 's basically a cheaply made bag that 's constructed out of a material that smells like chemicals i actually threw it away because i could n't stand the smell not to mention the fact that i bought it to cart my art supplies around and it 's no better than stuffing everything inside a grocery bag it has no rigidity to it at all , so it just <unk> around everything ; much like a duffle bag
there is absolutely nothing special about this bag it does not <unk> in art supplies that 's for sure i buy the same bags to give to my pc repair customers for the same price as this bag after i have them embroidered the bag can hold a couple of sketch pads , a ruler and a few pencils however , i was expecting a few more pockets to hold all the stuff required in my art courses
i like this bag it was a good value for the price the only thing i did n't like is that the snaps on the flap are bigger than the connector pieces on the bottom , so the handle on top is <unk> making the shoulder strap the only way to carry it still , for the price a very good bag
i <unk> my wife get me this for <unk> i love it i draw quite a bit since i 'm unable to get around and do what i used to due an accident i had in # this bag holds all of my art supplies , i 'm very well pleased i will do business with you again
i think the sleeve is great , but if you have a # -cell battery from dell , do n't purchase this my sleeve has already been worn thin because the battery was too bulky
barely fits my # `` laptop it ` s a good notebook sleeve , but it ` s too small it would never fit a # `` notebook , like i said it barely fits my # `` keep this on mind before purchase it
this bag is oddly sized at # `` x # `` x # `` it is advertised to fit laptops with screen up to # `` but it is too small for my acer aspire # . # `` other than the size issue it is ok it has the pocket on the outside for cables , etc . no padding on the inside though i 'm going to spend the extra # $ for a case logic that actually fits as advertised
i picked this up , but find i use my brief case instead because it does n't have enough room for my folders i find i need to carry if you are only carrying the notebook , it would be perfect
pocket is great for your charger , cds , paper , etc . this fits pretty well for my # . # `` laptop but still has a little extra room -lrb- dell inspiron -rrb- great price and great sleeve for the price
-lrb- + -rrb- very good price , liked the zipper and extra compartment -lrb- - -rrb- materials good , not great good to place into a larger bag , but would n't use it as a standalone layer of <unk> for my # `` macbook pro fit loose , it moved around slightly i know it 's made for laptops > # `` , but for the price , you could n't beat it the extra compartment is nice and roomy carried charger , full size mouse , video cables
i bought this for my hp probook # s and it fits pretty well i was worried about it being too small for my laptop but it was actually a little loose i wish it fit more snug -lrb- especially when i have a pretty large # . # `` laptop -rrb- but it works my main problem is that the padding is rather thin -lrb- especially on the backside -rrb- while i 'd like a little more protection overall since it 's loose and thin , i ca n't really expect much for the price also , a sleeve should almost never be the only source of protection for a laptop i 'm using this in conjunction with a backpack
i really liked this sleeve it has a pocket as well which holds my charger it may smell a little funky when you first open it but i did not regret this buy :
i recently purchase an hp laptop and wanted to a sleeve to keep dust and dirt off the laptop i was going to buy on sale from staples for $ # i got is for less than half that from amazon i like the sleeve it matches my laptop it fits nicely and has an outer pouch where i keep the power cord
the listing of the size on the website did n't quite match what i had received it works great however , and i would definitely purchase this again just be sure to properly read the description of the size measurements
this is the first time i 've bought one of these sleeves - i always used a bag or case before with more storage and padding but , if all you want to do is protect the laptop from minor scrapes and scratches and keep off the dust , this does the trick however , if you want to go through airports with it , you might want to consider something with more padding for greater protection for what it is , it 's well made with a good zipper and storage pouch on the front
i bought this notebook sleeve for my # . # screen hp notebook , to carry it inside a rolling briefcase that has a smaller pocket and does n't fit my laptop it fits my notebook perfectly not tight at all , there is some room to insert and remove the laptop from it with ease the material is excellent , neoprene , and stylish , but i just wished it was a bit more padded nevertheless , it is really good ; i 'm satisfied with this purchase
perfect complement for my hp dv # us it looks great and fits like a glove nice front pocket to keep documents etc . i keep earphones , memory sticks and mp # player in mine
fits my hp well and a great buy for the price buy this instead of anything at best buy or all the other big stores they rip you a new one highly recommend to anyone looking for a sleeve
buy this protector for my laptop dv # c # us also buy it on amazon.com , i saw and i found it excellent , has a good quality , and fits right size of my laptop i recommend it the product is such and such as described in the notice , <unk> amazon
this case keeps my laptop looking its best it fits well and there is plenty of room for an extra mouse and the charging cords it was also way cheaper to buy it here than on -lsb- ...
after long <unk> searching for a case that actually fits the hp envy # ; this is it , <unk> has finally been found this sleeve fits it so well , that it is as if hp made this case specifically for the hp envy # too bad they are n't to help either on my hunt for a proper sleeve or case this sleeve will fit the hp envy snug and safe with almost no unnecessary movement with or without the optional # cell extra long life battery <unk> another plus is the extra compartment for the charger and accessories quality is great in my opinion , i 've used numerous cases too ; it is comparable to the neoprene cases for apple macbookpro 's by incase ; but with a unbeatable and super reasonable price
this sleeve fits my new toshiba laptop perfectly i think it will provide enough protection from scratches and dust great price compared to what i saw in stores even at walmart they were at least $ # for not as good a quality
just what i was looking for , protects my laptop without the big bag to carry around i basically just needed a small case for the time being and this has done the job wonderfully
i bought one of these for my hp pavillion dv # t and loved it so naturally when i bought my wife the same computer , i get her the same one and she loves hers the design is simple and works best as a sleeve to put the laptop in before putting it in a bag
love this item unlike other protective cases , i have been able to send my pc through security in this sleeve that means one less thing for me to worry about while traveling
i sort of wished i never ordered this product i use a backpack for school and usually end up putting my laptop in it instead of carrying this messenger bag on the side the good : it 's stylish , matches my laptop 's design , and it 's spacious enough for the laptop , power cords and mouse the bad : it 's a little too spacious and i wish now that i had gotten a backpack instead of a messenger bag unless you really love the look and prefer a messenger bag , i would pass this up for something more efficient
this bag is awesome more than enough space or some would say a bit too large even after putting all your laptop related stuff you still have enough space to include your documents and files the only drawback i would say is that the closing flap does not provide a secure method of fastening it it has two magnets in each corner of the flap which does not properly or rather tightly hold the flap this is a bit of problem when you try to hold the bag from the top of it -lrb- as we usually do when removing it from the shoulder -rrb- anyway i 've just received it so i 'm not in any position to comment on the durability or the protection against liquids
okay i was really excited to get this product i specifically looked for this product because of the style it completely matched my lappy -lrb- my pet name for my laptop -rrb- this was a great alternative than buying it directly form hp which sold it for $ # i know <unk> overall this product was really good , however i was disappointed that the compartment for the laptop did n't not have padding and the bottom i.e if i drop the bag my laptop is fried but other than that , this is an awesome product ! ! i was worried about the size too but it fit
saw this bag online noted the design as part of the new hp line of computers - i just had to have it when i received it i loved it more space than i know what to do with also got the hp mouse with the design to match what a christmas present for me
as the title says this bag is the perfect fit for the dv # laptop and still has room for text books comfortable with adequate padding for the shoulder and having the strap adjustments on the sides is also a plus the only thing i miss on it -lrb- and i did n't expect to -rrb- was a handle at the top to carry it as a grip as well but that 's why it 's called a messenger bag ... did i mention it looks great
lightweight , durable , enough room for some extra stuff will fit couple of books , charger for macbook pro but , # bucks is still too much you can find similar bags for half of this price -lrb- stm -rrb- overall , satisfied , but wo n't buy it again for my other macbook pro
this messenger bag is exactly as described it holds my # `` macbook air snugly with the locking velcro strap could n't ask for a better bag for the money plus the inside is orange , my favorite color
i 'm a petite person so i did n't want a messenger bag that goes horizontally because it 's just to much i also wanted a bag that did n't scream `` i 'm a laptop bag ! ! `` when i 'm walking around in the city i get tons of compliments on it and is a great bag i love the quality , the pockets , and the fact that is just for my laptop i also get a huge kick out of the fact that they shaped their logo out of the velcro so that 's how the flap attaches best part : the way the <unk> is made is great for when it 's raining it has a sort of lip around it so it wo n't let any water in if you are walking in the rain i feel confident with this bag and would buy it again strap could have some kind of shoulder <unk> because it can dig in -lrb- hence # stars for fit -rrb- , but it 's easy enough to take on off of another bag , or just deal with my # `` macbook
overall is an ok product i bought it for an ipad as it was listed as an option for an ipad bag and my ipad swims inside the bag not the most comfortable bag to carry as the shoulder strap has no padding colors are cool and the design is modern , although someone mentioned it looked like a toilet seat and i have to somewhat agree the inside provides lots of pockets but most of them are n't really that roomy honestly , i 'm thinking of keeping this one until i find another that meets all my criteria to replace it
this bag <unk> macbook pro mb # ll/a # . # -inch <unk> a glove no wobble at all it 's made out of durable and water resistant nylon unlike many other bags i 've seen , this one is designed so that rain water wo n't seep through when the lid is closed the interior is nicely padded it has room for your macbook , <unk> documents , <unk> x # , and a few accessories at the same time , it 's slim and comfortable to wear -- partly due to its vertical design the stitching is nice and clean the only thing i did n't like about it is the color of the interior it 's <unk> lime green -- a bit too tacky for my liking
i researched hours online for the perfect laptop bag for my # `` -lrb- widescreen -rrb- laptop i had a heavy laptop for years and when i purchased my new super thin laptop , i wanted a light bag as well this bag is very thin , which is ideal because i did n't want to carry a bulky backback it fits my laptop , charger , wireless mouse and external hard drive the quality is excellent and the design the best i 've seen it 's amazing how many ugly bags are out there i love the colors and the front is an easy but sturdy velcro snap it has enough little pockets and partitions but do n't get this if you want to cram a lot of extra crap
unfortunately , the laptop pocket compartment which holds the laptop in this backpack is flawed this is because there is padding along the sides of the laptop pocket that ends about an inch from the bottom also , the padding along the bottom of the laptop pocket ends about an inch from the sides therefore , the corners of your laptop will not be protected if you place the bag down on the floor just with even a little bit of force there is no padding on the bottom of the bag itself so the corners of your laptop will pretty much hit the bottom of the bag which then will hit the floor and your laptop could get ruined i sent this bag back immediately when i received it it is a shame because everything else about the backpack was so very nice and i loved it otherwise , but i can not trust the bag to protect my laptop adequately
purchased this backpack for my son attending college and received the backpack in good condition the backpack is the perfect size and has ample room for laptop , books and supplies my son needs to carry , without overpacking however he has had the backpack for five weeks and the stitching has begun to fail and is coming apart at the seams very disappointed with the quality and poor construction of this backpack
i really like the backpack style and compartments but the description says it will fit up to a # & # # ; laptop i have a # . # & # # ; and when i put it in the sleeve the flap does n't cover the end and the zipper rubs against the corners i also have to pull up on the zippers when closing it to get it to go over the corners
lots of room i really like the padding for your back this was a worthwhile investment it has several compartments that make it great to take just about everywhere
