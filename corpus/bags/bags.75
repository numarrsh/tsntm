i am using this sleeve for my # `` acer laptop and i 'm impressed by the quality i have used other notebook sleeves -lrb- some made by brand names -rrb- that felt flimsy and ripped soon after purchase i have only owned this sleeve for a couple weeks , but it feels like it will last the padding on the case logic is thicker than is typical of other notebook sleeves the zipper also seems sturdier than is typical of this type of sleeve with this sleeve , i feel comfortable throwing my notebook in my bag -lrb- as with most sleeves , this one does not have a pocket for power cables . i highly recommend this sleeve it 's by far the best sleeve i have used and the price is <unk> to other sleeves
the case logic # . # inch laptop sleeve is perfect for what i need my # inch laptop fits perfectly and is well protected , even when flying also , tsa did n't require that i remove the laptop from the sleeve , which i thought was an added bonus i recommend this product for anyone who needs a protective sleeve for their laptop
this sleeve fits the proper person who walks around in a suit , the case just has a really upper class look to it it does n't look like a regular bag that has the strap that goes over your shoulder
the laptop case is great but is a bit big for the macbook pro # . # screen - but it is still a cheap alternative but the other cases that are worse quality this quality is really high
i love this case , the color is perfect the only thing is if you have a case on your mac book , its a really tight fit , but it fits none the less perfect and great

once again , case logic hits it out of the park with this case it 's soft yet strong the woven canvas on the sides does a great job holding the whole thing together now granted , it 's probably not going to save your laptop if you drop the thing on the ground but really , you should n't be doing that in the first place this is going to protect your laptop from bumps , scratches , backpack pressure , that kind of thing for laptops of this size , that 's a necessity , and this product does so beautifully at this price i just wish i could rate it higher
- tannin = purple . $ # cheaper than black - fits vaio z -lrb- # -rrb- the dimension of the vaio z is apparently slightly longer , narrower , and thinner than the macbook pro

i needed a just a cheap bit of padding to keep my macbook from getting banged up in my bag reviews of most similar products mentioned that they have a strong `` new `` smell and that smell makes me really sick , so i was so pleased when i opened this one and it was remarkably <unk> unless you 've got really severe <unk> , this is a great product in that regard as for the rest of it , it 's exactly what i was looking for probably not enough to protect your computer if you drop it down a flight of stairs , but i doubt anything in this price range and type would be

this laptop case/sleeve works perfectly on my dell inspiron # z which has an extra capacity battery attached to it the case is simple in design , feels good in the hands , appears to be made of a neoprene material , and has plenty of padding in front and back to protect from damage i purchased this to protect the coated aluminum laptop shell , which had gotten a chip from being placed in my backpack without protection if you are expecting to store your laptop , charger , and/or a wireless mouse , i would suggest looking for another product as this is only big enough for a laptop
i like the color and the material is thick there is a tiny bit of space when i use my # inch mac book pro , but not enough that it moves around a lot with a speck hard case the fit is tighter , but i do not feel like i am stretching the case i am glad that i can use both cases
this sleeve fits my toshiba # . # `` laptop perfectly it has just enough padding to protect the laptop without being too bulky i needed it primarily to use at home for safe storage -- if i were to travel with it , i 'd carry both the computer and sleeve in a larger case to be extra secure i agree with the other positive reviews as to construction quality and for the money i do n't think that there 's a better sleeve on the market , especially for the large size laptop the exterior material is such that it gives one a secure grip when carrying i recommend this sleeve highly , and even though i paid more for mine than the current price , i 'm more than satisfied with my purchase add amazon 's quick shipment and great packaging and you have an unbeatable deal
this item fits my # & # # ; laptop beautifully and seems to be made well it 's easy to handle , non slip and <unk> what i was looking for i love the color and it 's just as shown online

fits my laptop with about # . # inches of <unk> at the zipper i carry my laptop in a backpack or messenger bag and needed a little bit of cushioning to prevent scratching and light bumping it 's neoprene and it wo n't offer much protection from falls but that 's not a big concern for me
i bought this for my acer aspire one and it fits like a glove very understated look and the zipper protection is nice if you get a bigger bag to carry accesories , all of a sudden you 're carrying a big bag the mouse on the acer works fine so there 's no real need to bring a separate one and the battery life is long enough that i do n't need the power cord minimal is good great case if simple is what you 're after
i was so much hoping this case would fit my new # `` laptop , but it was just about an inch too small i should have known better since it was designed for a smaller computer , but i tried anyway because i loved the color choices and thought maybe it would stretch a little it did n't so i sent it back , and amazon was great about sending me the correct size thanks , amazon , for great customer service and <unk> me from my hopeful <unk>

it 's a very good case in my case , its kind of tight because i have a shell -lrb- see <unk> -rrb- to cover my macbook so if you are planning to use shell and case , think about the fitting
so like most people i bought this case so i can carry my macbook in my backpack to take to school i 've looked at best buy and the apple store but all their cases are at least # dollars and honestly nothing was as cute as this pink one this case is also good quality material and looks like it would really protect my macbook very fast shipping -lrb- i ordered # / # and it was on my doorstep on # / # i could n't believe it either ! ! -rrb- and # dollars is definitely a good price for this

what can you say about a neoprene sleeve it works as advertised and fits my # inch macbook perfectly not too thick and not too thin not slippery so no fear about it slipping when walking with it good for a little extra protection in a generic backpack no need to remove from the case at the airport security there is a fairly thick <unk> that keeps the zipper from scratching the laptop as a bonus it holds three long neck <unk> and enough ice to keep them cold for a few hours just be careful of <unk> as the ice melts the second time i got smart and put the ice in a ziploc baggie first
