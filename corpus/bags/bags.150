feels sturdy and well-built , holds all my papers , books and laptop without <unk> great purchase for anybody who lives on the go but has to carry a lot of stuff
i bought this pack because i 'm on motorcycle and it 's great i have a dell mx # , samsung tablet # , document folders etc . with plenty of room left , yet , it 's still compact on the outside has great padding and a nice thick sleeve for the laptop
i am going on vacation soon and wanted a bag that would hold my newly purchased # `` toshiba satellite laptop as well as a few carry-on essentials -lrb- books , camera , ipod , etc -rrb- i read several reviews on this bag and decided to give it a try , as i 've never purchased a bag specifically made for laptops upon receipt , i <unk> investigated the bag and found that it was everything i wanted this is a very <unk> bag , and it also comes with a removable sleeve for the laptop itself , which is a great value there are a lot of handy storage pockets all over , and when i put my laptop in the top pocket and put the bag on , it felt light and very comfortable there is good padding all around the bag and my laptop will be very safe and protected this is a wonderful item ! !
got the bag for college to carry my lenovo yoga and just as a laptop bag and was very impressed with all the room it has for storage but still remains thin enough to not look like a freshman
bought this backpack for my husband to carry his stuff and laptop to work after # months of everyday use the backpack is suitable to a business casual corporate environment , looks expensive enough , no unnecessary decorations the quality is very high , all stitches and zippers are intact when fully packed , looks large , but not puffy when there 's just a laptop and some papers in it , it keeps the & # # ; smaller & # # ; shape very well straps are very comfortable for both one - and <unk> wearing laptop sleeve is very convenient , keeps laptop safe and easy to remove would recommend it to anyone who wants to look and feel comfortable and serious
spacey , with many pockets and a couple places to slip your laptop awesome woven material seems very strong , very hardy and long lasting just from the looks of this bag i expect it to last me a decade or more
i decided to buy this item because it seemed to have a good quality , but after only # months its handle is already unraveling also , the wheels rolls inside of the bag , what means that it will be hitting your stuff inside of the main compartment i do n't recommend this bag
this product is well made and a great size , but the handle is poorly made i was afraid that it would break very quickly , since i travel a lot and would use it frequently i usually pack a laptop and two changes of clothes -lrb- all of which fit into this -rrb- , but it makes the case somewhat heavy when it is packed , the handle twists , making it difficult to maneuver
bought this for my husband since he wanted something like this liked everything about it , but the handle thought about sending it back because the handle <unk> so much - especially on one side i know it 's suppose to give a little , but it just seemed unsteady and that it might not last long
i do n't use this for daily work or even # day trips but i do use it when i 'm flying away and plan to be gone for several days it 's not functional for me for daily use but i think it works well if you are using it to take a couple of computers + accessories on an extended trip with flights involved
overall i like this bag the compartments are very useful for having easy access to my cell phone , pens , credit cards , etc . i also really like that there is a clip to secure clothes in the main portion of the case and keep them separate from the place for a laptop and/or files my main complaint is that it does not roll as well as other luggage that i own the handle is pretty flimsy when you extend it which makes it challenging to maneuver also , i had trouble with the zipper i do n't mean to be overly negative because you do get a lot for the price however , based on other reviews , i was expecting it to be better than it is
a very quality product and a bit larger and heavier than expected i use it <unk> now but it serves well for a quick overnighter when i want to take along my laptop
- all the space in it is great to carry clothes on a small trip - decently padded compartment for laptop computers - front pocket is very useful - rolls smooth - the handle is attached with a zipper -lrb- not sewed -rrb- it took very few days to open up and it 's impossible to fix unless you sew it together that made it look ugly - the sewing on the corners are kinda ugly and looks it 's badly made not a big deal if they sew the handle instead of putting a zipper , it would get # stars good product for it 's price
i can fit most of what i need in this bag along with my laptop it is like my rolling office of course , just like everything else , you wish it had just a little more room it seems to roll along well and goes up and down steps just fine i am pretty hard on things and thus far have had no issues with the zippers or wheels i would have given it # stars had it been just a tad bigger
purchased this identical model from a discount store years ago it is very durable and the perfect size for air travelers that must fly on small <unk> planes because , unlike most carry-on luggage , this unit fits nicely under the seat in front i travel a lot and basically beat my solo to a <unk> at long last , the handle finally gave out , everything else about it is as good as new looking for a replacement , i was surprised to find the exact same model on amazon and at a lower price than what i paid for it at a super discount store years ago
i do n't travel a lot with a laptop , but was fly to another location for # weeks and needed to carry files and a laptop i am a small female and really wanted something i could fit under the seat - but even though some bags said they would fit , their measurements were incorrect when i got them home i had purchased several different bags prior to my trip but they were so heavy i could not carry or lift to an overhead i had # day to make a decision and after reading the reviews , went with this bag it arrived the next day -lrb- thanks amazon ! -rrb- and it was perfect it could have held much more than i had in it - but it was the weight i could carry it was very tight rolling down the aisles of the airplane , but i was able to get it into an overhead without any trouble after my husband saw this , he said he wants to use it in place of the one he has i am very happy with my purchase
i no longer had a space to call my own when i went per <unk> so all <unk> material comes with me to wherever i am covering for the day has worked out well
i bought this bag with the idea of having something affordable that could help me for overnight trips , but with low expectations my experience is far beyond what i expected although it seems small , i managed to put all i needed for an overnight trip for my son and myself , plus the laptop and documents the small lock it has on the sides to avoid the full luggage compartment opens completely is very useful to keep the <unk> of what you carry , whereas allows you to reach the computer and documents the only improvement i see is a more rigid handling system , which with the bag fully loaded seems a little weak otherwise is a great bag fully recommended for the <unk>
i received the rolling laptop bag quickly and it was in perfect condition i have received countless compliments on it it is small enough to fit under your desk , in the front seat of your car , or overhead on a plane it is large enough to fit my laptop , ipad , clothes and shoes for one night or two the front compartments hold my cell phone , charger cables , and file folders the handle can be short or long , and i have no issues with it
i used it on a three week trip and it was a dream to have enough space for a <unk> / office supplies . etc . a simple design makes it not <unk> noticable the handle extended well and locked at the desired level a pleasure to use
i am a travelling teacher so am nearly attached to this bag during the school year i ordered this one to replace the exact one i 'd had the older one survived over # years of heavy use and abuse the only reason i was replacing was the telescoping handle stopped working like i said , i was very hard on it and was impressed it lasted as long as it did hoping this one will be as good or better
works great and has plenty of room but is still the smallest rolling laptop bag i could find fits very easy in the plane over head compartment , even on little puddle <unk> planes
i bought this for my # year old father who drags his laptop everywhere when traveling this is a light duty bag that fits the laptop , a few magazines & files and your phone & ipod light weigh and wheels that work fine if you do n't overload it if you are looking for a briefcase to drag everything in it , this is not the bag for you
this is my second purchase of this bag my first purchase was almost # years ago , for an earlier but similar model i travel weekly for work and although i am still using my original bag , the wheels are wearing out and i was looking for a replacement the bag holds an overnight change of clothes and the files i need for work i like this bag because it stands while i access the files and does n't fall over i can carry my laptop bag on the handles and it is easy to maneuver through check-in and tsa it fits in almost any overhead space and can even fit under the seat , if it is one of the full under seat spaces , not the smaller end ones the interior pockets in the new bag are different from the old , i 'm not certain if the configuration is better or not but those are the details i will just make work i 've seen others and for the price i have not found a more functional work case
it is not too small or too large . it serves the purpose i use it for work because i did not want to carry my work equipment on my shoulder i am enjoying this product so far i 'm waiting to see what it does going through snow i 'll recommend this bag to others confidently
i am a road warrior and so far this is the best laptop rolling bag i ever owned the only weakness is the handle , the fabric opened underneath after very heavy usage people with expensive victorinox looked at my bag with envy it looks professional , is roomy , but still can fit in the overhead bin of small airplanes i hope solo will keep producing this bag for a very long time
nice netbook envelope that comes with a front pocket fits a # inch asus netbook with ease carrying handle feels a little insubstantial , but has a velcro tab to hold the two parts together and provide stability the front pocket is small and works mainly for usb drives and other small pieces of equipment i would not suggest placing the netbook power cord in the pocket as that may cause undue pressure on the screen overall , if you are looking for a nice small carrying case for the netbook then this works well and has a nice feel
i am happy when a product meets my expectations , and i am able to use it for the reason i purchased it in the first place i am happy that i can shove all sorts of things into this little netbook carrier it expands , and it is convenient it arrived in a timely manner to my location in south korea it was shipped all the way from the states
this netbook sleeve is exactly what i was looking for - it 's very compact and slim , yet has handles for carrying i 've used both a sleeve and a laptop bag in the past for carrying ease , and the kroo glove accomplishes both things i ordered the black and it 's simple and attractive i have a dell netbook with a larger # hour battery and it fits into this sleeve with room to spare i could not fit in the charger cord in the front pocket , but i 'm not complaining given that this product is meant to be very minimal the kroo glove looks pretty durable and is made of some synthetic stretchy material it does seem to attract a lot of lint , but it 's been easy to brush of
i needed a cover for my netbook and was relieved and delighted to find this product a perfect fit . i use it travelling and it has held up well and protected my
the bag is very lightweight , the padding offers great protection it fits in my bag , or sometimes i use the handles -lrb- great idea ! the only thing is that the power cord makes it seem awkward , i often leave the cord at home or toss it in my purse
this netbook case was everything i was looking for at a great price it is small , has carrying handles that fold out of the way , and has an external zippered compartment for some small items the craftsmanship and quality of this case is excellent the zipper is made well and it keeps my netbook safe i highly recommend this to anyone looking for a netbook case
this case works great for my new asus netbook the case is very well made , with a zippered side pocket for the charger and some other small gear , and it has a good handle the neoprene construction provides good <unk> protection i would definitely recommend this case
this product is well made and something different than the same old black <unk> covers the handle is nice and makes it easier to carry the pocket is big enough for me
i found the kroo glove sleeve to be very attractive , and well made , however , if you add any accessories , it really is a tight fit i have an acer netbook -lrb- # `` -rrb- and it is very difficult to put anything else in the sleeve
this bag is nicely made and is a good fit for a netbook it 's attractive , and a bright color and my granddaughter loves to carry her netbook and all her attachments around in this book sleeve it also provide a lot of security if she happen to drop it i would recommend this to anyone who is buying a netbook for a young child
we purchased this as a gift for our <unk> net book & she loves it it was true to size , she loves the front pocket she keeps her mouse in there & the full handle is a great feature because she travels out of her house with it weekly !
i purchased two of the kroo glove sleeve 's to accompany my children 's netbooks last christmas -lrb- # red and # blue -rrb- almost # year later and the sleeve is in excellent condition stylish and durable
overall , these are great labels in terms of their shape and size , but i had issues with half of the box when i ran them through a laser printer half the time they would jam up in the printer once they do go through , they are fine , but do you really want to keep rushing to the printer to clear a jam and start your process all over again not my favorite post it product
we dont have a <unk> need for name badges in our household , nor in professional lives , but this label format is excellent for labeling the large <unk> storage bins that we use for <unk> storage in the house these are perfect for that task since they are sizable and yet not too big the labels feed well through our hp <unk> printer , and while we 've only used less than half of the labels in this pack , not one page has <unk> or had a label come off in the printer the -lsb- ... -rsb- site has a microsoft word template that works well with this but , if they are going with the ms office line of products , i would have liked to see ms <unk> templates available online
i used these labels with a hp brand wifi home inkjet printer used microsoft office xp and found template online the printing process was painless - no smears , <unk> and graphics printed clearly and evenly , and no stickers got stuck on the printer
this is really super sticky , but have n't had any issues on any surfaces also , the label itself is nice and bright and easy to <unk> on the perforations are easy to rip off as well
yes , these labels come with a page of directions about how to get on the post-it website to get the template so you can print out information on the labels without trial and error of lining things up unfortunately the directions did n't help me much and i had instead to turn to my computer knowledge to know which files to open once the template had downloaded i used a mac , perhaps the directions were n't for macs once i had the template it was easy to use and the ink stayed on it well the labels themselves stuck on a variety of fabrics and damaged none even after being on for four hours under moderate levels of activity my <unk> who wore them really liked them a lot and that was the most important criteria for me
the post-it super sticky name badge labels are a really great product i facilitate classes regularly with groups of new people who do not know each other and the name badge is necessary i have tried other brands that just do not stick long enough to complete a half day of class , let alone a full day since i started using the post-it super sticky ... it holds true to the super sticky hype and it has not <unk> or ruined anyone 's <unk> i highly recommend this product
having recently attended an event where my name tag would n't stay on , i must say that i like these super sticky name tags the tags are on sheets to be run through the computer and printed , just as the more familiar address labels are done what 's not to like well , this is my caution : if you use these for an event , be aware that they are not recommended for some fabrics such as corduroy , silk and leather picture this , you have a conference with printed tags , but a <unk> with a <unk> blazer comes in what are your options , catch him before he puts the tag on or wonder if all the fuzz is going to come off with the <unk> later for this reason , these have limited practicality
this is your typical sticky name badge it is fairly large , so it easy to spot from a distance if you do not wish to use a printer to create your text it is just as easy to write on these badges with a permanent marker
i got these for an alternative use : big labels for notebooks i wanted to print my logo on them too , so i went to the avery website and was able to use their label maker to get the job done the name <unk> are super sticky but also able to be removed off shiny folders i think the price is a bit steep , thus the # stars , but the product in general works as described and i like that i can use it for other purposes
these held up very well over a day for adults at meetings that combined some sitting -lrb- listening to presentations -rrb- to standing and moving around -lrb- <unk> groups <unk> , <unk> , ... -rrb- most of the people were in <unk> -- clothing that flexes more than business suits -lrb- and similar -rrb- many took off the badges when they went out to lunch , <unk> them for the afternoon most of my labels were <unk> , so i do n't have enough experience to comment on how <unk> handle them
i thought these had a nice amount of stickiness -lrb- i do n't like them too sticky -rrb- , but my wife said they are not sticky enough -- she was concerned they would fall off therefore , it really comes down to personal preference if you like super-sticky name badges that wo n't come off , then these might not be sticky enough for you -lrb- they seemed secure to me but not to my wife -rrb- if , however , you do n't like super-sticky name badges that try to pull the threads out of your clothes , then these are a good match i have used name badges that constantly fell off , and these seem more secure than those my only complaint would be the price tag , which seems a bit high note that these badges are plain -lrb- no `` hello , my name is ... `` -rrb- , so you can put whatever message you like on them
these name badge labels do stand up to their description they are definitely super sticky i would be very careful about using them on delicate clothing or clothing that might not be able to handle the pull from removing the extremely sticky tags the badges were really easy to use and finding the template was a breeze i would definitely purchase them again if i needed <unk> to stay on all day i will not use them for any type of event where people dress up ; i would not want to be responsible for the damage to the clothing
the best part of the post-it super sticky name badge labels are that they actually stay stuck to your clothes they in fact , conform to your clothing so if the fabric moves or wrinkles , it 'll stay put it is not recommended you use them for leather , suede , silk , velvet , corduroy , plastic or delicate fabrics there are a fair amount of labels in the pack for the money . # sheets of # labels per sheet microsoft word has the avery template # , which works with these or get the # <unk> template from post-it 's website they are both laser and inkjet compatible and i was successfully able to print them without jamming or the labels peeling off inside the printer as far as name badge labels go , these are great why bother getting labels that do n't stay stuck when you can get the post-it super sticky name badge labels ?
there is n't much to say about labels but these do the job they are n't hard to peel off they stay put you can write on them easily , and they are good for labeling larger <unk> moving boxes -lrb- my intended use -rrb-
i actually used these to make labels for my son 's toy bins each label had <unk> pictures the labels are a brilliant white , and create <unk> , clear pictures i made a mistake , and they came off cleanly these are sticking great my son has a habit of dumping the bins , tossing them around the labels weeks later are still just as crisp as the day i put them on i think these are great for multiple uses
well , they work great as name badges . not so great if you are a # year old who , loves sticking stickers all over her body ... or actually , the removing was the hard part
i have used these labels to tag any number of electronics cords prior to shipment to a new home ; in addition , the labels worked well as luggage address tags on an air trip recommend folks keep some sheets of these for the unexpected needs around the house , whether in the home office , garage or <unk> items
the first thing i noticed about this badge is that i could n't rip it it is very durable and sleek compared to the paper stickers i 've used in the past you can also send these through your printer so you can <unk> name badges markers work great on it , too the one drawback is that it should n't be used on some fabrics -lrb- leather , suede , velvet , corduroy , silk -rrb- i have n't tried it on these fabrics , but if it is an issue , you might think twice about setting them out for general use at a <unk>
i am using these as labels for various boxes of stuff i was n't sure they would take pen & ink hand markings as well as printer <unk> , but they seem to work fine , peeling easily and sticking well
i really like this product i use the stickers in my classroom for a variety of purposes they work well for labeling pocket folders that are use for various <unk> but they are perfect as name tags they stick well and actually last throughout the day without <unk> due to movement they are pulled easily from clothing without damaging fabric very good deal and highly recommended
these name badges are fantastic they do n't have frames around the individual labels , so they 're easy to <unk> off the sheet and there are no sticky <unk> of scraps <unk> the check-in table the finish is smooth and satiny , but not shiny and they seem more flexible than others i 've used they really do stay in place , instead of pealing up and popping off when you move around - they sort of flow with the fabric you 're wearing i used these to identify <unk> at an outdoor event in the past , we 've used expensive <unk> when we need name tags that will last all day , but the post-it super <unk> were up to the task , and saved us money i 'll only use these in the future they 're that good ** update ** i 'm back for my third purchase of these name badges - the last time i used them , some people complained that stick on name tags never stay stuck those same people came back later to ask what brand these were , because they absolutely did stick beyond expectations
these are sticking great my son has a habit of dumping the bins , tossing them around the labels weeks later are still just as crisp as the day i put them on i think these are great for multiple uses
they function as advertised i only wish my version of ms word had a more user friendly interface built in it was trial and error to print individual labels in a font that was <unk> to the size
yes , these name badge labels are everything you 'd expect from post-it . they stick very well , but can also be <unk> although i did n't try them in an inkjet , they worked fine for my laser printer -- just always remember to make the effort to feed them straight -lrb- no labels work if you are really sloppy about jamming them into the printer . i could n't find anything bad about these labels they do just what name badge labels are supposed to do
recommend this product i 've tried lots of brands of <unk> <unk> , but this is the only brand of <unk> <unk> <unk> that stay on for the entire meeting without <unk> only problem is trying to find them looked at all the usual office supply stores and they were out bought all that amazon had
i was glad to review this product as i happen to have a need for name badges often i put these in the printer and had absolutely no problem neatly putting the information on each badge they looked great and were very easy to take off the paper and use this product does what it says it will if you need name badges these will fit the bill
these are very good labels they stick adequately to most surfaces , but very easy to remove just like post-it notes , no residue is left on the surface i have used them to mark storage boxes <unk> space to write multiple lines they are not ` super sticky ' in a bad way - they are defintely not permanent easy to use , easy to write on , and nicely packaged
i really like these badges they are very easy to write on and the ink stays bright i also like the material they are made of the texture is nicer than any badge i 've ever used i also like how easily the badge comes off different types of fabric and can be replaced back on a different fabric and still sticks this is a very good reason to purchase these labels due to the versatility of the use on different fabrics and it does n't leave any residue
i actually used these for purposes other than name badges , despite the fact that the package says `` intended for use on clothing only `` due to the fact that they stick very strongly and come off very smoothly , they are highly versatile i used them as labels for folders and notebooks , and was able to remove them without any problems i have no doubt they would work perfectly as name badges as well these badges are not cheap but you are paying for the high quality of post-it they also came in a big box that ensured they would not be bent
these labels are very durable and the writing stays clear on them i used some of them as name tags for my class of second graders on field trips one set i used a computer to <unk> names on them and the other group i used sharpie both ways worked well and the names stayed clear to read and did not <unk> the tags stayed on the kids and did not fall off or slide into jackets which happens frequently with other brands very nice quality i will buy these to keep in stock
it 's fairly difficult to review labels , as they really do n't differ much one from another that being said , yes they are sticky as advertised , and they do a good job of taking ink without smudging what else is really needed in a label
the # m company has gotten out of the label business entirely i called and spoke to the company about it if you have these labels , enjoy them while you can i searched a while on the internet and was not able to find any vendor who still had them in stock i 've tried different brands of name badge labels , and these were worth the extra cost -- because they really did stick
these avery labels are durable , do n't peel , and are plain white and may be used for many purposes having used a number of inferior labels that peel off and do n't stick on clothing or notebooks , i am glad to have these the labels come in sheets of eight and may be run through either a laser printer or inkjet
if the forces behind one of society 's growing <unk> chat sessions requires you to get a name tag , this product does an adequate job at <unk> the dubious need for <unk> it 's sticky and visible enough to get you through the event so that you can get back to work or <unk> to work
very nice , as you 'd expect from post-it thicker , but very flexible , <unk> stickers that do not leave residue on the surface you put them on great for conferences , parties , and much more great for kids ' art projects as well as putting names on kids sweaters -lrb- i do n't think i 'd put any stickers on <unk> or other surfaces like leather , although you might be able to with these nice to be able to reposition these good for use with plastic name tag , over the neck name badges can use inkjet or laser great quality and these not leaving residue puts them ahead of the rest if you 've ever used stickers that leave residue , or you simply ca n't get it off period , then you know what i mean great for labeling containers for organization as well -lrb- if you move one item from one container to another , you can simply use the same tag !
these name badge labels are fantastically sticky , durable , and useful for a whole number of tasks if i may kindly suggest their use for <unk> jamming and sticker <unk> ; they are , indeed , a perfect <unk> they adhere well to clean , smooth -lrb- non <unk> -rrb- surfaces , and also to clothing the size of the package is generous -lrb- # labels ! -rrb- and <unk> i am pleased with this item and believe that its use should not be restricted to the <unk> office <unk> or <unk> professional , but extend to the reaches of all involved in contemporary society also useful for labeling leftovers in the fridge -lrb- item , date , etc . .
the stickers are very sticky , and work absolutely great the paper finish is very nice , suitable for full color stickers online templates make this product easy to use with a printer i not only used this at a little open house we had , but i also used it to label some plastic containers . they are more multipurpose than the name suggests really , quite excellent
great name <unk> <unk> cleanly through the printer , easily peels off backing <unk> finish that really prints beautifully and <unk> and the paper backing is perforated so that you can separate all the labels without removing them from the backing i 've tried them on cloth as name tags and on plastic as labels and they stick well , even in the cold i 've had problems with both removable and permanent labels sticking anything in the cold , and have had particular problems with plastic bags and <unk> our place is freezing right now & the labels are nice and sticky , not coming up on the edges , but they can easily be removed without tearing if necessary
if you 've ever experienced the frustration of having your name tag drop off after about # minutes at a meeting , you need to try these ! # m has sticky stuff figured out relatively pricey , but i 'll never go back to any other brand
i love that these are <unk> they are the `` super sticky `` version so they may stick a little too much at times but they are great i 'm using them to label the kids sock drawers . to put a list of <unk> on the fridge to make reminder notes for people at church to label storage containers a great addition to labels
in a nutshell , these super-sticky labels simply stay on fabric much longer than the ordinary labels available up till now perfect for <unk> <unk> where the <unk> need to know each other 's name
these are very great name badge labels they do n't smudge when you write with them with a marker or pen they peel very easily from the backing paper they stick very well to most clothes materials they are very easy to remove from clothes they do n't damage or leave any residue on the clothes as well
the post-it name badges feed easily through my laser printer i have not experienced any jamming , which is always a potential problem with label products -lrb- i did not try them in an inkjet inkjet <unk> are prone to run when wet , so be aware of that if you intend to use these on an inkjet . the <unk> templates worked perfectly in microsoft word the labels are easy to pull off the back and adhere well to clothes , even <unk> about # or # changes in positions -lrb- after that they begin to curl -rrb- so as far as name badge labels go , these post-it super sticky badges do everything well you wo n't go wrong purchasing these
i like the super sticky name badge labels by post-it first , they are easy to remove from their backing there is ample room between the labels , which allows the user to quickly and easily peel it off the backing second , they have a nice , smooth feel to them the paper is soft and bright third , they adhere to fabric nicely without leaving a sticky film behind i 've used the stickers on jeans and fleece i would n't trust using these on expensive materials , like <unk> , but they adhere well to ordinary material lastly , the labels come with instructions to make printing from an inkjet or laser printer simple
having used many different kinds of labels over the years i know that most labels do n't stick to fabrics most stick on name tags do n't do well unless they 're <unk> to a simple cotton t-shirt or something similar i tried these on many different fabrics - denim , cable knit sweaters of varying <unk> , polyester , <unk> , cotton , even suede , leather and water resistant jackets i tried bending the fabrics so the corners would start to come off although the corners may lift a bit , the rest of the tag holds tight and remained that way for over # hours when i eventually removed them removal is fine - no damage to the fabric even on suede and leather -lrb- the manufacturer <unk> against using the tags on these fabrics but i did n't run into any problems -rrb- i did n't run into any issues printing on the labels i was able to print edge to edge on the labels using the <unk> on the avery # template sometimes when using ` compatible ' templates i have to work a little inside the <unk> of the template to get all the text to fit , but this one works fine as is i highly recommend these name badges
i 've had this case for about a year now -lrb- unfortunately longer than the # month warranty -rrb- and i like the case , but i 've had to repair several things most of the metal parts on the case were made from a flawed steel that was too brittle the strap adjustment bracket , and both zipper pulls have snapped off they actually <unk> into pieces also , the stitching on the shoulder pad pulled out it 's a bummer that these things broke because i love the case otherwise
the first case i got had issues and the general design could be a bit better they send me a whole replacement quickly and seems to made better , but i have not left with the laptop in it yet the zips tabs broke after maybe three uses and the strap piece broke after i slung it on my shoulder on the second try the placement of pouches could use a little work , but not much of issue the large <unk> called a power supply for my asus g # vw has trouble fitting with all the cables that i carried in my old targus bag i really like the case design , but i would recommend that they beef up the zippers and metal piece on the strap to ensure it lasts for a long time
i received my case a few days ago and was first impressed by the look and the build quality i read the reviews on amazon before but did n't pay too much attention to the critical ones however , the experiences of other customers seem to be absolutely correct although the case is nicely build and feels solid there are some flaws during the first use the adjustment slider for the shoulder strap broke into pieces instantly it is a very delicate cast aluminum slider that can not hold any weight luckily , i did n't drop my laptop on the floor i have n't broken the zippers so far but i can see that this might be a weak point as well
poor design , cheaper made , zipper design is poor the bag also is constantly wanting to tip over forward buyer beware ... the price is great but the quality has gone back big time
the sherpa pack was a good investment for me i had purchased another model previous to this , made by swiss , but the shoulder straps wore out within a week from all the stuff i was carrying around this pack is definitely a good investment its not the largest pack swiss makes but for everyday commuting , school , it definitely holds a great deal of stuff i usually carry two laptops , and college books in the pack , plus electronics for everyday life , chargers , cables etc . . . worth the price
i am not a backpack person , so i do not love how heavy and bulky it feels however , i love that it stands up itself and fits my laptop and tons of other paperwork really well if you are a backpack person , then i am sure you will like it more than i do
got this for my wife to carry her laptop and other work things she loves it an says there is plenty of room , which is saying a lot for all of her stuff lots of storage and looks pretty sharp too
strong and sturdy enough to take a real beating and still be in great condition it seems like most backpacks are too small to hold all of my <unk> 's books , computer and lunch , but this one is perfect actually , this is our second backpack in this style the first one lasted longer than any other bag we every had and when it finally wore out after years of daily use , we searched all over for the exact same bag
took a shirt trip for three days this was all i needed held all my clothes for the trip and both my work and personal ipads bought for <unk> like that and family outings too , but mainly for <unk> <unk> and keeping <unk> you 're looking i 'd recommend it is
been using this backpack for over a year and it not only met all my expectations but it actually looks pretty cool too computer sits in protected and withing a snug
my son used this backpack for both # th and # th grades it was showing wear so we ordered another of the exact same one because he loved this one it has place for a laptop , a thick <unk> , and several handy smaller zipped pockets for umbrella , pencils , keys , etc . what he like the most was the expandable front pocket that allowed him to put his lunch box right in the bag , in the front , where it did n't get crushed straps were well cushioned too a superb backpack that held up really well for two full years
this bag fits everything i need it to for my college classes i 'm currently a commuter and must take everything with me for the day , and this holds it all durable and comfortable
the case is small , if you only want to put the dvd player in it then this will work for you it will protect the player from hard <unk> but it will not be big enough for the earphones and cords i also did not receive the color i ordered i had to go and buy another case big enough to hold the dvd player , ear phones and cords they are using this case to hold the dvds
i was expecting pink , because thats what the description said , specifically because i bought her the pink sony dvd player , but the item we received was red also it states being of sony brand , which i dont believe it is , it came in a clear plastic sleeve and has no sony branding on item , in fact no branding at all it has # little red circles on the zipper pulls also there is no room for the charger inside which isnt great having said that , it is well made , my complaints are that it is not sony -lrb- which is what we thought we were paying for -rrb- and came in a different color than described my daughter was disappointed it wasnt pink to match her dvd player , but it looks sturdy and will last a while
i purchased this case for my daughter 's portable dvd player that she got for christmas her dvd player is # -inches , but this case definitely has a lot of extra room around the player it is a bit bulky , and took up a lot of room in our carry-on during a recent airplane trip because it is a hard case it thoroughly protects the player , and has a nice netted space for dvd 's and a charger
the case certainly has held up all this time ... but after reading a description of what was supposed to come with the case i must say i am a bit dissapointed this was a gift , so i had no idea what came with the case , but mine did not come <unk> the pen/pencil holder , or the # slot holder , or the strap but , i am still dragging it around the country with me when i travel , and it does a fantastic job i would recommend this to anyone buying a portable cd player , it will keep it safe and sound thank you so much
we have three granddaughters who love watching dvd 's on the long trip to grandma and <unk> 's home we purchased a pink dvd player for them for christmas which did n't come with a case so when we saw this pink case we new it was the perfect case to protect their dvd player when not in use
