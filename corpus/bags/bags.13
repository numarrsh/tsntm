this backpack works great it is large enough to hold my # `` hp monster i ride a bicycle to work and the support is wonderful i have no issues with stress on my shoulders or back i have only had it for a month or so , so i can not attest to the durability of the backpack i gave it a four out of five due to the fact there are no slots for cds or other media and no pen/pencil holders everything is kinda just thrown into the compartments also , why do all the other swiss gear backpacks have a specific spot for mp # players and this one does not i could n't figure that one out all in all a great backpack and it will have room for the largest laptops
this bag is really nice lot 's of room when i travelled i used to take a laptop bag for my laptop and a messenger bag with reading material , etc . with this bag , i only need to take it when i travel for carry on i can fit my laptop , accessories and several books and all the other info i need in it easily it is also comfortable to carry the separate ipod compartment is very handy my only complaint is when i carry on in an aisle seat depending on the airline and cabin type it is hard or impossible to get under the seat in an aisle fortunately everytime that has happened , there has been plenty of bing space so it was n't an issue
i have been using the pegasus for my dell e # ; a # `` widescreen all zippers work beautifully , and the stitching is very clean the padding makes it quite comfortable to tote this large laptop anywhere <unk> it is very clean , and due to its color choices it does not show light dirt my only concern is a lack of padding where the backpack covers the top corners of the laptop -lrb- when oriented in the bag -rrb- essentially , the compartment 's zipper runs along the side and top corners as a backpack , in general , there is ample room to stash whatever you may need to carry i was satisfied with my purchase
the pack holds my laptop , along with the associated cords , <unk> , etc . very well there is adequate space for my mp # , radio , calculator , <unk> , etc to be stored , as well as a few <unk> thick files unit stands vertical most of the time as advertised price point was excellent as compared with the bricks and <unk> store
this backpack has plenty of storage for a # . # widescreen easily <unk> for books , documents , pens , an external hdd , phone , etc . there 's even drink holders on the sides the zippers , handle , straps , and stitching are top-notch the bottom is even a little rubberized to take a beating the pads on the <unk> are nice when walking across campus the only drawback after a month of use is that one of the decorative metal rivets on the outside came off -lrb- three on the front in picture -rrb- frankly , i could put it back on , but it 's just decoration the functionality of this pack is great and i recommend it
`` this laptop backpack fits my toshiba satellite x # -s # inch perfectly , even with a belkin # inch neoprene sleeve on it also has an elastic latching system to secure the laptop , with decent cushioning the bag has three main compartments , two side pockets and one easy access pocket with an mp # player slot and strap plus ample cushioning all in all a great bag at a very decent price .
this is the second swissgear laptop bag we ordered to fit our new # `` hp the first was supposed to fit a # `` but did n't - this one does , but my only beef is that the top zipper is still really close to the nice glossy corners of our new computer the number of pockets and compartments are great and the bag is really well padded i think this bag would really protect the computer in the event of an accident or fall i would definitely recommend this bag , especially if you are having trouble finding one for a # `` notebook
this is my third purchase of this exact bag now do n't get me wrong , i purchased the last one for myself the other two were purchased through my employer i used this bag for numerous trips to china it has plenty of space i even carry an <unk> set of clothes in it in case my luggage gets lost the first bag had a buckle that held the computer in a padded pocket - the buckle broke there were no issues with the second one the third one has a buckle design that was replaced with velcro i 'm not so sure i like the velcro better since it makes a ripping sound to get the computer out , but it holds it just fine i have recommended this bag to several other co workers and they all buy this bag
this is my first swissgear product although i have been thinking about getting one for a while i have been disappointed with other types of bags in the past and therefore am a hard sell the structure of the backpack is great with consideration to reinforcement and overall <unk> there are a ton of storage pockets for everything you could want to travel with it 's really the perfect carry-on , especially if you need to house a # inch laptop it looks pretty stylish too which was n't as important to me but a nice extra i would recommend this backpack to anyone
the bag is excellent for my requirements it is rugged , easy to carry , looks professional and fits my # `` hp pavilion entertainment pc without any problems i am also able to fit <unk> , <unk> and some sports clothes at the same time the only <unk> was the handling and courier costs which were more than the cost of the bag , however it was my choice to purchase as i could not get this item via retail in australia
i really like my pegasus my # `` macbook pro fits great and it is amazing how much more can fit into the pockets i have never been much of a backpack person before , using attaches , so the cable handle lets me carry it easily the straps also adjust easily to fit on the handle of my rolling suitcase bottom line , i 'm really pleased with this purchase
i 've owned this backpack for about # months and i 've been very satisfied with it i use it for business so i carry it around with all day i 've enjoyed having all of the compartments one thing i did not consider when i was shopping for a backpack was whether or not it would stand upright or fall over when sat down turns out that it stands up quite well which is important to me because it keeps my laptop and other electronics from taking any unnecessary bumps my seller experience was perfect item was shipped as advertised , properly packaged , and within the quoted shipping time
great backpack , fit my # `` thinkpad with no issue , i love the design , space and <unk> highly recommended for someone who on the road and hate the old fashion briefcases
i just bought this backpack for my dell xps m # laptop and it fits perfect , i could n't ask for a better bag i also have my cooling fan , pda , mouse , games with instruction booklets and other accessories and the bag does n't look bulky at all i highly recommend this backpack for any # `` laptop
i bought this product from amazon , and not only did it arrive at my house a week early , it met and exceeded all <unk> it comfortably fits my hp dv # -inch laptop with room for college books , pens , pencils , etc . i am extremely pleased with my purchase , and would reccomend this bag to anyone who asks about it furthermore , the bag 's support system is excellent , with heavy padding on your upper and lower back , along with a shock absorbing strap system the bag also includes a <unk> strap for when it is heavily loaded all in all , this is most likely the most satisfied i have ever been with a backpack
tried a # & # # ; laptop backpack , too small i could n't haul all my travel gear tried a # & # # ; roller bag , too big it would n't fit in any of the overhead compartments on the smaller airplanes and i <unk> & # # ; t i also didn & # # ; t like the roller bag as i prefer to have two hands free finally i tried this bag , and it is perfect fits all my gear , is comfortable , looks snazzy , and leaves me hands free great bag , i doubt you & # # ; ll be disappointed
it was built with high quality <unk> material , plenty of room and it also comes with many pockets that i can put everything i have to bring in
this backup has comfort to the extreme i use it both for school and for work the front pockets are great for carrying <unk> while the main pockets are best for full sized <unk> the top pouch is awesome i use it for everything i need to quickly grab almost like a little man purse <unk>
i just received my swissgear pegasus and it 's all that i expected everything from my old bag fit perfect and still enough room for much more all the little pockets for water bottle cellphone , great ca n't say enough good things and no cons so far
this thing is good for someone who needs to get organized or who is organized its got pockets every where and the lap top compartment has got plenty of protection all in all the best out there its awesome !
i need a good fit back pack to go there and back again from my office and clients , and take care of my laptop at the same time this back pack fits like a glove to me it is plenty of room , i usually put some clothes change that make it seems too over charged but after all it does the work i have not used it on the rain and do n't know if it offers coverage to my stuff but anyway i do n't plan to go to mountains too often it is a good choice and looks good
i bought this for my wife for her laptop this is a real quality product that will last plenty of compartments for the laptop , cords , files , and other gadgets padding in just the right places backpack is comfortable to wear i 'm very happy with my purchase
great backpack ! ! ! everything about this backpack is high quality -lrb- tough durable materials -rrb- it <unk> my expectations . it has a lot of room and is very organized so you can have full use . extremely comfortable even when it is loaded to the max i would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a backpack with a lot of storage and laptop storage features i am a college student and have been using it for # weeks
a friend had used one of these for more than two years , and was still in great shape i love this backpack , and it is n't that much more than a cheapie i carry a # inch windows laptop , my macbook , an ipad , two mice and lots of stuff in mine it is n't the lightest around , but you can have durability or super light weight - this strikes a good balance would also be great for a college student
this is the second wenger computer backpack i have purchased it was purchased as a gift i am still using the first one and it looks great after # years the construction is very durable there is plenty of space for a laptops and all its accessories , plus books , folders , pens , cds , extra cables so so forth i could not recommend it more highly
this is simply an outstanding , sturdy backpack that has been well thought out to store your # `` laptop , books , and all other necessities for school or when you 're on the road for work the <unk> top zippers make it very easy to get at anything , and it has ample side pockets needed to store your laptop power cord , bottle of water , etc . it 's not bulky at all , stands upright well and looks very sharp you ca n't go wrong with this bag
when my previous backpack broke , i thought i would upgrade to a notebook backpack that could carry my monstrous # & # # ; dell inspiron # r i am extremely happy with it 's ability to carry the notebook one thing to note is that it is heavy , however this is because it is for protecting a notebook and other various electronics
i purchased this backpack for my son he travels alot and said the craftsmanship in this product is super he can easily fit his laptop and all of the extras he carries after searching for a case and finding others that were all too small , this one fits his needs
this backpack is all that is promoted to be , i have a # & # # ; xps with a large battery and it fits perfectly even if the laptop uses much of the bag 's space , i am still able to comfortably put in my agenda and work related things the straps are extremely comfortable all in all a great
i highly recommend this pack for any business traveler it has all the compartments you need for various items it is comfortable and stands up no matter how full or empty the only negative i have is its lack of clips for keys and such i bought some carabiners for my car key -lrb- so i do not worry about it falling out in the airport or wherever -rrb-
this is the ultimate laptop bag plenty of room for your laptop in a secure , padded pocket , as well as plenty of room for all your other accessories the padding on the back of the bag helps cushion the weight as you wear it the handle is even reinforced with a steel <unk> of material on the inside of it the best thing of all - the bottom is designed to keep the bag upright when you set it down no falling over get this bag
this has been an excellent case so far i replaced a belkin messenger back with this backpack style swissgear bag , and i have had # problems so far it definitely feels sturdy , and the zippers seem nice and strong -lrb- that was the biggest problem on my previous bag , the zippers breaking -rrb- and there is definitely plenty of storage space i recently packed in two laptops -lrb- including my # `` dell studio with extended battery -rrb- , a tablet , all supporting power adapters , extra mouse , other random stuff , and the bag did n't even <unk> everything fit nicely it also feels comfortable when wearing it overall , i 'm extremely pleased with this bag i 've seen a few other folks using swissgear bags and have gotten nothing but positive feedback from them , so these guys seem to have it together pretty well it 's pricier than some other bags , but considering i likely wo n't have to replace the bag every # years , it will actually end up being cheaper in the long run
i bought this backpack because i have had previous swiss gear backpacks and really liked their durability i was looking for one which could hold an # & # # ; laptop it is a tight fit , but this backpack does the job
purchased this backpack as a gift for someone who has a # `` macbook pro - his laptop fits perfectly , and he has plenty of room for other cables , small books , etc . comfortable to wear and very aesthetically pleasing
i 'm impressed with the design and quality of construction most products i buy i can see several areas for improvement but not this one only unknown is how long it will hold up i 'll have to write another review # years from now
the backpack is very durable and has loads of storage capacity i use my backpack daily for work and store all my network tools the only thing i would have liked which my old pack had was storage pouches inside the pack to hold my small items my backpack is my office so i do carry quite a bit from site to site
i bought this backpack for my son 's computer and he loves it he said `` it 's awesome ! i have not seen it as i had it shipped directly to him , but he is very picky and if he says it 's awesome then i know it is a good product i searched many different backpacks for weeks before selecting this one and my research paid off my main concern was that it would fit his macbook pro which is the larger size laptop and he said it fits great he is in the military so he is on the go a lot
this is a really great backpack it packs all your essentials - laptop , files , ipod , cds etc . plus it has enough space to fit your books or even extra pair of clothes inside i have used it in a multi-purpose fashion i use it as an office backpack and also as my travel backpack it has enough different pockets to store all things in a very neat fashion
seen a coworker who had this same backpack also , his son was on his # th year of college using the same pegasus need less to say , its durable and thats why i bought it rugged handle and straps and material and zippers only con is mesh side pockets for water bottles , etc are too small for all but the smallest bottles also , mine doesnt have a & # # ; thru hole & # # ; for ipod cables , seems like some do and some dont
it is really nice it is same as the descriptions i can not be more happier with it i have used for more than # years it is same as
i used this for almost # years to carry my computer and tools to a factory that was under construction it held up really well with all the abuse it got on a daily basis unfortunately , i had to leave it with the company when i left that job otherwise i would probably still have it
pros : huge ! ! ! i was able to fit my # . # laptop , # `` cooling bed , all my clothes , my car and suv and still had room for # children and a dog very well build bag cons : missing a jet pack other thoughts : <unk> gear put a ton of thought into creating this bag even when sitting on the ground , your laptop never touches it the inside `` chamber `` that holds the laptop is suspended off the bottom of the bag ... . this is the only bag that i have come across to have this feature for extra protection against water , put your lappy into a sleeve with the zipper facing down
a back pack for men a back pack for the <unk> this back pack is one of the best bags i have ever bought and its cheaper on amazon then in staples its a winner for size , compartments , laptop cushion and security from drops it has a ipad slot for my ipad that keeps things just as secure all other compartments are a plus i recommend this to anyone who needs a solid long term bag that can with stand any <unk> conditions and situation that can kill your bag
i am a consultant , so i carry my laptop and supplies to work with me everyday i need a pack that can handle a fairly heavy load and also keep the contents safe i have found the wenger packs to be one of the best packs a <unk> this they also seem to corner the market on having enough compartments to keep all of my different devices organized and safe
i bought my first pegasus # or # years ago and it lasted me until last month that says a lot about how well built these are it 's a great backpack , and has saved my laptops from some pretty <unk> accidental drops i highly recommend it
i bought this backpack <unk> hoping it would accommodate my macbook pro # i fits very snugly and comfortably i really appreciate all of the extra space this bag affords there are plenty of pockets for cables , adapters , disks , drives , etc . and lots of space for books , folders , microphones , or any other `` <unk> `` gear you might need to carry it 's very well made i 've only had it for a couple months , but it seems as durable as anything i 've seen the price is the real kicker there are dozens of nylon computer bags out there at twice the price , that are n't half as useful or well-made if you 're looking for a back-pack type computer bag for a macbook pro # , look no further
this bag is great i needed something to carry my # `` dell and my # `` dell and this bag does the trick it is a little heavy with both laptops & accessories , and would be a fantastic product if it had wheels , but it meets all of my immediate needs in it 's current state i do n't think i 'll ever get around to using all of the storage compartments
i bought this backpack in # and even now it looks and functions like a new one i have been using this bag for my work and school for almost four years now and have no complaints against it i feel like this backpack will last forever if i have to buy another one i will definitely go with another swissgear
i never really got into the knapsack thing until this new job and both my counter parts have them i went ahead and sprung for one and just made the transition over to it it is very well made and the storage space is well thought out you definitely get what you pay for i am an it <unk> and carry my laptop , some cables , my notepads , and the convenience of throwing this over your shoulder and having everything self contained in one device is very convenient and comfortable i do n't review much here so hope this helped
we purchased this items for our college student and he just loves it it has tons of storage for all he needs to carry and it also keeps his laptop safe very sturdy and he says its comfortable and easy to carry even when stuffed full
purchased this as a gift and had it mailed directly to the recipient he just loved it it 's just what he needed to keep his computer safe while in transit i researched bookbags before i purchased and this brand seemed to be the best great price at amazon and fast shipping too
this pack is exactly what i was looking for i have a dell # `` laptop and this backpack has a perfect pouch in the back the laptop fits perfectly and there are a ton of other pockets throughout some might say it is heavy , though is it not that bad at all there are lighter packs out there , but this one fits the # `` and is very durable the laptop fits in a <unk> pouch in the very back , making me feel better in case i drop it or something crazy happens all zips are easy to open , the finish is fantastic ; the grip up top is a wire rope ... yes , wire rope with a plastic handle over the top of it it is not nylon that might tear or rip , but a real wire that is attached to two screws at the ends looks very durable and i expect to use it for all my airline travels , and those camping trips we dig so much they get an a + from me , and i am extremely picky
love the backpack fits a # `` laptop easily has a large amount of storage space , well constructed and great organizational pockets could n't ask for a better backpack to carry the laptop for <unk> best part of all , half price compared to office stores
now i 've only had this # days , but it is awesome it holds a # inch laptop with ease i load this backpack up with a ton of stuff and it is very supportive it does not hurt my back like my northface <unk> did this feels like great quality and i feel it will last a very long time
i feel comfortable carrying my laptop bc the extra padding is great . lot of space to store books and anything of the like . not to mention the shipping came on time . no complaints
i saw this backpack in an apple store in my local mall i was very impressed , but did n't want to spend the $ # on this bag since i was positive that i could find it cheaper online i was right my wife actually pointed me towards the pegasus over the other two popular types i 'm glad that i chose this one , as it 's excellent i own a dell inspiron e # and it fits perfectly in the bag however , i do want to point out that though it looks big enough to carry around a <unk> <unk> , it 's actually smaller than the picture looks also , the mp # pocket is just a storage pocket , there is n't any aux . output to listen to your mp # player while it 's in your bag also , i can put complete <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> # , <unk> <unk> and complete warrior in addition to my laptop
i <unk> an old # & # # ; dell inspiron laptop that i found -lrb- one of those old , fat white ones -rrb- because it had a # screen -lrb- great for <unk> -rrb- i had trouble fitting it in my old backpack and always loved the styling and protection offered by <unk> this backpack fits the # & # # ; laptop , power adapter , wireless mouse , # & # # ; / # & # # ; tablet , and two textbooks no problem i really like the easy access pocket in the front for my phone charger and laptop mouse the cushioning makes it very easy to handle overall also , the backpack is modern and professional very happy with this purchase overall
this backpack is stellar i travel a ton for work -lrb- ~ # flights a week -rrb- and this has made my travelling much easier to deal with lots of pockets and lots of
as an <unk> highschool student i needed a backpack that could take real punishment i usually go through a couple each year i now have my first laptop and needed something that would protect it and allow me to still keep several text books as well i chose this one as it has steel cables and swissgear is known for it great construction i 've been using it for about a month and it still looks brand-new ; but time will tell several of my friends have had theirs since the beginning of term and have had great luck with them i do n't need luck , i need real protection and i think this is the one i 'll keep you posted as the year goes on
this book bag is great i can put my # . # laptop in there with out a problem , but not even . . and also i can put # laptops in there , and carry all my book from school this bag is amazing , i would highly recommend it to someone that needs a roomy bag to carry around a lot of things . p.s if you buy it , buy it from <unk> # , this person has some good deals
this is my second laptop bag ; -lrb- swissgear pegasus -rrb- this bag can handle up to a # `` laptop and has lots of room for other storage it is also built very well and will hold up to a lot of abuse i am hard on my bags i have a jansport odyssey # and after # months it is showing wear i give this bag high marks
this is the best computer backpack i 've ever owned i wish i used a backpack instead of a normal laptop bag long ago this is very sturdy , has tons of storage areas , and easily fits my <unk> # . # inch laptop -lrb- which is very large -rrb- the top handle you can carry it with very well made and <unk> it is also very comfortable when carrying on the back i have not tried to carry extra books in it yet with the laptop so i do n't know comfortable it would be but if i did n't overpack it , i would guess it will still be very comfortable i saw this same backpack selling at office depot for $ # . # more so this price on amazon is a good price
the case is small and only covers the camera , there is no room for an extra battery you are better served by buying a single extra battery and a better case
this case is listed as fitting the nikon p # camera it does not you can squeeze it in width-wise , but the cover does n't even come close to closing do not order this case if you want to use it for a p #
this nikon # leather case is a perfect fit for the nikon p # compact camera it does protect the camera from scratches and dust , but the padding is minimal , so it wo n't help if you drop the camera the $ # price is a bargain for this good looking , well made case the nikon # fabric case is also a perfect fit for the p # camera and also costs $ # the fabric case has a little more padding and also a built-in battery pocket , so it is a little bigger and a little <unk> nikon fabric case - soft case for digital photo camera -
the case works extremely well as a belt case my only current hesitation is that i do no know how durable it will prove to be my only criticism is that with the shipping i probably paid more than i should have -lrb- as compared to buying a <unk> case from walmart -rrb-
this is made of a high quality soft leather , and looks to be very well stiched the nikon logo is subtle my only concern is that the sides are open at the top about the top third of each end is exposed one good thing about this layout , is that if you attach your camera strap , it will be exposed outside of the case
buyer beware ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! after having this bag a little over a year the handle and wheel assembly is totally <unk> and falling apart i tried to get this repaired because of the & # # ; lifetime warranty & # # ; but but i was told the mechanical parts are only covered in first year now they want to <unk> $ # plus shipping to replace the wheel assembly in the future i will go with another brand that stands behind their products
the bag is huge but nothing fits inside it doesnt fit in most airplane hallways either you have to carry it when walking to your seat it is also very heavy even when it is empty with laptop inside it looks bulky and the leather looks like plastic not happy at all ! would not recommend i will get a samsonite next time
i was so disappointed when i received this bag the material is stiff and cheap looking and the plastic roller that attaches to the bag is clunky and ugly the plastic roller broke in my first week of using it i used it one week and threw it away it 's a waste of money
after ordering this bag from a different <unk> several months ago i was very satisfied with my order and went to purchase a # nd bag however , after looking over the pictures and <unk> it is the same bag , the bag i received was widely different first of all if you look at the pictures you can clearly seen on the red bag that they are <unk> two different bags , and selling it as # type of bag one has the back completely covered and is a very smooth leather finish the other one is a plastic finish and part of the bag is exposed also the handles are different i can tell you after receiving both types of bags , the one with the leather finish and the square handle is a much higher quality bag it is more functional and a lot better built the black bag i ordered , shown in all the pictures as the bag i wanted , is not the bag i received i feel this was a <unk> of the item i received and overall i was very dissatisfied with the way amazon handled the purchase
it is too heavy , it did not fit under the seat in front of me on the plane -lrb- that was the whole purpose of this bag -rrb- after putting my laptop , there was n't that much space to put all my belongs from my purse i got this briefcase thinking i can consolidate to one ? laptop <unk> its definitely not going to work and when i looked at the receipt to return , i <unk> out my order date was # th of august and although i did n't get the bag until the # th ? so my # day money back has expired
i bought this bag because of the detachable cart the cart is great but the bag is made from very cheap looking leather , i wont ever use it , it looks and feels like plastic i took the bag off and use the cart with my own bag
the pull cart is so cheaply made and <unk> , i have my doubts it will support my # & # # ; laptop for long wheeling through any rough ground like <unk> will likely snap the handle it has absolutely no rigidity or strength the briefcase is okay it is hard leather as some have noted may soften up with time smaller interior , but seems well put together for the laptop and a few files or # ring binder i 'm hanging onto it because its $ # . # shipping to return it i wo n't be using it daily i would not recommend it for daily or frequent use
i love the look and quality however it is not a travel nice as i would like i carry it down many plane isle as it 's to wide to roll smoothly and it does not fit under all seats isle sets almost never i have only used it on <unk> flights but have been on # planes , carried it on at least # of them and it did not fit under the seat on # or # of them
the bag itself looks nice , but the attached roller assembly is very cheap and the handle quite rickety ... not what i would expect from a bag in this price range the bag has not & # # ; broken in & # # ; over time ... still very rigid if you want this for looks , and occasional use carrying very little , this might be your choice if you want a workhorse that looks good ... look elsewhere
i 've had this bag for a year and it has held up great if you travel on many regional jets , the bag will not fit under the seat in front of you and barely fits in the overhead bin it will fit underneath the seat of a regular jet but is too wide to be rolled down the isle which is not a huge issue but i 've loaded it to # pounds a couple times on accident
i really like the bag but it is not as pictured after reading a lot of reviews i thought i had found the bag that zips onto the roller part this bag from this vendor has # clips that attaches the bag i love the color and dimensions of the bag , so i have decided to keep it but want future buyers to be aware it did come with the cover to keep it clean as you travel and # extra clip as they come off completely and are probably going to be easy to lose also , the handle is different than the one pictured
i have been carrying this bag for over # . # years for work i get a lot of compliments on it as it is so rare to find a large , feminine laptop bag i 've taken it on about # airplane trips and dragged it through offices pros : it 's attractive and holds the massive # inch laptop i need for work it is sturdy cons : there is not much room for books and other items i can fit in several spiral notebooks , but binders are an issue it is nice that the bag separates from the <unk> , but a # in laptop weighs so much that i never want to use it without the wheels if you have minimal additional paperwork and intend to use this with the <unk> attached , it is a great bag for ladies
i travel a lot and need a bag that can survive getting pulled , <unk> under seats , above in airline overheads , etc and still look good this one has <unk> really well after # months the hard plastic backing on the wheely part protects the bag from getting scratched and the wheels are sturdy and have -lrb- so far -rrb- survived bouncing up and down sidewalk curbs with no visible signs of wearing down its a nice thick leather and stitching giving it a quality look # -rrb- the interior laptop section is too small for my # & # # ; laptop this could be a result of me not reading the product details enough but the laptop does fit nicely in the bag itself in the general interior section # -rrb- the wheels stick out a little wider than the bag itself and i get caught up a lot around corners -lrb- e.g . turning into a smaller <unk> aisle -rrb- not a big deal , just takes a bit to get used to swinging it wider than other laptop <unk> i 've owned overall : worth the money
i purchased this bag to transport my # inch laptop back and forth from my tax office it is a nice bag but could be a little bigger my laptop fits , but it is hard to zip when it 's in there also , the handle could be a little sturdier
ordered the bag that had # main compartment zippers and received the one with one zipper i do n't <unk> i will order from this company again as you can not trust the photos of the items
i am very happy with this briefcase the quality and style have exceeded my expectations it is plenty big enough for my laptop , accessories , and work folders the rolls smoothly and looks great since it is leather it might be heavier than some , but since it is on rollers that has not been an issue i love that the rollers are removable if i decide to carry it alone
i have had two previous -lrb- zipper -rrb- versions of this bag i was worried that i would n't like the clips i love them i previously had a slightly different model i love the roominess of <unk> i like the zipper pocket versus the snap great all around
i have a heavy # & # # ; laptop and travel frequently for business i had a big bulky rolling bag and wanted to replace it with something more compact this bag is a beautiful deep red color and high quality leather there is very little room for much besides the laptop though , which is fine by me i found it easy to disconnect the bag from the roller cart and it comes with a nice shoulder strap that they do n't show in the picture there is a weather cover that also comes with it - a nice touch happy with my purchase
i am getting older and have back problems i travel # states to # nursing facilities for training i finally decided to get a laptop bag on wheels and this one is the best it can hold much more than my laptop so it is perfect , of course the color is me , me , me
the dimensions given for the <unk> bag are incorrect the correct dimensions are # . # x # . # x # . # this bag is bigger than the <unk> , which are the dimensions used in this listing -lrb- # x # x # -rrb- that said , the bag is nice , and it has a new connect and disconnect system that uses clips , not zippers i think a new write-up is in order , though , as this is clearly incorrect
this bag is perfect for hauling around my # inch # lb work laptop the detachable wheel housing is durable and goes over curbs and bumpy parking lots easily the handle is easy to both expand and collapse this is an overall durable , stylish and usable laptop bag there is plenty of room inside the interior with places to keep files , pens , cell phone , etc . so glad i purchased it
after years of a backpack , i wanted something more professional and polished i love my briefcase , and the deep red color is perfect i mostly use it without the wheels , but when i 'm traveling , they make it a dream for running through airports they did n't feel quite sturdy enough at first , but they have been put to the test lately and passed only minus , i think i would 've liked one size smaller for daily use ... this size is quite large - but i usually use all the space available anyway
this case is roomy enough for my # `` laptop and accessories , yet it can fit under an airplane seat when you remove the wheel frame the telescoping handle opens and closes easily the case even comes with a raincoat -lrb- protective cover -rrb- very good quality and quite stylish
after searching far and wide for a backpack that would easily accomodate my # `` screen laptop , i purchased the targus it is roomy , sturdy , and fits much more than just the computer it was a great buy update : thirteen months of use -lrb- although not extraordinary wear and tear -rrb- have taken a toll on this backpack i recently noticed that the outside left shoulder seam is coming <unk> after paying this much for a bag , i 'd expect more and am disappointed
this backpack is too big considering i 'm not very tall -lrb- i 'm # ' and the backpack width is longer than my shoulder -rrb- , but it can fit my # `` laptop easily i did n't want to carry this backpack to school because it will look <unk> on me i still keep it in my room , and found the use of this bag when i went to a camping trip it can fill as many items as you want for a # days trip , so at least it 's not wasted after all
i am having shoulder pains from carrying my bags only on one side of my shoulders i am looking for a backpack that does n't look like an elementary school children 's backpack i am looking for something that looks more like a purse i thought that this backpack was exactly what i needed but it is too long ! ! it 's constantly bouncing off my rear regardless of how much i shorten the shoulder straps and therefore i get back pains i think i am returning it
nice look , light weight , good bag less rigid than i expected and bigger ; i have a # `` macbook pro , i would have prefered the bag to be smaller other than that , it is as shown with # half height pockets of which one is easily accessed on the top flap if you hold the bag on the left shoulder only -lrb- i really appreciate that -rrb- flying papers tend to get crumpled because the only place to put them is in the main compartment -lrb- they can go with the computer though -rrb-
this backpack is exactly what i wanted i 've just gotten into a <unk> search , and this will carry my notebook , accessories and necessaries with room to spare easy to carry around libraries , <unk> and wherever else i need to go it arrived right on time and in perfect condition
i got this backpack for my son who is in college , he loves it and was surprised and glad it has so much room , not only for his computer but books , workout clothes etc . .
i 've had this for # years and traveled around the world and back with it durable , solid , well built , can carry loads comfortably water resistance is what you trade for the high quality cotton canvas but i like the natural material feel and look as it 's aged will have me coming back to case logic for my next
i was looking for something to carry my # . # `` hp that did n't look like a laptop bag this works great , especially for the $ # that i paid for it yes , it is missing water bottle holders and organizational pockets i will live i can organize myself into # pockets and manage to carry my water in a sealed bottle
it does the job and i still use it today -- had it for almost a year the problem is the stitching on the inner lining -- the stitching that <unk> the outer canvas material with the inner material soon after i bought the bag the stitching began to fail this made for an unwanted hole between the lining , sort of a third pocket where small things tend to fall and get hidden -- like my jump drive or ipod <unk> the other negative is the outer side pockets , the latches that keep them closed they unlock with just a slight nudge not a big deal since those side pockets are very deep and nothing will fall out unless the bag gets turned upside down the bag has a nice look and is roomy , and was cheap just poor stitching
this bag is great i 'm using it to carry my macbook # `` and fits perfect <unk> all the accesories including a # genius <unk> the design is great and the material seems like will last forever the only bad thing is the side <unk> , does n't fit anything and when you put something inside , it 's very <unk> to reach due to the size of the pockets p.s . sorry for my english
