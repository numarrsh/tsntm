my wife and i use the neoprene case for <unk> and our small kids use the nomad rugged case there is a small opening for the cable to fit into the hard drive without ever taking the hard drive out of the case works great ! they have dropped it plenty of times and no issues the hd is completely protected in the case i 've been using it for # months soo far a great purchase
i ordered this case along with a # tb wd external hard drive this case comes with silicone `` padding `` -lrb- i guess you could call it that -rrb- , which can be switched out with an included , smaller pad to fit your hard drive perfectly it 's not too big and bulky , and the added size and weight is definitely worth it i always keep my hard drive in here , and it even has a port on the bottom -lrb- which has a cover on it -rrb- for convenience of <unk> i would say this case is a must have for anyone with an external wd , which are prone to death when dropped or bumped - pros : water , dust , and mud resistant protects from drops up to # feet best way to keep a hard drive safe in transit - cons :
i got this hard drive case for my travels it is extremely durable and is really not that bulky compared to other soft hard drive cases i got this for less than $ # so it is well worth the price i paid i would say it is a must have for frequent travelers
when there comes to speak about protection , this rugged case is first level great product from wd it fits perfectly the my passport external hard drive model and you can use the external usb # . # cable to connect your hd directly without opening it it gives the protection that i was looking for
if you want to protect your wd portable you need to buy this case and he will protect it against scuffs , scratch and some hit which will cause some data lose inside your drive
a great shock absorbing protective hard drive case i drop my hard drive surprisingly often and this case is perfect for protecting the drive it looks good and protects the drive as well recommended if you go to tough places with your data storage or are just clumsy with it like me
i 'm on the go a lot , so i needed something i could throw in my backpack without worrying about there is no doubt in my mind that this will be able to protect my hard drive for what i use it for , and could definitely handle much more it 's a solid case that 's gon na keep my drive spinning until it fails on it 's own one possible downside that you should be aware of is it 's size it 's significantly larger , heavier , and bulkier than the hd alone but if this is n't a big deal for you , you 'll be glad you bought it also , i got this case for my # tb my passport for mac my <unk> was n't on the list of compatible drives -lrb- <unk> -rrb- , but it fit perfect
the wd nomad rugged case should help if i drop my wd my passport # tb portable external usb # . # hard drive sometime you keep the hard drive in the case , so you do n't have to be putting it in and taking it out the wire attaches easily through the case makes it easy and secure to carry the hard drive between home and office for use on different computers i also bought two upgraded wires so i do n't have to carry one of those back and forth as well
this product is fantastic , its hd fits perfectly inside the case , and you do not need to remove the hd from inside your case to connect to the computer the product seems to protect well your hd i am very pleased with my
almost looks like pelican built it other than the connector access port , it would be waterproof it 's well padded and holds my hard drive snugly well built , solid little box
the cover i received was not what i was expecting to get it shows finger prints so easily and they are hard to get off i would n't recommend this type of cover
the item snaps on to the keyboard and your wrists end up being scraped by the clip on part the quality was okay it is just the way it is made that makes it hard to work with
i am a teacher and purchased this product -lrb- <unk> blue crystal # inch hard case cover see thru -rrb- for my new macbook pro # . # `` laptop in august i move my laptop around my room throughout the day , from my desk to the smart board , etc . so it sees a good bit of activity the color is amazing and i love it , but the case is rather cheap it is truly plastic and cracks very easily i am replacing the cover because there are already cracks on the corners and it is scratched i am going to choose the rubberized cover this time and see if it 's any better
the case is quality and everything but i was under the impression it had a cut out over the apple symbol my fault for not reading through everything other than that it is a great
after having a few scratches on my macbook i decided enough was enough and looked for a cheap case to put on the laptop to protect from further wear i decided on this product because it was n't too expensive when i received the case everything was aligned well and the case did n't block any ports ; however , the case did n't really look good the part of the case that covers the top of the macbook when opened was n't uniformly cut and was more of a wave shape this part of the case was also more clear than others which made it look weird after about a week of usage this top part also <unk> a crack , leading down to the front of the case i just decided that scratches were a part of usage and showed character , so i took the case off if you really want a case for your computer , get this one but be aware that it is n't of the greatest quality
for those who bought the newest model after october , # , this case was too big for the newest pro # `` i hope to get a replace or something and the seller should make a more conspicuous note about this either in the title or the product description
the case is pretty functional i bought it as a present for my girlfriend but i think the only problems she has had so far are trouble getting the case on in the first place and i know it has fallen off occasionally other than that it 's a good hard case that has protected her computer well
i ordered this product because it was cheap and i thought a black macbook would look cool when i received the package i was surprised to see that there was no apple logo cut out and that the case is <unk> now honestly this case still looks pretty sweet and i do n't regret buying it but the product is n't what the pictures and description make it out the be
i picked this up to protect my new mbp and it fit perfectly the installation was easy since it just snapped into position i prefer the clear since it lets the sleekness of the laptop show through i liked it enough to recommend it to my mom when she picked up a new air
i am a little disappointed in the hard case 's resistance to scratches but the whole point is to protect the laptop , not the hard case and in that regard this hard case does the job exceptionally well i would list this as a must-have for any macbook owner
i love the case but the picture here seems different from the actual case here it looks more metallic but it 's actually plastic and a bit clear overall , i love the case it fits perfectly and is my favorite
i really like this case for my mac pro it stands out from the rest of them in a great way easy to get on and off it you need to i had to take the case off to clean it but it came with no problem and my mac looked brand new under the cover so it is doing its job the only think is part of the cover sticks up a little so i had to reposition my hands for typing a bit overall i would recommend this to anyone that ask im m going to buy other colors soon from the same company
i will admit i like the speck case better -lrb- my wife has one on her macbook -rrb- , however for the difference in price , i do n't find it to be a justifiable difference in cost they both stay on the laptops well without movement the speck just seems to be made of a more durable material , but that 's all
i got this case shortly after i purchased my mac when i first took it out of the box it looked too large for my computer , but it fits perfectly and i love the way that the apple on the front is cut out so that you can see it when it glows up also i put some decal stickers under it so that they do n't fall off and they are easily seen through the translucent case the only down side that this case has it that crumbs and dust do build up under the case near the edges , so i have to take it off and dust every so
the case is great , its strong and so far , it has n't broken also , i really like the way it looks on my computer the one thing i did n't like about it is that , if you close the computer , the back part is completely exposed , so it does n't completely cover the whole computer aside from that , i really like it
looks super nice for the price i paid i was very impressed i have referred a friend over to you the only thing i did n't care for is how the package came i expected it to be in a nice padded box so it would n't get broken , but it came in a <unk> with plastic covering it i quickly opened to make sure it was n't broken that is all i do n't approve of
this case has proven to be both cute and durable the only issue i have with it is that fingerprints show up quite easily on it it also appears to be a pearly pink the the picture but it 's not -- it 's more of a matted pink
it 's stylish but the bottom does n't fit as snug as other cases i 've purchased the top fits perfectly though and there 's a cutout right where the apple is so that it stays lit up bright
i 've had this case for for about # months and it does a great job of protecting my laptop but after about # months the quality of the material starts fading and becoming almost soft
when you have matching laptops with your spouse it 's really cute - until someone takes the wrong laptop to work this hard case was our solution it arrived fast and fits perfectly i do only use the top and not the base because i just wanted to easily tell them apart the base was fine and fitted well , i just decided not to use it
i ordered this cover for my macbook -lrb- # in . -rrb- to protect it from scratched and to keep it clean i received the order earlier than expected it 's also a perfect fit for my macbook it is plastic , a little see-thru but looks great i 'm very happy with it i may order the pink one next . =
bought this guy when i first got my mac , about a year ago , and it 's still going strong have dropped it on it 's corner a couple times , and it 's chipped a little , but kept my computer completely in tact thinking about buying the pink one too
this case was true to the description and i like it a lot easy to apply to my mac and i like the rubber feet and how it keeps my mac from sliding all over table top surfaces also the cover not only protects my machine , but enhances the look good decision on my part
i was a bit worried ordering this case because there was no reviews but it was the color i wanted so i just went ahead and ordered it . . and i love it shipping was very fast -lrb- i ordered on saturday and received it on tuesday -rrb- and it fits my macbook pro perfectly the color looks great and i think it 'll do a great job of protecting my macbook from scratches and such
i got this case for my daughter for christmas and she just loves it the color is just as it shows and it goes on easily i also bought myself the same cover in purple after she opened it and put it on her laptop , i could n't wait to put mine on too i have a friend with a cover she purchased from apple for $ # , and this cover is as good if not better
got this right away it fits perfect awesome color : d please get this i recommended # percent i dont regret ordering this it protects my laptop and at the same time its very pretty and shiny love it
this case is the best case you can get for the price the case is very protective and is thick enough to protect it from small falls the gray option is very nice and i highly recommend it if you 're hesitant to buy it , dont be ! buy it now !
orderd this case for my <unk> 's apple lap top she has the first model that came out i went thru several ones to find they did not fit . make sure you know the right one shipping did go wrong due to my error of wrong address , but was fixed and <unk> in a timely manner thank you so much to sender .
i ordered this case right after i got my computer and i have had it for almost a year my case held up pretty well considering i dropped my computer once or twice the corners eventually cracked a bit but other than that the case was fine my computer has no scratches and looks practically new even though i dropped it i just ordered another case -lrb- the rubberized hard case -rrb- and i hope it does the job just like this one i would definitely recommend this
i purchased this as a gift for one of my kids and decided to keep it and use myself love the color and it has really helped keep my computer clean
i bought this to replace my daughter 's cover that got cracked because she dropped her laptop and the cover did the job and protected her computer so i am replacing it with the same cover
i have several of these cases for my computer and i love them not only are they affordable , but they are durable and long lasting the colors are great and i switch them up every so often if you 're looking for a macbook case , kuzy is the way to go
this cover snaps on tight , fits perfect , and even looks really good just what i wanted and for a very fair price it does n't seem to add any bulk to the nice size mbp either all connections and features are accessible yet the unit is covered and protected it is transparent so your apple shines through when you are using the computer this has restored my faith that everything apple does n't have to be overpriced thank you kuzy
good product . fast shipping , nice color , very pretty , it fits very well , it look 's like original color , i like the apple hole on the
i have had my kuzy - black crystal # inch hard case cover for three years now and it was worth every dollar it has taken a beating and traveled the world with me and has n't cracked let me tell you that takes a lot since i am very clumsy and have dropped it , bumped it , and transported it cross-country its also easy to clean
i received this product right away and its perfect for my macbook , also the colors are the same like the one you see in the page im glad i bought this definetly will be purchasing in the near future
i was really happy with this product when i received it i have had it for about a month now and it has done a really good job at protecting my macbook it also gives it a cool new look
this is case is very inexpensive compared to other macbook cases and very durable it snaps on and fits perfectly the color is very rare and i love it exactly how it is described shipped super fast
i had bought another case for my macbook from ipearl that was too opaque to let the apple logo shine through the logo shines brightly through this kuzy with a bright light and looks just like the photo
i purchased this a month ago and absolutely love it combined with the <unk> guard , i know my computer is safe , and is going to be there for the long run installation was easy and with being college student , i know i can put it in my backpack with the assurance that no external objects will compromise my macbook
i am in love with my cover , i wanted it so that i could personalize my mac because many students at my school have the same one it also protects it very well and the color is very pretty
i got this for my <unk> macbook pro and snapped it right on without a problem cut outs on the side were all perfect so as to not block any ports on the computer no , it is n't the prettiest thing in the world , but it 's there to take the scratches , scrapes and dings that you do n't want your computer to take for that , the perfect fit and the cost , i give it # stars
i just recently purchased this case and i love it the purple casing is the perfect color the back is n't loose nor the top and i believe for the price it 's even better it 's a nice hard cover case and protects against any scratches what made me especially happy about this case was the fact the apple logo can still be seen perfectly as well as the ventilation slits on the bottom to help release hot air i love this and if i ever have the money again i 'll definitely purchase more :
just received the kuzy clear hard case for my macbook pro # `` and it was just what i was looking for i wanted a case that was more on the <unk> side , but would still serve it 's purpose of protecting my macbook this case is wonderful it was incredibly easy to snap onto my laptop , and it has features like base slits , to ensure your laptop is n't overheating , and small , circular tabs on the bottom to keep the laptop from sliding delivery was also a couple days earlier than the estimated time , which was a nice surprise this product is a keeper , without a doubt , and it was definitely just what i needed
i got this for my mom 's laptop for her birthday and she loved it she still uses it too i got this for her over a year ago
it came just in a <unk> time and shape this is why i like to purchase things through amazon , i feel i can trust them for any of my orders if there is something wrong i purchased online i can always find them to help
this case has protected my macbook pro from getting scratched and i love it great protection and lasts a long time i would recommend this case to anyone with a macbook
love the purple color of the product fits my macbook perfectly no problems with my purchase also shipped quickly the price is also very reasonable considering most other cases you buy in store are about double the price i am very pleased with my purchase ! - would deff . recommend to others
for the price it is absolutely perfect . it fits my # inch macbook perfectly and the apple shows through like its actually on the case its the best case iv had so far also , there are rubber feet on the bottom part of the case so it does n't slide when you put it on a smooth surface i am very happy and would def . recommend it
i have just one piece of advice when buying a laptop case/sleeve especially online make sure that you keep all of the dimensions in mind i have an older hp laptop and forgot that the battery is huge compared to most laptops now the case fits my laptop but it is a little snug and takes some time to get on but i am satisfied i was just looking for something that would keep my laptop protected in my backpack which does n't have a laptop pouch inside other than that it is a perfect sleeve
after taking it out of the box , the case had an industrial smell to it i would describe the smell as stinky plastic i put dryer sheets inside and on the top/bottom of the case for a few days this took most of the smell away and it fits around my laptop perfectly after a few days of using it , i could barely detect the smell and now it is pretty much gone
this case is ok it does n't have much padding and is too big so , at least my laptop , slides around in it also , the zippers are not that great of quality it 's cute and it 's something to try -lrb- <unk> on try -rrb- to protect your laptop in
it does the job it supposed to , but it is a little roomy my # inch hp has a lot of extra space to move around i get compliments on the design and so far it has kept my laptop protected
this product was made very well i do n't even own a laptop , but love <unk> so much , that i use it for notebooks and such why it lost a star - it took a bit before the some what toxic , & # # ; made in china & # # ; smell dissipated also , i still feel it is <unk> , but looks better on line than in person -lrb- looks richer vs. cheaper -rrb-
a nice case , however a bit big for my liking i wanted it to fit my computer snugly , but there was a bit of wiggle room in any case , the design is nice and it appears to be solidly made no complaints on that front note : it does smell rather strongly fresh out of the packaging
if you look for neoprene sleeves in stores , they 're $ # - $ # and boring blue , red , black , <unk> at $ # . # , these sleeves are not only a steal , you get a variety of designs as well i wish the case for the # `` fit a little more snugly - i can probably fit a # . # `` in it otherwise these things are worth it for a simple , protective laptop case
overall , i think this is a very good sleeve for my daughters hp laptop that she can use to slide in her backpack that said , there was a little more room around the edges with the laptop in it than we <unk> , so her laptop will do some sliding around also , the sleeve had that horrible plastic odor that has still yet to dissipate even after keeping it outside to air out it wo n't provide hardcore protection , which we obviously knew , but it will definitely minimize the scratches from being in a backpack
this was a little big for my # `` laptop from hp the width was right , but the height was off by a solid inch because of this , the laptop can shift around inside the case it 's also not incredibly thick - it basically softens blows your laptop could take normally , but i doubt it would save you if you knocked it off a desk or something that said , the design is absolutely beautiful the colors are sharp and i love showing it off
i have a dell inspiron # r and this sleeve fits it perfectly i saw in some reviews that people were disappointed there is no space to put in the charger but i bought this solely to protect my laptop from debris and scratches when i am not using it at home for better protection and portability , you really need a case as others have mentioned , this does have a strong smell due to the material used but it <unk> within # weeks the pattern is just as vibrant as it appears in the pictures , and overall it 's a solid product i would definitely recommend this for basic laptop protection
this is a quality item love the peacock design , closure is excellent as well as the cushioning material -- quite thick more than enough room for my google chromebook easy access on the go , received a number of compliments about this bag
purchased a new laptop for my daughter and this case she loves it and it is perfect to slide into her bag to keep the laptop from getting scratched up while schlepping across campus
i have an hp pavilion dm # - # inch i will admit this sleeve is a little big if it were just the computer i was carrying , i would be hesitant to use it with the charger in the sleeve it is actually a great fit the design is really pretty , and i am impressed i love it
my daughter loves this sleeve , it protects her school-issued laptop and ensures her computer is not mistaken for any other kids ' computer she 's used it every day , all day , for # / # months and it has n't failed yet
i use it to protect my # inch macbook pro as well as my mother 's # inch samsung it is definitely too big for my mac , but it works very well , and it stretches a surprising amount to accomodate the samsung the colors are vibrant , the material has a nice feel , and it 's super easy i really like having the # zippers
this bag is beautiful , i took it on a business trip and from the airport to my meeting i was complimented the wheels stick out a little on the sides and i did get stuck a couple of times but once you know where you can fit no problem it looks like the base will last , or at least i 'm hoping it does overall great quality
the overall appearance of the bag is very pleasing it 's only when you get into the finer details of the bag that it falls short to some of the better designers the opening is very stiff , and i keep scraping my <unk> on the zipper when i pull things in and out like some reviewers , i did notice that the handle seems flimsy , but it <unk> up when it 's & # # ; in use & # # ; if you have a lot to store , this bag would not work the front pocket is very very narrow and will only hold essentials keep in mind that # stars means & # # ; i like it . & # # ; you can not expect $ # quality though it 's a great bag for the price beautiful to look at , and great for the & # # ; mobile & # # ; minded
i love this bag i am an educator and a grad student i am able to take my mac air laptop and a couple books , binder i only wish it were bigger it 's sleek and so nice to roll rather than carry my heavy bag on my shoulder
what an awesome briefcase it is highly functional with may pockets to hold computer plus paperwork as well as computer accessories such as external hard drive it easily <unk> from the rollers to be carried into meetings if contemplating a rolling briefcase , this is a must have
i get compliments on this great briefcase daily i took the quilted laptop case out to make more room it is a bit heavy but # % of the time i am rolling it i recommend this bag to anyone needing a roller bag also , it fits under plane seats and in overhead compartments nicely
love my briefcase i like its <unk> and style i got it because i was tired of lugging my laptop to and from work due to project i 'm on i have had constant compliments from colleagues and strangers i gave one colleague a gift idea for his wife
i am a frequent traveler and i like nice things i have been searching for years for something functional and feminine this fits both bills the ability to snap <unk> and off the wheels is great i prefer to carry the bag but on long airport hikes the wheels are the best it has great space for laptops both my # `` mac and my <unk> the only slight disadvantage is the front pocket is tight to fit my wallet but i throw it in the center pocket and it is fine i would buy it again
i 've taken this on a few business trips now it gets compliments everywhere the detachable wheels were a big selling feature for me as well while it does n't have <unk> space , there seems to be plenty of room for the essentials and a few extras
love , love , love this laptop bag i have had coworkers , complete strangers come up to me and ask me where i got this bag it is absolutely stunning i travel for business quite a lot and it holds my laptop and presentation books quite well i 've had for almost a year and it still looks new buy it , you wo n't be disappointed
this may fit hp # . # inch laptops , but it will not fit most other # . # inch laptops the dimensions are wrong , you 'll have to stretch it to fit those dimensions moreover the zipper on top will scratch your laptop
i bought this bag to commute to work on the subway , but it proved to be too large for the train people bumped into my bag all the time trying to maneuver around it it 's a great bag , but i would n't recommend it for commuting
except for want of a bit more space , this bag is perfect ... and the price is even better than that it has a tablet pocket in addition to the laptop secure sleeve - a great feature it also includes a quality bag for cords and power supply
i think this was a good buy this thing has tons of compartments and the quality seems to be pretty darn good more than i expected to get for the price i paid one thing i would warn people about , is the size laptop it will hold i barely got my asus # inch in it tight fit ! but it did fit lots of extra room after i got the laptop in and it came with a couple extra bags inside for the charger and cords , etc . i recommend it for anyone wanting a lower priced bag but , if your laptop is much over # inches , good luck getting it in there
this is a very unique and durable laptop case bag i love the multiple compartments for various things the price is also great this is definately a quality product from hp i recommend anyone to purchase this product
first off , i love this bag to the core because of its many features lacking in common laptop bags although this bag did start at a price of $ # and when up to $ # , it is worth it since the bag is made from premium quality leather and vinyl pros : premium quality leather and <unk> to the core -lrb- even in the inside , thus accounting for its weight - sturdy chest strap -lrb- with sturdy metal hooks at end - magnetic handles -lrb- clip together to produce a `` <unk> `` -rrb- - accessories pouch -lrb- for battery pack , mouse , etc . . - two pockets in front for pencils and peripherals -lrb- although i highly recommend not placing said peripherals here due to the magnetic latches . < ps : magnets can <unk> data from usbs and such - metallic feet at bottom -lrb- so the bag can stand properly on a surface of any kind - loads of room for extra <unk> : not # % <unk> -lrb- but durable so i guess this does n't matter - front pockets are `` almost `` accessible -lrb- meaning the outer covering does n't extend far out so you can see the bottom of the pocket
this hp case is really wonderful and useful for my # . # inches size laptop actually , i 'm pleased with this product and its price is reasonable i recommend you to buy it !
i do n't know why this was so cheap -lrb- $ # -rrb- , but it was more than worth the money it 's got high quality straps and it fits my # . # `` wide screen notebook i 've had a really hard time finding a reasonably priced tote bag so many of them seem to go for $ # or more
i like the service i received -lrb- fast and product as pictured -rrb- , but when the item was received the zipper was broke the item was only $ # so it was n't worth sending back i guess you get what you pay for
i ordered this for my macbook pro # `` because of the apple app icons when i received the product , it was <unk> instead of app icons it would have cost me too much money to return the product since shipping was almost as much as the item itself do not buy this item unless you do n't care what it looks like when you get it update - the seller , mygift , contacted me and explained that all of their stock was labeled incorrectly and they were out of the apple icon cover on # - # , they contacted me again saying they were shipping the correct product to me with a return label for the incorrect product upon receipt of the correct cover , i will update my review
i gave this product four stars because nothing is perfect in life : -- rrb- my laptop sleeve is amazing , very functional and what a fantastic price came right on time and is made of quality i would recommend this product and the seller to any / everyone
i love this case , it is absolutely the most unique case for a mac i had to bring my macbook to the apple store , and brought it in to be worked on in this case all of the apple store employees had a fit over it i need something like this for my ipad
got this for my daughter to use at college so she would not damage her computer she loved the design and it worked to keep her computer safe and sound
i ordered this for my husband for his birthday in may i still do n't have it they claimed that it was damaged in transit and that it would be <unk> to me to date , -lrb- september -rrb- , i still do n't have a backpack
i just got this backpack and had a couple of trips with it materials are very good as well as finishing , no regrets on purchasing so far my biggest concern when choosing a backpack was to have something that i could use for traveling and for work without the look of a high school backpack and that was definitely achieved by booq i 'll need to update this in the future when i had more time with it , but right now i would suggest this a a great item for both travel a d work
i had a chance to see and feel this backpack before ordering it through amazon , and i love it i 've been using it for # - # months and still strong and solid as <unk> the little pockets makes it very convenient would buy it
i love this backpack it has room for all my stuff , including a laptop , charger , <unk> reader , external hard drive , and a textbook or two the straps are comfortable , and i wear it while riding my motorcycle to class it even has an <unk> chip inside it , in case i ever loose the thing could be a little bit cheaper
