i bought this case to <unk> my samsung # t keyboard , which fits snugly inside it is flexible enough to stretch around my # t <unk> should i choose , too i only wished it had an external zipper pocket , like my # . # & # # ; case logic tablet case for carrying small items -lrb- ie ; memory cards , flash drives , etc . . -rrb- this particular model does n't offer such a <unk> ; just the basics w/case logic quality
good product for the price fits the samsung # . # chromebook well seems to pick up dust/dirt easily - perhaps it would be less noticable if it was available in a charcoal or lighter gray color remember to remove your wireless mouse usb & # # ; plug-in & # # ; before storing ... makes it a tighter fit and i would be concerned about too much pressure on it overall - good value product
i really like this case we were at target and thought we would just see what the pricing is for something similar . $ # - $ # and it was n't padded as much as this is the only reason i 'm giving # stars is because it would be nicer to have a pocket on the outside for your charger it 's nice to put your charger in a case rather than throwing it in your backpack
the material feels great and very cushioned enough to protect your computer from small impacts although , i had to return this case because i have a dell inspiron # series notebook and it did n't fit i managed to squeeze it in the sleeve but the corners of my computer did n't let it zip close only if it was a half inch longer it 'd fit perfect
before i ordered this case , i was nervous about the color since on the screen it seems extremely bright however , when it arrived , i was pleased with it it is a nice shade of red i wanted a case that would hug my macbook pro snugly this case does fit it well but it is n't as tight as i would have liked it to be when i zip it up , there is still air that i have to <unk> out of it in order to get it to become flatter additionally , it is not as thick as i would have liked it to be all in all , it is a fine case that does its job well
this case has good material , zippers are easy to use and good amount of padding . perfect shape and size for a slim laptop will not fit the bulky # inch ones
it is exactly what it says like a sleeping bag for your laptop it does n't protect much from impact but keeps things from scratching and its better than not having
i got this for my mba # & # # ; , and it is a perfect fit ... not too snug but does n't rattle around plenty of padding to keep it safe in my carry on bag or briefcase
i bought it for my laptop , which is a samsung series # np # <unk> # us it looks decent and works the only con is that it is n't a perfect fit exactly the case is a bit big , so my laptop does have some sliding room it 's not a deal breaker or anything , but i just wanted to point it out
perfect in every way the only reason i give this # stars instead of # is because it gets a little heavy with a # & # # ; laptop in it i wish i could find the same case with low profile handles so it is easy to move around great product , i am very happy with it
when you put your laptop in it if really feels that it would protect it from small falls , or hits also while at the airport you can keep the laptop inside it when you go through the tsa checks helpful if you carry more than one laptop in the same bag as it avoids any bumps and rubbing against each other
this case is perfect for school , except for one thing it gets dirty very easily for instance whenever i take it out of my backpack it has a ton of dust all over it
there 's a little more wiggle room than i expected for my mba , and the inside seems a little more <unk> than cushion-y but , overall , i would say this is definitely a good sleeve for the price it does n't <unk> like cheap junk , but it 's nothing all that special either
i 'm not shocked since i read other reviews but it 's a bit big for the ipad # i wanted a case that is simply to toss in another bag , i have a hard back cover and a smart cover on the phone as well so i need something that i can fit all that in to if this were about an inch shorter it would be perfect , but it 's still pretty good
i picked up one for wife and i for our macbook pro retina # & # # ; and it fits them like a charm i either carry my rmbp in a messenger bag with a dedicated pouch or in a backpack when in the back pack i always use this as i am sure it will help protect the computer in case i am little rough -lrb- accidentally -rrb- or if the bag is dropped the quality is good and the zipper seems to be pretty good quality as well
if you 're looking for a simple sturdy sleeve , this is it i feel safe carrying my # . # inch laptop in this , but sometimes wish it also had a handle somewhere for a better grip
the case works great , it 's thick and feels decently sturdy i use it to carry my lenovo to school the only thing i can say against the product is that it 's not as snug as i would like for it to be there 's about an inch of extra room for my # . # inch
good product , looks nice and adds decent padding i would n't go dropping it out the window , but will certainly keep you from damaging it in a backpack or knocking it off the <unk> table
i was hoping this bag was more form-fitting , but it is nice material if not large for my # & # # ; macbookpro nice zipper action , but no place for keeping your charger
i got this sleeve because i was starting to bring my macbook pro with me more often so i got this sleeve and its made out of high quality materials for a good price and it came very quickly with my amazon prime i would recommend this to a friend if they are looking for a low priced high quality sleeve
simple eva <unk> padded sleeve only black or pink available for # `` was hoping for green , but not one of the colors fits my dell # fine needed something to slip over my laptop when carried in a backpack for travel does the job
bought this for when i needed to just drag my laptop with me on sites and needed good protection without all the extra baggage fits my # -inch macbook pro and some documents came with a foam insert -lrb- as part of the packaging -rrb- that i left in there as extra protection and works great
good fit , seems a little cheaply made , but definitely going to protect my macbook . fits the # inch macbook pro perfectly , even with a protective case on the computer . overall worth the money
this case was just what i needed for my new lenovo t # p this computer is wider than the sleeve in my laptop bag and i needed something wider and this was it fits like a glove and keeps it from getting banged up while riding around in my bag
for a # & # # ; macbook air , the case works good it 's a little bigger than i thought it would be , meaning the macbook air has room to move around some , but i think it will be fine it 's a really nice case
i bought this case to protect my samsung arm powered chrome book and it 's a perfect fit it looks nice and it seems to be very well made with a nice quality zipper too
these cases have a good amount of padding and a sturdy zipper the inside of them is slippery enough so the laptop slides right in without getting caught on anything they are of good quality i 've purchased two for both my laptops
i just got a new macbook pro my jansport backpack does have a computer compartment , but it does n't provide enough protection for my laptop since macbook is really thin and the compartment is wider so i bought this sleeve i love the foamy and thick padding it has and it 's really convenient if i need to carry my laptop to different classes for presentations the only problem is : it does n't fit in my backpack : -lrb- therefore i leave the sleeve in my office
i purchased this product as a case for my new lenovo thinkpad x # e very happy with the quality and price of the product i have the # cell battery on my thinkpad and this case fits the thinkpad x # e perfectly the case is very light weight therefore good for travel note : the case fits the only notebook itself , the a/c adapter does not fit in the case my only issue is when i purchased the product it was delivered in a very large box i needed to have the case forward shipped to australia and due to <unk> shipping based on <unk> rather than actual weight the shipping costs were three -lrb- # x -rrb- times the cost of the product itself i would therefore caution anyone purchasing this product and having it forward shipped outside of the usa the product is very lightweight and could probably ship in a large envelop rather than a giant box full of air
i purchased this case for my macbook air # & # # ; it fits well in the case and it provides protection against scratching and a bit of padding in the event of a fall it is made of high quality material , and seems as though it is going to last the only con is that the zipper is not protected on the inside , and has some remote possibility of scratching a laptop if it is the right size this has not been a problem for me , however get this case , you would be paying $ # + for this or something similar at a big box store
a cheap sleeve to be sure , but it works and protects my chrombook just fine no handles or anything , but it 's great even for just slipping into my backpack and ensuring nothing else will jostle my computer if you just want something cheap and you 're not a road warrior who needs bells & whistles -lrb- e.g . extra pockets , handles , reinforced edges , whatever -rrb- then why pay more
i use this and an insert for my messenger bag to keep my laptop from getting banged up i def has extra room and i take advantage of that when flying if i have to check my bag at the last min - i just pull this out of my carry on and it holds my <unk>
i liked how snug of a fit my chromebook was for this case , it wo n't rattle around the foam is not as protective as a hard case , but for the price it is a great case the zipper has a protective covering on it to prevent scratching the side of the laptop as well
this sleeve is made slightly big for the mbp # `` so i 'm not sure why it 's described as meant for this model however , since i use a cover on my mbp , it fits in nicely with little wiggle room inside nice cushioning and materials , the exterior does n't get dirty as i have seen often with such sleeves
i bought this for a # . # & # # ; acer laptop it fits perfectly seems to provide enough cushion for adequate protection without being too bulky the only reason i did not rate it # starts is that i just got it so i do n't know how well it will do in travel
its a little tight for my asus <unk> # , but it works i think for the money it is a good purchase if you want a leather , waterproof , fancy case , go spend $ # .
i ordered the red case , & it was just as described it is great for it 's price and i ordered the # inch case for my # . # inch laptop , and it fit perfectly it will protect your laptop from bumps and scrapes , just as i wanted this is a basic case so if you want something with many pockets , straps etc . this is n't it it 's a great case for simply protecting your laptop , which it does well p.s . i gave it # stars because it is just a basic case for the laptop which does n't have many extra slots or straps but for a case it 's great , # stars for that
the only thing that i would have liked is if this was available in a # inch size i bought this for a # inch mbp and there is some extra space on the side on <unk> thought , i would have also liked to have a separate compartment on the side where i could have placed some of the accessories
this is a great case for larger laptops it provides good protection with minimal bulk i can fit my massive # & # # ; laptop in there plus its charger cable and it fits well into my travel luggage definitely would recommend
the laptop fits in this case like a glove the case does an adequate job of protection for the computer but has no place to store even the standard charger this is a bit of a pain as most of these supplies have a lump in the line that is quite bulky and does not fit easily in you pocket however , the case does a good job for the price
i really like this case it looks sleek and i think it does a nice job of protecting my laptop it does n't seem as protective as some cases out there , but that 's because it is thin and chic you have to trade one for the other i 'm happy with this product
had to work a bit to get the laptop in the first time , but ok now after stretching could be a tad bigger probably would last longer if not constantly stretched
bought a new macbook retina # & # # ; laptop and ordered this case to carry it in the case is very nice , but just a tad big for the macbook although , i can fit the charger in there with it , so maybe not a bad thing
only one thing is missing in this product is the handle a small handle would have been better . otherwise i would say this is not the best product i have ever seen but for the price this is good enough
i have a macbook pro # & # # ; and there 's about an inch of extra space when you place it in the sleeve , it can shift and move about despite this , the sleeve feels quite protective because of a foam-like material surrounding the laptop it is thin , keeping from the overall package from being cumbersome , but the <unk> material feels like it would protect the computer from <unk> and scratches for sure like the top review said , the zipper 's lip is on the outside , so it 's unlikely to scratch your laptop value : # fit : # design : # protection : # -lrb- for a sleeve
i 've been using this case a couple weeks and like it so far i strongly recommend not buying the red one i ordered it thinking black would be too boring but the red is not like the picture and its quite an ugly red the case is soft with a few millimeters of foam it is n't going to save your computer , but it will keep it from small scratches and dings while its being transported i 'd love a case that offered a bit of moisture protection , which this certainly does not , but for the price , it definitely meets my expectations
the case is well made and provides good padding for a small laptop i have an # . # lenovo ultra book and it will not fit in this sleeve it is short by # & # # ; if my laptop would fit , i 'd give this # stars
this case does a fine job of protecting my laptop i leave it in my bag all the time , and just remove the laptop directly from the sleeve while still in the bag i feel like i have to be careful every time though , because the zippers can occasionally come in contact with the surface of the macbook when sliding it in or out , and i 'm worried about scratching it
i got my wife a new macbook air # . # and decided it was absolutely smart to get a lightweight compact neoprene case to give it some protection this arrived promptly , fits well and does the job .
i am one of those people who sits in the coffee shop doing work and i need a good case to put my computer in before shoving it in my bag it does a great job of protecting my computer from all the stuff floating around in my bag and is big enough to hold my power cord
this product is well made , has a great cover , and will protect your laptop from scratches and <unk> i had to return it because the # `` - # . # `` size was a little too small for my # `` samsung <unk> series laptop
i should have checked the dimensions , but my notebook is # . # inches and i still have about an inch of travel so this case is n't a <unk> fit if you have an ultrabook , do not buy this this case is mainly for the larger # . # inch laptops with optical drives and at least # . # inches in thickness construction is good and zippers seem to hold up well
- <unk> aspects - color is horrible -lrb- tannin - i have a dell xps # and the case is much more bigger than it the case does not fit like a skin hence the laptop float
my kids are sooo rough on their electronics -lrb- and so am i -rrb- , so when we finally upgraded to the newest macbook air a few weeks ago , i knew i needed a sturdy case this one is a bargain compared to the ones they sell in the apple store and it provides great padding to protect our new favorite laptop it is such a <unk> not having to worry about it on the go my one complaint , and why this does not get # stars , is that i 'd have <unk> one with a pouch on the outside to store accessories , power cables , etc . other than that - fantastic !
<unk> case for sure with good laptop protection i keep mine in a backpack often , so i needed something durable but not too heavy i like this case for its room even with the laptop in it to keep papers or the charger there is no outside pocket , unfortunately , but still very good not as flexible as other cases , but that may be a good thing
i really loved the sleeve i do notice that there are marks on the sleeve from carrying it in my book bag i am glad i have one to protect my laptop i really have no other complaints
i got this for an asus u # sd it 's a tight fit with this laptop , but maybe with a little more <unk> , it will fit better i really like the general design of this sleeve with the edges and the case logic accents i have one for an # . # & # # ; acer ao # , and it fits perfectly for that netbook i was hoping for the same with the # . # & # # ; u # sd unfortunately , it 's not quite as good , but i 'm still keeping it
i got this for son -lrb- we all like red -rrb- to slip his laptop into his backpack it fit his # -inch laptop perfectly i keep wishing it had a handle and a place for cords and a mouse , but then it would n't be a sleeve , now would it
got this to put my yoga # pro inside and it fits with the lenovo sleeve on took a couple of tries to find this case at the right size to accommodate the sleeve as well and even then it 's a just a bit on the tight side a # inch sleeve was way too big and a # . # inch the complete opposite if you do n't have the lenovo sleeve then it 's perfect
the subject says it all this product is cheap , light weight , and there is enough padding that it provides your computer ample protection the zipper works great there is enough room to throw some papers in as well which is nice in a pinch
handy , convenient , great padding perfect fit for the computer alone , but when i put a rubberized hard case on my # inch computer , the # . # inch case became too tight a fit - need to go up one size
it 's a great looking sleeve and seems like it would provide the needed protection in case of bumps and drops i bought the # . # inch for a lenovo yoga # s and it did n't fit so back to amazon it goes i wish it would have fit the first time without having to get the # . # inch size but it is what it is
it was really sleek and lightweight my macbook fit in their no problem and i have a hard shell case attached of my mackbook so i couldnt beat it for the price and the selection of colors were great
this case is essentially what i was looking for at the time ; i wanted a case for my computer that was light and compact and would protect my computer this case does it for a small price and i 'm happy about it i do now wish i had a case with more pockets to hold my mouse and charging cables otherwise this case is could
this product is perfect for the macbook pro i have a # inch model and it fits it snuggly i purchased the red model and though it 's a bit brighter than the picture , it 's certainly a nice change over having a black one
this case is well made and offers good protection for my laptop after ordering this i discovered my device actually came with its own case , but i do n't use it the case logic case is much better the only thing i could suggest would be to add storage for a couple of usb jump drives
is nice with good padding but i bought a wrong size a # inch will be look nicer on my chrome book good thing is extra space can be used to put the power
i bought this case for a new # . # dell laptop the case it too big but still will protect the equipment i say too big because it is a little bigger than the dimensions listed
the case is built well , does n't seem weak or flimsy , and was exactly what i was looking for my only complaint is that with a hard case on the laptop it 's a pretty snug fit , but it still fits i 'm hoping it 'll maybe stretch out just a little bit so it 's easier to pull the laptop out of the case as i use it more good fit without a hard case though i 'm a big fan of the tannin color that i got too , a little bit of color without being obnoxious
nice case but a very tight fit for an # . # inch netbook i bought it for an asus x # and it barely fits hope it stretches a bit through use
this product works for the mac air as advertised , but it is sized for the mac pro , so if you are using it loose in another pack , the laptop will shift inside of the sleeve it serves the purpose for me , but may not be what others are looking for
i have a # macbook pro -lrb- not retina -rrb- and this case is the perfect size it is n't the softest but it protects my computer in my messenger bag and looks good
order this laptop sleeve to fit for the new lenovo yoga # the quality and <unk> that went into the product is obvious i ca n't fault it in the least but , i wanted to write this review to let other know it will not fit the new lenovo yoga # convertible laptop/ultrabook the yoga # is a # . # & # # ; display laptop , not unlike a macbook air , but the sleeve is not wide enough again , the product itself is great -- exceptional amount of padding , solid zipper , and smart <unk> options , but i could n't keep it because of the size issue
i bought this product for my new macbook air # & # # ; and it fits literally perfectly so when i put my kuzy case on it did n't fit snug it felt to me a little
not as snug as i would of liked it , but its good enough . the padding on the inside is thick and durable , zipper is heavy duty and covered in plastic for protection only issue is the inside isnt made of softer material
i 'm a big fan of this case -- lots of padding for protection without being bulky and the color is fun i 'll never lose my computer when it 's hot pink only reason i 'm giving it # stars is that i have a lenovo yoga which is # . # & # # ; and it is a bit of a tight fit it requires some maneuvering to get into the sleeve although it still works
this is n't the most beautiful case out there , or something to show off ; but it is a good size and well-padded i use it to carry <unk> aspire one # . # -inch netbook , which is about the same width and depth as a macbook air but <unk> thicker , and it 's just what i wanted i have a nice tote bag that i carry around when traveling , and wanted something i could put my laptop in , then handle the tote back with an <unk> lack of care this case logic case fit the bill my netbook fits perfectly and the padding lets me carry my bag around roughly without worrying
i am quite pleased with my purchase - an inexpensive way to transport my netbook/laptop it keeps my netbook/laptop safe when i need to take it with me , i can put it in a nice duffle bag or tote good bang for the buck
using it right now on a macbook pro # & # # ; -lrb- not retina -rrb- the case is light , fits good and has a piece of fabric that prevents the zip from scratching the border of the mac excellent option for the price
this case protects the computer from damage during a trip well and keeps the computer cool and dry it 's also quite sturdy and i like the simplicity of the design overall , the case i purchased along with my computer compliments it well and is definitely worth the money
i needed a cheap laptop case to use so i would n't have to carry around my bulky laptop bag around anymore i bought the # . # -inch sleeve for my dell inspiron # laptop -lrb- from # -rrb- , and it fits a bit too large i 'd rather have it snug when zipped but this is n't a big deal as for the quality of the material , i had borrowed my girlfriend 's incase sleeve prior to buying the case logic one , so it definitely does n't compare to the incase 's material the case logic sleeve is cushioned yet it feels stiff and a bit rough i 'm not complaining though , because i bought this to protect my laptop in my <unk> bookbag and i have no doubt that it will get the job down if you want a simple and cheap laptop sleeve , this product should be fine
despite the fact that it was advertised for macbook air and is really for a macbook pro , it still can fit a macbook air in it maybe a lil bit of room left inside but feels very good the texture on the outside is very smooth and the product is very light
it gets dirty way to easily and its hard to maintain clean for the space it has enough and more than enough go for it if its cheap , but its pretty <unk> m basic if you want style get something else if you are on a budget go for it
i bought the # -inch black case for my # . # `` dell inspiron it 's not snug - there 's a half an inch of space at the top - but there 's not so much wiggle room that i 'd be worried about this laptop while it 's in my bag i suppose if you dropped it in a certain way it could lose a little bit of protection , but i bought this more for a little extra padding when i 'm carrying it around with other things
we keep our netbook in our bedroom , so it does n't get carried around much this is a good case for us , but it does have minimal padding , so if you plan on this being a go everywhere unit , i 'd suggest going with a heavier duty case
needs more room to store power cords perhaps an outside pocket could be added travels well - on a recent business trip it fit nicely in the laptop case along with the # & # # ; pc laptop i use for business
i checked the model to make sure this case would be the correct one for my air it fits , but i just wish it was a little smaller so it had a snug fit it works and i 'll use it on the bright side , you can throw files in there or even a thinner book and it was relatively inexpensive
it looks nice but i do n't use the product often later i thought i could have <unk> this buy but there is no complain with the product it perfectly fits with my laptop
all case logic cases are excellent products , and this one is no exception but # star off : i bought this for a lenovo s # . # -inch laptop , which has <unk> corners , and this did n't fit , so i had to return it too bad , it would have been perfect
i have a thinkpad t # it 's thick so i have to try hard to put it into this case but i suppose it 's not a problem for most laptop nowadays my university gave me a backpack for laptop so i do n't use this sleeve a lot
i received so many emails and text <unk> telling me that this item was scheduled to arrive on may # , nope it arrived today the third it 's just a simple sleeve , considering the other things that i purchased -lrb- including the laptop computer -rrb- arrived either before or on the scheduled date , i do n't know what the problem was with this sleeve it 's a nice sleeve , made from neoprene so it 's waterproof , it fits my old computer very nicely , and it looks very nice of course i got it for a great amazon price , i would recomment this for anyone looking for a laptop sleeve i took away a star because of the late delivery
this case was okay it sleek and looks cool when carrying my small laptop around however it is a little too snug at the zipper well i guess you ca n't have everything
it is what it is a sleeve for your laptop i 'm using it for my macbook air the only problem i have with it is that the macbook does n't fit perfectly snug there is some wiggle room other than that , it is a well designed case that should handle most activities you plan on doing with your laptop
nice case fits well on my # inch asus vivo book i would to have liked to see a side pocket maybe for the plug or a place for the owners manual
the sleeve seems well made and has good cushioning i did n't expect it to have so much extra space for a # `` macbook air though , it does n't fit really snug i guess that 's because it 's <unk> made for # `` laptops but the name had me think it would be more specifically directed to the macbooks still , it 'll do what i need of it
does a good job of protecting my mb air which is in my <unk> while biking to and from work it cushions well , although i do find it a <unk> stiffer than i thought it would be i would recommend it though
nice fit for # & # # ; silver macbook or mb pro -lrb- not retina -rrb- there are more protective sleeves in this category , but this one is designed well and does the job
i like the feel of this case and the fact that of course it 's large enough to fit my computer i would love though if it had another compartment to pocket the other little laptop accessories that are necessary for a day out
i have an asus g # vw which has # . # inch screen it did fit in the sleeve but i was not able to close the zip if you have a gaming laptop which is # . # `` and big compared to normal # . # `` please do n't buy this product
this case is excellent for its purpose it 's simple , well constructed and provides enough cushioning to protect my laptop from dents and scratches i have n't dropped my laptop from any height yet and i doubt this case would do much to protect it from a fall , but that 's not what i bought this for it would be perfect if it were n't too big for my laptop as far as i know , i bought and received the correct size sleeve , but it leaves about an inch space at the top and sides this makes the case unexpectedly cumbersome to carry around and almost too large to fit into my bag i wonder if the # in case fits better , but i do n't want to waste time and money trying it out in case it ends up being just a few mm too small still , i 'm fairly satified with the product and it does its job
