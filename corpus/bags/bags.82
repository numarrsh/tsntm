i bought one of these and it broke within the first month i thought it was a simple fluke so i returned it and got another one of the same backpacks . and the same thing happened again this is a horrible product
at first i was impressed with the reviews and had purchased this bag for my dell # & # # ; laptop the bag carries sufficient padding and a lot of zippers to its credit but , this bag wore out in just # weeks of my purchase the stitches were long gone before i realized it and it now looks hanging ugly lastly , if you are having a # & # # ; inch laptop , theres is good chance that your laptop is already heavy this bag just adds weight and if you are a <unk> , then dont go for this bag . . its a crap overall , i would not recommend this bag because i see the stitch quality to be poor
i was excited when i first got the backpack because it is stylish and had many pockets and useful features however , within just a few months of very light use , seams started unraveling from three different places also the zipper teeth bent and rendered one of the pockets unusable i am <unk> by the insanely cheap construction of a product from what i thought was a reputable company
purchased backpack in february # for weekday use commuting to work . # months later i 'm looking for a <unk> brand backpack to replace it it gets <unk> because the water resistant bottom cracked in under a year and at # months the poorly constructed bottom has holes large enough for items to fall out a water resistant bottom could be a great feature , but using material that lasts more than a year would have been an even better feature
tons of space , very large fits large laptops very securely i have used this laptop for # months now almost immediately one strap began losing stitches now both straps are losing stitching one strap has completely come apart really upsetting since the size of the backpack is perfect really wish the straps were better quality seems like it should last longer than # school year for the price
i had this bag for only # . # months , and it is tearing at the shoulder straps this is totally unacceptable i had expected a better quality bag from targus yes , there are many zippers and compartments , and can hold many things , but perhaps it is a manufacturing defect that mar my experience with this product
strap broke within # months of daily use my previous jansport lasted # years of similar use -lrb- abuse -rrb- there is not only one point of failure either , there are several points where the stitching has broken , exposing the foam padding this backpack is just poorly manufactured spend your money elsewhere
dont buy this item on my # nd one in # days backback comes apart at the seams had the # nd one about # days use it # or # times a week i dont carry a lot of junk ; never used it with my labtop i wont buy a targus drifter every again . there <unk> control is zero in my book
it looks nice at the beginning it has cushion as well but , after couple months , many places are wear out , especially on the straps , they are apart i am worry about maybe my bag will fall apart soon
nice pack , great space , good price as an old targus customer -lrb- this is my third backpack -rrb- i liked the sturdy quality of its products sadly , not the case with this backpack which arrived already with a lose thread in one of straps and a hole in the stitching that looks it will expand quickly i thought targus had a life-time guarantee , not this one
yes it is fairly comfortable to carry and has many compartments , that are logically placed however , two backpacks later this item has an <unk> defect : seams on the top of the shoulder straps are rip within days , making this pack useless do not buy if you plan on a daily use
i ordered this for my son within # weeks the handle started to fall apart when i went to return it i had just missed the return period by a matter of days this was an expensive backpack , i would have hoped that it would have some staying power do n't waste your money and look elsewhere
after # weeks of use . the zipper on the small pocket just under the handle ripped apart from the main body i only had laptop , # books , # magazines and laptop charger in the backpack i expected something a lot sturdier considering how much stuff you could actually load into this bag
i bought this backpack after my old laptop backpack broke , and from the reviews it seemed that i was a good choice and last for a while however as a college <unk> , i used this backpack heavily on a daily basis now within # months of buying it , one of the sholder straps is starting to fray
# months after <unk> this backpack , one of the shoulder straps ripped at the top we had to duct tape the strap to finish the school year it 's disappointing to pay so much for a backpack , have it rip after the return policy expired on amazon and not be able to get the item replaced or refunded we liked the overall backpack not one of our older , cheaper backpacks have ripped like that , maybe the one we had was defective ?
this bag was a real disappointment the zipper broke after a few uses and i was able to repair it however , the stitching subsequently let loose from the part where the straps meet the top of the bag it does n't really seem up to the task of toting around a desktop replacement laptop
i am a computer professional and i have carried a laptop to and from work every day for the past # years in addition i have traveled for work and my work is demanding enough that i even take my laptop on vacation i have used more laptop bags than i can remember due to my constant use ; i am pretty hard on them and so i have become pretty picky as well i liked the design of this bag online it arrived yesterday and i took it out of the plastic tried one of the zippers only to find that it caught on the material as soon and it moved from one angle to another thinking it was just that zipper , i tried another ... after testing four of the zippers each catching there was no way i was keeping this bag i would have a broken zipper or torn material exposing the compartment in a matter of weeks if not days i would say that the issue is either a design flaw for a manufacturing defect , either way i was n't going to waste my hard earned money it is going back today
it 's a decent backpack , fits everything i need it to and has a reasonably well thought out design problem is the construction stitching came apart after a month or two and has just deteriorated further i do not recommend this
this is a big backpack with lots of room , but two of the zippers caught , one in particular i thought i could make it work , but i found that in order to open the one compartment i had to turn the backpack and use two hands even then , it took several tries to get the zipper unstuck , then it it just did it again the next time decided to return it and try something else if you need a big backpack with lots of space and can get one without the zipper problem , this might be good for you , but i ca n't really recommend it
heavy , scratchy , and not comfortable on the back it 's quite large it 's also not cool enough it does have lots of nice compartments though not good for neck or back pain
after a year and a half of use , the arm straps are beginning to break for the amount of money it cost i would have expected a better quality product it has a lot of pockets , that 's true . . but do n't begin to add stuff inside them
this bag is nice and i really like it , but it 's coming un-sewn the shoulder strap is coming apart as is the cell phone pocket in the top of the bag real bummer i ca n't exchange it ; i would have rated it much higher had it not fallen apart
bought this backpack assuming it would last for a long time and protect my computer this backpack started to fall apart about # months after purchasing the stitching on # separate parts of the bag started to come unraveled which just became worse and now one of the straps almost completely come undone the strap has two completely separate areas that are completely torn at the seams this backpack just does not display the quality that i expected
too many zippers and the pouch is not high enough for asus # & # # ; laptop i had to return it the description says it will fit # . # & # # ; but it does not take in account the thickness of a laptop
first off let me say this bag has loads of pockets , some i only just discovered after a week it holds a lot of stuff , however there is one really big drawback where the nice padded straps end and the thin nylon adjustments begin , there are the hard plastic clips these plastic <unk> dig into my arm and chest no matter how high or low i adjust the straps , they dig into different areas of my arm pits or my sides extremely uncomfortable unless i sling the bag only over one shoulder
this backpack is not durable - at least the one i received is not the stitching in the shoulder straps started coming apart within about two months targus 's replacement policy is that the defective unit must be shipped back before replacing it unfortunately , that would require me to purchase another backpack on the plus side , this bag is large and has lots of pockets so , it 's a pretty good option if you have a lot of stuff to carry it 's tall , so it 's not the best option for carrying a lot of small stuff - unless you do n't mind digging through everything to find what you need
i used this for work , toting it to job sites every day within a month , the seams had split on the expandable part of the strap a year later , it is completely unraveled , both sides all the way down a single stitch seems flimsy when the bottom is so rugged i just had a zipper malfunction on the laptop compartment , so i am in the market for a new bag -lrb- did n't keep receipt needed for warranty -rrb- if it were n't for the straps and now zipper , the bag would get # stars for size and number of pockets if your use it light duty , this bag will probably be great for you if you need to fill it up , it 's straps will not support the weight
was a good bag at first big , a lot of compartments , sturdy -lrb- initially -rrb- however , i have used it for a few months now and the back part of the bag wo n't stay <unk> unless something is in it this gets annoying when you are wearing it or if you are trying to put something big in and there is no one to help to keep it open one of the straps is already tearing as well along the elastic part i am too lazy to return it so i will take this loss i do not recommend this product at all
i am older than most who use a backpack , but i have used them for a few years on the surface it seems to be a great bag , but between zipper problems , and the bag 's <unk> to stand up even with a # & # # ; laptop inside is unacceptable i found myself designing a heavy cardboard frame to place in the second compartment to get to somewhat stand up it has plenty of space , but those two issues , zipper problems , and not <unk> broke the back for me it does offer good protection because on more than one occasion , the bag collapsed and fell off my desk with my laptop in it - no damage to the laptop i replaced it with a swiss gear of comparable size and space , and although compressed in the shipping box , when it was loaded , stood right the start , and no zipper problems a few <unk> from <unk> and this would be a truly great backpack
when i picked it up for the first time with my stuff in it i heard one of the arm <unk> rip ... sigh after a while on of the decorative rings popped out and even though i really wanted to like this backpack i just ca n't pass that these things happened within the first days it was bought if you are not planning to carry too much , buy it if you are in school and have to carry many books look for another one
one of the shoulder straps is tearing after # months i carry two small notebooks for class , a tablet , and two college books and it started showing loose threads after # days it is now showing tears and inner padding i knew i should have went with swiss gear i do not recommend this at all wish i could have sent this back
nice enough bag , but less than a year after i got it -lrb- april # - january # -rrb- , the stitching along the straps and side pockets has come undone
i bought this laptop backpack based off the high reviews . # - # stars and # - # stars couldnt be wrong well one of the other reviews mentioned having a problem with the zippers catching going around the angles and sure enough , mine did the same thing , two of them right out of the box ive had the bag for two weeks now and i thought i could ignore that issue until tonight when the small pocket on the top of the bag had problems opening and closing i had to use some force just to get it to slide even a little bit i love the pockets , love the layout , but im not going to keep a $ # back pack around when im having zipper problems after # weeks of very careful usage
i purchased this backpack after being told by several friends that it was a high quality laptop backpack from a company with a good reputation i purchased the backpack at the end of january and did not use it every day by the end of april , both shoulder straps were ripped and i can no longer use the backpack i am disappointed in this purchase and would not recommend it to my friends
i got this backpack a little more than # months ago and it has already started to fall apart on me the right shoulder strap has ripped and the inside zipper in the laptop compartment has fallen out completely i should have gotten another north face backpack instead , that one lasted me for almost # years does anyone know if i can still get this replaced after # months or am i just out of luck
the bag is nice but the <unk> of the product is not good it showed up at my house with a broken zipper that anyone that would have inspected it would have found i ordered it for an extended trip out of the country and since it was a side pocket zipper and i needed it for the carry on stuff i took it on the trip amazon has no way for me to return the product from the country i am now in and by the time i return i doubt any return would be <unk> it would have been easier if they would have just inspected the bag prior to shipping since the broken zipper was obvious
i love this pack , the only problem that i have and the only reason that it does not get # starts is because of the stitching in the straps i returned my first pack , because the stitching had come un <unk> with normal use this would cause separation in the materials used shortly after i received a <unk> , the same thing is happening i decided to just keep this one , but sad that such a great pack has this flaw
this is a quality bag , but it is big it is hard to get a feel for the size from the site , but it is big i am # ' # & # # ; , # lbs and it is big on me also , there is no chest strap and no way to attach to a roller board , so it falls it 's big and it falls lots of nice pockets and zippers and appears to of very high quality
i was a little upset so see that less than a month after i received the bag the stitching on one of the shoulder straps started to come out it was not a large problem because i had it fixed if left alone it might have ruined the
after a month with this purchase , the front zipper broke and # grommets on the front pocket came off i had purchased for my son , because of the reviews i got and he has alot of books along with laptop for school i was hoping to condense from him using # bags to one it has plenty of room for everything i contacted amazon for the defective bag and my experience was very positive they expressed mailed a new one and he recieved it in one day amazon is awsome to deal with
great looks , very roomy and fits almost anything and everything with my # & # # ; laptop very comfortably inside however the main problem i found was the handle which gave way this bag is not even an year old but the handle has almost given way especially the plastic on the top now the bag looks ugly -lrb- probably more in the mind but ca n't help thinking about his -rrb- and now looking for a replacement which i felt was way too early if the manufacturers can do something on this , would most certainly recommend this bag for everyone
when i got this bag , i really liked how it was laid out it had ample room for everything i was going to need -lrb- laptop , power supply , external hard drive , noise cancelling headphones , etc -rrb- for travel it had plenty of pockets so nothing got lost in one gigantic pocket the bottom is made out of a weather resistant material so it stands up to being set down in all kinds of places the issue i had was after only owning the bag for roughly # months , i set it down and it rolled over onto the zipper the laptop inside was undamaged , but the zipper was cut clean through and no longer works i would expect a bag meant for travel would hold up at least a year and not fail that quickly i was really disappointed because i love the design of the bag , but now its useless
after owning for # year : has a suspension solution to keep the laptop from resting on the bottom of the bag so my laptop is n't <unk> when setting it down it has lots and lots of expandable room and tons of pockets of varying sizes i could keep a couple textbooks and small binders in this bag with my laptop with a little room to cram in more if necessary a seam in one of the pouches came apart with little <unk> shortly after i bought this about a year ago the mesh side pouches are nice for light weight , non abrasive items but do n't put anything abrasive or <unk> -lrb- that 's a word -rrb- , in them they did stretch a bit one strap is now hanging by a thread strap should be built with heavier materials ca n't handle a full load overall a good buy for the price
i have used this everyday for last # months handle split in half within one month three months ago the canvas started to pull away from zipper i have already purchased another bag for when this one becomes unreliable
bought this to carry my laptop and camera on a trip turned out to be too heavy and cumbersome for my use i sold it to a school kid who loved it for a book bag
i love this backpack however i bought it to put alot of stuff in and it is already coming apart at the seams on the straps i am disappointed i thought for the price i would have gotten a little better quality other than that it has all the pockets i need and it is stylish enough for me but i was looking for function more so
this backpack is huge which was what i thought i wanted until i put my computer in it the pack is heavy on it 's own and with a computer in it it 's a back breaker but if you 're up to the weight , its got great compartments and well built
this is a great bag - very roomy , loads of zippable pockets etc . the only reason i 've knocked off a star or two is because the stitching on one of the shoulder straps started coming away within the first week my # & # # ; laptop is very heavy but all the same this bag is specifically designed for # & # # ; laptops and i am not carrying much else of any weight so this is disappointing i 'd still recommend though because otherwise this is the best laptop bag i 've owned -lrb- and i 've had several over the years -rrb-
the backpack is a good backpack it has plenty of storage areas and is reasonably setup for what i use it for my only complaint is that the stitching on the bottom of the bag on the side that faces your body is separated luckily it is not a seam that is crucial to holding components in it did n't even take a month for it to pull apart i carry a laptop , tablet , couple small books and cables in it nothing close to what it can hold <unk> this should n't have happened and i recommend looking for something better out there targus products are definitely not what they used to be
i was very happy with the backpack until i tried to lift it fully loaded - at which point , threads connecting left shoulder pad with the strap broke under stress stress was about # lb -lrb- # kg -rrb- apparently some chinese factory bought <unk> threads
it said it fits my laptop it does but , not in the laptop sleeve i 'm keeping it but , i do n't recommend it my laptop seems to be the biggest one ever made
i really liked this pack and its amazing padding for your back it also has a massive main compartment for all you science <unk> who have to carry your thousand page textbooks main highlights of this pack is : large <unk> side <unk> comfortable <unk> wire <unk> all that said , the stitching on the shoulder strap on my right shoulder strap became undone in the few days i had the bag it was odd to see this brand new bag with the stitching coming undone otherwise this would have been an amazing bag
i bought this backpack about a month ago because i use # . # inch laptop , and there were not many options , and this one had excellent reviews i found the laptop very good in quality with ample <unk> however , within a few weeks of using it , i noticed the stitching on the shoulder straps starting coming off it 's not totally unusable , however i feel it 's the sign of improper design i would like targus to replace this as it has been only few weeks that i bought it
good bag for the price i 'd love an external <unk> for quick access to business cards or usb drives , but this thing has more than enough zipper compartments to be a great man-purse i carry emergency clothes in it with my laptop now the material is durable , fit for my hp elitebook # . # & # # ; with a tablet in front of it is perfect to be clear , the laptop fits snugly in it 's padded space , then the tablet is tossed in font of it , outside the padded pouch , but still within the same zipper compartment i open one zipper when i get to work and pull both devices out
liked the looks and the fact that it <unk> to have lots of compartments for various bits and <unk> only received it couple of days back and did n't have a chance it use it much only complaint is that that as against the advertised weight of # . # lb the bag weighs in at # . # lbs -lrb- i used a luggage weighing scale to <unk> the bags empty weight -rrb- this is pretty disappointing since once of the reasons i went for <unk> bag as against swiss gear is that it seemed to give the same weight and features at a much lower price apparently that 's not the case hence the reason for #
a bit too fancy and lacking in important practical details negative = no <unk> on zippers to allow them to be <unk> no document divisions on inside of main area secure strap over laptop inadequate too few small organizing compartments inside positive = comfortable to wear good top handle nice to have side <unk> and bottle pockets on each side
it 's a really great backpack , but it 's a lot like a refrigerator let me explain because of it 's depth , it can hold a lot of stuff , and holds a # & # # ; laptop with no problems it 's nice and padding and the straps are comfortable -lrb- although it does ride kind of high -rrb- but , because it 's so deep , it has the refrigerator effect , where all of the <unk> and <unk> stuff gets pushed to the back , and then it kind just gets stuck there one day when you find yourself needing something in the back , you pretty much have to take everything out to get to it i would recommend this backpack if you 're only carrying a laptop and some other supplies , but i got it in the hopes of using it to bike to work clothes just do n't work really well in this bag , and i ended up switching back to a standard backpack and a shoulder strap briefcase tucked underneath
when i got my backpack it was better then i had expected the backpack has a nice cushioned pouch for laptops and a large middle section that i can fill with books easily i think the best feature of the backpack is pockets that are all over the backpack there are small pouches in sections of the backpack as well as a pocket in the middle that is great place to put cables and power adapters the backpack also has cushion on the back which make carrying it even when full easy i would buy this backpack again but i do n't think i will need to because it should last me a long time i would recommend buying <unk> backpack if you need space for a laptop and books without being over <unk>
i have used this for several months now and can attest to its quality and design design : case features well-designed structure to enclose the laptop itself , <unk> padding and a <unk> <unk> strap to keep the laptop secure there are a <unk> of small pockets useful for pens , mobile phone , keys , etc . , as well there is also a small padded pocket i find great for small fragile <unk> my travel <unk> headphones and spare glasses shoulder straps and padding are well placed for comfort there is also a <unk> you to carry the pack as a & # # ; briefcase & # # ; if you wish quality of construction : tough quality fabric ; durable seams no signs of <unk> six months of usage , including # weeks of oversea travel i tend to <unk> luggage and treat it harshly ; this pack has been up to the challenge
this backpack is <unk> i love it i have a laptop , ipad mini , # charges , lunch bag , two bottles of water , blanket & neck pillow it 's sturdy and has plenty of compartments love the padding on the back
i use this backpack daily and have love it only problems are that the stitching at the top of the straps has started to come out and the black plastic piece on the handle broke this backpack is large but it holds a lot of stuff it fits my needs well as i use it as my portable office - i carry my laptop , files , small toys as <unk> , notebooks , my lunch , and much more
purchased strictly for intention of carrying laptop computer and other items needed for a day at the office and it serves that function well love the functionality of the various pockets , especially the smaller one located at the top of the bag near the handle , where i can keep the smaller items needed quickly when traveling or commuting
arrived very quick the items is exactly wich was mentioned . in the purchase story i use it for hand <unk> when i 'm flying and the <unk> are very usefull to <unk> so i 'll would by it again in the future
got this as a school backpack and it is well made , sturdy , and has lots of room easily fits my laptop and books with padding in between to keep everything safe comfortable to carry even with lots of stuff in it well made backpack
good solid back pack but after having it for more than a year now and having gone through the airport several times it is showing a little more ware than i though it should i still use it every day and may buy another one when this one kicks the bucket
i have bought targus bags and stuff before , so in purchasing this bag , i took a chance despite some reviews on it 's durability so after about two weeks , one of the shoulder straps began coming off instead of the hassle of returning it , i just <unk> it with black <unk> tape i wont be buying another one like this from targus again
been using this pack for about # months now and so far i love it the stitching seams to be nice and strong and this thing has tons room . very good deal for the price
i bought this backpack for my son to use in college it 's a great size , it can carry a lot of stuff and it does n't look big -lrb- even when stuffed with a lot of things -rrb- after a month , one of the threads on the right strap came undone and the strap was about to rip contacted amazon and it got replaced immediately new backpack even has a design with no threads on the section where the other one had come undone therefore , backpack is now great
i am a small framed woman i needed something that could carry my # . # & # # ; laptop , all of my books , calculators , writing utensils , binders , lab <unk> , and tablet this backpack delivered and has plenty of pockets to keep it all organized this would be a great backpack for a day hike , or a carry-on bag the downside is that i have a small frame and the backpack is uncomfortable i think it would benefit from a chest strap plenty of storage <unk> of pockets for <unk> fit a large <unk> for <unk> make a good carry-on <unk> not good for small frames -lrb- uncomfortable would benefit from a chest
this backpack is outstanding , i use this for both school and <unk> time i manage to packed in five days worth of clothing including accessories for camping has many compartment for easy access , lightweight and leather bottom along with the padded shoulder straps which is a plus for me
love the large handle so much easier to carry than just a nylon strap on my old backpack could use a key ring inside one of the compartments otherwise great product
this bag has lots of storage options , compartments , and tons of rooms i can fit my full sized laptop , and # & # # ; chromebook , both power supplies and still have tons of room for other items i 've only had one issue with a broken loop on the shoulder strap , but it does not affect the
i am very happy with this purchase , it is well made , very sturdy , very comfortable for traveling and holds everything i need including my laptop endless pockets for storage i love it ! !
this is a pretty solid backpack -- comfortable , with lots of pockets for just about anything a <unk> would carry around the only gripe i have about it is that it wo n't generally stand upright on its own if you do n't prop it up against something , it will probably fall forward this is n't a huge deal , since it has padding all over the place , but it would be better if it could stand upright by itself still , i recommend it if you need to tote around a laptop
i travel a lot for work and need a backpack for my laptop and pads this foots the bill as is very roomy for my stuff to include lunch , water , <unk> and other junk the price was the bait
this bag has already held up better than most i bought a new bag at the beginning of last school year , and did n't even last a semester this one is almost there , and still showing signs of more semesters to come
nice bag to carry for travelling drawback in this bag is the bag weight the bag itself weighs nearly # lb thus it may give you trouble when you are looking for long travel by air -lrb- weight restrictions
i have a big company laptop , a # & # # ; wide screen , and it even has an extended battery the laptop sleeve in this backpack fits it perfectly it also has multiple pockets and zippers it has very wide padded straps that make it fairly comfortable i have it weighed down with about # pounds of equipment so we 'll see how it holds up i 've only been using it for about # months now it does not have any carabiner type clips , i wish it did
we like it because it has lots of different kinds of pockets , is a good size for travel and seems mostly sturdy the handle on the top is attached to only the fabric ; that seems vulnerable
lots of space for a backpack , it could easily substitute for a small suitcase the drawback to this is that it could get heavy real quick which is not a lick on the bag itself the right handle <unk> on the bag started to unravel after a couple of months of use i mostly throw the bag over the right shoulder and carry by the right hand strap it has been two years now and the bag is performing as advertised
this targus backpack is well built there is more than adequate padding for your # `` laptop the <unk> nylon is rugged , and it has an enormous capacity with many `` nooks and crannies `` it has a strong handle on top and a rugged bottom there is a lot of padding on pressure points to ease the strain on you back when you carry it there are two negatives to this pack : there is no <unk> strap , and more importantly the zipper pulls are made in such a way that it is difficult if not impossible to secure the backpack with a lock this is important if you want to keep out prying hands , or after removing your laptop you wish to use this as checked baggage on a
this bag is awesome tons of pockets and seems to be built very well my only complaint is , it does n't fit all # . # `` laptops for example , it fit my # `` hp envy perfectly but my # . # `` asus g # doesnt fit into the laptop sleeve and i 'm forced to put it into the large book pocket
this backpack is more than i expected it is nicely padded for my laptop and has enough pockets to organize everything the only thing it lacks to be perfect is wheels the item arrived on time and as expected
after # years my previous targus backpack started to rip at the shoulder strap so i began the tedious task of trying to find a new one and was lucky enough to find this product i am a little on the ocd side so i love all the different pockets and the pockets within pockets the only reason i give it # stars is because the flap at the bottom of the main pocket sometimes bends down with some of my books i am a graduate student so i carry a lot of things and the weight <unk> of the back makes it very comfortable to
this packpack is great i use it to carry my laptop , notebook , waterbottle -lrb- which there is a mesh side pocket for -rrb- , a workout outfit with an extra pair of shoes the one thing i really love about this backpack is it 's very comfortable there is good padding on the back of it so i do n't have to feel anything digging into my back while i 'm carrying it this backpack also has so many pockets i do n't even use , but it 's nice to have options the only reason why i gave it four stars is i wish they had options for other trim colors to <unk> to the female gender i know it sounds silly to bring up , but when you see it , it just screams `` this is for a guy `` other than that this is a very well made backpack i also love the fact that for the most part it stands up on it 's own when you set it down
this is a very sturdy , well made , lasting and quality backpack it holds my laptop in its great shape but also hold tons of stuff like one time i even put my car in there i am telling you , dont get lost inside in there and yes , there should be a caution : keep out of reach from children if they fall into it ; good luck i love it
this thing is sturdy and versatile fits things conveniently that i never even considered before it 's pretty large , and the padding on the back is just right it 's fairly cheap compared to similar products with the same features , there are fancier ones that are <unk> , but for a good long day out this is a good choice
i received the backpack # days before the expected date which was definitely great there are tons of pockets and it fits multiple textbooks along with my # . # & # # ; vaio with no problems and looks like it might even fit a slightly larger laptop i was expecting the very front top pocket to be fairly small , but it actually goes the entire height of the backpack there are also small mesh pockets inside several of the pockets , which i was pleasantly surprised to find the straps as well as the back are padded very well and thus the backpack is very comfortable , even with multiple large textbooks i 've only had it for a few days , but so far i 'm very happy with the bag and would definitely recommend it to a friend
i have used this backpack for several years it has protected my full size laptop on many flights and daily commutes it shows no wear after years of use and has many well thought out features and is comfortable to wear on a bike now that i have switched to a smaller form factor surface pro , i no long use the backpack on a daily basis however , i still use it for air travel <unk> horizontal mobile messenger bag -lrb- brown -rrb- for microsoft surface / microsoft surface proi now use daily , fits perfectly in the laptop hold and provides lots of added security i add even more padding for daily use by inserting <unk> protective neoprene cushion sleeve case for microsoft surface tablet rt and <unk> the crown case it fits both the surface pro <unk> key attached and the crown case perfectly you might think the whole protective system was engineered to work together
top ` grab handle ' is reinforced with cable wire targus also has a great manufacturer warranty previous version -lrb- not as well constructed -rrb- started to give way at the seems i contacted targus , and they sent me this one -lrb- for my son -rrb- as a replacement it gets a lot of wear and tear nice looking , very functional , comfortable
i look around online to find a nice backpack for college since i spend over # hours a day on campus , i wanted something that could hold all my textbooks , my laptop , my lunch and more this bag covered all those <unk> it is well built and seems to handle the # lbs of stuff i carrying around in it every day i would recommend this to any college student in need of a good overall bag
fits my # . # inch lenovo laptop along with two or three large book and still has room to spare it also has many pockets for miscellaneous stuff throughout the bag so far , i have n't had any problems with the straps as i have read in some other reviews
tons of pockets/compartments in this bag built very well , great material and stitching holds my # & # # ; laptop great as well as tons of other things i am an it tech and constantly take tools with me and cables and cable ties , etc . . this bag holds everything i need and then some
i have one of those big ol ' # & # # ; hp pavilion laptops and this is the only backpack that carried that , plus all my books and still fit comfortably i would highly recommend this if you have a large heavy laptop like mine
this is a solid , comfortable , fairly well designed backpack the materials are high quality my one complaint is that it really works best only if you put the laptop in the place they give you , which puts pressure on the laptop i 'd really prefer if the laptop could be on top of the weight , so it does n't have any weight bearing down on it because i have to be careful with my # & # # ; laptop when travelling ; the keyboard is <unk> into my screen under the weight of the other stuff in the pack sure , you can put it in a different pouch , but then the lower pouch -lrb- where you 'd normally put a laptop -rrb- is an awkward size and less comfortable when used for most other things also , it has so many pouches , that if you really use them all , they fight with each other for space
this backpack will without doubt hold your gigantic # inch laptop with room to spare i lug around my <unk> in this without as much of a second thought plenty of padding and just solid construction
pack is made of good quality materials , zippers operate smoothly and easily , plenty of pockets and places for a variety of items my # & # # ; dell laptop fits very well the straps have built-in shock absorbing elastic and are very comfortable i use it as an <unk> carry-all would recommend this to my friends
i 've been using a computer back-pack that my job provided for me for the past couple of years and decided to replace it because the bottom was starting to tear off i decided with this one and could n't be more satisfied first of all , there is plenty of room to put all your stuff in i 've managed to transfer all my stuff from my old backpack and still have room for more stuff i was even able to put two computers in the computer compartment -lrb- though i do n't recommend doing that i had to carry my personal and work computer back from work and forgot my computer case for the work computer -rrb- that being said , even with more stuff , the back-pack was much lighter it 's probably mostly due to the type of material used , but i think it may also have to do with the straps hardly feels like you 're carrying anything at all there are a lot of compartments in the back , and i seem to keep finding new ones every time i open up the bag
i love this laptop # inch bag great for my <unk> as an <unk> technician where i carry a laptop and other related tools for internet just waiting to get my tablet its great for students , it <unk> and
i am # ' # & # # ; and nearly # lbs i do n't want a backpack that makes me look # lbs and i do n't want one that looks like i it would fit a middle schooler this things holds all my gear and still has room fits nicely in the overhead compartment on the commuter train and can even be held in my lap when need be i have used the pack everyday for about # weeks now and have seen no signs of stress or defect yet the only gripe i have is that the side compartments would n't hold my camelbak # oz water bottle it fits nicely inside the pack so i did n't knock a star off i think if you had a smaller bottle it would work for you
