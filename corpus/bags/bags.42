my # yr old son is in college and i had just purchased him a # `` laptop i found this bag and thought it was perfect i gave it to my son and he just loved it and he uses it every day
i have been looking for a backpack that would hold my pretty big msi <unk> # the size is a bit big coming it at # . # x # . # x # . # inches it fits but it was it any wider -lrb- greater than # . # inches -rrb- it would not fit in hopefully this will give some people an idea of the holding area this backpack has for laptops
no complaints at all , comfortable shoulder strap and <unk> , lots of room but it doesnt look large i just wish it had straps so you could tighten it and so it wouldnt stick out when its nearly empty a great deal at $ # would highly
i have a # ' laptop , it everything fits well and it 's really comfortable especially when you take the security check at airport , your laptop can be accessed easily
little bit on the high side for the price for a backpack but worth every penny sufficient for # day travel needs and would be very comfortable as an carry on item
i was looking for a larger backpack to hold my laptop and books for college this backpack met that need and more the abundant pockets and storage area was enough to safety secure my laptop and books , notebooks , and binders needed for work and school very happy with this item
the backpack feels like its made from quality material and it does perfect for the job , carrying a # . # inch hp envy it looks great too even with the laptop and a couple of textbooks the backpack doesnt feel heavy i am a # ' # `` tall guy so take that into consideration i do wish the straps had a little more cushion or maybe slightly wider , but its great <unk>
i bought this backpack from swissgear and am delighted to own it it easily accomodates my # `` lenovo laptop , apart from a host of other stuff in the other # compartments , like adapter , mouse , usb , keys , mp # player , check books , etc . the <unk> of this product is its light weight and excellent packaging -- looks real good in black with the red emblem at the top i 've carried lots of stuff in it during my local trips in ny and london , and am using it daily to work in india it draws envious <unk> wherever i go the facility to scan a laptop without removing it from the bag is superb , but security guys in india are <unk> and insist on removing it fully i 'd have given it # stars but for the absence of cushioning on the top handle ; the back straps are <unk> though my <unk> wanted to buy one yesterday , but it looks like the price has <unk> <unk> to $ # -- i had paid only $ # . # in march , #
i was initially concerned about purchasing this backpack because i needed it to carry my # `` mac laptop and was n't sure it would fit it fit beautifully , with room to spare also easily carries my # `` dell laptop excellent construction and comfortable i have to walk quite far to work and this has made the walk much more <unk> has been great for air travel , as well
this backpack has so many pockets that i am able to place items & know where everything is the durability of the straps , pockets and overall manufacturing is ideal for my needs i carry a laptop , laptop cooling unit , ipad , notebooks and all the power cords for each working two -lrb- # -rrb- jobs this backpack rocks
it fits my alienware m # , it not only fits , it fits perfectly this is the only reason that i am writing this review , and hope it helps other alienware m # owners that are looking to see if this fits their m # like i was
even at full price , this backpack is worth the money it 's great for students , with a high textbook capacity , and the padded shoulder straps and back make it so comfortable to carry best backpack i 've ever seen
great quality product that can hold tons of books and my laptop at the same time i would recommend this for any college student or anyone who wants a backpack to last long in any type of weather
as we walked thru security all the tsa people said to empty bag when it was my turn to place the <unk> thru the scanner the tsa agent told me that this bag is a tsa friend we traveled through multiple airports along with cruise line ports and each time it was a non issue this may be a christmas gift for many this year . :
this is a great backpack i have a # `` screen toshiba with wide screen and numbers on keyboard there is plenty of room for it and some to spare on both sides in the laptop compartment it is perfect for my needs in college and work traveling from what i can tell so far i like all the compartments and the open design for scanning at the airport the scan compartment opens all the way and can hold other large items or books for times when not going through airport scanners i ca n't comment on durability yet , but i trust the brand based on my son 's recommendation after he finished # years of college recently
i bought this at sams club two years ago for my husband and he loved it this one was purchased for our son as a christmas gift with the same results it fits everything , mouse , laptop , wireless keyboard , and all of his kindle fire , and gaming accessories
this bag has a number of useful compartments it 's light and durable excellent for biking and hiking i use it all the time the different sections for this bag have just the right features needed for everyday travel
lots of pockets tsa in the us let my laptop stay in the bag canada did not it 's also pretty wide to store under the seat in front of me on the plane it fits , just a tight fit under some seats
i love the bag and the value , except for a problem that began within weeks of using the bag - the front compartment zipper gets disconnected , or off track , and never really closes the compartment now one zipper is gone , and the other does not zip the compartment one year in and it is useless
i travel weekly and needed a bag that was up to the task after two weeks of rolling through airports , to the office , and in and out of hotels , the case logic bag has already begun to tear quite noticeably around the rim of the case it is incredibly disappointing giving the amount of time i spent searching i suppose i should have just sucked it up and <unk> out the dollars for a tumi alpha
i 've had this bag a year now and functionally it 's a great bag holds my dell # in it 's own bag also will hold cables and such or a days worth of clothes problem is the front zipper failed a few months ago this past week tsa decided to really fix the zippers : -rrb- i 'm returning to amazon to see if i can get a refund off to find the perfect bag without spending $ # or
after having the patriot , i decided to get a check point friendly bag and the idea of it being more upright than wide appealed to me due to airline aisle width well it does all that but i typically fly with a carry on bag and this the weird shape of this prevents me from stacking this on my other bag so i am left dragging around # bags -lrb- one in each hand -rrb- if this bag simply had one of the straps in the back that my other bag handle could go through it would fix the issue if you want a single bag , it would work great for one nights worth of stuff however , since i like to workout when i travel , this bag can not accommodate clothes and shoes for the gym , plus next day work clothes i ended up using this on day trips , and stick to my back back and carry on for flying
i am impressed with the overall quality of the bag it has plenty of room for a laptop and clothing for an overnight i was a little disappointed in the quality of the included laptop sleeve i was a little hesitant because of the issues several people mentioned regarding the zippers but i have found them to be quite durable the handle works smoothly as do the wheels *** update : a year later and i still love this bag it has proven to be fairly durable but there is some wear in the areas that come into contact with flooring when being pulled along i have travelled extensively and found the bag to have plenty of storage and protection for my computer
i have made several weekend trips this year and i have used my caselogic laptop roller to carry my netbook i have also found places for my other electronic gadgets - including a nintendo ds , a psp , a digital camera , and all the accompanying cords it has a nice handle and rolls along rather well the many pockets do make it a little difficult to remember what is stored where - but if i continue to use it frequently , i 'm sure i could come up with a system that works for me for frequent travelers looking for an affordable way to carry electronics safely and securely , i would recommend this product
i like everything about the bag except that the zipper on the front compartment is messed up i 'm not sure what to do about that because all the packing materials were left behind when i traveled to <unk> for several months except for the zipper , which is obviously an <unk> , i am very pleased with the bag i actually safely packed three laptops into it for a trip from florida to <unk> including a # -inch , a # -inch and a # -inch it comes with a padded sleeve for a # -inch laptop i was able to take them all out , go through airport security without incident and put it all back together with very little fuss the handle and wheels work extremely well it is also very stable standing upright , unlike other carry-ons i 've had
this roller has worked out great as a replacement for my broken plastic rolling cart it holds all my paperwork , files , and office supplies the rollers allow it to glide <unk> on any surface , even asphalt the telescoping handle glides smoothly and adjusts for height
i am quite satisfied that the case will perform as well as its predecessor , although it is not constructed in the same style and will require some <unk> it would appear that the protection is adequate , convenience fine , and design and construction better than many of the competitors delivery was prompt and packing fine
i 'm using the case for storage for my electronics at this point have n't traveled as yet but i like the case , makes a nice appearance and plan to use it when we do feels very sturdy and holds a lot for it 's size was looking specifically for a case to hold a # `` laptop and this just fit the bill case logic <unk> # check point friendly # -inch laptop roller -lrb- black
this case has plenty of room for a # inch laptop plus my small canon <unk> scanner in the computer compartment the extras are just as noted and really exceeded my expectations lots of room for clothes and accessories very pleased with this buy also takes up very little space in the closet or trunk of the car caselogic <unk> # check point friendly # -inch laptop roller -lrb- black
this is a bit larger than i expected , but i think it 's great the most important thing in roller luggage is that it rolls smoothly and that the zippers run smoothly as well , without snags or problems the handle also pulls in and out easily it 's very light and is packed full of compartments for all sorts of <unk> items the computer bag is nicely padded and will secure into place the <unk> material seems quite strong and it 's sewn strong for extra durability it feels like great thought went into the design of this computer roller , which in itself , is refreshing i 'm not sure that a woman could get away with this for all her luggage needs on a short trip , but for a man , it 's perfect well done !
i have traveled several times within the us with this bag and it fits in every plane 's overhead compartment including the very small <unk> # i have used it also for international travel to india several times as well it 's small and light and is great for computers , tablets , <unk> etc . it can also hold a change of clothing i highly recommend it unless you need a larger number of carry on clothing items as much more than a pair of jeans , a shirt , <unk> and change of under <unk> will fill the clothing compartment easily
i received the case in very short order it is all that is advertized i am impressed with the organization this will be a huge help when i travel next month i wish i 'd had it before i last travelled
i was surprised with how flimsy this product seemed it 's okay and definitely better than no cover i do like that it comes in so many colors the first one i owned was purchased through apple but are no longer made for my laptop - great quality
i love the bright color of this case , and it fits my older mac perfectly the only problem for me is there are too many ventilation slots on the bottom case , and it has hardly any protection for my laptop luckily the case i had before only broke on the top , so i use this case on the top for its pretty color , and my sturdier incase bottom on
the cover fit the macbook laptop like a glove good , sturdy , translucent plastic however , the laptop cover can not be tilted back to the maximum position - - i.e . , the position i can tilt it to , without the cover i like my screen fully tilted and so can not use the cover which allows me to tilt it only slightly more from the vertical i had to remove the cover and put it away i will use it if i have to take the laptop on a trip , etc . , when it might provide some protection if i dropped it the cover should be fine for people who are not concerned about the tilt angle
this does n't really show you that its a <unk> see through plastic , not the lime green material i had been expecting but otherwise it works great and i love the height adjustment legs
this is a pretty good laptop case for the # `` plastic macbook i like the feet on the bottom that allow heat under the laptop to escape my only issue with the product is that the plastic stubs on the bottom front of the case can eventually come off , as the glue used to attach them is n't the greatest otherwise , good product
reliable and trustworthy seller product is just as advertised and arrived in # days i purchased the orange cover and it is even more beautiful in person than in <unk> full keyboard cover is very comfortable highly recommend this product to anyone with a laptop
i bought this case with the hope that it would serve as a protective case for my laptop similar to the `` otterbox `` cases for mobile phones alas , it does not appear to be that kind of product -lrb- otterbox people , are you listening ? ! ? -rrb- however , it is a fun way to personalize your laptop and a lot more interesting to look at than plain white it is also super easy to install : take it out of the packaging and snap it on to the top and bottom -- done
i love the cover and get compliments on it constantly definitely a conversation piece at work was shipped very quickly and is super easy to put on however , i 've only had the cover for a few weeks and the little traction feet pads have already fallen off other than that , if you love bright colors this is the cover for you
i wanted to protect my old macbook # i looked it up and made sure i purchased the right size the top fits just dandy - but the bottom is a little tight i 'm gon na keep it , i 'm not disappointed , also the keyboard cover takes some getting used to - but as i let the # year old learn on it and sometimes use it in the kitchen it 's worth the extra time to get use to it
i really like this case as it fits well the flip down feet are a good addition this case is really hard to remove though which can make cleaning difficult
i 'm really happy with this product it 's really pretty and it works just like i wanted it to it 's kind of tricky to remove , but that 's probably a good thing
i bought this for my white macbook and am very pleased the color is very vibrant the case fits perfectly and was easy to put on it is very sturdy and protects against dirt and scratches the case was a great buy
nothing much except i love my green plastic cover i am very satisfied as to color <unk> , material only problem once i installed it to my mac book i <unk> n't remove it cuz i need to clean first my macbook outside surface there is no instruction how to detach it i do n't like to force remove because it might break since it is plastic as i tried to remove it from my mac , a little crack <unk> at the corner
this macbook cover is awesome , not only is it very reasonably priced but it looks great much cheaper than the silicone covers easy to snap in place and the built in feet allow you to type much more easily and comfortably
this is the third one of these plastic cases i have bought from this seller needless to say i am well pleased with these i had a couple of macbooks that looked scuffed up from use , but once i put these cases on them they looked brand new the macbooks i have been selling have the manufacturer 's defect with the chipping at the edges of the keyboard and screen <unk> these cases keep that from happening and they look real cool the apple logo glows through the plastic when the computer is on i highly recommend these
its better than i thought it would be i got it because i have a small crack in my laptop case - i was worried that i was going to get water inside of it i put it on -lrb- i ca n't get it off , though -rrb- and its working great
i had an older model and just got this new one , and i could n't imagine it could get better , but it did easy to get on and off , allows for great ventilation , have n't ever had a problem with overheating yet , and the feet are a great feature the color is also so vibrant and cute might i just say that i love this case
i bought this item for my original black/white macbook and it works wonderfully . it fits correctly and i like that it has the feet on the bottom to help with <unk> after i got mine , my mom liked it so much that i bought her one for christmas its a very good deal and a good product
not only was the product everything i could have hoped for , but it came ever quicker than i expected it snapped easily onto my computer and is working at both keeping it scratch resistant and beautifully colorful
i really like this case at first when i bought the item i was a little skeptical about the quality of the product because of the price turns out its a good buy some would say even a steal . great product for a very reasonable price the case fit like a glove on my computer and on top of that my computer look stylish ; -rrb-
i am so glad i purchased this green mcover it is a perfect fit for my macbook and i love the colors offered and of course it protects my macbook very well i will definitely plan to buy other colors in the future
this is an excellent case for the macbook or macbook pro i have gotten # of them so far for each of my computers you ca n't beat the price and selection for this product also , i got a free matching keyboard skin too the case itself is very durable and the feet really help to keep the computer cool and in a nice typing position have never had any problems with the cases and they fit perfectly
it is pretty but pulling the red flap open is cumbersome one needs to squeeze the computer in . . a flap that opened the entire length or width would be so much better you have to fold this over then work it in even <unk> closed , the opening stays <unk> a little not easy and i will find something else
i bought this for my new samsung chromebook # & # # ; i really liked the price , but when i got it it was way too big for the chromebook if you keep the foam padding that came inside the case it fits fine , but its about an inch too big
i bought this for a carrying sleeve for my acer chrombook and it does exactly what i described it 's a fast sleeve to pop my chromebook in when going somewhere and i do n't need the charger or any other accessories like earphones that said , it 's only good to protect from scratching but not much else however , i do n't look at that as a <unk> of the product design as that 's what it 's designed for pros - quick , easy , slip sleeve for toting your <unk> - limited to a ` one duty ' roll ca n't / should n't be used for traveling protection no accessory pouch -lrb- s
this is a nice little sleeve that fits my asus ul # ft very well i like that there are no zippers to scratch , etc . unfortunately , i did not have it long before the edge of the cover flap started to rip away it 's stable now , and its protective capabilities are not diminished , but i would prefer if it did n't rip in the first place
i can put my # . # `` asus laptop -lrb- asus ul # <unk> # -rrb- in the sleeve but i 'd like to say it is pretty hard to put it in and get it out because the poor design of the ear
i purchased this for my # `` powerbook g # after doing research i found that my powerbook g # was about the same dimensions as the asus u # <unk> # laptop this case was made for , so i decided to buy it i like the no zipper idea for any case because they tend to scratch the edges of the laptop , so this case is perfect it fits the powerbook g # perfectly except the case is slightly too long so theres some extra space , but not too much ... it 's almost perfect as for protection , there is n't as much padding as i 'd hoped , but overall it is a great case
a tight fit -lrb- what i wanted -rrb- for a lenovo x # with a # cell battery i looked for a review that mentioned that particular model and could n't find one so i had to leave a review for the next guy that 's looking
i purchased this case because i liked the idea of no zippers to scratch the netbook and for that it works great there are really no frills or any other exciting things to mention ... its a protective neoprene case . . it does it job i did not end up using all that much , but i do use it when carrying the netbook in a messenger bag or other luggage i use this with <unk> eee pc seashell # <unk> # <unk> # . # -inch black netbook - # hours of battery <unk>
fits the # inch asus # b pretty well with a little bit of wiggle room it is not the most padded laptop sleeve , but it prevents the laptop from scratches when i put it in my bag , which is all i really want
i use the case for a thinkpad x # it is a little tight for it , but fits tight the case looks good , but i subtracted one star because the padding is rather thin i would not trust it to give much protection when dropped
i bought this bundled with my asus # n laptop and the it fits great its a nice and snug fit that does n't allow for movement within the durability of the case is pretty good i got a small tear on the corner of the flap a couple days after receiving it as a result of how tight it is when trying to pull the flap over , but it hasnt compromised protection the protection from scratches and dust is great i wish that it had come in blue though
nice sleeve for my asus vx # it 's not tight but it 's nice and should provide good protection i 'd recomend if you are going to put your netbook in a backpack or suitcase to help protect it
this is manufactured by casecrown , very good quality i was surprised by the quality of this thing cause i expected it is asus branded even for my older thick # `` x # , i can fit in easily
does exactly what it says , shipped in a couple of days , no complaints whatsoever so i gave it a perfect score this is not meant to be a carrying case , as i would probably put my netbook in this sleeve and then into a suitcase or briefcase
i was nervous at first if it would fit , however , my new chrome book slips in and its well protected i love it the price was too good to be true the price tag was on the sleeve still and the brand is great great price , delivery was as said , less actually , and perfect condition highly recommend for the new chrome book
granted , i was sure to check the dimensions of the product before buying it for my netbook , but even doing that is n't always a guarantee of a good fit in this case , however , it fit like a glove not only was it sized well , the <unk> of the neoprene ensured that the case contoured nicely to my netbook the smoothness of the material makes it easy to insert and remove my device , despite the <unk> snug fit , and enables me to quickly stuff the whole thing in my bag , knowing the device is protected the flap on top is more than enough to ensure your device does n't inadvertently slide out -- who needs a zipper if i were forced to <unk> , i would say the neoprene does n't smell great at first , but that 's just the price of <unk> for neoprene give it a rinse or two and the smell will eventually <unk> in any event , certainly nothing to <unk> a lower <unk>
i got this for my # & # # ; samsung series # chromebook and it fits it perfectly i 've had this for a long time now , and it 's protected it greatly the seams have all held up very well and even though sometimes i carry it by the lip of it , it has n't stretched out or distorted at all
i did n't know if this will fit my motorola <unk> lapdock , but for $ # , why not try it but i found out when it arrived that it fits perfectly ! ! ! and for $ # , its a good deal ! ! ! im glad i did n't buy the more expensive ones
i work for bank of america and they issued me this bag with my work laptop the bag is very sturdy with lots of compartments for accessories , phone , wallet , etc . i have had it for about # months with zero issues very nice bag and i recommend it for work or non work related laptop carrying needs
i travel a fair amount for work , both domestic and international , and have shopped bags around quite a bit overall i feel this is a very solid bag and a great value for the money very well made , good looking , and with ample room for laptop , extra battery and charger , ipad , headphones , notepad , accessories , etc . it has a very comfortable shoulder strap and a couple of nice zipper pouches on the front of the bag which make accessing boarding passes , passports , and other random stuff easy the x-ray friendly butterfly zipper also makes getting through tsa easier when a tsa precheck line is not available the only drawback i can see is that , while the two main zippers appear to be of more heavy-duty construction , the remaining three exterior compartment zippers are of lighter construction i just got the bag and ca n't say if this will be an issue , but it 's something i did notice as i had hoped for larger zipper tabs all the way around just a personal preference provided they hold up this probably wo n't be an issue
i brought this to replace another laptop bag that was highly rated , but was falling apart after less than a few month of light use this bag is a bit bigger than my other bag , but it 's design , quality workmanship and material are worthwhile it fix my macbook pro retina # . # & # # ; nicely the laptop is well protected on all sides which is mostly the reason it 's bit bigger the material is of good quality i find <unk> for airport security check-in to be different -lrb- than the ones i used before -rrb- , but functional the padded shoulder strap is a nice touch it stays firmly in place when i walk or bend down overall a good decision and well designed bag
i can fit one laptop , one ipad , several folders of documents , and all kind of loose accessaries -lrb- keys , pens , mouse , cables , charger , hotspot , phone , snack , etc -rrb- this is a all-around good bag that you can take everything you need for doing work on the go it is compact , good looking , and sturdy
the best bag for your macbook i purchased a macbook pro and did n't want to sacrifice protection after researching all the available bags , in terms of price , features , the best protection and social <unk> , yes this is important to me brenthaven can not be beaten do not hesitate , buy it the vendor i used through amazon did an excellent job of packaging the bag and having it delivered on time
after a long wait i finally received my <unk> monitor carrier it looks well made , and i love the design and features the mesh pockets for mouse and cords is a nice design feature the keyboard mount looks good as well the case seems adequately padded and the handle is nice the problem is that on arrival , one of the small snap buckles that help stabilize the lateral movement of the monitor within the case was broken these snaps are not well made careful inspection shows that the two spots where they broke -lrb- which actually broke the snap in half -rrb- is the thin plastic bands that connect the female side of the buckle to the strap the two areas that broke are about a millimeter thick and this does not seem like a very good design i have emailed <unk> support and i will see if they can send me a replacement snap
i got this bag to provide more protection than what bubble wrap in the suitcase can provide its compact and fits in over head storage and i recommend it to anyone who travels and works wanting the second screen to their <unk>
i carry my monitor to all my lan parties before i would have to wrap my monitor up and on a few occasions it got scratched thats no longer an issue with the widescreen gaming bag it fits perfectly around my # inch monitor , easy to carry and has a small pouch for <unk>
i have an hp envy <unk> # & # # ; this was the only bag i could find that did n't cost a fortune it makes it much easier to carry my computer back and forth to work my computer fits in it securely i am giving it # stars because the few pockets it has are very small it has straps that secure your keyboard onto the front of the case , and the mouse fits okay into the mesh pocket most of the time i end up throwing my power cord into either my purse of tote bag and i have an external cd drive that i also have to carry separately if not for the lack of storage , i would have given it # stars
i looked all over for a case to store and/or carry my <unk> <unk> # u <unk> monitor to no avail all laptop cases were too small , and anything that seemed like it could possible fit ran well into the $ # 's after quite a bit of searching i finally came across this carrier and decided to give it a go despite a delay in shipping due to weather in my area , i was ecstatic to finally receive this item i immediately opened it up and tested it out its a perfect fit with room in the front accessory pocket for the <unk> to my device definitely suggest this to anyone else looking for a way to protect their <unk> -lrb- or any other large <unk> <unk> such as wacom <unk> or <unk> <unk> -rrb-
i bought a # & # # ; <unk> for my pop up camper and this bag is perfect for packing it up for storage after a camping trip if you have to schlep your <unk> this is perfect adjustable fit , great quality , and designed perfectly to accomodate different stands and brands i just wish it has a larger zippered pocket for storage
these work amazingly well i 've fit them on everything from a tiny new asus # & # # ; # p to an old fat dell # & # # ; # monitor fit both great you can squeeze a # & # # ; in there , but about # & # # ; of the screen -lrb- not bezel -rrb- on left and right sides will not be protected still better than running bare and could probably add your own protection
i use this for a # & # # ; tv to carry around to trade shows works audio # flat panel stand with tripod legs tv fits in here along with components and remote perfect for my use
i 'm traveling a lot , hauling two desktop computers and two laptops note : this product is not for a laptop ; it is for a monitor my `` <unk> `` is super easy to throw over my viewsonic monitor and `` click , click . the mesh bag is a little tight for a mouse and cables but i am not at all bothered by that this product looks like a bullet-proof <unk> for my monitor having it makes it easier for me to protect and haul what i need when i have to work <unk>
i needed a bag to carry and store my # & # # ; flat screen tv to/from my travel <unk> this bag fits the bill perfectly at a reasonable price the outside mesh pockets can be used to carry power adapters , usb and antenna cords , etc .
the base of it sticks out , but its great to carry around in case you move alot , or have jobs that require you to bring your gear with you its got a hard piece of plastic to protect the screen so you dont have to be all that <unk> with it once the case is on
love this product i have a # inch led monitor that i take everywhere with me . my monitor see a ton of bumps and <unk> and bangs and this thing has protected it no matter what hold accessories quite nicely too great build quality and the shoulder strap is a bonus my coworkers and gamer friends are quite jealous of this
this is exactly a perfect fit for my wacom # ux ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! the quality of it is perfect , its made very well and the qc is there this product is the best purchase i 've made this year
this is a very functional case for your big screen stand i used this to carry from office to hotel everyday open back allows quick packing without having to remove the stand i would not check this through the airport , but i used it in the luggage after taking out the stand i may get a sleeve to wrap the screen before using the case because where i am , it is very dusty , and the sleeve will over some more protection
this bag looked great online but once i received it , i was instantly disappointed i use a messenger bag for <unk> serves as my `` office `` as i am constantly in and out of client 's homes this bag just did n't do the trick it was small and pretty <unk> to carry and there were very few compartments i think it would be great for a student to carry a few books back and forth to school , but not for what i needed it for i returned the item and purchased a high sierra tank messenger bag
it 's an excellent bag for your computer it protects it fairly well and it has a lot of space to keep everything the average user might need we use to carry around my wife # macbook keep in mind that it 's really big , its not a small bag it 's more of a work or college bag
i loved the color of the bag and the front pocket hold a lot of little things the pack lacks a little in the fact that once my computer is in the bag , there is n't much more space for more than one large book , maybe two
this is our daughter 's laptop bag it works really well , plenty of room for her # -inch laptop , headphones , mouse , power cord , etc . fabric quality is good , looks cute , and is easy to carry due to the padded strap only drawback to using this as a laptop bag is lack of cushioning we 're pretty careful with it , so it has n't been an issue , but she does n't take it to school or travel with it very often i do n't think it would work for a college student unless they were careful or added some cushioning great for the price though
i simply do not have enough positive things to say about this messenger bag it has made it through two years come this march with heavy use during the first year i used this bag for textbooks and my laptop -lrb- which i kept in a sleeve as there is no padding in this bag -rrb- the bag stood up very well , the only damage it has sustained in two years is staining and a small tear in the netting on the side that is meant to hold a water bottle at the time of purchase , this was the the most girly messenger bag available for a reasonable price i would certainly repurchase this item or recommend to a friend
this was bought for a gift , the little girl that received uses everyday for school and would n't go back to her old backpack i got it for a great price during a sale
i got this and loved the design , the low profile and especially the handles unfortunately , one of the handles broke on the second use and it was not due to any sort of unusual use ; i just picked it up and one side just came off clearly it had n't been sewn on very well disappointing , especially b/c i really liked this case and wanted it to work
case provides only convenient handles to carry the computer and acts as a dust cover it does not provide drop protection from even just two feet my screen cracked while inside this case from a two foot accidental drop the computer was # days old lucky for me , i found a new screen on <unk> , but it cost me $ # and a couple of weeks not having the computer to use
i bought this for my # `` laptop because the description of the product states it 's for a # `` laptop i tried inserting my laptop and i could n't even get the zipper to close i had to return it
