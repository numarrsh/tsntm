this sleeve is really nice the quality is great for what i payed for it , and it arrived really fast the sleeve is thin , but has a good `` foamy `` material inside to reduce shock there 's also a little protector from the zipper , preventing scratches from the inside and out it 's a little snug on my computer so it 's not an effortless removal after you squeeze your macbook inside , but i do have a shell which <unk> to that factor there have n't been any problems with the sleeve , and i feel like this was a good buy it 's clean , simple , and worth getting for your mac
this fits my late # & # # ; macbook pro with retina display model me # ll/a perfectly with a speck hard shell case on the computer it will still fit into this sleeve , but it 's a much snugger fit since the hard shell adds to the thickness
this is a great alternative to the $ # cases found at big box stores it fits my macbook pro # & # # ; perfectly ; not too tight but not loose i found the small pocket on the front to be useful for the storage of a microfiber cloth to clean the screen well built and looks brand new after # months of moderate use
nice design and size fits great on a # `` hp pavilion g # series but it is just like a cover , is not too thick , so if by accident your laptop fell down , the sleeve will not protect it from harm , only dust and scratches would be better with more foam inside
my daughter loved this for her computer but it was not as described and was for a # inch computer and she has a # inch so it was just to big we returned it too bad i am still looking for a # inch
this laptop cover is so cute and functional the only problem i had was that it was considerably too big for my # inch hp laptop i am a picky person and even though i loved the case i could n't get over how loose it was so i ended up getting another case made especially for hp 's i believe this case would fit most # inch laptops not # inch
case is what i hoped it would be quality and fit my daughter picked it out for herself and she is happy with it great price , great value
i always bring my laptop to work on my backpack recently i bought a new laptop and i really wanted to protect it from getting scratch this bag did the job
four stars : perfect fit for my macbook air mid- # model the bottom sticker was the easiest to put on , followed by the lid , and the <unk> cover being the hardest - # star - & # # ; no instructions included with package other than an <unk> website reference the installation videos provided on youtube were well done , though
installation is easy do n't worry about <unk> it during adjustment periods however , it would get better ratings if the holes for screws and apple logo were cut to ensure even coverage installation required the skins to be a little off-center to ensure that all cuts were aligned properly
good product , good quality performs as expected the outline of the skin does not align # % with that of the laptop other than that it is a very good product protects laptop from scratches , looks awesome , the apple logo shows through would recommend purchasing
received yesterday and applied last night on my mac air it is tricky to get right and lined up but the product is pretty easy to work with laptop looks great and you really have to look closely to find where it does not line up perfectly on edges and cut outs i highly recommend
i am in the construction industry my previous macbook pro received many dents and scratches from day to day use on a construction site this product protects my mac from scuffs and scratches
the skin was really easy to put on and it even provides a complete carbon skin for the iphone # s looks hot and everyone who sees it always loves it
this cover is made of very durable material and the design was very nice there were no surprises when i received the product i do have to say that the installation is not as easy as it seems i am somewhat a perfectionist and to get it to <unk> with the edges was difficult on the positive side , unlike other sticky stuff , you can <unk> and install over while fresh without <unk> the stickiness of the product
it was so pretty ! my # `` macbook pro fit perfectly with a hard case on it i dropped my computer on the corner in this sleeve and the zipper broke so i 'm sending it back but other than that it is a good product and i would recommend it it 's just as pretty in person as in the picture
the case is just as pretty as it looked in the picture i like that it has a zipper flap to protect my computer from the zipper it is slightly padded and that 's all i wanted , just something to protect it from scratches and spills the only `` problems `` i have is the hint of `` new `` smell but a dryer sheet should fix that also , it is slightly too large for my macbook pro # `` but nothing of major concern all in all i am happy . =
it 's exactly what i expected and wanted it 's large enough for my tablet and keyboard case and it will hold my power cords i highly recommend it if you want a larger carrying
holds up well , i have been carrying it for about a year now it has n't faded or anything and has done a good job of protecting my laptop it does n't hurt that it 's adorable i have gotten a lot of complements
i purchased this item and when it arrived i tried to place my # . # laptop into the case it did not fit the case has no interior pockets and is cheaply made needless to say i tried to get a refund but could not return the item since it had passed the <unk> date for return i will not purchase another item from this company
this product is not as nice as the picture the colours are not as they seem , they seem to have a yellow tinge to them this product also has a very strong material smell -lrb- almost chemical -rrb- if you are to leave it on your bed , that part of your bed will have the same strong smell this product still does what i want it to do , just is not as nice looking as i expected
this bag was great the design on the side is as shown and i really really like it it could use a little more padding , but it 's padded enough that i 'm not afraid to put it in my backpack i do wish that the strap was longer , but it 's not it only extends to about # or # . # feet which barely goes over my shoulder so i can carry it like that i also wish that the option for carrying it by the handles was doable without having to keep the bag partially unzipped ... just seems inconvenient
the item is nice however was not exactly what i was looking for it will protect my daughters laptop but i was looking for a case that was much sturdier so it would n't get damaged . my fault not the sellers item is a neoprene like material sleeve , and i wanted a carrying case with harder sides
love the look of this bag i do wish the handles were outside of the zipper though and i did n't get the shoulder strap in my order i would like a different style next time to meet more of my needs
it 's a nice thin , neoprene case that allows you to bring your laptop safely with you the design is just as vibrant as it looks in the pictures fits my hp laptop perfectly i have n't used the carrying strap that is included , so i ca n't comment on the quality of that -- i zip it up in the sleeve , pop it in the messenger bag , and go
i liked the case , i just wish i would have noticed it did n't have a pouch inside or out to place smaller items other than that i love the design and it is sturdy
it 's a little big for my hp # . # `` laptop there is about an inch at the top , so it does n't fit as well as i wanted the picture is also printed weirdly it 's almost like it was printed twice on there with one kind of faded it 's also adds a bit of weight to carrying the laptop , but it certainly has plenty of cushion to protect my laptop that is <unk> what i was looking for
there 's just enough room for my hp # & # # ; laptop - there 's no room for the charging cord or any other accessories it is cute and seems to be well made though
i was hesitant thinking the quality of this would not be good because of the design on it , but it turned out to be a fantastic buy fits perfectly . . like a glove
i like the design of the bag as well as the design my lab top first like a glove in the back the <unk> feels great and it can be wiped off i like the graphic design that i may buy the matching skin for my computer
at first i thought this was a great case but after using it for a while the magnets to hold the flap closed seemed to be less and less effective after being unsatisfied i purchased the case made by samsung and was amazed at how much the case crown one <unk> in comparison both in material and manufacturing quality worst of all though ... when i went to switch from this case to the samsung one i learned that this case leaves black <unk> all over the back of the tablet ! ! ! i 'd recommend going with the samsung one it is definitely not worth saving # dollars to have marks left behind all over your galaxy tab
possibly the biggest waste of money i have ever spent on a product not only does it not fit the tablet , but it does not have any cut-outs for the <unk> buttons the tablet itself slides too much and when in landscape mode i can not even access the home buttons down at the bottom the way the case stands is also a joke as it only improves the angle very slightly to having it flat i am beginning to think that i have been sent a case for a different tablet the only thing positive about this case is the fact that it looks good but the other features ruin it for me i will be staying well clear of case crown in the future
i loved this case at first , did exactly what it said however , after two months of light use , it bends and folds , and doesnt keep its shape as i had hoped the lip that holds it bends easily and i have to use both the case and something else to prop the galaxy up , then it slips i find it easier to just leave it flat and go from there i was hoping this product would work well , but <unk> , it was short lived
i purchased the casecrown bold standby case for the galaxy tab # . # about a month ago i like the <unk> , magnetic closure , and openings for the camera and speakers there are several things i do n't like about the case , however first of all , it 's got about half an inch of excess room , i imagine for use with other tablets that means i 'm constantly pushing the tab up from the bottom to get to the home key , etc . this is the biggest nuisance the other inconveniences i 'm dealing with relate to the lack of port access in order to charge the device the case must be left open in order to use headphones , you must either remove the case all together or flip the tablet around , blocking the primary port for charging it 's a nice case , but not ideal for the galaxy tab
naturally you would like the flap on the top when you hold it or or use the triangle stand when doing so the volume button and on/off sit on the bottom and charge port on the top
i needed an expensive case to use while i researched cases , and i am pleasantly surprised at the construction of this inexpensive case it does have a few drawbacks i have the wifi only tab and it does n't fit as snuggly as i 'd like into this case there is a lot of wiggle room in this case as well , there is no cut-out for the power and volume rocker buttons , so you 're always taking the tablet out of the case to turn it <unk> or use the volume rocker because of the wiggle room , the case sometimes shifts to cover the camera lens when you 're on a video call i paid under $ # , and the case looks and feels nice and does protect the device i 'll eventually replace it with something that has more bells and whistles -lrb- such as a place to store my stylus -rrb- , but i 'm in no hurry at this point
this was a fantastic buy at under $ # , and it fit the galaxy tab very well it maintains the sleek feel of the tab , while protecting it nicely the material did get a depression or bruise at some point , but is on par with other covers the only complaint is that it is impossible to keep the case closed while charging the device , due to a lack of a cutout for this this is a necessary trade-off , since providing a <unk> would expose it to the elements
the case fits my tablet very <unk> the only problem i found with it was when i am watching a video or listening to music the speakers are covered , but i fixed that by using head phones . very good case
just in case your not sure , this is not real leather however , it looks and feels similar to leather and may possible wear as well unlike some of the covers i 've used i like the way this one lets you lay it down but tilted towards you for easier typing it also works to stand the tablet almost upright it fits well and works well an i am very satisfied with it at it 's reasonable price
this has been a great case so far , just got it and love it so far the only problem that i have with it is that when folding the stand to type at an angle , the camera port at the bottom makes it essentially sit upside down , which some <unk> do n't support it also makes turning it on and off somewhat awkward as the ports are upside down , not on top like normal otherwise a great case that does n't add too much bulk and looks very classy with all black leather
not overly impressed with the <unk> on the front panel ... which seems would wear excessively over some months and <unk> for my kindle fire give this case an average rating ordered same for my wife 's galaxy tab # . # and think it is overall a better cover for the bigger device over the small device would order another for the galaxy tab but not for the smaller kindle
wow ! fits like a glove and great protection for my tablet this will be a great help , and it came really fast arrived way before they said it would
it fits my wifi galaxy tab # . # comfortably , and after a little adjustment the cameras have <unk> <unk> the stand works well for watching youtube , netflix , and amazon instant video -lrb- through the web <unk> , no built in <unk> app -rrb- in portrait or landscape mode i 'm not sure how much robustness it does or does n't add , but honestly i 'm generally not concerned with that usually electronics nowadays can withstand a couple of <unk> without breaking that said , i generally do n't buy cases , so while this works great as a case for the case <unk> , a case aficionado may want to take my feedback with a grain of salt
maybe my expectations were too high for this case but i was not impressed at all this thing practically stores lint in between itself and my computer plus , the glossy finish is like magnet for small scratches sorry for all of the <unk> but i would n't reccomend this case if lint and scratches are major issues for you
first , it took a month and half to receive this case second , it arrived in the cheapest packaging with tape everywhere third , there were scratches on the side on the case even though it was covered in bubble wrap i do n't know what i was thinking because i know i 'm not the only one with a bad review for this product for the extra # bucks , i 'll just go to the apple store and get a better quality case i hope to get my money back my request has been sent , if it does n't get approved i will not be happy ! gr
the idea for attaching a protective shell to a macbook pro is actually pretty good , but this case is poorly done the edges are sharp enough to cut yourself if you are not careful , and the plastic material is glossy and not likely to look good for very long nice color , but not nice enough to outweigh the drawbacks it is going back to amazon
the company delivering the product did so in a timely fashion the product itself is a tight-fitting , clear protector for the macbook and seems that it would do what it is intended to do which is protect the computer the issue is that the hard plastics of the shell have very sharp edges , uncomfortable to the touch and remind one of the feel of a paper cut for this reason , i am returning the item
while the case looks good and fits properly , the back left corner is very flimsy and broke after having it for only # days overall this is a decent case but i could not recommend it to anyone else
it 's a really nice looking case but the corners on the base are starting to chip after just a month or so of heavy use but is still kinda
the case looks very nice , my main problem was that it gets scratched very easily so it goes from shiny to scratched up i flipped the macbook on its top to replace the the hdd with an ssd i turn it back up and there 's scratches every where it is made of plastic , it was only its top on a wooden table
this is a good product however , people should be aware that using it will increase the size and weight of the laptop the plastic tends to scratch super easily i bought it to cover with stickers so it doesnt bother me
have had case for # months so far stays sturdy and strong only issue is that it fits so snugly to my laptop that i 'm having trouble getting it off to clean the inside of it -lrb- it still <unk> dirt particles
it is a good cover , i can say also that this case protects my new macbook pro but it has came scratched this case also protects your computer from everything that can happens to it
good product , although it does add some weight to my laptop , i am pretty satisfied with it overall a good product because it will protect your laptop from getting any scratches , and green is my favorite color
so far so good my computer has gotten a little warmer than usual with the case on - but it protects well against normal scratches - which was the point of getting it i have n't tried cleaning it yet , which may be the trial of fire
this case looks great and fits my macbook pro perfectly the color is so girlie , and i constantly get tons of compliments on how cute it looks never mind how well it protects from scratches and the elements when i remove the cover , the macbook looks brand new
i have only had my speck case for about a month now , but so far i like it and feel it was worth spending $ # arrived on time and in brand new condition
it takes literally a snap to put this on fits perfectly and looks great i had read that scratches could be a problem and it remains to be seen but it is a protective case and scratches on the case are better than scratches on the laptop
this product seems to be a decent product it snaps on the macbook pro nicely and provides the scratch protection for my laptop that i bought this for the only problem i have with this is that while it protects the laptop from scratches , it is very prone to scratches itself i have had this case for half a day and it already has some scratches , and that 's with me trying to be careful with my <unk> all in all , it does what it is supposed to do and that 's protect the laptop
using amazon prime , my case arrived in two days , as promised the case went on easily and was easy to clean when opening the macbook the top cover pops off a slight bit , but is easy <unk> by opening the laptop only a little differently the case is also easy to remove for <unk> cleaning the box the case comes in is a little difficult to open , only because it is held in there so well
i really like the way this color looks on my macbook it is probably one of my favorite cases , and fits well speck always has good products , i did not hesitate to buy this
i absolutely love this case especially since it is cheaper than buying it on <unk> i 'm a new mac owner and i needed a case for my computer and this one fit the needs i was looking for it fits my mac beautifully the only negative is that it attracts hair like crazy i 'm constantly cleaning hair off it from my boyfriend 's cat other than that one issue , the case looks beautiful and i 've received many compliments
i like this case a lot , it really <unk> my macbook and protects it i bought this particular product because my friend who works at the apple store said never buy anything but speck because the others will scratch your computer the only two complaints i have are a -rrb- i ordered the raspberry because i wanted hot pink , and the color is a little <unk> when the apple light is on , it 's clearly hot pink , but when it 's off i have a lot of people say , `` oh nice it 's red ! `` : - -lrb- b -rrb- it scratches really easily i 'm glad the computer itself is being protected , but i 'm really sad about how scratched the cover has become in about two weeks
it was easy to put on and is not bulky i like the clear case i have only had it on for a month so we will see how it holds up long term when i called the apple store to ask about products , this brand was what they recommended i obviously found it on amazon for way less
this case fits my # `` macbook pro perfectly i bought the clear case and it makes my computer look so sleek and shiny it is very easy to put <unk> the cover and i was very impressed with how it releases the hot air out the bottom and does n't trap it i highly recommend this <unk> is now my second one i have purchased -lrb- yes i am beginning to love to change colors ! i gave this product # stars instead of # because it tends to scratch very easily other than that , i love <unk> makes my macbook pro look even more impressive - and it also was shipped quicker than expected
i ordered two other cases before ordering this one because i was being cheap . i wish i would have just ordered this one the first time i would recommend to anyone who has a macbook and does not want to take away from the look of the computer
very nice product i gave my other mbp to my wife , and i just purchased a new mbp as well as this protective case for it it fits it great , and all ports are readily available the description says that it is see thru , but i believe a better description would be `` opaque / semi see thru `` it fits really nice and will still go into my soft `` incase `` sleeve i love it
this is a very durable cover , it was exactly what i needed great value for the money the only thing that i did n't like was i originally ordered blue and received black i sent it back and was shipped the blue one
a clear cast that fits perfectly on the macbook , as described so far i havent had any problems ... its been on since the day i received it kind of like a hard , clear plastic outer shell i like mine a lot
i fell in love with this case as soon as i placed it on my mac i feel so much safer carrying it around , and it also feels sturdier for some reason -lrb- maybe less delicate ? -rrb- the only thing i could recommend when applying it is to do it in the bathroom or something -lrb- somewhere without <unk> flying around so much -rrb- so that no <unk> particles get caught under the case this happened with a few specks even though i cleaned my computer and the case prior to the application it 's not too bad , though however , be careful once applying the case because it may be hard to take it off i tried to remove it just for the hell of it but it proved a difficult task but it 's okay because i prefer that to it coming off on its own in the near future it is also does not interfere with my wrists when i type so that is good
i have previously bought the same product for my wife 's macbook from the apple store and liked it when i bought my used macbook i wanted it for my macbook this product does a excellent job protecting our macbooks and is also attractive letting you see the good <unk> laptop that the macbook is with this clear plastic cover
the blue apple looks just great and is great for presentations it has protected my computer from many scratches the little thingies on the corners wear out somewhat quickly , though nevertheless , it was a great purchase
this case is awesome in protecting you macbook from cosmetic blemishes though it might not protect it from getting run over on a car , it is still a very good investment thought it does make your macbook a little <unk> , its better than getting it all scuffed up
not sure why there would be any negative reviews for this product it works awesome looks good , adds grip where the aluminum body of the imac can be slippery and protects against most external damage i got the black cover and it looks sweet i would recommend this product to anyone # months later and the case is still awesome the only reason i updated this was because amazon lets you see your previous reviews and this was easy to access i do n't even know if this product is still available , but it rocks
i love this thing although it bulks up the macbook a tad , its totally worth the protection i travel a lot and my laptops see a lot of abuse and previous mac 's have gotten some good dents but ive had this a while now and its been absolute rock solid i take the case off maybe once every # months to clean it and the macbook looks pristine
this works really well i was careful with my previous macbook pro , but it was unavoidable for it to get small scratches during use -lrb- unless you never move it from your desk ! -rrb- most of the the time we do not move the notebook inside a case ... when moving at home , in the office so , with my brand new macbook pro # `` , this `` second hard skin `` is the best protection i have found ! it 's harder then a film , so it does protect against dings as well and the computer still fits inside my old tucano sleeve for the macbook , which i can still use to double up for even safer transport , and for keeping the speck case from getting overly scratched i have had no problem with <unk> the computer , nor with overheating , like a few of the comments suggested i look forward to my macbook pro staying <unk> new for years to come ! ... and if the cover gets too scratched , i can replace for $ # - not a bad deal at all i recommend this # % !
i love this ! it protects my new macbook pro yet looks like there 's nothing on it thank you for a fast and easy transaction buy with confidence
<unk> liked it but the color was off so she asked them to replace it and they did so give it a try and i expect you will like it
i have two macbook pro the first one i bought the same case that i just bought again so you figure this case really protects my computer best deal
i was a little hesitant to buy a cover for my # ' mbp , but when i got it i knew i made the right decision it fits great and the price is even better
i have gone through several cases just to try how they are for my old macbook pro i had i purchased a topcase brand case which was a darker green and the part the snaps on the macbook would be a scratch hazard with my new macbook pro i purchased this speck case and am i completely satisfied the color and transparency is a nice tone and looks just like the picture and the clips <unk> n't damaging to the laptop at all i give # stars and highly recommend purchasing this it is worth your money
bought this item for my bf because he did n't like the green case we had on it when we got the laptop and plus it was worn down because we had the same case for quite a while already he like it because it protected the mac and it looked as if it did n't have a case on it i love it as well too :
i 've had this case for about a month now , and i 'm really happy with it it is a little darker pink than the picture shows , but the color still looks great i would say it 's definitely raspberry colored , while in the picture it looked more hot pink there are a few scratches on the case , but the whole reason i bought the case was so that it would get scratched instead of the computer itself it fits my computer really well and looks great it 's also nice that pet hairs and dust do n't stick to it the way they stick to some of the other satiny cases i 've seen
the case was perfect for my macbook pro , cause i have my dj logo up front didnt have to bother putting the sticker on . i just placed the <unk> over the clear case and that was
i have had this on my # mid year macbook pro and i love it ! if it is put on correctly , meaning not upside down -lrb- `` speck `` should be at the hinged right corner -rrb- , it fits perfectly and you wo n't even notice it 's on there are some light scratches on mine after two years , but is n't that the point to have the scratches on the case and not the laptop itself i have a snow white decal on the lid and this case helps protect that also i highly recommend this cover if you want to see your laptop and keep your laptop in great condition
i love this product my roommate has one too and it 's great because you can put <unk> paper or whatever behind the case and change the look of your mac as much as you want
i bought this product to protect my new macbook pro it was easy to snap into place and looks great i like that you still get the original look of the mac but just glossy rather than matte it helps to keep the computer free of fingerprints from the kids and wipes off easily i would recommend this product
gives the illusion that your <unk> laptop actually is blue it does scratch a little easy which makes me a little unhappy however ; it is still a great case regardless happy with my purchase
this case is a really pretty blue it gets scratched up easily , but at least it 's not the actual laptop i feel it 's pretty secure on my computer and does n't effect how the lip closes
this item fit my macbook pro # inch lap-top like it was made by apple do n't hesitate to purchase if you want to protect your computer from nicks & scratches
and this shell is still holding on , even after all the abuse i put it through daily one of the better purchases i 've made through amazon and it means i get to <unk> it in stickers without damaging my actual computer
i bought this case because i am pretty tough on my laptops i feel on my stairs and my computer crashed # ft onto hard flooring i was sure it was a <unk> surprisingly , my computer seems to be working fine and only has a small dent on the corner where it first landed i am sure the speck case absorbed the shock of the fall i do n't think that they advertise this case as a shock absorber -lrb- probably for legal reasons -rrb- but it seemed to do the trick
durable , beautiful and easy to clean protects your laptop from dings or scratches i only wish i had purchased it sooner i bought it after i received a ding on the bottom of my laptop a must have ! !
i bought this for my son to protect his macbook that he saved his money for he 's still a kid and they drop things ... well we all do accidentally my only concern was that these items might make the unit hot especially if he were using it on the bed or something the case works great it fits well the vents in the case make sure that the laptop can breathe the way its supposed to great for <unk> which laptop is his protects the units from scraps and scratches , bumping against a wall or when a dog jumps onto his lap well worth the price company shipped in time for christmas
i purchased this case almost a year ago , and i love it just as much now as i did when i first received it yes , it does get scratched , but it 's protecting your mbp from getting scratched it was easy to snap onto my mbp , and i have taken it off several times to <unk> it i could n't decide on a color , so i just went with the clear case it is lightweight and unobtrusive ; no complaints here i highly recommend this case
looks pretty , works well , fits perfectly not sure sure what else i need to love the product we have it for several months , it is heavily used and looks as new
this case is so cute i love the color it is exactly as pictured also , it snaps on and off very easily with that being said , when it is snapped on , it is not loose and does n't feel like it will fall off you can see the tabs where it is connected to the computer and that makes it easy to take off , if needed a must have accessory for your macbook also , it is completely see-thru i ordered a decal for my macbook and you can still see it perfectly through the case
i was using this product for my mac book pro # `` from the past one month installation is pretty simple if we follow instructions on the box it has vents at the bottom part of the shell which will circulate heat out rubber grips will secure your laptop if anyone using laptop on table clear access to all ports which is awesome and great hard shell great product , worth every buck , fast shipping but pricey though i recommend this product
i love this speck case i had been looking everywhere for a lime colored , but durable case , and i got lucky love the color , love the feel , and i love the knobs on the bottom if you allow the computer to breath -lrb- not lying flat on a bed or couch -rrb- then you will not have an overheating issue i would recommend others get this case if you 're thinking about it
this is the fourth speck case our family has bought we have been loyal customers when our first mac book went in for service and the apple tech said he could not believe it was a four year old machine we recommend this product for its quality
