the product arrived quickly in perfect condition like the look and you can carry it either over your chest or carry it by the top handle and remove the long strap
at first i was not sure of getting this bag for my new # . # macbook pro because of the <unk> `` # `` . however , this bag is the perfect fit for my computer is front flap give the computer an extra protection ... and also stores things like cd 's or discs this same bag is found at target for about $ # more than offered at amazon other sites <unk> it as much as $ # more you have to protect your investment
i love this bag ! i often need to carry a lot of small items and this is just perfect it 's very comfortable to wear , and because of it 's size i can take it with me anywhere -lrb- not that i do : d -rrb- it keeps my netbook safe too ! definitely worth the money
this is a great bag for the apple macbook the construction is top notch with a wide shoulder pad and plenty of pouches and zippers for cables , business cards etc . one thing that could be made better is the hand grip -lrb- a bit sub-par -rrb-
i was using a regular sized laptop bag for my new macbook and it was <unk> around in there a lot it was way more bag than i needed this little laptop bag is perfect
this little bag has big space and is well designed it is a perfect fit for an mac air or macbook it also has a space for my kindle -lrb- tm -rrb- and all the other stuff i carry i would buy it all over again you ca n't go wrong
this is exactly what i was expecting shipped quickly , in great condition does well with laptop protection i wish it had a little more space for other stuff , but no complaints i wanted something smaller than my previous bag
this side bag is perfect for my # . # ' macbook pro though it 's not entirely water proof -lrb- it will leak a <unk> or two through the side gap between the cover and the body -rrb- , it will repel water quite well on top of that , the shoulder cushion that comes with the strap is great when comfort is an issue the additional <unk> that comes with the strap works with a mouse , but not with a phone additional inside compartments for office work and # external pockets -lrb- big enough to fit an ipad and several paperwork -rrb- make it quite a good investment
the shoulder strap has a soft cushion , it continually comes apart until i just took super glue and fixed it the company has sent me # straps and it just comes apart the same way as for the bag , what more can i say than it has saved my macbook and now macbook pro # `` from sudden death by airport <unk> you know how you carry your life in your hands , have to go through security my bag fell with the macbook inside and nothing happened ... it fell to the concrete floor i love the bag , i hate the strap pad , it makes me angry that i email the company and nobody has addressed the issue in # + years the easiest production fix would be to reinforce the pad on the strap and then i would rate it a perfect score
i purchased this bag in may of # and only used it # times recently the seams started to come apart near the main compartment zipper area the items i carry in the bag are a canon # d , # l , # lens and a small palm video recorder after contacting canon i was told there is only a # day warranty on the bag this bag is great as long as you do n't put anything in it
i 'll keep this short i bought this bag a couple of years ago and it has been sitting in my closet for # % of the time i graduated up from a tamrac day <unk> because i finally have too much equipment to fit that bag -lrb- which i loved -rrb- after very little use on this canon bag , the part where the zipper handle attached to the zipper bent off and broke ok i lived with it for awhile , and i probably could have made a make shift zipper , but the point was i barely used the bag , why such crappy materials and then after not so much use , the bag flap ripped at the zipper seam all the way across ! ! needless to say i gave up using this bag and am too lazy to go through it and throw it away i would not recommend because it was cheaply built and for a little extra $ you can get a solid backpack
this bag is dangerous it zips from both sides when new , i had the two zippers meeting at the top they opened <unk> and dumped out my new canon digital rebel and a lens luckily i was on a carpet and nothing broke i fixed that problem by using a safety pin to keep one zipper at its bottom location to force me to zip the other all the way over the top so far , so good then , when the bag was about # months old , the zipper gave out totally the bag is worthless
if you are going to buy a nice camera you need something besides this advertisement for a bag the zipper broke in # weeks and the bag simply does not protect the equipment true the price is cheap and so is the bag
i loved this backpack up until the stitching on shoulder strap began to tear i 've used it moderately for just # months i certainly was n't doing anything rough or excessive with it i tried to call canon about a replacement but it is not under warranty , so i 'm stuck update : after # months , a stitch along the main zipper started tearing i swear i do n't put it through much abuse i 'm just an amateur photographer who takes pictures of my family and on vacations i 'm not <unk> or base jumping i 'm going to replace it with a more sturdy product
i bought this backpack thinking it & # # ; d be a good option for safely and comfortably storing my camera and lenses while hiking i was wrong the good things about this bag are the multiple and adjustable compartments and the cushioning for the camera and lenses however , the back straps are poorly designed and are extremely uncomfortable the weight of the backpack rests on your neck muscles , causing pain even when the backpack is empty in addition , it is only water resistant -lrb- not water proof as described above -rrb- i love canon products but with this , they got it wrong
i bought the backpack hoping it would be useful the plastic zipper kept unraveling , and that was the end of my using it it is in the garage somewhere i regret purchasing it
i purchased this backpack approx . # months ago i have used it about # times a week the form and <unk> of the item is fine the quality of the construction is poor the seams are beginning to pop at multiple points if you are looking for a backpack for even moderate use i would look to a different brand i am suprised that canon put its good brand on this item i have owned many canon items through the last # years and have always been satisfied i am having doubts about the brands quality
i received my bag on saturday -lrb- # days ago -rrb- just put my gear in it to go shooting tomorrow and it started <unk> at the stiches has a big # inch tear in the front , where the green fabric connects to the black fabric yes , it is very roomy for all your equipment but it is cheap made the funny thing is i can not return it because i removed the cannon metal logo and i put a butterfly patch in there so i am stuck with a piece of crap that i did not used not even once i am so mad i could scream again , buyers beware , this bag will <unk> if you want to waste # dollars , go for it , but you were warned
i was traveling in <unk> for a photo shoot the zipper was only # % shut due to the nature of the zipper and how it zips all the way around ... all my equipment fell to the ground i wish there was a lock on the zipper i 've also had to restitch the inside of the outer pocket
the straps are uncomfortable the zipper is cheap interior is poorly designed and there is no way to secure most of the contents i bought a `` cheaper `` backpack and that 's what i got
i bought this pack because it was inexpensive and quickly found out that the `` you get what you pay for `` rule definitely applies to camera packs with over $ # worth of gear to put in it , i promptly returned this pack when i saw the horrible quality zipper on the main compartment first off , this is a very small pack ... for a larger person like me , the pack just did n't fit right -lrb- i almost ran out of room on the pull straps when wearing the pack -rrb- the zipper on the main compartment was defective and kept coming open -lrb- from both the zipper pulls as well as from the opposite end a # d or larger body would have a difficult time fitting into this pack remember : `` you get what you pay for ``
i received this bag as a gift less than a year ago it has not been exposed to extreme temperatures , excessively packed nor has it been overly used ... almost hardly used both zippers have now been broken in half on the main storage compartment as a result of me opening the bag for a canon product , even if not expensive , i would have expected better
i was walking fast pace to the airport terminal the zippers were coming loose slowly from the weight of this camera and eventually the backpack was wide open this backpack should have some type of buckle snaps on each two sides i 'm very unhappy right now , dropping my canon # d that i just bought it has some cracks but still working good
i bought this bag last july the first week one seam came apart , the next week a zipper broke two weeks later another seam came apart a month later another seam came apart the week after that another zipper broke i have all of my new equipment in the bag and it is just about full i would not recommend anyone buy this bag unless you want your expensive equipment to fall out however the padding inside is nice
i loved the price the fact that it was an original canon product appealed to me as well so , when one of the waist straps broke after a year of use , i bought another one but , that did n't last more than just a little over a year exactly the same problem switched over to a lowepro , which i have now had for over two years , and i can see the difference
the elastic strings on the outside of the bag are more annoying than useful these snag on everything as you are walking around , particularly in nature settings my straps were worn out and pinched my shoulders after about a year of steady use the zippers are cheap and poorly sewn into the fabric i liked the compartment design overall , but the bag is not worth the canon brand name there are better , less expensive bags out there -lrb- i love my lowepro and my vanguard bags -rrb-
any type of camera bag is very <unk> . . some will love it , others will not in this case , i am in the do not like it category i spend most of my time <unk> in the florida <unk> environment first , the positive about this bag well constructed , definitely keeps equipment safe when the bag is securely closed what i did not like was the giant zipper opening that just falls open , that does not feel secure . to remove equipment you must lay the backpack down and remove the top `` flap `` . otherwise , you run the risk of have a complete yard sale of everything in the bag the other negative for me was all the <unk> hanging off the bag , just not to my liking
i completely like the design of this bag , but i took it brand new on a # week trip to india i carried it with me everyday and by the end of the # weeks , it had # rather large rips at the seams where the main compartment zipper is one of the rips occurred during only the # nd week of use i 'd recommend a more durably constructed bag
i like the basic function of the bag , but i am <unk> at the poor quality of the zippers all of the zippers on the bag have malfunctioned from the first day i live overseas and it arrived more than # days after it was shipped so returning it without <unk> is near to impossible , even for a bag that does n't work generally the inside is ok , but not if you want longer lenses i like the depth of it , so med size lenses can stand the stretch cord is way too long and so it catches on stuff like tree <unk> i would n't recommend it and would n't buy it again
this backpack is ok , but not great if you have a smaller body and relatively small shoulders , it will fit you perfectly however , if you have average <unk> shoulders you will find this backpack too small and uncomfortable i 've had a few friends try it on , and all the <unk> loved it all the <unk> -lrb- average size -rrb- said it was too small and did n't fit comfortably my advice is to find a store that carries it , and try it on first it holds things well , and i generally agree with other reviews - except for the fit factor
my bag suffered a tear at the top after minimal use also , make sure the zipper is close all the way , because it might just swing open at anytime causing your equipment to fall off
this bag was too small for my canon # d mark ii so i had to return it the padding seems very thin too , especially in the area on top where the camera is supposed to fit i would n't recommend it for anyone with professional gear
i thought this one had what it took but it coming apart like a worn down <unk> a the seams i just finished doing a little stitching on the <unk> but i do n't know how he 's going to hold up :
this bag is great for holding a camera , # lenses and a flash if you are going to use it to hold your equipment and walk for a mile or two save your money the shoulder straps are not comfortable at all at the backpack is bottom heavy so it does not want to sit on your back correctly for walking
i 've had this bag for a month and have noticed the zipper is separating at times i 've taken to having the zippers both on one end to be sure the zipper does not open up while on my back , dumping my sigma # f # . # lens on the ground if i could return it today i would as a future zipper <unk> <unk> me
the bag is spacious and can be used to tote an ample amount of equipment the straps , however , are thin and uncomfortable also , opening it up to get a specific item is <unk> and unless you remove the bad and lay it flat you risk spilling equipment after using this bag for a short time i retired it in <unk> of a
bag is pretty good for a typical amateur photographer holds about # lenses on top of a mounted one has lots of pockets and compartments biggest -lrb- and only -rrb- complaint is that it is extremely uncomfortable to wear around the design of it is too boxy and the way they designed the straps makes it sit very awkwardly on your back i hope they redesign the straps , otherwise that 's the biggest downfall
the other day , i was closing the main compartment and the metal zipper tab broke while i was pulling on it . # seconds later , the other tab broke just as a test , i wanted to see if i could break the remaining metal piece that was still attached and it broke like a <unk> very cheap material the tripod staps on the bottom are really hard to open and close this bag was not well thought out
have had this for a little more than a year now at first i loved it -- it holds a lot of gear a year later , i would not buy the bag if i had it to do over again the zippers are very , very loose -- the <unk> of any bag i have ever seen if they are not <unk> together , or the straps <unk> through each other , the zippers come open on their own if you have the bag more than about # full , the weight of the gear pulls the zippers completely open -- end to end they unzip unbelievably easily , so you 're guaranteed to bounce all your camera gear off the ground if you do n't secure the zippers i 've not damaged any equipment with it -- hopefully never will , but i 've come close a couple times no excuse why a camera gear bag from canon should have this issue -- they know exactly what kind of equipment is at risk by using such poor quality zippers
the bag is easy to use : it opens out flat which makes for easy accessing of equipment the big drawback is the main compartment where the lenses are kept has a double <unk> and right sides while i was carrying a full pack one of the side zippers worked it 's way down and one of my lenses fell out and crashed to the cement now i safety pin the # zippers together at the top , and still with the weight of the bag the zip works it 's way open as much as the safety <unk> allows it
this backpack was exactly as advertised however , it is set up inside so you place your camera in the very top of the bag , which makes it <unk> i suspect this is great if you are a professional photographer with tons of heavy lenses to balance out the bottom of the bag i , however , am just a <unk> mom who likes to have good pix of my kids long story short , i bought my new camera on a wednesday , put it in the canon bag , and set out this worked until sunday , when i started to reach into the bag , and the weight of the camera at the top of the bag caused it to unzip itself , spilling my camera onto an asphalt parking lot so , i had my brand-new camera for four days before having to ship it off to canon for a $ # repair i really feel like this happened because of the design of the canon bag again , if you have tons of lenses and <unk> that keep the bottom of the bag heavier , this is probably not a problem but it certainly did not work well for me
i have had this bag for a year or so and am not extremely happy with it it is truly only for light use the smaller cameras -lrb- # d , # xti -rrb- would work with maybe two <unk> and a flash also i really do n't use it that much and one of the straps for securing the bag around my waste has almost come out i am going to have it repaired and will probably try to sell the bag canon really should n't put their name on it time to move on to a <unk> pro
bought this to use with d # and # lenses , has enough space for the items the only downfall is that it is not high enough to fit my camera with battery grip attached built is good , space and pockets are good check height for your particular camera before purchase
i just bought a canon slr and needed a little day pack to carry the camera and all the essentials i do like all the compartments , it makes it easier to be organized the first time i used it for a trip the zipper handle broke i was at the airport and was in a rush to get my wallet into the pack i must have pulled it the wrong way and the handle that pulls the zipper broke
i thought it would be a little bigger , but it was able to get the # l and the # <unk> as well as a few other lenses in there at the same time the straps around the sides are pretty useless you are not easily going to get a tripod in and out of that i removed them and put some straps with buckles in its place all in all it 's a good enough bag especially if you consider the price points of the other brands that run you in the upper $ # s , it is a great value
why three stars i like the backpack it has many compartments , and it fits many items along with my canon # d , however the zipper at the top of the bag ripped off i 'm in the process of getting it fixed since i like this bag and the price was pretty good you get what you pay for right
this is a nice camera bag and it 's certainly priced right it holds everything that i need to take with me when i want to take everything however , when i put my dslr and battery grip in the bag at the top , i do not have the feeling that my investment is being adequately protected i has a velcro strap to place across the lens opening but that still did n't make me feel good if you 're putting a small dslr w/o grip , it may do the job adequately . but , not for me
it 's a decent backpack for people who do n't have a lot of stuff definitely not for people who tend to pack things they do n't need a tamrac or lowepro backpack would be better for enthusiasts of course , they come at a higher price for good reason
when i looked into buying this backpack , it was pictured with two cameras , lenses and other camera accessories i have two cameras , a wide angle , telephoto and zoom lens plus other accessories and am not able to fit all of the equipment into the bag the way i thought i would i now have two camera bags to accomodate my equipment - disappointed
the pockets and internal configuration combinations are great for a camera bag unfortunately , the stitching on the main straps has started to come undone -- this started after only one week of light use
great looking camera backpack but i find it rather difficult to use i have always used a more traditional camera bag that flips open and is ready to use you could <unk> toss things in and organize as needed the first few times that i used the backpack , everything spilled onto the floor since i was <unk> to everything being stored vertically i like the separators and the many pockets , but it will take a while to make the adjustment
lots of room for both my <unk> 's and # lenses , spare batteries , battery chargers , etc . etc . nice slip clips for attaching a monopod or knee pad on either side of the bag my only complaint -lrb- which is a global complaint of just about any product made in asia -rrb- is that the zippers seem sort of cheap i expect the bag to outlast the zippers as in many products such as backpacks and <unk>
i really like the design and features , bought this for a vacation one of the zipper tabs broke on day one , the logo came off on day three , and the stitching around the main compartment zipper started coming undone at the end of the week i 'm going to reach out to canon customer service for a replacement , very disappointed considering i have one of their shoulder bags from the # 's still in great condition
<unk> is still out as i have n't had the opportunity to really use it yet , but upon first use it was a bit awkward i think i 'm just not used to the set up yet it is nice to have enough room to carry along all of my lenses and flash vs. my old bag that i was cramming everything into
it keeps my camera safe and i am usually with my little girl so i could not go with a shoulder bag it is a little thick and depending on your gear heavy it serves its purpose and can be frustrating getting in and out of it especially in and out , off and on
i have used this bag on and off for a about a year now and it had been a good bag overall until about a few of months ago when the zipper tabs started falling off by now the bag is very difficult to use because most all of the tabs have fallen off and it is very hard to zip the compartments open and shut for the price it is a ok bag , but if you are going to use it a lot and want a long lasting bag i would suggest a more expensive lowepro or <unk> bag as with everything , you get what you pay for
i own this bag and have used it for several months this bad does exactly as advertised i have to be careful to make sure the zippers are fully secured or the bag may open unintentionally after several months , i do n't feel this bag is for me this bag is dedicated only to a camera and lenses i do a lot of outdoor photography which leaves me needing space for other things -lrb- food , water , <unk> , <unk> repellant ... i will soon purchase a more expensive bag which offers camera and lens storage as well as a large compartment i believe this bag would be great for certain uses but maybe not so great for me
i bought this so that i could carry my camera and lenses around safely around europe but the bag itself is really heavy and this proved to be very uncomfortable over the course of a day of walking in paris and surrounding <unk>
it would be a pretty good product except for the zipper for the main compartment the handle part of the zipper broke after minimal usage it is still fuctional as there are two of the handle parts , but it makes it much less desirable and limits its ease to access the main compartment
i like the bag but the quality is questionable , which is disappointing for the price and brand the zipper pulls are already coming apart - and i have not abused them by <unk> on them
overall it is good the main thing that i am concerned is that the zipper is not locked so it may open itself if you take both of the handlers of the zipper on the top of the bag my advice is to use only one zipper handle and take it all the way down to the bottom of the bag
i have a lowepro - mini trekker i am pretty satisfied with it when i bought my canon # mm f # . # is i outgrew with my lowepro - mini trekker logically , i looked for bigger size of bag from lowepro however , based on the amazon reviews , this canon # eg bag has more reviews and better rating the price is much more attractive too however , when the bag has arrived , the padding of the bag was much thinner than i was expected so i returned this bag and ordered a lowepro <unk> aw instead
i carry a canon # d ii , # <unk> , # mm # . # lens , # mm # . # lens it carries them all safely however , the backpack is too small for me it does n't sit comfortably , the lower straps bite into my <unk> and hurt like hell after a while the side pockets close with velcro and leave a gap so when i put some aa batteries in their , they fell out of the pocket i guess you can put a cell phone in there but nothing small or it will fall out the front pocket is large but has no compartments , so maybe is useful for papers the other top pocket has some compartments for memory cards , i can fit # cf cards in them the inside area is very roomy and easily fits my camera with # mm lens attached i am looking at ways to cover the straps with some foam or padding ... which it was just bigger ... its smaller than my school
canon # eg deluxe back pack + deluxe <unk> # `` tripod very fine bag but to small for my use , i will only use on limited small shoots i will buy much larger version canon # d ii with # mm f # . # l too big to fit with battery grip installed
i got this to replace my old camera bag prior to a vacation trip this year the bag is ok , but nothing spectacular it 's smaller than it appears in the description a second camera is a stretch my nikon d # with an # fits fine in the main slot , but my -lrb- small -rrb- d # with kit # is just jammed in the top pocket is very small , the side pockets are adequate i did get all my gear in , but it 's not as well organized as i would like it it was n't bad enough to send back , but i would not buy it again
this is a great backpack that lets you carry a camera and several lenses and other accessories the downside of this bag is the size . the nose -lrb- top -rrb- is not as deep as the rest of the bag also the sides are a bit soft and may only offer minimum
pro 's : large <unk> design with lots of good sized <unk> for taking a short <unk> <unk> 's : the zippers are very poorly <unk> about feels low quality although nothing has broken yet does n't live up to the canon
i 've had this bag in less than one year now you can fit most of your lenses , filters , camera body , and even attach a tripod using the straps provided inside the bag has thick compartments that can be adjusted using the built in velcro straps to protect your lenses the only thing that i do not like is the quality the fabric easily ripped on mine if you place a lot of your heavy telephoto lenses , plus all of your other gears , be carefull when picking it up use the straps as much as possible but if you use this as a camera and storage for your equipment , then it will do the job hope this helps
bag has plenty of space but only water resistant needless to say even though it was water resistant , i got caught in a freak sleet storm in amsterdam and it did not hold up everything got wet or damp the outside pockets items were soak -lrb- which sucks for me since i now have sticky hard candy <unk> in there and my guide book is ruined -rrb- inside was only damp oh and i was using a umbrella so it was n't completely exposed but it was driving sleet at a angle there is only so much you can do so <unk> of the story not waterproof debate the water resistant part
i really liked this packpack for the price , the size , the fit , and the ability to store additional personal items i used it for my canon # d and several lenses and until <unk> thought it was a great way to carry around my camera , several lenses , and flash as my <unk> grew , the bag <unk> too small , but the real problem is that after only a few years of using it , the seams are starting to separate to me that is a real quality problem i think if you use it only for your dslr , an <unk> lens or tow , and a flash , it should be okay but keep an eye on the seams
i have no problems with service or delivery whatsoever the backpack is a nice starter peice but not recommended for enthusiasts the backpack is small , and the shoulder straps are wanting the interior is nice and there are sufficient pockets and sufficient space for starter gear not too bad
i bought this bag # years ago and within the first year one of the zippers broke at the eyelet the other zipper eyelets eventually broke and one of them completely broke off if they can only fix this problem , it will be a great bag
i got this bag for christmas a year ago , and it has been great it holds a ton of equipment , it 's smaller than most bags , and it 's really well designed my issue with the bag , and why it ended up receiving only # stars , is that i took it out in rain and it got completely soaked through every piece of my equipment got wet none of it was ruined thankfully , and due to a long drying process , but i would suggest you consider whether or not you 'll be out in the elements with this bag had it not soaked through , i would have easily given it # stars
great bag that has detachable compartments to put your gear in i love the zips and front pocket has great storage for smaller items like memory cards , batteries and more the one down side , the zipper broke quickly =
i love the backpack , but had one scary incident if you zip it up with the zippers at the top of the pack , they will work their way lose of you run i had my pack open up and spilled all my thousands of dollars of contents into the <unk> in busy washington <unk> and my gear was nearly run over zip everything to the side , and you wo n't have any problems
i saw this bag at another big box retailer and it was $ # i used my amazon app on my smartphone and scanned the bar code and voila ... it was over # % less on amazon as for the bag itself , it does n't really compare to the `` professional `` quality camera bags , but i did n't want to spend hundreds of dollars on a backpack all in all , it works for me houses all my equipment and lenses , plus room for snacks , ipad , etc . when i am traveling good value for a starter bag or for someone who needs one for quick weekend trips and does n't want to spend a lot of $ $ $ also is water repellant
this bag is okay - i used it for shooting weddings for a few months before purchasing a new bag it 's a little smaller than i 'd like - i really need something with more space for more lenses this being said - if i were on vacation and taking one camera and two lenses instead of two cameras with several - then this is an excellent bag
this is a very nice bag at a reasonable price it has lots of room for equipment my only complaint and reason i returned it in favor of the <unk> flipside # is the bag lacked structural support the nylon and padding are nice but the top -lrb- where your camera sits -rrb- <unk> very easily the flipside # had a structurally sound -lrb- sturdy -rrb- feeling compartment that felt like it would protect your equipment a lot better however , that pack is more expensive , though it can be had for about $ # -lrb- not much more -rrb-
for the photographer out on a weekend shoot , this backpack has room for everything for a photography enthusiast , with only # slr and # lenses , this pack was too bulky and heavy
not as big as expected an xti and a couple of lenses , depending on size looked good out of the box , but zip puller -lrb- <unk> attachment -rrb- fell off on the first try zip is stiff and binds on interior at times padding did not seem sufficient and surprisingly limited options for arrangement of camera and accessories returned to amazon
i got it for $ # , so i ca n't complain much i use it more often now than my <unk> . does n't seem to secure or well padded for equipment . not too comfortable to carry canon tag is a good conversation starter , but some say this can be advertising <unk> . no laptop storage , no storage for anything else for that matter ca n't hold reasonable size tripod it 's actually a lot smaller than it looks in pictures , or maybe i have high expectations the compartments are very configurable , which is good
this bag holds everything i need , including a reflector , my wallet , a bottle of water , ... everything i 've had it now for maybe three years , and the inside fabric has torn away at the seams it 's still useable , so i 'm keeping it as is i 've definitely gotten my money 's worth , and would probably buy it again , but was disappointed in the shoddy craftsmanship i 've always worried the zippers would come unzipped from the main compartment , and i solve that problem by <unk> the zipper pulls together every time i close the bag a little <unk> , so it would have been nice for canon to put in a solution for that still , despite the flaws , it has served me very well
this bag is great if you 're simply taking your camera from one place to another and want to protect it do n't expect much comfort when wearing it on your back for more than half an hour the bag is constructed with a plastic support piece at the base this piece digs into your back after some time also , the straps are designed poorly so the bag weighs heavily on your shoulders if you plan on wearing your bag for longer than an hour , look elsewhere
i recieved this a a gift . . a very nice gift indeed it holds all my photography goods , and i worry no longer about bumps and such it 's been in rain and lots of snow , and has never let me down it has a nicely customizable interior that can make room for even the <unk> of items i hav a canon # mm , # mm <unk> , # <unk> , a # mm , and several other little odds and ends including several filters , tripod adapters , ect . it holds them all , and just screams , `` lets go on an adventure `` . . in fact i hear it calling right now
is a great bag for cameras and lens ' however , it could have been made better by adding a space for a laptop as someone who shoots weddings often , i sometimes carry my laptop as well -- especially if i am out of town for a shoot just something to consider however , i like the size and the fact that it 's not super bulky unlike other camera bags i have owned
while i still use this bag on occasion , i have to be honest when i say that i am disappointed in it when i first got it i thought it was great ! that was until the stitching that is holding the zipper in place started to come apart after only a dozen or so uses i did n't have it `` overloaded `` either -lrb- canon # d <unk> grip , # f/ # . # and a # f/ # . # -rrb- so yea there 's some weight but not enough to have it fall apart
bought this and later sold it because it is not very well made fits plenty of gear , and the price is right ... but a few zipper fobs came off ... not that big a deal good for a cheapie bag
this bag is certainly big enough for the rebel and extra lenses i can also fit my <unk> in it to be fully packed for a digital day i do n't love it because it 's too big
the backpack looks great but it could be made better right away one of the zippers broke and the fabric has torn it is n't as if we are constantly toting this around either for how little we take it along , nothing should have broken
overall , i think this is a good bag with tons of storage and compartments i did realize one big problem after taking it for a day because it is a backpack , it 's not so convenient in order to take out your camera safely , you have to sit down , lay the bag flat and then open the zippers it is not as convenient as a shoulder / sling bag where you can take out the camera easy and quickly the zippers on my bag are very loose , so if i attempt to open the bag while upright , everything will fall out i use it mainly as a storage bag now for a bag i carry with me , i bought a lowepro slingbag -lrb- # aw -rrb- and it works great for <unk> , i think of this bag as a minivan ... whereas my lowepro slingbag as a <unk>
i like the layout of the backpack but the only problem i have with it is the direction that the the cover for the zipper was put on . it should be the opposite of what it is when you have the backpack on everything can get under the tab including rain instead of running or falling off i bought it to keep dirt and moisture off of my camera and lenses i 'm not talking severe weather just moderate weather so i probably would buy something different if you are real concerned about <unk>
the backpack is attractive , with ample pockets , straps , and netting to handle a variety of light gear on photo expeditions but , the backpack structure is softer , <unk> flimsier , than desired with heavy l lenses and slr bodies , the pack is clumsy when opened , especially on uneven surfaces like a <unk> rock i bought this for hiking to photo locations , but returned it , wanting something that can offer more protection for light gear , it is nice , but it is n't designed for larger , <unk> equipment
i bought the cannon photo backpack and used it for a couple of weeks it is okay , works as advertised what i do n't like about the bag is that i have to take it completely off and lay it down on a flat surface in order to be able to safe extract my camera i recently purchased the lowepro slingshot # and found their design completely addressed this issue i think the lowepro quality is considerably better too look at the slingshot before you make up your mind to buy the cannon photo backpack
this bag is okay if you 're just planning on carrying the camera and nothing else since i want to use it as a carry-on , i need more room than it provides
i purchased this backpack thinking that it would be well-designed with a photographer 's needs in mind i 've found it difficult to use for walking around and shooting , because the pack is not made to be accessible what i 'm mainly disappointed about is that when you want to open it , you basically have to set it down and use both hands to open it up and get out your camera if you try to sling it around to your front and zip it open with one hand , the zippers are so easy to open that the whole bag falls open and your gear <unk> out you ca n't open it <unk> or standing up this is a serious problem if you want to be on your feet moving around and have quick access to your camera other than this issue , it 's a decent bag with plenty of space , but the accessibility is such a big problem that i almost returned it i expected more of canon
this is a great camera bag for the price , has all of the adjustable straps you could ask for and feels relatively sturdy however , i was surprised at the odd layout choice they made for the camera body + attached lens -- right at the top of the bag , and honestly this is the area with the least amount of padding i can see how this would provide <unk> access to the camera , but i think i want more shock padding around the camera than some of my other gear
the best feature of this product is the velcro on the inside that allow you to <unk> the storage compartments to your own personal needs i actually ordered this product for a nikon camera and everything fit fine my biggest problem with this product is that there is no convenient way to carry a tripod i tried using the side straps , but since there is only one strap on each side there is room for it to move around which is annoying when you 're trying to hike i tried several other ways to secure the <unk> but nothing seemed to work i usually just have someone else carry it or strap it on separately
not a bad bag some of the construction feels cheap only after a couple years all the zippers broke and i can not open or close the zippers the amazon bag is rated higher and probably worth purchasing over this one
the backpack is more than adequate for a camera however , it is not meant to carry a laptop -lrb- even tho there is a picture showing it -rrb- the laptop area shown in the picture is actually a thinly lined pocket meant for incidentals i need one for both so i 'm returning mine
i was so excited to get this and then as others have commented , was not thrilled with how easily things could fall out i thought the backpack would be just what i need i travel a lot , and was disappointed that this was not an easy bag to switch lenses i had to find a flat area and open it carefully for fear of a lens falling out i am going back to my old bag which when carried across my body made lens changes much easier
