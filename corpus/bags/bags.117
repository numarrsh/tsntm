this item was a perfect fit for my rebel xt well padded , lots of compartments to accommodate my accessories in one location awesome product to protect my priced possession highly recommended for digital slr owners
i started out with the canon gadget bag that i paid about $ # for this bag is easier to carry , can fit more stuff , and is a little more than half the price i only wish i had seen this before i <unk> out the cash for the other bag my only complaint is the emblem on the back that says `` attention all thieves : this bag is full of expensive camera equipment ! but with a screw driver and about five minutes , it can be removed easily enough it does leave a couple of holes behind , but that 's better than the neon thief alert sign
this a great backpack i have the canon xti digital slr with # different lenses , a compact digital camera , and a video camera , plus other things like manuals , travel tripods , etc and everything fits great i got it for a great price right here on amazon and i am very pleased with it if you 're looking for a backpack to hold your slr and protect it well , this is the way to go
i did n't know much about camera back packs - <unk> searched amazon and found this one it was <unk> less expensive that i thought i would have to spend so i ordered i happen to own a canon camera - but the brand really was n't important to <unk> am not sure what the more expensive one offer - this one has all i need and more lots of <unk> , adjustable compartments , the camera sits on top for quick access and there are lots of other compartments made of high quality material - not water proof , but it would hold up long enough to take other measures in a downpour i have looked at others and they ca n't touch this for the
this camera <unk> pack is great we are able to put all equipment in the bag with room to spare the canon eos d # , # lenses including a telephoto , extra memory cards , filters , lens hoods , external storage system , extra batteries , everything we own fits in , nice and snug we highly recommend this back <unk> bag for anyone who has a lot of equipment and wants to keep in all <unk>
i 've just got this back pack in the mail and was absolutely surprised with quality and functionality that it provides very light , stylish , it can fit my camera , # lenses and there is plenty of place left for different accessories it has a big front pocket , straps for the tripod -lrb- at the bottom -rrb- and it 's weather proof too also , it looks a lot better than the picture a lot better than the packs i saw in retail stores for $ # and up
the only issue i possibly have is that i do n't have a specific laptop/tablet pocket ; so , i have to <unk> my chromebook in alongside my camera it 's not a product issue , though more so a personal problem . :
great pack , everything fits and made it half way around the world in less then a week from order to my box . cant wait to take it to london this weekend
i have two lenses , and slr , and a flash there is still plenty of room for expanding my collection lightweight , and a carrying pocket for a tripod everything a photographer would need
this bag holds all of my camera equipments - an slr body with # lenses , flash and misc . accessories comfortable to wear used it while travelling nicely priced and not too big , nor too small
this is a lightweight , well padded backpack that is truly amazing how much you can fit inside -- all of my lenses , flash , camera , extra supplies , rocket <unk> , etc . . . amazing i used a lowepro # slingbag until this one - but this fits almost twice as much , at about the same weight you wo n't be disappointed one warning : the canon logo on the bag advertises you have a camera and expensive equipment inside -- do not use in dangerous areas where there are pickpockets or other <unk> characters you might want to put a button or sticker over the canon logo if using the bag for travel do n't leave it lying around in an airport , a train station , or a library
i bought this bag to hold my canon eos body and # lenses it is great not to have to carry around my camera case and separate lens cases it also has handy pockets to store accessories -lrb- computer cable , remote control , etc . . a great bag , i 'm very happy with this purchase
i use this bag exclusively for my photo shoots my primary lens is a sigma # mm which i use on my <unk> and it fits perfectly in the center of the bag with the body attached other bags are just small enough so that i have to carry the body with another lens attached , causing me to have to change to the <unk> in a very short period of time the bag is also large enough to hold my two other lenses , # ex flash , several filters , batteries , <unk> release forms , cleaning equipment plus anything else that is <unk> it 's also nice to carry the weight on both shoulders instead of just one if anything the bag is almost too big ... it was a rather tight fit inside the <unk> of a boeing <unk> # g
as long as you are not doing a big shoot , this is the most convenient method of transporting your camera it has enough space for quite few lenses and your flash i love it for trips best camera case i ever owned
there are tons of camera backpacks out there ... they are all overpriced and never seem to work just right for me to carry both of my cameras this pack carries my sony and my nikon plus all the extra lens i could n't be more pleased with it also it is comfortable to carry and protects my back
i actually purchased this backpack before my canon eos camera , lenses , and flashes arrived the pack is well designed and holds enough equipment to have on hand for an outing without becoming too heavy , or bulky to carry around i have a three day trip coming up tomorrow and will have a better idea on it 's function when i return
with help from some of the other reviews , this has turned out to be a great purchase . holds two bodies a couple of lenses and more makes carrying all my equipment easy again
i purchased this camera bag over a year ago and could n't be more pleased with the product the shoulder straps are padded , comfortable and easy to adjust there are plenty of pockets for lenses as well as the camera body with a lens attached <unk> are padded and isolated well from each other the small zip down section in front has elastic <unk> for # memory cards and there are some additional pockets which i use for batteries and other small accessories that need to be accessed readily i own # lenses , many filters , extension tubes and other accessories and there has been no shortage of space with this bag a couple of my family members ordered this product as well after seeing mine i ca n't imagine anyone being disappointed with this camera bag
i love this camera bag after years of using a traditional bag , it is fun using a back pack i highly recommend it mostly because of the secure feeling i have while using it to carry my $ # digital camera it has plenty of <unk> and , at first , may seem to be a bit bulky , but there are <unk> ways to hold it and they are all comfortable
i have been using a canon camera bag for the last # years decided to try this when it went on sale wow ... what a difference it makes when lugging a lot of equipment around
wonderful at any price , exceptional value at $ # enough room for my camera , lenses , filters , instruction manuals ingenious use of velcro wide straps insure that all equipment is snugly held well made to last light weight for what it holds this backpack is well designed to spread the weight like a high end day hiking pack
got this for my wife as a gift and she loves it ! ! has been all over <unk> , nv , co , on our vacation and it works beautifully very comfortable to wear and very functional one of the better gifts she has received
i absolutely love this bag this bag is stylish , light and full of compartments it is made of sturdy materials and my digital eos , lenses and accessories work with this bag perfect i suggest this bag to any photographer on the go
great camera bag just used in in on a photo class trip to <unk> that included a lot of traveling around held everything i needed and more adjustable dividers are useful and was able to carry my small laptop in the seperate compartment cost less and seems like a lot more for the money than others i looked at it also seems less bulky and the water resistant features , like the zipper cover flaps seem good , though i did n't actually have to use it in the rain yet could do without the shiny metalic `` canon `` label on the back which seems to advertise that you are carrying expensive equipment i covered it by using fabric glue and a strip of webbing to go over it you do have to take the pack off to get inside it , but was n't a major issue to me all in all am very happy with it
i am extremly pleased with my purchase from amazon it arrived promptly and was well packaged i have my backpack ready to go on a trip and a cruise which is able to hold all my equipment plus i can even fit in my gps the shoulder straps are well padded and cause no problem with my shoulders even though i suffer severe shoulder pain this pack is well worth the money spent and i could n't have asked for anything better i also own a hand bag for my camera but this will always be my first choice . thanks again for the great service
my old camera bag had run its course and would no longer hold all my gear the canon # eg was exactly what i needed lots of room , and the compartments in the main section , and they are adjustable so you can modify and shape it to your needs several other zipped compartments , a spot to strap your tripod on , and you 're all set for that photo adventure it 's sturdy and built to last in addition , the various straps allow you to keep the bag snug against your back i would recommend this camera backpack to anyone needing that little something extra to hold all their camera gear
the velcro sections make it perfect for any use , you can configure it any way you 'd like i made room for a # mm lens , even brought the full size charger , just in case
i absolutely love this camera bag ! ! ! it is perfect for holding all my gadgets , lenses and has room for much more ! ! ! i encourage anyone who loves to take photographs to buy it
been using this bag for over a year and love it took me a while and lots of <unk> as to - how to compartmentalize my camera and lenses , etc . it is not something i wear around all the time , and i got into the habit of just taking my camera , a spare battery and an extra sd card when i went out to take photos the bag was always in my car or nearby on one of these excursions i was out on an <unk> about a mile from shelter when a sudden <unk> <unk> camera strap hanging from my neck , i <unk> through the <unk> wind and rain back to our cabin my t # i was fried i take the bag with me everywhere now
i was looking for a backpack to carry my nikon d # and my panasonic tm # camcorder well this does it all , and i have room for my batteries , chargers , nikon flash , filters , extra lenses , etc . a great value for the cost i was looking at a sling , but for the price , i prefer to carry my camera and camcorder together when going on family outings , instead of having two bags !
this is a <unk> backpack for the price they must mass produce these to be able to offer such a high quality pack for such little money i payed $ # . # for this pack expecting a so so backpack but was surprised at the quality and functionality good job canon
i am very impressed with this bag i carry my two canon cameras and five lens i love how small it is amazing ! ! and for the price , it 's a steal
i love this bag recently i obtained a telephoto lens for my nikon d # and outgrew the small bag i used to carry around i was looking for something that i could not only carry my d # with the new lens , but also the old lens , several guide books , my cleaning supplies , and more i was also in search for something that could just as easily be carried while hiking but not feel too heavy on my back or shoulders shortly after receiving this bag , i took it on a # mile hike and nearly forgot i was carrying my bag because it felt so light and comfortable i now have room for all my supplies with more than enough room to grow with comfort
i use this to transport and store my d # , <unk> , and k # it has enough room for all the lenses i have for my d # , mind you i 'm not pro and have a small collection
took this on a trip up the east coast <unk> , <unk> , ny city then back <unk> <unk> , <unk> national <unk> it held our digital slr , # lenses , camcorder , extra batteries , chargers , etc . it held up very well and i think we 're going to make it a permanent replacement to our separate camera bags great deal , too was $ # more in local stores
exactly as shown ... the packing was perfect ... just it would be better if the picture was with a human as the bag seems to be smaller than it appears
this is an awesome bag for the price it allows quite a bit of room for storage of lenses -lrb- ca n't wait to fill mine -rrb- i 'm very pleased with it and it seems to be made quite well
i bought this to store my newly purchased canon rebel t # i dslr and its accessories i have a telephoto and <unk> lens , a <unk> microphone with wind screen attachment , a lens hood , a <unk> , and # sd cards , and there is still plenty of room to spare i definitely recommend getting this backpack , whether you are an amateur or professional <unk> , and want an extremely convenient carrying case for your camera and accessories
this backpack is great , full of divisions inside you can fit your camera , lens and many equipments everything you need when you want to take your stuff around there 's space for tripod , fits well on your back , and looks good
i purchased this bag because my other camera bag was getting a little crowded with accessories while this bag is not as big as i had thought , i am very pleased with it 's functionality it has adjustable velcro dividers you can custom fit for pretty much any accessory you might have for your camera there is plenty of room to grow if you decide to buy other accessories for your camera as well you can remove all the dividers completely if you want to use the bag for something other than your camera and accessories again , it 's not the largest backpack in the world , but it will handle a light load nicely i really like this bag because it fits nicely on the back instead of having a strap across your shoulder it does n't make you look like a tourist like the traditional camera bags do good buy for a good price
for this price , the bag is outstanding it can comfortably hold a camera and # lenses , depending on their size i usually transport all my equipment in pelican cases , but in situations where i need to be quick , or have to travel on a plane i just put everything in this bag after # months of use , it is still fully functional and looks great
i have been very satisfied with this pack , having used it for a few minor <unk> expeditions and also on a more substantial florida trip with the grandkids on a <unk> trip to disney world , i used the pack as my sole airplane carry-on and daily as we <unk> the theme parks it was comfortable and large enough to carry my <unk> , water bottle , windbreaker , sunglasses , sun lotion , my assorted <unk> , and lunch <unk> of items from the two main compartments required unloading the pack , but the camera items were securely protected and conveniently accessed the dividers , adjustable and sturdy , adapted to whatever i was carrying , and prevented sandwiches from being crushed it seems very well made and rugged , yet light and manageable
i use this to carry my canon rebel t # and a couple point and shoot cameras , battery chargers , extra lenses , portable hard drive , hoods , flashdrives , the list goes on very durable bag , pockets everywhere i 've recently seen this at best buy for $ # . # , i bought it on amazon for $ # . # great bag , great bargin
the bag fits everything we own for our canon camera we went on a trip recently and were unable to take all of our lenses that made this bag an extreme need it fits everything and it is comfortable to wear we love it
this is a sturdy , well made camera equipment carryall it 's well thought out and especially well designed compared to other camera bags , this is very reasonably priced one of the best back-pack bags i 've seen
i use this for everything , both for bringing my cameras with me on hiking trips and for hiking bottles and food and whatnot its a very nice quality pack with nice zippers that do not snag at all brilliant for # bucks
this was perfect for what i needed , has plenty of room for my smaller cameras and all the <unk> items that go with them i was going to buy this in a store when i checked on it on amazon and found the same item for # the price and free shipping , wow
i use this bag to carry my camera , flash , gorilla pod , and accessories the multiple pockets make it easy to carry extra batteries and memory cards it 's comfortable enough to wear all day i have worn it for long walks on a hot beach and it protected my gear without being too hot this is a small bag , i can carry my ipad in the front pocket , but there is no room for a laptop
if you do n't want to spend $ # or more on the <unk> stuff , this backpack serves the amateur very well plenty of room & dividers for your gear , and two outside pockets for stowing your favorite lens -lrb- or water bottles -rrb-
this is one of the best deals i 've found for a camera bag . $ # does n't buy much however , this bag is well constructed and you can organize it in several different configurations it 's well padded and light weight
purchased this backpack to hold my xti camera , # is , # is , canon <unk> # camcorder , and all my little goodies and it is holding up very well lots of space with great build quality took it on vacation to <unk> and it was comfortable to backpack with on the streets and on our scooter
this bag may not be built for serious <unk> hiking -lrb- the straps are padded but not ergonomically designed -rrb- , but it certainly carries more equipment than any other bag in this price range i was having trouble locating a bag for under $ # that would accomodate my canon xt with my # mm lens attached this bag can do that and i still have so much room for other equipment left over although the straps are not as comfortable as the ones on my tamrac adventure # , it is definitely comfortable enough for outings where you are able to take it off every once in a while for breaks
this is the best thing i ever bought it is so handy to use a backpack and not a bag when i go on vacation i just put it on my back and go with both of my hand free
comfortable to carry , lots of storage available , sturdy easier on my back and shoulders over long periods of time frees up my hands to do more than just carry my camera bag i was amazed at how much storage space it has
yes this bag may not be the fanciest , the prettiest , or the overall best , but for the price , it was the best all around bag i have found the price on amazon also is great compared to local big box stores this bag helped me trek through <unk> and grand <unk> with my t # i , ef # l , and # l with extra batteries and charger easily
this is a must buy if you own a dslr i had a smaller bag and just did not cut it once i got this bag all my problems were solved and had enough room for all my gear and more
its the perfect size for what i wanted it has enough dividers to store a lot of equipment and also has outside pockets for other things i used velcro to secure the items into the dividers so they did n't fall out it is supposed to be water repellant but i have n't had it in the rain yet the back drawstring area is good for storing a rain jacket
a great bad to have it can save upto # bodies with # lenses you can also attach a small tripod to it but if it has side access door that would be awesome
this backpack really is quite nice it fits my rebel xti and rebel t # with an assortment of lenses and still has room to spare the straps on the bottom for holding the tripod are such a huge help -lrb- i uploaded some photos to amazon , so check those out to see tripod attached -rrb- it also has straps to go around your waist and across your chest to take some of the weight off of your back it 's extremely comfortable to wear for long periods of time you ca n't go wrong with this one
simply said this is a great bag i have had it for quite a while and it is still in great shape it is getting a little small for all my equipment though its got a great build and plenty of pockets and changeable compartments for the price a really good choice
plenty of room and pockets for all of your gear what i like best is that you can leave a longer lens on and still pack it away the inside is <unk> so you can make it how you like it depending on the gear you 've got
just as described can hold lots of equipment for <unk> photographers and provides lots of room to grow for <unk> like me -lrb- who do n't yet have near enough equipment to fill it up ! -rrb-
this bag has worked great for me it holds all kind of equipment i have camera body , lenses , flash , hoods , books , etc . i am glad i purchased the backpack over a shoulder bag like i used to have i feel its more secure from banging against something
i just received this backpack and am very impressed with the value it holds my camera body and # lens easily with room for more - filters , lens hood , cables , etc . my # . # inch macbook stores easily in here as well on top of the camera gear , a huge plus as i travel often for a serious hobbyist , this is a great value for home storage and travel for added security , you can modify the storage pockets easily to firmly secure lens from shifting
we 've had this camera bag backpack for over a year now it 's durable and practical - and easy to carry the weight it 's not really `` easy access `` like some i 've seen , but if you are a casual photographer that wants to carry a camera when hiking or <unk> , this would work well
this is a terrific camera backpack i recently used it with my new canon # d in europe it was great the quality is super and what a great value this is the one ! !
ladies & <unk> you must buy this camera backpack if you are reading this review and debating whether to jump in or not this is an awesome awesome camera backpack it looks very nice and professional and have a lot of space and pockets for your lens , batteries , camera , and whatever you can think of for your camera accessories for the price , this is a smart buy i love it very much
this is a great invention i love that i can put both camera , and camcorder and lenses i need for my `` <unk> `` . quality made it 's also a good idea having two straps to carry all your camera equipment on your back
when i first saw the price of this bag i was very skeptical i had looked at other backpacks for three times as much and i did n't like any of them as most had very little space for equipment this one hold a lot ! it is well made and easily <unk> for all your equipment needs i told all my canon buddies they needed to get one i just love mine and never go shooting without it canon deluxe photo backpack # eg for canon eos slr cameras -lrb- black with green accent
i love this camera case it is so light and well designed for the <unk> photographer that i am i have lots of <unk> and this helps so much to be able to carry everything with me
i love this bag . has room for all my lens and other accessories . very well padded . keeps everything protected . the backpack is much better than carrying shoulder bag . not bulky . just the right size
this is a nice addition to my <unk> of ever growing camera gears this will be used for my new canon xsi and accessories and does accommodate all of them even the lens hoods yes i wished it did have velco to prevent items from falling if you opened it accidentally the wrong way you can buy the velco strips to secure the open tops again amazon had the best deal in my area -lrb- <unk> -rrb- the price is almost double
i outgrew my old canon camera bag when i bought more accessories for my camera i settled on the backpack type of camera bag because i was going to travel and even walking in national parks ; i figured a backpack was more comfortable to carry a lot of camera equipment this backpack is everything i wanted in fact i want more `` stuff `` because i still have enough room to add several more accessories yes , the bag is now heavy , but i 'm sure glad it 's not carried on one shoulder , but on both and it 's very versatile , has lots of pockets and compartments i do n't know how i ever lived without it
i was originally looking at the canon camera bag as it was plenty of room for my needs i read a review from another photographer about the <unk> of carrying the back pack version , this helped me decide on this model i 'm sure glad i did it has plenty of room for my gear and i feel the design of this bag is well thought out i am happy with the design of the flap over the zipper keeping unwanted debris out when out hiking for those nature pictures i am comfortable and my hands are free
this backpack has plenty of pockets and compartments , but it 's just perfect for carrying my camera equipment i carry # bodies , # lens , # lens , spare battery , chargers and more does exactly what i wanted it for , and it does it well
i 've had this bag for two years and i love it i carry a canon # d , a telephoto , portrait and wide angle lenses along with the usual accessories without any problems <unk> i added a travel tripod that fits very nicely with the bottom straps i 've looked at a number of the more expensive bags , of similar size and simply have n't found them to be significantly better than the canon bag if you are looking for and inexpensive , good quality camera bag , this is the one to buy
this bag holds a camera , # or # lenses , a # <unk> , batteries , filters , everything you can remove all the dividers and configure them as you like i removed the main camera holding dividers and flipped them so that the camera is at the bottom of the bag when you are wearing it it comes with the divider positioned to hold the camera at the top , which makes the bag top heavy ; i prefer the mass of the camera be down low as has been said , position both zippers at the bottom left or right , they will not <unk> from there all the other reviews cover it , my point is to reposition the dividers to put the camera at the bottom also , the waist strap does not really put the weight on your hips , all the load is on your shoulders there may be a way to get a hip strap from rei or <unk> or somewhere to mod this and get the load on your hips , like a good backpack does
this camera bag is well worth the money compare to similar bag that costs a lot more the quality is good and it holds all my camera gears i like the padding in the back it makes it easy on your back when you are hiking with this bag full of camera gears there are plenty of pockets inside i 'm very happy i bought this one
great camera bag lots of room for all my lens , flash , etc . sturdy , water resistant , and lots of padding inside to protect your valuable cameras enough room that i can leave my smaller lens on one canon , and longer lens on other canon , and have plenty of room still i like the two side velcro pockets also , so that you can throw your keys in or extra money so you do n't have to carry your purse also great bag overall , just what i wanted ! !
i do n't have a dslr i have an early model of the <unk> and a camcorder i bought this as it holds everything for both cameras when we travel for <unk> <unk> and vacations it holds more than i can put into it - regarding my camera stuff it does hold the larger tripod as well , but , the smaller one i have is perfect for it
this is a very nice camera bag , it holds my <unk> k # d attached to a sigma # lens , which is <unk> i use most the side spaces provide for my other lenses and even the battery recharger and spare battery just what i was looking for at a great price ... even though i do n't use a canon
i just recieved this backpack , it holds all my stuff easily , i could probably triple all my stuff and it would still hold it i can trust this bag to hold my stuff with protection , the lens holders are high quality my body also does n't slide around at all once i locked it in there well no regrets ! ... for now
i had my camera equipment scattered over three different bags big pain in the butt other reviews seemed like this would be what i needed for a reasonable price got it , packed everything i have for my canon eos -lrb- which is quite a bit -rrb- and it all fit with a little room to spare this was a fantastic choice i 've <unk> it around quite a bit without any product workmanship issues have yet to take it on a vacation but overall <unk> been very pleased
i have been very happy with this product you can really put so many lenses and cameras in this bag the padding is great and it is very comfortable to wear i like all the compartments and the ability to change the compartments <unk> etc . highly recommend this product
i carry two camera bodies -lrb- one is a smaller sony the other a larger canon -rrb- four lenses plus other peripherals comfortably and securely in this case i especially like the durable material and strong zippers
the canon deluxe photo backpack # eg for eos slr cameras is an exceptional product when considering the factors of cost , versatility , <unk> and convenience all this along with quality craftmanship makes for a great buy
this is a phenomenal investment , especially for the money the bag has plenty of room for lots of gear and is really well made i was suprised that there are so many <unk> and internal components it has helped us a lot to have one place where we place all of our photographic equipment
i 'm still a real amateur and only have a single dslr -lrb- nikon d # -rrb- and this backpack really gives me the room and ease of access i was looking for -lrb- even though it says ` canon `` on it ; # -rrb- ca n't beat it for the price
i bought this bag to go with my canon digital rebel xt this is a fantastic bag enough space to hold my extra lens , the external flash , my camcorder , etc . i love this bag as it fits all my gear and is comfortable while on your back
great bag that actually holds my slr camera , two lens , tri-pod , flash , camcorder , cables , <unk> , etc . everthing fits into this one bag and have friends that paid double or more for the same functionality in another <unk> brand bag wonderful bag that i just gambled would be all that it says it is and more
i have been needing something to carry a camera body and several <unk> for a long time and have tried many camera bags and cases this was my first backpack and since my gear was getting heavy this turned out to be just the ticket it 's very roomy and the partitions are easy to adjust to your equipment the camera rides on the very top so you do n't have to worry about the weight of the bag crushing it the best part of this backpack is that i have everything with me the only drawback is that you have to take it off and set it down to remove your camera i have tried out a few of the `` sliding `` backpacks , but they seem to have the same or more effort involved to get your camera this backpack is a keeper
the canon deluxe photo backpack # eg is great i have several lenses , # x <unk> , <unk> flash and my camera with the original lens on it inside the compartments inside the bag are removable and you can set it up anyway you want i like the way you can just unzip the top of the bag and pull out your camera i have been using the backpack for about a month and i have no complaints i would strongly recommend this backpack
customizable interior , use for my olympus e- # carries flash and # lenses including a long telephoto plus batteries , have taken into the mountains in utah , on top on <unk> picchu hawaii , all over holds equipment and ipad , wo n't fit a laptop though i do wish the side pockets had draw string closers vs flaps so you could hold a water bottle etc . considerably less expensive on amazon vs electronics retailer that 's blue and
i 've always owned the big name bags at the big $ $ $ this pack is quite a surprise in how well it is made and how functional it is for multi cameras with a long lens mounted on one i have a # d with a # f # . # and vertical grip mounted , a # d with # mounted plus # other lenses , large flash and a lot of other accessories the pack is very well made , carries well and has a nice assortment of functional exterior pockets for a field trip what a great camera pack at an outstanding price ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
this was a very wise investment , the cost was reasonable compared to some of the other camera bags out there there is plenty of room , it holds all of my equipment which includes several filters , # lenses , # camera body , one video camera , one point and shoot camera , and one tripod the best part is that there is still room for some more i also put it on my shoulders and it will be a lot easier than trying to carry one over a single shoulder this camera bag exceeded my expectations by far and i 'm very glad i bought it
i have read many reviews before deciding to buy this bag i was considering buying the <unk> mini trekker at double the price but for the price of the canon appealed to me happy to say i am delighted with my purchase it is just the right size for a backpack , with enough pockets for my dslr camera , flash unit , # zoom , # mm and plenty of room to spare there are plenty of pockets inside and out to accomodate passport , manuals , memory cards , filters etc . . buy it you will not be disappointed
