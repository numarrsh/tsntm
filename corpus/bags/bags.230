i purchased this case using my iphone so i never saw the small print that says it wont fit my macbook pro that it only would fit older models why on earth dont they tell you that right in the title what a waste of money the company never returned my request for a return and i see that they will charge me # % <unk> fee + return shipping to send it back i 'm <unk> what horrible a customer service solution to an issue they could have avoided with proper marketing
this case was exactly as promised with one major exception , it did n't come close to fitting my new # `` macbook pro -lrb- purchased # -rrb- the seller was great and i returned it apparently the new macbook pro 's are a little bigger they do n't have one to fit the new style macbook and that 's too bad because otherwise the case was great , both sturdy and stylish i got this one at a discount because it had been opened and i imagine the same thing had happened to the previous buyer
this product costs over $ # and is less worthy than a grocery store fruit container , really , which is given away it 's not plastic as people say in their reviews , but it 's made of a thin acrylic which makes it pretty fragile for what it is intended to be
do not buy from these people if you have a macbook pro made in the past couple years i was not aware of this when i searched `` macbook pro case # `` `` which is the aluminum model that most people have when i took it out and see that it didnt fit my macbook , i contacted them and received no response then after a couple days i contacted them again they told me they wouldnt not take it back one of their `` return <unk> `` is that they dont except any returns on this product if the <unk> is taken off -- thats the only way you can see if it fits your computer oh , and they dont cover return shipping -- basically they 've found every <unk> to steal your money now i spent $ # on a case that doesnt work money down the drain i will contact amazon to let them know about this misleading ad
i was excited to receive the product however it did not fit my laptop everytime i opened the lid a popping sound would occur turns out the rear right back panel was rubbing the lid casing i took the laptop out and placed it back in thinking it was not properly installed , same issue i 'm not telling anyone not to buy this product just be cautious . . and i hope you have better luck then i did
the case fit my macbook pro well , except that when i would lift the screen , the top half of the case would snag on the bottom half at the right hinge , lifting it off the computer as another reviewer mentioned , this can be fixed by shaving off a little of the speck 's plastic , but for such an expensive item this should not be necessary
i ordered the pink case ... one corner -lrb- front right lower case -rrb- does n't fit ... so as i type it snaps out of place i will exchange it and hope that i just got a bad one if the next one fits i 'll give it # stars because it looks to great
although i no longer use this with my mbp , it did protect my computer from bumps and kept it looking new the speck case does scratch easily on normal surfaces too aside from being overpriced , there are two major problems with it , that have forced me to remove it permanently from my laptop the case attracts a plethora of dust which is never good for computers to combat this dust magnet problem i put the entire unit inside an incase sheath which costs about $ # however upon removal from this sheath , static <unk> would build up on the speck case and shock me as well as the laptop electric shocks are never a good thing for expensive computer equipment the only way to prevent this was to touch part of the metal on the computer to ground it another way to . prevent this is by leaving only the top cover of the speck case on to protect the rear of the lcd screen
this case has provided no issues with concern to the heat generated by mbps which was my primary concern it does seem to have some craft issues though it is about # months old and has no tabs left holding the the bottom peice on it showed a lot of <unk> when i first purchased it , but that is no <unk> a <unk> since it is now covered in scratches i do not think that i have been that hard on the case , but i do take it with me every day , and it shows the <unk> along each side of the top panel appear much more `` <unk> `` in real life , which was a bit of a disappointment as well all in all , it seems to be doing its job , and the price was not bad , even after purchasing some industrial strength double sided tape to keep it on i would have prefered a slightly more matte finish
this product is definetly the best way to protect your macbook pro from scratches , i bought the orange one and its really sweet it brings a cool look to mbp its easy to put it on it took me only # seconds to start using it . but i dont think this simple plastic cover is worth # dollars and i feel like i wasted my money
i realise this is n't a very expensive piece of plastic but why cant it be made more precisely the tabs holding it on to the base dont quite make it over the edge , leaving an ugly bulge where it should just fit it seems to trap dust and grit - not the fault of the case but i find i have to take it off now and then to clean it
i wish they would say it does not fit the newer models i just bought a new mbp and purchased this to protect it it fits great , but the bottom covers all the ports , rendering them unusable oh well , at least the top half fits
this case is average at best it scratches very easily , does not hold on to the laptop via the clips all that firmly and generally feels cheap and flimsy if i were to buy again , i 'd try another product
you may like the color i do n't not enough shock absorption actually none i think you may be disappointed because of the quality of the product when you open the box , but it works it still feels like a cheap $ # case
this speck case does wonders for the macbook pro visually , but i had some initial problems with it it did n't quite fit so the back corner chipped off also , i was saddened to know that dirt and grime get in your case even though you have a case on it and it scratches the macbook pro it 's still pretty good though because i know i 'd have way more scratches on it if i did n't have this case on i hear incase 's new one is also nice and it 's softer so it wo n't scratch either one i guess you 'll do fine with
this is ok i 'm so glad i bought it here -lrb- for # . # -rrb- . . and not through other websites that advertised it for almost $ # -lrb- it 's not worth that much at all ! ! it 's only two pieces of plastic ! -rrb- it provides nice coverage for my mbp the only thing i 'm unhappy with is the color it is n't a deep red - more of a candy apple / cherry red
i was a little disappointed with the fit of the case even after fitting it on , to open the case requires a lot more effort , i have to turn the case up to get to the button maybe i 'll get use to it since i only had the case for a week , but a <unk> <unk> would have been appropriate i 'm confident that it will provide greater protection for the laptop , but would only give it a `` # `` for value for nearly $ # , i expected more
the shell does not fit correctly on the <unk> front corner of my c # d mbp and has several <unk> edges disappointing quality for the price however it does provide good protection and i will continue to use it i would recommend looking at other hard shells before purchasing i also have one for the # `` macbook the mold for the # `` model is a perfect fit , but it still suffers from the <unk> edges
i just bought my first macbook pro , and so want to keep the best care of it and so , i went looking for the best , most convenient hard case this led me to the speck macbook pro see-thru case i was impressed by the variety of colors , and decided to go cool black when i got my new laptop , and got out the case -lrb- which arrived weeks earlier , thanks to amazon , no thanks to <unk> ! -rrb- , it snapped on very easily i have also been impressed by the way all of the places to plug in are so easily accessed it also has handy little rubber stoppers on the bottom that keep it from sliding around the temperature of the macbook is also lessened a bit by the case , but it seems to be able to breathe just fine all in all , it looks like a good use of a bit of money to protect something worth quite a bit of money
the product is solid it is for the non-unibody macbook pro i think the macbook pro basically from # clips on nicely to the computer and holds well no complaints here of course your macbook will get hotter a bit faster but it is better than a broken computer when you drop it
have not discovered any scratches on my macbook pro after placing it in this case - which is my reason for purchasing it would give it a # , except that the bottom section does not fit perfectly and the lower right corner can easily pop out when moving the laptop
people are always talking about the <unk> and bends that happen to their macbook pro 's over time it is a <unk> trick apple plays on us by making us this great machine , yet somehow the shell of the machine <unk> appears with fresh blemishes and warping every now and then the speck macbook pro case is a fairly tough plastic shell that covers the top , bottom and much of the edges of the laptop it still allows for all your connections and opening and closing , and actually makes my computer look like iron man or some kind of <unk> up macbook special which is kind of fun of course its a but bulkier now , and i do feel like an <unk> parent ... but who cares , my computer stays in perfect condition . i look super <unk> cool and well ... its fun
i get asked all the time how i `` painted `` my macbook pro red -- it 's pretty incredible what a <unk> it is -- in a good way i swear , i should become a traveling <unk> , this case looks so good but , there is one issue -- primarily that the fit is so tight that the underside has developed about an inch long crack from one of the corners , and i 've only had it about a month i intend to contact the manufacturer and see if i can get a replacement because otherwise , this was a great buy
i bought this to protect the beautiful aluminum case of the macbook pro it does an excellent job of this just seeing some of the marks on the black case makes me realise what ` could ' have happened on reflection i think the clear may have been a better idea so that you get that silver finish - but whatever colour it is a great fit and great product
this product does it 's job in protecting the laptop and it 's nice to have such a slim and sleek casing it 's also easy to attach however , a good amount of dust still gets through the casing and leaves a not so nice appearance if it is n't cleaned in a timely manner that is why i have rated this as a #
exactly as described , timely delivery ! performs exactly as described minor blemish ... magnet piece on one of the # corners was missing nothing to interfere with the product performance , but missing all the same
this case is a great fit for my # `` macbook pro it is pretty easy to get it on , but a little <unk> if you want to take it back off it is made of pretty sturdy plastic and has been protecting my mac well during travel i give it a # instead of five because of the placement of the vents although it does have some vents on the bottom , it does n't have any vents over the battery area , which can run hot on the macs my husband 's mac had a battery that <unk> when it got too hot , so it makes me nervous to cover the bottom with a tough plastic like this so i actually just use the top cover of mine and sit it on a targus fan
snaps on easily but the bottom cover of my case is n't perfect - still fits well enough but the line is n't as clean as for the other sides it 's barely noticeable so i 'm quite happy with this purchase
i 'm fairly tough on my laptops and this works well to prevent scratching and easy to clean the rubber feet help a lot and the laptop stays cooler , the distance between the bottom of the laptop and case makes an <unk> <unk>
i installed the speck clear red hard case on my # `` mbpro # . # ghz laptop it went on easily , stays on well , and is not hard to remove all ports are accessible without modification the case looks very cool and generates lots of interest i had to remove the bottom half to put the mbpro into my <unk> docking station , since it raises the laptop enough to interfere with the fit this is the same problem that i 've had with every case - at least removing the bottom of the speck case is quick and easy it protects the laptop nicely from minor bumps , scratches , and other day-to-day <unk> did i mention that it looks cool , too
the speck mac book pro # `` case protects my laptop extremely well and makes it very attractive to the eye it fits snugly inside my incase mac book pro bag it is easy to remove for <unk> cleaning , unless you wish for debris to scratch and <unk> such a beautiful machine this product is terrific and i have no complaints it is a very good buy
so far this hard case works out great for me three things to consider though # -rrb- it attracts more hair , fur and dust than you mac without the hard case not a huge problem though # -rrb- your mac will get slightly heavier even though the see thru looks like it 's weightless it 's not # -rrb- you ca n't tip your display as far back as you can without the hardcase to me it 's a little annoying when sitting with the mac in my lap where usually need to <unk> the display all the way back to get the right viewing angle my guess is that you can tip the display # degrees still all the above is an okay trade off when it come to protecting the mac
neat little cover it has two great features # -rrb- it protects your mac book # -rrb- looks really cool many people ask what kind of apple i have i rated it # of # , because i think it could be priced a little more <unk>
fits nicely , all plugs , ports , etc . are accessible with the cover on the computer does have a couple of <unk> edges , but they generally do n't interfere unless you bump it from the side vents in the bottom allow heat to escape so computer does n't get too hot
the day that i recieved my red mac cover , i dropped the darn thing - and would n't you know it , if i had n't had the case on it my mac would have been <unk> this case is very easy to use and really works , it keeps the dings out and makes a pretty little place to put your stickers or <unk> without harming the integrity of the mac grade : a
overpriced , but worth it provides great protection without <unk> the weight and beauty of the macbook pro core # i had to cut a little off the back of mine to make it fit perfectly , because it was preventing the screen from opening , but besides that i have had no issues i travel a lot , so i need something to protect my mac whether i was carrying it under my arm or throwing it in and out of numerous pieces of luggage
i bought this because i 'm a student , so my computer is constantly being transported from my apartment to class to the library and back again although i do n't think that the macbook pro is as easy to scratch as the regular macbook , which has a slick plastic casing , i still wanted a little something extra to protect my computer the cover is made of a nice thick plastic i bought the case in green , which makes my computer look a little more unique than regular mbps it was very easy to put on and easy to remove , and i think that it definitely can protect he laptop very well the only things i do n't like about the case is that it makes the computer feel about a pound heavier since the plastic is so thick , the top of my computer closes very quickly and a harder than normal since it is weighted down by the case there are some cases that do n't fit well -lrb- according to the speck website -rrb- but mine happens to fit perfectly without having to send it back or fixing it myself
purchased from value twist here on amazon the speck see-thru case is great to protect the macbook pro i believe a lot of people that are getting scratches from the case may be due to their inability to put the cover on correctly you need to be gentle and precise when clipping it onto the laptop as for value twist , they sent it asap , and in pretty decent condition for a used item had a few minor scratches , but nothing too ridiculous i think i may purchase some black satin fabric and figure a way to customize the shell i like the plastic look , but would love to hide the blemishes on my actual laptop :
although it looks great on my macbook pro and does the ` protect from scratches ' thing , the case does hang up a little in the back making me wonder if eventually it will crack with numerous openings also the side that in earlier models used to cover the inputs individually now is one big opening i think that this takes away from the stability of the case other than that it 's been great
when i first received this case it did n't properly fit my macbook pro , after contacting speck 's customer service they sent me a new one no charge or shipping fee i appreciate it when a company stands by there products when the new one came it fit perfectly & does the job i had hoped it would do if your looking for a way to protect your mac investment , this case totally helps
it even fits over my <unk> skin which in turn protects my laptop even more my # month old son knocked it off the coffee table and it did n't pop off i 'm very happy with my purchase
speck products are great , the cover comes on and off with ease the scratches that have appeared on the case make me extremely satisfied that i bought the cover , my mac is protected also , it looks really cool
was shipped exceptionally fast within two days -lrb- standard shipping -rrb- the product fits my computer perfectly and protects it from many scratches and dents for which i would have been responsible every where i go people complement me on how cool my computer looks with the red macbook pro case
i would suggest not even opening the box on your new macbook pro without first purchasing and installing the speck macbook pro # `` see-thru hard case it protects your macbook that well i love it and have been the source of mac envy in many situations people see it and want it it works , its pretty , its awesome
i am so happy that i purchased this product when i see the scratches and kinks that would have been on my laptop man ! ! so happy that i got it also , i get a lot of looks , people are always asking where did i get it pc users wishes they made it for them
this hard case is excellent it is easy to put on and remove for cleaning , etc . very thin so it is hardly noticeable i would definitely recommend this product to others
i 've only had mine for a week , but so far raves all around the case fits well , does n't seem to scratch the exterior of the mac , and the blue looks much better in person than in the product pictures
i feel greatly relieved to have this case for my macbook pro -lrb- especially while i 'm traveling -rrb- many reviews that i read said that they had to file down a portion of it so it would open all the way , i did n't have this problem at all straight from the box , popped it on , off i went the clear case is great you can hardly notice any scratches and i have lots of fun putting pictures or the like underneath to really make it more personalized
excellent case , i chose the orange one which matches the inside of my <unk> laptop bag perfectly and it was very easy to snap on and it fits perfectly
this is the best product for protecting your precious macbook pro i carry it around with me every day , and i feel so much safer having the speck protecting it it fits perfectly too
this is just very nice and well made add on for my macbook pro i have the new version of the macbook pro with the led backlight screen i 've had the skin now for about # months and no real scratches on it it clipped on with no problems heat has n't been an issue even when i 'm booted into windows and running a game on it my remote still works with it all the ports work with everything i have and i 've had some compliments on how well my laptop looks i mean it just makes the macbook pro look even better
my laptop 's <unk> appeal just <unk> this case is perfect for all my carryall needs - i never have to worry about scuffing again before this , i used a soft case , and i 'd <unk> when i accidentally set my bag down too hard now i can trust my laptop can take some roll and tumble it 's the perfect case
the cover fits well with the exception of the front corner near the dvd drive -lrb- at least on my laptop -rrb- before <unk> a dvd , i have to ensure that the cover is completely snapped on otherwise , i ca n't eject the cd/dvd minor issue considering the extra protection provided by the case cover and it looks great
i bought this `` skin `` for my # year old son 's # `` mac he loved it it snapped right on and offered scratch protection for his # `` mac so he felt comfortable carrying it around in his backpack he loved the <unk> seethru color
basically , i bought this hard case to protect me from myself it does fit very well , not perfectly , but if it fit perfectly you would n't be able to ever get it off it slightly prohibits the screen from angling as far back as it would without the case , but it 's minimal and a small price to pay for a great case something not mentioned that i really enjoy is the little rubber feet are of great quality on the case ; they 're a vast improvement over the ones the macbook pro offers itself the only reason i can see someone not wanting this case is if they frequently switch out batteries , since you must take the bottom part off to switch batteries -lrb- probably # extra seconds total -rrb-
i had one of these covers on my mbp for about # months and i like it alot i also got similar covers for my daughters and wife 's laptops and they like it too i took my cover off after about # months to clean it , some dirt does get under the cover so after cleaning i did n't put the cover on right away , but took my laptop with me and had it on the floor of my car when i reached for the laptop i grabbed the screen between my thumb and index finger to pull it closer and `` snap `` the screen broke i had been moving my laptop in a similar fashion -lrb- with the cover on -rrb- for quite awhile and i assume the lack of rigidity -lrb- and my poor choice -rrb- resulted in the broken screen it costs $ # to have apple repair the screen or about $ # at a cut rate place that 's expensive either way and having a $ # plastic cover that gives it a bit more protection , is a good investment so , consider this when deciding on whether to purchase a `` sleeve `` or a shell i 'd <unk> for the shell
i read a lot of reviews on here that said the case did n't fit just right and that they had to scrape a little off here or there to make it fit but mine fit perfectly without any modifications it 's a little hard to get off , but there 's really no need to take it off so it does n't matter i know it 's a little pricey but hey , the mac was pretty expensive and i figure it was worth it to protect my investment i would buy it again in a second
the macbook pro was just too pretty to begin with ; it could n't help but suffer under the <unk> handling of <unk> security forces but now this case is its armor , and the color says , `` hey touch me at your own risk . `` priced right and timely delivered : all in all a good deal
the speck macbook pro # `` see-thru hard case fits my macbook pro perfectly i was nervous about purchasing the product but once i received it and installed it i was impressed with the product definitely dresses up my macbook pro quite a bit
the best way to keep your macbook pro always looking brand new easy to put on , keeps your laptop clean and scratch free easy to remove when it 's time to dust it off from small specs getting in between the case and the metal
i love this thing , it 's honestly exactly what i was looking for in a protective case fingerprints get on it , but they 're easy to clean off with the cloth given -lrb- which you can also clean your screen with if you need to -rrb- i 'm definitely <unk> by the <unk> of delivery , i ordered it on a friday night and received it monday morning so sick ! !
this is a fantastic piece for your macbook pro it does a great job protecting it just make sure you clean you laptop before you put it on because taking it off is a pain in the a $ $ ! !
i am very pleased with my speck hard case the translucent green gives my macbook a personal touch and protects it from scratches and nicks from daily use installing it was a snap
this is a great case i have had no problems with it , and works very well it 's also very `` sexy `` if you want to put it that way , and looks really cool only trouble i have is that when i open it sometimes , it 'll make a click sound because # pieces touch , but its very minor and does no damage it 's a great item however , if you intend to bang your laptop around a lot , i 'd recommend one of those soft outer cases too , because this is not intended to protect the hard drive etc . just protect it from scratches and smudges i recommend it highly
i just bought one , even after seeing some of the mixed reviews everything went on without a hitch the only `` issue `` was that my <unk> pro mag-safe holder does n't quite work with it , since there 's plastic between the mag-safe jack and the <unk> usb port not a big deal in fact , i think the mag-safe stays on well enough with just the shell that using the <unk> may be unnecessary i 'm very happy with it edit : # / # after using this for a while , the tabs holding the bottom piece on eventually broke off it still worked , mostly , but the bottom could sort of slide off also , make sure it 's completely clean between the laptop case and the shell or it will scratch your case , defeating the entire purpose
i researched a lot of covers and decided on speck we now have # speck covers and they all are great go on easy , fit well and excellent quality
ok well - when i just received this cover i had a hard time fitting it on i had to remove a piece of plastic to give it that snug fit other than that this item was and is still great i traveled cross country with my lap top and i was worried that it would get all scratched up and not one nick or anything so this is a good investment to protect that really expensive macbook
when i opened the plastic bag that the item came in , i found the piece of the case had broken off the bottom back i was disappointed because the case fit beautifully and know the size is very hard to find so i kept it and tried the glue repair fix that lasted for a while but eventually it broke off again i kept the case because the break does not affect the excellent fit on my laptop this could have been avoided with a padded mailing envelope or bubble wrap around it prior to mailing
this case fit my macbook pro like a glove the bottom and top parts snapped on perfectly with no fuss the case itself is made of durable plastic and does not add a lot of weight maintaining the light , streamlined look of the macbook the clear case lets the natural beauty of your mac shine through all the appropriate holes have been cut out to allow access to all the ports i would definitely recommend this product to keep your computer safe , protected , and looking beautiful
we have two speck covers on macbook pros , and two more on macbooks the oldest is twenty months -lrb- back when mainly red was available -rrb- , now we distinguish our computers with a variety of colors no problems after repeatedly taking them off and on -lrb- batteries and memory problems i recommend it to most mac notebook users we have none of the typical scratches and dings we 've seen on previous computers
i first learned of speck cases for macs from my brother-in-law , who found them to be a worthwhile investment in the higher cost and better quality of a mac laptop so , after buying a # `` macbook pro , i purchased a clear speck case i am very pleased installation was a snap ... <unk> the pun ... and the case definitely protects the nice aluminum case of the mac the case fits snugly my brother in law had issues with an earlier model of case : the <unk> plug could not be fully inserted into the laptop side because the speck case prevented a snug fit current models fix that problem by simply leaving that side of the case open my only complaint about the case is that dust and debris tends to collect down in the case near the edges of the laptop but , that 's a small price to pay for protection and the clear case looks great on the high-end mac book pro
this hard case is so pretty -lrb- i got the red one -rrb- and works great with my macbook pro # i had none of the problems described in other reviews the laptop opens normally , i did n't have any trouble making it fit the computer , i does n't heat at all i wish i had bought it earlier
i was a bit concerned when i read a few of the reviews of these speck see-thru hard cases , but i decided to throw caution -lrb- and <unk> bucks -rrb- to the wind and give one a whirl turns out , it far exceeded my expectations i ordered the black version , and it 's both sleek and protective my macbook pro has never looked better -lrb- love the apple shining through the square on the lid ! -rrb- , and there 's no danger of scratches ... or overheating , as the bottom is <unk> this is easily one of the best investments i 've made for my beloved apple notebook just to be certain , i 've removed the cover a couple of times , and there were no problems if i could , i 'd give it # + stars
there is a lot of <unk> surrounding this product , but this , i believe , is the newer version i have had no problems and it has already saved my laptop from plenty of dings and scratches no heat , noise , or performance issues <unk>
i have recently upgraded to this new model this is a new model with no fit issues this model also has a cut-out to allow the pressing of the battery button speck got it all right with this new model the top cover of the new model is also smooth giving this new model a better look , at least in my opinion
i bought the hard case because i have # cats and they manage to walk all over my other <unk> i keep it out and work on it quite frequently this is such a neat item i did not know that it was out there to have i would recommend this case to those with <unk> and little children with dirty hands that like to touch things it wipes off and the mac inside does not get dirty i love it ! ! ! !
i bought a clear speck for my macbook pro # `` and i just bought my wife a macbook pro # `` and wanted to get the same type of cover for her of course she wanted pink and it looks great it <unk> the laptop as hers as it has her flare this cover is great it snaps on quickly and easily and i have not had a problem with it falling off it provides great protection it does add a little extra weight and thickness , but it looks great and is completely protected i just love it
this case is a product that i would n't recommend the case simply was n't designed for easy use , it was too rigid for a messenger case and from the limited use i gave the case it did n't wear well most of the pocket -lrb- s -rrb- space really could n't hold anything like the charger and charger cables , mouse , etc . the `` flap `` had zipper opening that did n't allow sufficient entry space to store any files only thing that was `` authentic `` was the microsoft logo and that did n't mean very much the case was designed to fit a # . # laptop and it was a good , snug fit for the notebook and not much else i gave the `` messenger `` case away and happy to see someone make use of it !
i bought this item for my boyfriend last christmas and he simply loved it the material is great it has plenty of space inside and best of all it does not necessarily look like you 're carrying a laptop inside which is the feature he loved the most all geeky colleagues liked it a lot as well a definite hit
this messenger bag is the perfect size and provides adequate protection for your laptop the materials seem to be very sturdy after using the product daily for the past few months i highly recommend this product
i have had this bag for less than two months . i do not use it every day so it does not get hard use start with the flaw -- one of the zipper pulls broke within the first couple of days , and now another one is broken it is so disappointing to have what is otherwise a great bag show signs of poor materials so soon now i wonder how long it will be until all the pulls are broken and the bag is no longer usable other than that , i agree with other reviewers that the layout and organization of the bag is great -- and i love the contrasting color inside that makes whatever i put in there easier to see
i just bought this to replace a notebook back pack i have had for # years i like that tis is a lot lighter and more stylish , but there is a flaw that really annoys me , a lot i do not pick up the back pack , swing it over the center of my back and then insert both arms into the straps to use to shoulders and my back to carry it i tend to <unk> one side of it over one shoulder only and walk from my car to the coffee shop or work , or back to the car my last back pack had a rubberish underside to the straps , so they sort of gripped my shoulder , keeping it sort of in place this back pack has a mesh like material that does not grip at all , in fact seems to glide <unk> off like <unk> so i put it over my shoulder and walk no more than # steps and it had slid off my shoulder onto my arm , which is annoying and if carrying coffee , causes it to spill if only the unit had a non-slip material on the underside of the straps it would be perfect
the backpack seems really great many compartments , lots of room for books as well as smaller compartments for everything from pens to <unk> card , phone , mp # player , etc love that the interior is orange but do think that the front pocket may get dirty from pens and the like pretty quickly the other con -lrb- for me -rrb- is that as another reviewer mentioned , it is a very big bag in my opinion anyone under # ' # may think it takes up the whole back and then some too bad , it is a great bag
i looked at hundreds of packs before picking this one , and i 'm not unhappy with it at all it is very well constructed , unlike some of the cheaper packs it is just the right size for what i wanted , and easily holds my laptop plus all the accessories , plus all of my work i carry it on a small pull cart , and then transfer to a backpack when needed the only thing i would change is the <unk> front panel it makes it more difficult to get into the front of the pack ; also the velcro was weak holding it down and it came loose alot i fixed that by adding some more velcro patches and now it is much more secure
this bag is awesome you can actually fit a computer and a portable printer easily , also has a lot of compartments where you can put all sort of stuff i am very satisfied with this purchase
i bought this backpack almost three years ago now , and nothing has worn out on it i am a network administrator , and i used to have to travel between locations on the bus , this bag has more than enough space for two laptops notebook , network <unk> and whatever else you need i dont see this bag wearing out anytime soon
well , if you were like me and looking for a laptop bag that did n't look like you were going mountain climbing , then this is for you i was not happy with the choices for backpacks out i mean they had tons of zippers and <unk> and ties i needed a more simpler and professional backpack and this was it it has tons and tons of space for everything you need and more overall , a really nice bag
pretty good product its a bit heavy , but sturdily constructed main compartment zippers sealed for water resistance would like more <unk> spaces however holds my nikon d # , flash , set of filters , # mm # . # , # mm # . # along with a gps device
very good camera backpack with lots of space to <unk> camera and it 's accessories but the laptop compartment looks to be small for # . # inch and very tight . one more drawback is we can not keep the manuals and laptop together
i think this is a # . # star bag but i 'll round up because i do like it the main reasons i purchased this bag was for the capacity , the tripod carrier , and the all weather capabilities compared to my lowepro <unk> # i feel like i get an enormous backpack for only a little extra storage space getting to the cameras and accessories is easy and the laptop compartment is a great feature even with a # & # # ; mbp i did n't feel like i was getting pulled back a word of caution - if you add on a tripod to the back it feels like this pack extends several feet behind you -lrb- and it does -rrb- this makes it difficult to walk through crowds and hike into tight places i would not recommend this pack if you want a backpack for small trips or outings if you 're like me and you need a travel case for multiple cameras , flashes , lenses , a laptop , and accessories then this backpack will work for you this pack will fit in the overhead compartment of # s , a # s , # s , # s , and a # s
you can carry enough in this pack that it will make you uncomfortable carrying it it holds enough for a complete on location shoot , and then some like i said , if you need to carry more than this pack will hold , you need a <unk>
great backpack , tons of space the back pack has several compartment divisions besides the ones installed has a weather cover below the tripod base can be hooked on any part of the backpack great purchase ! really happy with it
if you buy it for what it is has been designed for -lrb- international travel -rrb- this bag is fantastic it is cleverly designed , very comfortable thanks to its big thick waist and shoulder strap and it is the right size for travel by plane -lrb- to keep it with you -rrb- the only drawback i have usually heard and agreed with is the location of the notebook it would have been better to fit the notebook closer to the back so to provide a better weight distribution if your notebook is big and heavy , you will certainly feel the difference the quality is superior to anything i have seen on the market -lrb- including tenba which is also very well built
this bag will swallow so much gear you may question that it has straps and not wheels all in all it is a great bag for holding a lot of equipment
plenty of room , lots of adjustments , very comfortable to carry on long hikes keep in mind it is a large pack it will not fit on overhead compartments on the small regional jets
this is my second bag my last one lasted since # the strap broke because i am a little rough this is the only bag i can find that is water resistant , holds many items that i do need and is the right size for carry on when traveling
i bought this for my partner who loves photography he has started to accumulate more gear and his smaller lowepro was too small he really loves the product quality and style of his smaller lowepro so it only made sense to buy another larger one it was a huge hit christmas morning
the case is very well constructed , well finished , and designed ok it is the design where the case falls a little short the case is just adequite in size to hold a slim body # in wide monitor laptop , just adequite but that 's ok there are <unk> pockets and slip in spaces for papers , pda 's , and a few small <unk> items where the case falls short is they forgot the small but very hard with sharp pointed edge design of the portable battery charger converter there is no place for it to be stored without bulging out the side of the case , or scratching up the laptop try and add the wonderful new wireless mouse and you have two large <unk> looking to be broken the <unk> are just begging to be bumped and <unk> flat , and they keep the case from laying flat a simple end pouch for a mouse and charger would have solved the problem , added no weight or extra size
this is a very nice case and it would be wonderful except that i bought the extended life battery for my computer and thus the computer does not fit into this -lrb- or any other case i 've found -rrb- apparently , this computer is n't portable once you get a bigger battery my choices are to buy a smaller computer or get the smaller battery for traveling or take the battery out
great case for holding everything that goes with portable computer the zippers seem to hang up as you go around the front corners both in opening and closing other than that it is great .
