ive had this cover for about # weeks now , right before christmas great color , great fit it slightly snaps on but it was a lil difficult <unk> the top cover on no problems at all but i thought it would b more rubberized on the outside of covers just to have a better grasp oh , and it does pick up smudges from grabbing it , mostly on edges im assuming they will wipe right off just havent done it yet
it 's light weight enough that you do n't feel much of a difference without it in terms of protection it 's helpful to prevent scratches i have not yet dropped my laptop , so i ca n't write about the drop protection it looks good on the laptop the laptop is used for graduate class work so i would consider that heavy usage
very nice cover , slim , grippy but not sticky had to work at getting the bottom piece in place on my macbook air , somewhat difficult to get last side to fully click on , but did with several attempts fits well and matches my <unk> , too did have to go online for instructions , so as not to inadvertently damage the cover while placing
i bought this after coming to college when i realized my soft case/sleeve just was n't cutting it i put this on and my laptop looks so cute , and it protects it it fits perfectly , it 's easy to put on and take off and i just love the color edit : after a few months of having this , i 've only run in to one problem the little rubber pads on the bottom of the case that usually keep it from sliding are coming off it 's not a huge problem , as i do n't need them much
i like the color and fit of the case , but it came with no instructions on how to put it on it was n't hard to figure out but the top part has one side with two tabs and one side with three the side with three tabs is suppose to go on the top where the camera is so you do n't create a gap when you open your computer i put it on wrong at first and getting it off was impossible i cut my finger open and it took about # minutes before i finally forced it off , so make sure it is on right the first time the tabs that fastens it on rub my wrist when i type and that is <unk> annoying it seems like a strong case and obviously is n't going to come off easily ! i think it is worth the price just make sure you put it on right the first time to avoid the frustration of trying to get it off
fits very snugly , good fit , quality is a , not a + because of the seam lines about # months into it i 'm getting stress fractures around the back corners would buy again
only thing stopping this form a # star review is the slight discoloration it may have like mine around certain corners other then that , great feel , materials , and
i have a macbook air # inch that i bought in # i have been trying to find different cases , however they are either really expensive or too with unbelievable quality this one , on the other hand , is way worth $ # it fits perfectly it looks great you can see the apple logo when you turn your macbook on there is only one thing that i did n't like a lot about it is the texture of the case it becomes dirty pretty soon , you just have to keep cleaning from time to time other than that , this is a great product
no surprises here i 've had it for a few days now and no complaints i 'm not running through the streets telling everyone about it or anything , but it 's doing the job well thus far i 'll update if anything goes
i bought this to replace a speck case that broke i was impressed that the quality was pretty good based on the price difference i normally buy speck cases but i pick this up because of the price the fit was true and it hold on pretty well i was impressed enough that i bought one for my # & # # ; mba as well i am expecting to get about a year out of it before it falls a part based on the quality that i see for the price that is perfect a speck only lasted about # years of hard travel
it fit my macbookair perfectly upon first putting it on i have n't tried to take it off and i do n't intend to , so hopefully that will help maintain its integrity the only slight issue i have is that it shows fingerprints on the outside pretty easily
fits perfect to my mac book air # fast <unk> just did n't like that on the top cover came with a tiny black dot or mark that ca n't be removed its factory mistake its just visual but it bothers me because i like my stuff to be neat other than that its great
ordered this product to protect my mac air from getting scratch overall i like the product ; very thin and light weight but does the job i did notice a slight imperfection in top cover but it was n't enough to go through sending it back i would recommend this product to a friend
the color matched , and it does have the satin feel but the plastic did not feel well made , like the feet of the cover where i had to rub some plastic off overall , it serves its purpose , but could have some improvement for better quality
when this case was first shipped to me it came broken via shipping i sent a note to kuzy customer service and they responded within # hours they asked for an image which i sent and they immediately sent me a replacement which i received in a few days folks were quick and friendly during this process now that i have the case it was a little bit hard putting it on , i was worried i would break the case or scratch the laptop i finally got it on and it looks great
the extra protection is critical with all of my travel and it looks sleek , not <unk> from the notebook 's design itself while it could be a little tighter to the frame of the laptop , it fits and gets the job done - for a reasonable price , no less
firstly , it fits very very well and clicks on firmly the texture is exactly what i wanted too however , the case is prone to fingerprints overall , decently happy with the case - but customer service could be better
my # nd kuzy hard case the # st one developed a crack on the lower half after some rough handling and it would n't stay on securely if it were truly indestructible i 'd give it # stars that may be overly critical -- after all , i did replace it with the same thing i like the matte black finish -- it <unk> the sometimes overly flashy apple finish it 's sturdy , fits perfectly , feels good in the hand , and , most importantly , provides protection from bumps and scratches
i gave it only four stars because after a few months the rubber feet started to fall off its what it says it is -- a plastic case with a rubberized finish its translucent so when your mac is lit up the apple shows as in the picture its a nice <unk> color i find the case makes it easier to hold and reduces any worry of normal knocks and scratches
looks and feels great but a corner of it chipped as soon as i installed it which leads me to believe this case is a bit weak in the corners aside from that i must say this is a pretty sleek case that will keep your mba looking as beautiful as it did out of the package
like great , fits great apple logo shines through i got for the mac air and it keeps it all really protected without adding bulk or weight that is noticeable i got the frosted white which is almost the same look as the actual computer i also got the kuzy keyboard cover and that fits like a glove , <unk> the key click , protects well and cover closes fine with it in place
the product arrived earlier than it should be ! ! i was so happy when i saw it the color is great but not as transparent as the model item what 's more , it fits my # `` macbook air really well !
this jacket has a rubbery feel to it that helps avoid dropping it it fits perfectly on my macbook air this makes the unit look unique and protects it well at the same time highly recommend it
this product fits like a glove lot of protection for mac air light weight and all ports accessible lost # star because top was almost impossible to remove once on , but recommend thin rubber <unk> to slide under and pry off in order to remove
i have had this product for about two weeks the skin is easy to put on the macbook and the turquoise color looks really cool it surely does its job of protecting my macbook overall , it is worth the money spent
the color is exactly as the picture the case is not bulky at all , but it is heavy . my screen tilts back if i lift it from the bottom i ended up taking it off and only putting it on when i travel the fit is a on the tight side takes effort to remove it , but that 's better than having it loose the lower part of the case is too thick though
at first i was unhappy with the fit of the hard cover case it was making a * click * noise every time i opened the laptop then i realized that not all of the tabs were lined up and this was the <unk> this was fixed quickly and the noise has since never bothered me overall , very good fit and has protected my laptop from scratches in my briefcase one note , the rubber pegs on the bottom have a habit of sliding off if they do , all that is required is a dab of <unk> and you 're all set
the cover is great for keeping my computer safe from scratches and bumps at first when i took it out of the packaging i was a little disappointed because it did n't look like what i expected it to but once i snapped it on to the computer , it was exactly what i wanted
love the color and everything about this case it fit my macbook air like a glove however , through the shipping process it was slightly chipped on one corner but it still fits and i would definitely purchase this in different colors and styles
i have only one issue with this case overall it fits well , comes on and off easily and does n't add much weight the only issue i have is this case was not designed for # models it covers the one of the external microphones on the left side
i liked it a lot , specially the color , its exactly like the picture . only the upper part i did n't know which side should be at the top or the bottom but it worked just
the plastic was a bit harder and slicker than i expected but it 's well worth it the picture makes it look like there is an apple logo or that it 's see-through enough for it to show white ; however , it 's the glow that makes it show it 's a good piece and we 're happy with it
everything about this case is nice - <unk> -lrb- super small and light -rrb- and so on only complaint is that the rubber stoppers on the bottom began coming off after a month or two of having it i 'll probably just super glue them back and it 'll be fine but ... overall , the case is everything i wanted
i bought this because i wanted the apple logo to be bright through the case , but it 's not it 's not that big of a deal to me it 's disappointing but i can get over it since i 'm not looking at the back of my mac it comes with a key cover too which i did n't know great case for the price and does the job for me
not too bad a cover the plastic is a bit loose around the speaker area , so it <unk> and <unk> with the speaker if the volume is high definitely seeing some wear and tear around the base -lrb- possibly due to the speakers <unk> the plastic a lot -rrb- , but the top cover looks fine it wo n't protect from a spill or a drop , but definitely does from scratching or marring the surface the no-slip silicone discs on the bottom serve well and are fairly nice , and the vents seem to help keep the laptop cool i would definitely buy one again as long as the price stays below $ # anything more would be <unk>
this case will keep your hardware from getting scratched , and fits very well i tend not to drop things , so this case will serve my needs perfectly i 'm not sure how rubberized this case actually is it 's aesthetically pleasing , and the apple still shines through black rather well overall this is a very decent product at a very reasonable price
there are no directions , but the cover snapped on very easily once i lined things up i doubt that the cover would protect my computer from significant impacts , but it should protect it from scratches the cover has a nice feel to it and looks good i have the black cover , which looks professional -lrb- but a little boring -rrb- i 've only had it for a few days so do n't know about longevity , but suspect that with reasonable care -lrb- particularly with the clips -rrb- , it should last at least a year
i got the yellow and the color is true to the pictures it looks great on my macbook air , especially paired with the kozy yellow keyboard cover i really like the rubberized texture fit is good as well you can see the apple logo clearly glow through the case the only nit pick is the kuzy logo on the cover it 's too obvious but that is a minor concern and would not keep me from offering a hearty recommendation
good price , fast shipping there is <unk> little to say the only thing is that is blocks one of the two microphone inputs in the # macbook air if you are not going to use the microphones a lot that it will be fine
protects my laptop well and looks beautiful very sleek profile not too slippery either my only complaint is that the bottom does n't seem to snap perfectly into place i do n't know if i installed it improperly -lrb- although i do n't think so -rrb- but there are very minor gaps around the bottom part of the laptop and the case overall , would probably buy again
i received this product and it had a small scratch on the top i chose to return it to amazon but the seller replied asap and offered to replace the case for free very good customer service the case itself is better than the other black cases my friend has one of the other brands and everyone remarked that my case looked a lot nicer it has a rubbery feel to it which is very good cause it gives u a grip and it does n't make it look cheap it is a bit difficult to remove the case so keep that in mind also the bottom case has # nice feet that help prevent the case from getting scratched or the macbook from moving around to be honest none of the cases do justice to the macbook air - the laptop is so beautiful and all the cases make it look ugly but if you want to protect your baby then this is it
i like the rubberized feel it 's much easier to pick up my mac and it does n't slide around although two people thought my black case was purple otherwise , happy with the case
i ordered this laptop hardshell case for my # `` macbook air which i purchased for college i received the case a day before i expected and it fit my computer perfectly my only concern is that it might strain the hinges of the computer and forces it closed if i do n't open it wide enough over all good product the color is slightly duller than i expected , but that is a risk you run with any purchase online
fits well and the blue helps differentiate your laptop from the sea of brushed aluminum apple machines at half the price of what one would find in the apple store , think of this as disposable protection from minor bumps and bruises
the rubber feet are not attached securely at all i 've only had the thing a couple of months i spent a few weeks moving the feet back to their places on the case that was annoying , but now one of them is gone , so the laptop is always tippy on the table very annoying . : -lrb- update : kuzy replied to my review within a day and sent me a package of feet
easy to install and seems to do the job i would give the fit # only because it seems like it could fit slightly tighter around the bottom below the trackpad area , where you grab to open the lid for this price i am not complaining and will deal with it
this is a <unk> case for my # macbook air i like the rubberised finish and access to the ports and card slots i took a star away because the case doesnt seem to fit perfectly and fingerprints leave marks
the fit and color are perfect the only thing that 's a little bothersome is the rubber pads on the bottom start to move a little bit , probably due to the heat it 's no problem pushing them back into place , and i 'm sure if they come off i can just super glue them back on other than that , though , i really like this case
the case does exactly what it should ... protect the outside of my macbook air the case though has broke in # spots on the bottom piece that keep the case in place i have had it for almost # months now but still i have never taken the computer out of the case since putting it on ... so i 'm not sure how it could break will soon have to invest in a new case
i love the color of this case it fits well , but i was hoping that the two pieces would be easier to install the top fit perfect , but the bottom was cut a bit short and i had to use force to flatten it out completely and make sure it snapped onto one of the sides other than that , it 's a great case , you can still see the apple logo shine through and it gives a nice rubber feel so it does n't feel like it 'll slip out of your hands
case is great - nice feel - lightweight , smooth , sturdy only negative - wish the rubber feet would n't come off other than that i really like the case very much
this a good cover and does a great job a protecting the air the color is perfect for my wife and she is very happy with it quality , construction just not quite perfect to give a # star
good snug fit that does work with the new macbook air , i think they just cut the # models to expose the extra mic black shoes marks easier go with another
a friend had a red kuzy and i loved the look , so when i bought my new air i got my own i really , really like it i travel quite a bit and can be somewhat hard on my computers and so far it is really holding up i like how easily it snaps on and the price is reasonable compared to others - i may even get one in teal just for fun
i looked for hours through all the shell cases trying to debate which one to get , and finally decided on the kuzy i was looking for a matte case that would n't show fingerprints and provided some extra protection from my bag so far i am happy with it i do n't know how good it will be in a fall pros : great looking , slightly soft touch feel similar to tpu , easily installs , added protection with only a minimal increase in bulk cons : does n't cover the corners completely , the rubber feet were coated in the soft touch material and were pealing -lrb- it did come off with a fingernail
this cover does exactly what it is designed to do snaps on easily , stays in place , is ultra-thin and lightweight i 've used it for about a month now and i would have given it # stars but for two minor complaints the little black rubber circles that serve as pads on the bottom have come loose and keep falling off i <unk> them back in place and so far , they 're staying put the cover is also prone to collecting greasy finger prints , as other users have noted neither of these are <unk> in my book and i can highly recommend this product ca n't imagine using my macbook air it
been using it for about year and the corners are gone due to being cracked only the corners of the bottom of the mac has broken and its falling <unk> i used it for one year and its the best for the price i love the color will order more
i wanted a case that was minimal but protective , and this is exactly that i was most attracted to the color , which looks great on my macbook air also , as far as comfort , the rubberized texture allows a good grip overall , great product at a good price
shipped quickly , fits great the only thing is that the top piece has weird little squares near edges they are n't <unk> or anything and look like they should rub off but they do n't that 's sort of annoying since they are n't visible in the picture
this case fit perfectly and has stayed on my air for over a year one tiny piece of plastic that locks the computer into place near the top left of the keyboard broke off at some point , but it has n't affected the functionality whatsoever the foam feet on the bottom have worn , but they 're still doing their job my one big gripe is that this thing is a fingerprint magnet the best way to clean it is to take a softer cloth -lrb- but one that still has some <unk> -rrb- and wash it with a little bit of dish soap then , after you wipe it clean with the rag , use a microfiber cloth to dry it comes out looking perfectly new
the item does clip onto the ibook air nicely it provides the desired laptop protection however , i bought this in particular to protect my bare legs from the cold aluminum , but then i found a downside as is all too common with products , i had to modify this one slightly to make it more human friendly i had to use a fingernail file to remove those rather pointy little corners off all those places where the case pokes into a bare leg that meant around the connectors , and it seems like a couple of other locations , i filed off pointy mold releases , or rounded corners to make it more comfortable against my skin now it 's better , but not perfect overall , i am satisfied , so the kuzy case will stay on the air
i love it perfect fit , and you can still see the apple lit on the outside the color could be a bit brighter , it leans more to a & # # ; rose & # # ; color it does the job & makes my mac look girly too
this case is very nice it was very easy to hook on , the only problem is after about a week , the case became scratched on the rounded bottom parts the only place i keep my computer is on the table or shelf , so these are very easily <unk> otherwise , the case has held up well
the case was a little more difficult to put on than the speck brand the black rubber feet were not attached at the factory in the exact center of the foot pad circle there are visible rectangular indents -lrb- not present on the speck brand -rrb- the black rubber feet are thicker than on the speck case , causing the device to sit higher on the table there are also air vent slots cut into the bottom of this case that are absent on the speck case but since the feet are solid , it is unlikely for water spills to <unk> up into the case , where the speck case has feet that allow water spills to <unk> up into the case these vents may allow for better cooling , as the aluminum case is also a <unk> also the back -lrb- rear -rrb- of the bottom half of this shell does not cover the corners as well as the speck brand bottom line : this will provide good protection at a really good price if you do n't mind the -lrb- slightly -rrb- inferior visual appeal
fits the macbook air released in summer # just fine does n't block any hinges , ports , etc . has vents on the bottom and little feet fair for the price it does n't lie flush against the apple icon on the cover so it gives a soft ` blur ' effect to the apple , fyi
the only reason i am rating it # , instead of # , is it was really hard to snap the bottom piece on one side i 'm still not sure it 's snapped all the way it does feel secure when i carry it love the color , love the protection
does what it says its supposed to do i was worried of scratching the bottom of the laptop from constantly moving it back and forth from my desk at work this product <unk> the issue still pretty light and relatively easy to install i do n't have doubts about the product
i really love the color and it could n't have been easier to snap on i thought it was going to be more like a rubber texture but it 's a plastic with a very soft feel it did n't add any weight or thickness so overall i 'm very pleased the only negative is it seems to attract dust and dirt so with two young children i 'm constantly cleaning it
the case itself is made out of a rubberized plastic that is perfect for protecting your macbook and has a very nice feel to it the apple logo glows nicely through the case , and it has rubber feet to keep it from sliding around on whatever surface you have it on the case holds up very well , and does n't easily show scratches the only real issue i have with it is the fit of the case overall , it snapped into place with a bit of work , but there are # tabs on the front bottom and one tab on the bottom side that just refuse to stay snapped in place not a huge deal , as the case is staying on with no problems , but if you have ocd about stuff like that , it might be something you want to consider before buying this case overall , it 's a good case , and if i had another macbook to protect , i would probably buy this same case
the quality is great and it does n't take away from the functionality it was easy to install , feels great to the touch and gives it a good layer of protection if accidental falls happen i like that it does n't truly take away from the design of the mba , but adds a bit of sleekness with the color choice -lrb- yeah , it enhances the apple logo -rrb- for the price and protection , it 's not bad -lrb- better than what you 'd have to pay if you bought something similar at apple 's store -rrb- it is a smudge magnet , but not major or a deal-breaker i like it and would recommend this case -lrb- especially the price via amazon <unk> s & h -rrb-
i love this cover it protected my mac air from what could have been a <unk> coffee spill it kept most of the coffee away from my computer i still had to remove it and wipe down the laptop , but it did what it was supposed to do the pink color is nice and i really like the soft feel it helps grip the laptop the only downside of the cover is the added weight to the laptop macbook air is a very light laptop i hate adding weight to it that said , i am glad i did
having owned a few macbooks , i 've had my share of macs with little dents in them i always <unk> at paying $ # at the apple store for a shell , but after my wife dropped her macbook with a shell on it , the fact it lived changed my mind finding a one here for $ # made the purchase an easy decision the shell arrived in two days -lrb- thanks , prime ! -rrb- and installation was a snap ... literally the pictures accurately <unk> the shade of blue for this particular case it looks spectacular , is lightweight , and has vents to keep your computer cool i took one star off because the tabs at the top show through a little bit on the back of the screen it 's a minor annoyance , but not enough to make me want to send it back
i really do like this case a lot , but have recently run into an annoyance in which the rubber feet at the bottom of the case constantly fall off they 're essentially stickers , making them easy to be removed i 've lost one of them after pushing my laptop across the table however , it protects my computer and does its job i would probably buy another case
i recently got a macbook air # inch , so i decided to <unk> it with a case and a sleeve this was the case that i bought , and it 's quite amazing i like it it 's kinda rubbery -lrb- barely -rrb- , so it 's non-slip the apple logo is n't <unk> as brightly , which i like - non-slip <unk> to put <unk> -lrb- not loose - covers the microphone holes on the left side of the <unk> up , you need to put down quite hard to clip the case on , so do n't be afraid you 'll break the laptop
received my -lrb- tiffany -rrb- blue kuzy in the mail today -lrb- earlier than expected i might add -rrb- my previous cover -lrb- from another maker -rrb- had a slick bottom once the clips broke , it was hard to hold onto this new one has # pads on the bottom to elevate it and allow ventilation i am also hoping the ventilation slits on the bottom will allow more airflow than the previous cover so far , extremely happy
i really like the simplicity and protection this case offer , versus the $ # dollar apple store speck case the case conforms tightly to the body of the case and even has a cutout for the mic holes on the left side of these new macbook air the only thing preventing this case from a five star review is that for some reason the rubber <unk> <unk> on the underside of this case <unk> like a <unk> i am not sure what kind of material it is made from but it has not stop shedding its like some sort of living rubber animal that keeps shedding this weird clear material that looks like dead skin maybe just my case still a nice case besides this shedding rubber
the fit and material is good my only minor issue is that there is some flex on the case if you touch it on the lid 's sides other than that great , thanks
i received this hard case cover fr amazon <unk> short time and in good condition it was packed real well the cover was in two pieces one for the front and one piece for the back each item went on with little effort and with a good snug fit you <unk> have to worry about it . coming off when using your lap top they can be taken off with effort and go back on really good they offer god protection the color -lrb- black -rrb- looks good
i 'm quite happy with this product - i wanted a cheap , nice cover that would protect my computer , and that 's what i got it has a really awesome , smooth texture and the color -lrb- orange -rrb- is wonderful and bright it does fit my computer , but also sometimes unclips a little bit , and i have to press it back on the case is already getting dirty after about a month , but i do n't mind because it 's cheap enough that i can just get a new one in a few months or a year overall , i 'm satisfied and think it 's a good product - just do n't expect it to be of the highest quality
i ordered the `` black `` version of this product and i 'm very happy with it it 's simple , it protects the finish of your macbook air and it is see through so you can still see the cool lit apple on the back of the display it provides minimal protection , but that 's all i require , as i treat my macbook air as if it 's a new <unk> baby my only issue is the cost of this product my opinion , this is a $ # . # product at best i paid $ # and that 's why i 'm choosing to give it # stars
i am very happy with the fit & added protection this case gives , but be warned it attracts fingerprints like mad they wipe off with a damp towel , but they definitely take away from the & # # ; nice & # # ; look
this is a great case it is tough and the finish is great on it it has just the right shade of translucency and everything to see the apple through it it is hard to get the top part off , but it has plenty of snaps in all the right places to keep it from falling off if a snap breaks , the others pull through and keep the case on perfectly i do miss the feet on the ipearl case though , which is the one reason this is n't a # star review
i 've had this case for just under six months and i love it it 's a gorgeous shade of tiffany blue and the texture is soft and smooth it 's very lightweight and does n't take away from the sleek feel of the laptop the only complaint is that the bottom will pop off occasionally in the front , however it snaps right back on with no issue definitely good for the price
it 's very sturdy and light and compliments the macbook air perfectly i would recommend this for a great case price compared to the one at the apple store was cheaper
i just got my red kuzy case for my # `` macbook air last week and i love it so far it 's a really nice red color and fits perfectly on my mb air and the texture feels so smooth it does n't feel cheap like those other hardshell plastic cases this one has a slightly rubbery feel , yet it 's still smooth enough that <unk> does n't stick to it i 've only had it for a week so i can not comment on the durability , but so far so good and it 's only half the price of the ones sold at the apple store !
i love the color , and that the logo shines through the back , it has lots of space for ventilation so your computer does n't over heat , and my computer feel very secure .
has worked out fantastic as a protective case for my macbook air snaps on snugly has a smooth , <unk> finish , that 's soft to touch looks sleek -lrb- i ordered black -rrb- , and the macbook apple logo shines through the front finger prints can be noticeable on the case cover - easily <unk> though
i just got my kuzy case this morning and i love it so far i read a lot of reviews before i bought it and a lot of them warned to make sure you put the case on the right way when you receive it , the top is a little confusing there are three little tabs or spaces that go in the front of the case and the side with two goes in the back i was able to put it on right the first time due to reading the reviews , but it seems like everyone else had a rough time if they put it on the wrong way one thing that would be nice would be some sort of direction from kuzy on which way the case should be oriented all in all , i love the feel of the case and i love that it wo n't just slide off a desk if it gets knocked off it is exactly what i expected and i am happy with it so far
first , i love the color no matter where i set my computer , i can easily spot it from across the room it also very attractively provides the protection i needed
i ordered this tuesday and got it thursday ! i was so excited it came so soon lots of people commented on the case not going on properly , but mine snapped on quick and easy i got the blue , and it 's very classy , i love the apple logo shining through , not as tacky as a cut out so far it 's been great stays on and keeps my laptop protected i definitely recommend this product and company i will do another review of this in a little while , because a couple days can only tell you so much
as a previous owner of speck and incase hard cases for a macbook pro , this case is at least as well designed if not better designed than the prior two the materials are sturdy , the installation was easy , and it seems as if it will last the life of the laptop -lrb- hopefully -rrb- very impressed with the product and glad i could save quite a bit over the cost of the other hard cases
i bought this cover for my macbook air # inch purchased in october # as soon as i got it , i snapped it on and it 's stayed on since i ordered the purple cover and it looks just as advertised it also fits perfectly the cover feels slightly velvety and has rubber feet on the bottom i 'm not concerned about it slipping out of my grasp or off of a table top i would buy another one of these covers in the future
the fit is perfect i 've been looking for a case in this exact color , it is light , bright , and beautiful i 've had it for a couple of months now and it is still in excellent condition thank you kuzy
everyone who has seen my computer -lrb- i work at a school with # 's of people there -rrb- remarks on the color and how cheerful it looks for me , the conservative gray of macbook air gets a <unk> <unk> on its outside with the case i 'm very pleased with how easily this fits on the computer and how well it protects the computer functional and decorative -- it 's a purchase i 'd make again and recommend to anyone who asks
or should i say , exactly what my mbair needs durable , perfect fit , with a wonderful feel to the case ... and for much less than what the bigger brands would charge
this cover looks great and fits perfectly on my macbook air it has a soft feel and it will do a great job in protecting laptop external surface kuzy also provided outstanding customer service and i will order from them every time if they have what i need
this cover is perfect it fits so well and makes the aluminum macbook air look even more luxurious the matte black finish is perfect for any laptop sleeve i would definitely recommend this to anyone interested in a macbook air cover
i ordered this for my new macbook air -lrb- mid # version -rrb- and i was n't sure if it would fit but it fits like a glove it was so easy to put on ; i had it on in < # min its color is also true to its description it does n't add much weight and i feel like it offers the protection i wanted i had a similar cover on my old macbook pro and it would n't open all the way , but this cover does not <unk> the motion of the screen i love it & could n't be happier
we have used it for a couple of months now and it has done the job looks nice and locked on easily when we first put it on
i was a little hesitant to buy this case at first but after reviewing all the other similar cases out there and doing a comparison , this one was the best value for the money not to mention the case looks really sharp and feels perfect to the touch its not too slippery and easy to grab a hold of i highly recommend this case if you are looking to protect your mac air ... and for the price , its really hard to beat
