i bought this case for my air # `` i really liked it ! first , the design is nice and clean second , it serves as a perfect protection for my air it 's in good quality , very sturdy inside i am not sure what it is made of but it feels safe even you accidentally drop your laptop i will recommend anyone who is looking for a good case for macbook air
this case smells so strongly of chemicals i ca n't keep it in the room , let alone use it and do n't be fooled - this is too large for the new macbook air # `` - with extra space on the sides and top i will most likely be tossing this case and looking for another
this product is too big for an # . # macbook air - there 's a good inch plus of extra space at the top so it slides back and forth constantly within the sleeve it also appears too wide , so the laptop does not fit snuggly in that department either like the other reviewers said , the smell is pretty bad but i expect that to go away soon enough the pocket for the charger is nice , but i 'd rather have a snugger fitting sleeve
roocase neoprene netbook sleeve case cover provides a good protection for my macair # inch which fits in it perfectly however it has been with me for more than # weeks but it still smells terribly
this is our second purchase of this same product price , fabric , and padding are nice zipper broke early on the first one we decided to give this product a second chance because we liked everything other than the zipper
in spite of the title for this item , i have found it to serve as a perfect travel carrying case for # `` tablets the extra room in the main pocket allows a tablet already in a case -lrb- like a <unk> style holder -rrb- to be inserted , thus <unk> from the protection that the neoprene provides then the exterior pocket is suitable for storing headphones , micro sd cards , power adapters , or other tablet accessories the case does smell strongly of neoprene when it arrives , but after a few days in the open air , the scent <unk> and is then quite unobtrusive for the price , it provides a great additional layer of protection and convenience when traveling with a # `` tablet
i expected a good neoprene sleeve as i 've had in the past for other size computers this one is well made and the zippered outer pocket is the right size for the power brick and cord so i do n't need to pack those in a separate container any more this <unk> packing for trips longer than a few hours when the cord is needed i am delighted the color with the piping in an other color is an attractive touch too i expected a fine product but i got something even better than that
this product is obviously an excellent item it 's extremely well made , and sturdy , and would undoubtedly <unk> a laptop for a very long time however , the dimensions shown on this page are not correct i ordered this item through vine because the product description on this page says the cover was `` originally designed for mac `` but is actually # . # inches wide -- precisely what i could use alas , not so the item is not as described it is # . # inches wide , and indeed made solely for a mac book pro , as it says right on the package i do n't own a mac book and do not intend to buy one this one is going into my gift closet for future use
it 's not often that i need to take my macbook out of the house , but for those occasions when i do , this zippered sleeve fits the bill my macbook is able to fit nicely in this case with enough room for a folder the front pockets have enough stretch to accommodate the laptop 's charger i like this sleeve , but i ca n't say that i love it i would like it better if the front pockets had velcro or something on them that would allow them to be fastened shut a carry strap on the sleeve would be nice , but it 's not essential i like that the sleeve protects my laptop from scratches when it 's placed in a bag it seems like a nice quality product that is well made
the product description says new , which is what i thought i was paying for i have an incase case for my own macbook pro , and was looking to buy one for my sister and father after receiving the case in the mail today , i was a little concerned with the packaging it looked like a toddler had been assigned to ` <unk> ' the product upon inspecting the case , it is cracked on one edge to say the least i am disappointed i could have saved time and simply bought one in-store new
the only downside to the case is that it creates more friction on my <unk> room table -lrb- with <unk> -rrb- i bought it for protection , but really to make sure i can spot it coming out of the x-ray machine at the airport -lrb- almost picked up someone <unk> macbook before i got it -rrb-
this is a great way to protect a macbook , but the only flaw i saw it have was because the finish was matte , it would peel away and show the glossy underside it looked a little funny on the corners because of this , but overall does the job
the case fits my macbook pro # & # # ; -lrb- w/out retina display - year # -rrb- it has a nice feel to it with the soft stuff on it -lrb- i do n't know what it is called -rrb- i do see a lot of finger prints though but i think that will happen with whatever case you have sometimes i feel like the bottom is coming off a little bit , considering it only has two little tabs to keep it on it is understandable previously having a speck case on my macbook , the incase bottom does n't stay on as well as the speck one did the color is more <unk> than i thought it would be i expected it to be more of a purple but it is still a nice color overall i am happy with the product but if i were to buy another one i think i would go back to the speck brand
this case fits the late in the year models macbook pro # i was worried it would n't fit my cool magsafe plug , but it does incase is a great company they have sturdy iphone cases , so i am <unk> this mac case will hold up well
i just dropped my macbook pro off a wall , for it to fall # . # meters and smash hard onto a solid concrete floor <unk> , i ran to it fearing the worst , broken screen at the very least not a single scratch this is an amazing product i would have been <unk> if it had been broken i 've just ran some internal tests and everything is operational and working well as usual without this case , i would now have a very expensive broken laptop for certain it looks and feels good and will give you the protection you need i do n't ever recommend things or write reviews , but i would advise anyone reading this to buy this case im delighted with it now
the & # # ; clear & # # ; cover was not completely clear it had & # # ; squares & # # ; on each corner it looked like someone had put pieces of clear packing tape on each corner -lrb- but it was n't tape -rrb- the top piece also rubbed on the bottom piece when opening it made a <unk> , cracking sound i returned it
its ok for the price but in the end i will end up buying a different case i would recommend just paying a little more and get something with some
i bought this as my second case for my # inc mac book i go to school so i use it everyday at first i thought oh this looks nice fits well , no problems then i started noticing the right side kept falling off the clip that attaches like a latch to the keyboard side was barely visible it had n't broke just was n't manufactured well there is nothing i can do now about it does protect the computer pretty well
but dont buy hard cases because now my laptop is broken . everytime i opened it , the mac cracked a little and now the back of my computer is messed up the hinges are loose
for some reason i had a difficult time trying to place on the bottom and/or the top part of the cover on my computer ! it was just a little bit too small ! very frustrating
there are # visible rectangles where the top piece was fused together pretty obvious , since its crystal clear laptop ca n't be opened all the way since the top and bottom pieces get caught at the laptop 's hinge speck 's is better
not a bad case at all , snaps right onto my computer and i 've never taken it off you can personalize it by adding stickers or <unk> or gluing <unk> to it without messing up your computer
i 've had this case over a month and the biggest drawback is that it shows scratches a lot but better the case than my computer it does make that small clicking noise when you open it up as other reviews have mentioned but that doesnt really bother me at all has protected my computer well and fits great without adding a ton of bulk which was the main goal so i am happy with the purchase i also like the padding on the bottom which elevates the laptop to help with overheating
i have a late # macbook pro # ' & this case fits perfectly on it i just wish it was easier to remove i had a rough time removing the top piece & it also makes a small clicking noise whenever i open my laptop , but all in all it 's protecting my laptop nonetheless & the price could n't be beat
i needed this case really quick ! ! just got a macbook and needed a case by <unk> . . i did n't want to pay # bucks for a case ordered it on monday , got it on tuesday cons : makes a slight noise when i open the lid , not really a big deal ... . pros : protects <unk> easy to <unk> n't add major bulk to my <unk> would consider buying another case i 'll give it a week and come back with an update
i liked this product because i recently got stickers , and it works well with the case it makes my whole laptop look shiny and nice the reason i gave it a # though , is although i like it it 's uncomfortable to put on the laptop sometimes
this was the second case i bought for my laptop after my last one -lrb- not this brand -rrb- broke i like how it is clear , so it does not take away from the computer that you spend a ton of money on i bought this product # years ago and it is still going strong with no cracks it is easy to take off and clean , and really protects your computer i would recommend this for any college student
the greatest thing i bought for my daughters computer kids lover stickers on their laptops and this keeps it clean and she was able to dress up the cover instead
although it does n't have instructions is was very easy to pop on my laptop it seems to be very durable , better than speck , and very sleek the packaging was very detailed , the box almost appeared like an apple design and the case was wrapped twice to ensure that no scratches would be put on the case in transit very pleased with this case and actually expected less than it was for the price , will definitely be purchasing from them again if need be , highly recommend
this case is exactly what i wanted it has a low profile and so it does not increase the dimensions of my laptop - important because i also use a carrying case of <unk> it snaps right on and stays put - keeping the appearance of my mac while protecting it and it <unk> <unk> very well and is itself easy to keep clean i 'm entirely satisfied
macbooks are a joy to own now it 's time to protect your long term investment this case does it perfectly i was so happy with this case , i got one for my wife 's new mac air one month later this is a must have for our rather pricey notebook investment
hi all , here is my view on this product it 's just awesome and price is great i suggest you its better to buy from here and the same product is $ # @ store and here its cheap and same quality
i just received this item today and love it it fits perfectly to the macbook pro # inch i highly recommend purchasing this item if you are looking for a case for your macbook
excellent quality , easy application and does not add weight protection is there but does not change the appearance of my laptop does not make the laptop heat up during use good heat <unk>
i bought this case in may and when it came it was very good it not only was comfortable but it was also very thin and practical i have had it for # months and i only used it for one i picked it up one day and suddenly the stitching of the fabric loop came out i took the strap off and used it the entire day but when i unzipped it for the first time one of the zips came off the other zip worked for about # hours until it came off too rendering the entire bag useless i thought this product would be better quality as it was made by samsonite , but one flaw resulted into the entire bag rendering useless i would never buy this product again as its design is wired though the fabric straps and the stitching is loose and not
the bag serves its purpose and can fit the mouse keyboard charger with my # inch air but do n't mistake this for protection dropped the bag once and the corner of the air is slightly dented they could of put more padding in there so it 's a # out of
maybe it will improve with airing out , i do n't know <unk> fit for # -inch macbook air good padding on both sides while adding minimum bulk to the laptop <unk> you have sensitive <unk> <unk> , this bag is n't for you padding is minimal -lrb- if that -rrb- along the seams , so its ability to buffer the corners and edges of the laptop are suspect
overall like the bag although the handle is a bit awkward when using as a sleeve note on the # rd day after purchasing this , the zipper handle fell off most retailers will not support you past # days and samsonite 's # year warranty means you take it to one of their few repair <unk> for me this means a # hour drive unless you have a repair center near you , the low cost of this bag makes repairing it <unk> , rendering the warranty useless for all <unk> and purposes
after many disappointments , took a chance on this bag main strength is it is extremely light and will fit your # inch -lrb- sony vaio z -rrb- and give it reasonable protection for everyday carrying if you have a light laptop and do n't want a heavy bag -lrb- ! -rrb- this may be it will carry power supply and cords as well but <unk> the zip pocket out a bit main weakness is relatively thin strap -lrb- one star off -rrb- with a nice pad put on my booq strap and am good to go interesting detail is the rubber dots at the base -- i often clutch the base of my bag so this was a neat touch decent price and nice cosmetics -- try the <unk>
nice product -- serves it 's purpose well my # & # # ; macbook air fits nicely , and the pocket for accessories is useful it also has a shoulder strap for those who want to carry it on their shoulder
i have a # inch mac book air laptop and this is wonderful i can use it along with my back pack for school and not feel like i need a sherpa to haul my bags around it was well work the price and i am very happy with it
the case got here in a matter of days and it was better than what i expected it 's soft , but not so soft to where your case is n't protected it holds my numerous wires that i use with my laptop as well as my laptop would buy from them again
at first i thought i would return it because it literally only holds my # ' macbook pro , # notepad next to the laptop , and some pens , charger , and a headphone in the side pocket but , it is actually great it is very light , forces me to keep my bag relatively empty , and really allows me to carry everything i need -lrb- as i study for the bar -rrb-
i bought this item as it 's extremely light and soft , and it comes exactly as i expected although its quiet small i can still fit in all the charges , mouses and misc stuff
offers compact , lightweight protection for my hp elitebook # laptop , room for cables and power supply in the side pocket -lrb- if you do n't mind the inevitable <unk> -rrb- handles and detachable shoulder strap are major pluses compared to many neoprene cases that do n't offer those <unk>
holds my macbook great and compact , nice handles and i love the extra zipper slot ! excellent product ! : -rrb- i would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a computer case :
bought this for my macbook air the size is perfect ; case is well padded without being bulky it smelled of rubber when i first unpacked it but i hung it on the back of a chair for a few days and the odor completely dissipated this was a great buy
i bought this shuttle bag so i can use it while i 'm traveling , without the need to carry my bigger bag i have a macbook pro # ' retina , and this bag fits perfectly it also have enough room in the external compartment to carry my mouse , charger and wallet the material is well made , and the shoulder strap is a wonderful bonus
i added a few items including a laptop , # page book , mouse , laptop charger , cell phone charger and a hard drive and the bag already looks bulky the front <unk> not close really well because of the bulk it has also become heavy to carry i am not at all impressed with it and am already looking for another
the bag is of good quality but the padded compartment is too small for my laptop there is sufficient thickness to the rest of the bag that i can put me computer in the larger area and just use the padded part for file storage i was disappointed though
i was looking for a nice comfortable laptop bag to lug around my heavy laptop this is perfect - very compact and fits my # `` laptop like a glove it 's not bulky nor does it dig into my shoulder plus it 's very fashionable
this bag is perfect for me it 's professional and serves my purpose my laptop fits perfect in it and i am able to store a calculator , pins , business cards , etc . great item !
honestly , i searched and searched for a computer bag that was the right size , fit , and comfort i ordered a few others and was about to lose hope that i would find the right one i saw this one and decided to give it a try my laptop fits perfectly , and there is also a pocket for my paperwork , as well as two smaller front zippered pockets for pens , wallet , and whatever else i need to carry the strap is very comfortable on my shoulder . and i love the style also the front of the messenger has velcro , which is a plus no buckle to fight with when you want to open it quickly all around i give this back a <unk> a + ! ! ! ! ! !
i love this bag and got a lot of <unk> on it it 's light weight and fits my # & # # ; laptop the # extra compartments outside are great for wallets and keys and there is plenty of room for additional notebooks and paper the strap is padded so it does n't hurt my shoulders and i like the velcro closure for quick and easy access overall , i am happy with my purchase and recommend it to others
i purchased this for my college-age daughter who uses it for school and an office job it is a nice looking , well-made bag the <unk> design looks both stylish for class and professional for work my daughter says her mac air fits perfectly inside , and is protected well she also likes all the pockets , and that it 's a crossbody style which is comfortable and practical
i bought this to use as a briefcase for work , and not to carry a laptop i work from home part of the week and there is plenty of room in this bag for me to bring the files i need back and forth to the office the <unk> on the front is even cuter in person and i love the corduroy lining on the inside of the flap i would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a <unk> priced bag
this bag is pretty cool nice design pattern , my wife loved it the padding on the shoulder strap is very comfortable with heavy load in the bad the material used to make the bag seems to be of good quality i also like the overall design of the bag , as it tends to hold a little bit more that the regular laptop bag my wife is very happy
i bought this thinking it 'll fit fine for my # . # & # # ; ultrabook or my # & # # ; regular sized laptop this sleeve is about # . # inches too long and # . # inches too wide for my # & # # ; laptop this can easily fit a # & # # ; without issues if you are looking for a sleeve that fits snugly for a # & # # ; laptop , i recommend looking elsewhere if however you want to store other things with it , this may work fine for you personally , i do n't keep anything else inside to avoid damaging the laptop and i did not expect so much slack for a # & # # ; laptop it 's so big that it does n't really fit in my medium sized timbuk # messenger bag
it is a sturdy product - i like it for the <unk> the sleeve is bigger and as a result the laptop does n't fit in the sleeve the way it should
it is a great deal for $ # , but too big for a # . # inch laptop . when i leave the packing foam in the sleeve , the laptop does not slide around
i gave it a # stars because the sleeve is a little big for my laptop but nonetheless the shipment was super fast i could n't believe my eyes that it got here so , i 'm going to order another sleeve as well for the # . # that i have at home
great sleeve , wanted something small to carry on the plane with works great and fits my t # laptop even with the # cell battery sticking out very good and cheap
i do n't really think this purse lives up to it 's advertising it is just a cheap purse with a lot of compartments i have seen the same purse in the junk catalogs that i get for a lot less money however , i decided to keep it because i do like a lot of compartments and pockets , but i wo n't use it when i am carrying
when we saw the photo and description of this purse , it appeared that we were ordering an exact duplicate of a purse we purchased a couple of years ago , which now has a broken zipper the photo on amazon shows a side compartment for a cell phone and the written description promises one we wanted a cell phone compartment , and it was one of the primary reasons we chose this particular purse when the purse arrived and did not have a cell phone compartment , the only option that was <unk> was to return it for a refund since we liked the purse and its quality , we contacted roma , the manufacturer and asked for a replacement or a discount because the purse was not as described roma said that they had sold to a second party and were not responsible for making good on the promises in the ad with amazon providing only the option of returning the purse , we were forced to accept a purse that was not as described or return a purse that was otherwise just what we needed though the purse quality and price are acceptable , we would not order from roma again , either directly or via amazon someone along the line needs to take responsibility for updating photos and descriptions
i really love the <unk> of this purse i thought it wore well however , after just over one year , i had trouble with my zipper i contacted the company and sent pictures of it they requested they said to send it back for repair or replacement they sent it back `` repaired `` but it did n't last two days they also sent a note stating that they repaired it `` this time `` but they considered a zipper part of normal wear and tear i was very disappointed that they did n't stand by their product
its okay , but is way to heavy for everyday carrying beautifully made and just what it says it is if you have nothing against carrying something a little heavy , then its for you
this purse is hands down superior to the two purses i previously owned by gun toting <unk> that fell apart in short order this one is holding up well and looks very nice the gun compartment is a little snug , but it works for my # special one drawback is the fact the gun compartment only works on one end , so plan ahead as to how you carry it or you might be hunting for the zipper i love all the compartments which makes things easier to find overall , i would say this purse is good value
best purse i have ever owned it works great for carrying as it is n't noticeable at all it is great for all occasions as they stated i am still using the # st one i ordered and ordered another as i was so happy with the first one thanks for the great purse and customer
see how the picture shows the strap on the outside well that 's not how you get it there is no outside strap , only handles that are on the inside so you have to pull them out and leave the bag partially unzipped to carry it
i liked the look of this bag - it 's about time they came out with girl laptop cases it did fit my # `` dell nicely two drawbacks : no pocket for accessories and the zipper broke after # weeks
this case was not as expected the bag did n't have much support i can say the design and the light weight of the bag was good , but without the structure and support to protect my lap top i had to send it back
my fiance bought this and only had it maybe a week and the handle broke on it already the only thing in the bag was her computer . . she is very unhappy !
this item is ok , but i should 've read the description closer it 's very thin and there is no padding to protect the laptop at all it will be fine if you carry it in a padded bag or backpack key word in description is & # # ; sleeve & # # ; other than that it is a cute bag
my bf who bought this for me had it a week now it looks better and brighter on the screen , as are most items for sale the quality so far is okay , does what it is supposed to <unk> the straps / side clips for straps / zippers for fault will update in about # weeks
the bag is very beautiful , and i loved it when i got it but my strap broke within # weeks luckily there are handle straps but i wonder if they will break as well
i bought this case to carry my laptop from place to place it works great for that purpose it 's thick and has two different handles a removable shoulder strap and if you unzip the zipper a little there are smaller hand straps
love this bag with butterflies , bought it for my daughter for her birthday , but it turns out she do n't need it anymore , as she is no longer doing the <unk> to own thing for her laptop very pretty bag , so instead of returning it , i will just keep it for myself or give away as a gift
such a nice bag its so much easier to carry my laptop now i had the larger heavier type of bag but gave it to my fiance for something a little less heavy and more lady like lol i really enjoy it
love the design ca n't beat the price i was really looking for a more upscale , professional bag , but with most of them costing like luggage i just was n't happy with what i was finding in a # & # # ; most said & # # ; up to # & # # ; or some such which was n't real comforting , i wanted it to really fit , not just <unk> of fit do n't know what the long term will be , but for now it 's fine
this is not worth the money spent we had to struggle to get this on in that struggle we must have weakened one of the clips on the bottom cover so that it never really `` held `` on to the mac very well the top never was snug to begin with but better than the bottom after # . # months , one of the clips is completely gone and the bottom cover is falling off and the top piece is <unk> about we are looking for a replacement hope the more expensive options last longer that a few of these cheap , useless options
tried to save some money and bought this , the positive reviews had convinced me this thing is awful and cheap the top does not clip on , i have tried everything on earth the rubber circles on the bottom fell off the third or fourth day of using it please dont ' waste your money on this
poor material , poor fit and finish should have sprung for the extra money to buy the name brand you get what you pay for , in this case very little
this is a pretty cheap product the top half would n't even stay on properly so i just tossed it and kept the bottom the bottom fits decently enough and does n't cause the machine to overheat i left this purchase wondering whether i even improved the protection of my computer or not consider something else
the case at first appearance fits properly and looks fine ... upon opening fully the top and bottom creek because they rub together not worth $ # i would return but the $ # return shipping cost is ridiculous i will be looking for a different case in the near future like i said look somewhere else for even the cheapest of cases
tried to get this thing to cover the bottom cover of the notebook ; it just does n't work seems to provide ample coverage for the rest of the device but i wish i 'd sprung for one of the overpriced name brand cases perhaps that extra # bucks would have bought me more piece of mind for my daughter 's computer
all of these type of cases look very similar in the pictures in reality , the bottom of this case is very bulky i am currently still using the top , but the bottom came off after # hours and i have n't ever wanted to put it back on
i would consider this a design flaw overall , it seems well built , but the laptop screen will only tilt back slightly past # degrees -lrb- not the full range of motion of the laptop hinge -rrb- this is frustrating because it 's a bit of a poor viewing angle unless you are sitting at a really tall desk the pop-out feet are basically pointless since the laptop screen would be facing toward your <unk> if you used them i wo n't return it because it 's not worth it , but i 'll probably give it away and get a different case there are probably better ones out there
currently , this case seems overpriced it is listed for $ # . # , but definitely not worth that much the top of the case looks really nice but the bottom is kind of iffy looking and the two legs are a bit awkward to use i ended up just using the top , and i never use the other , bottom half
serves the purpose -lrb- to protect from scratching -rrb- looks smart and priced significantly less than what apple wants for the full <unk> but then the apple version also offers some additional protection -lrb- bumps , etc . . some fit issues -lrb- rubs when opening -rrb- but other than that i am
nice , thin protection for the macbook air not the sturdiest material , but it was reasonably priced -lrb- and i bought it to replace a much more expensive & # # ; name brand & # # ; cover that cracked . . i like the flip up legs in the back they are a little flimsy feeling , but so far no problems great cover at a good price it is a tad slippery , but that might be that i am used to my former cover , which had a slight rubbery feel this one is smooth plastic
i bought two covers from ipearl , one is for my mba and another is for mbp the cover for mbp snaps easily , but the quality does n't seem as good as the other one however , it is very difficult to attach the front cover on my macbook air , if you could just make it # mm larger it would be good when i do install it successfully , it looks really pretty
the fit is great i was skeptical at first . but at least it is protecting my macbook from <unk> and scuffs from around the house . only time will tell , but for now , it works
just received this today and so far so good it takes a bit of work to get the top part on the computer but the rest just snaps on easily i love that its transparent enough that the apple logo shines through the case when lit up it looks really nice on and i 'm glad i finally have something to protect my macbook from scratches i would recommend this product to a friend
i find the case to be a little bit heavier then i originally thought and it does limit how far back the screen can travel but it offers good protection and it works well i 've dropped my laptop from pretty high up and normally this has dented the aluminum but the plastic has absorbed the impact and protected my laptop well
i like this cover it makes the mac a bit discreet , which i like when it 's on you can see the logo a bit through the plastic cover , but it 's not obnoxious protects the outside from scratches , but this is not a case built for dropping your computer it 's not that sturdy
this hard cover fits perfectly in my macbook air # & # # ; this is the third hard cover that i buy from this manufacturer , and i can say they are of great quality the first two were for two macbook pro 's . these covers have folding legs and many vents in the inferior cover , so over heating is not a problem at least i do not have that problem i gave # stars this time , because this only time the cover came with an & # # ; extra & # # ; hole on the right side of the inferior cover there is a small hole that , i guess , was made by accident it looks random it does not compromise the overall quality or performance of the product , but is ugly i recommend this product :
i like this case a lot ... my macbookair fell about # feet while in this case and one of the tiny clasp that keeps the case attached broke case still <unk> to the mac and i suppose that 's what case are supposed to do
i like the bottom pieces to engage the <unk> that props the computer up the finish is nice and the apple light still shines through the back i 've had the case on for a few months now and it is still <unk> and looks very nice
surprising how something with such a slim profile can make you feel safe handling this expensive piece of equipment it took a little thought to insure it was clicked in properly but once done , it 's like wearing a good down jacket on a cold day . you feel perfect
slightly difficult to install as the tabs that secure around the bezel and body are very very small so small that i actually crushed one trying to install it still works great and stays in place
