it 's beautiful and perfect i would recommend it to anybody it 's cheap and really easy to use i have n't dropped it on the floor yet but so far i really enjoy it it looks exactly like it does in the picture , if not better ! i love this so much
i was skeptical about ordering the case because of some of the negative reviews but i ordered it any way because i needed something to protect my brand new late # macbook pro retina -lrb- a # -rrb- asap shipping was very fast i ordered on a saturday and it arrived on a wednesday i wish it would have been shipped in more protective packaging but my case arrived in good condition and with no scratches -lrb- it was wrapped with plastic to prevent surface scratches -rrb- so far the case appears to be of good quality for the low price that i purchased it for i ordered the neon yellow case and the color is exactly as i expected it to be based on the picture most importantly , this case actually fits the late # macbook pro retina perfectly kuzy far exceeded my expectations and depending on the durability of this case , i will be ordering more in different colors if you recently purchased the newest macbook pro and you 're looking for a case that fits , you 're in the right place
first time <unk> from amazon and im impress with this product item is not bad for the price , it fits perfect had no trouble installing it on my macbook pro # & # # ; retina , may consider <unk> different colors ! !
i like my gold case just fine , but i would not recommend the keyboard cover to anyone i only had mine about two weeks when the gold on the keyboard cover started to turn green my number keys are still gold but most every one of the letter keys have an ugly green <unk>
this is a good case - i love the color and it 's nice that it 's cheaper than some of the other covers out there , but i think there is a reason on the bottom case , there is a ridge that sticks up over the edge of the computer near the trackpad that is right underneath your wrists when you 're typing , and it 's annoying and kind of hurts i am on this thing all day long and now i am thinking of buying another case to avoid this otherwise , it fits and looks really good
cover is amazing , makes it a bit heavier and a bit hard to remove but looks amazing the key board cover was not good n got worn out in not even a week
the keyboard cover is already fading in the gold color -lrb- to a green ! like fool 's gold , haha ! but i have gotten soooo many compliments on the cover itself i am just <unk> with the cover it is so gorgeous and so unique , and it has a slight texture to it so it never shows scratches which i love i only gave it # stars because of the keyboard cover -- otherwise i would have given it #
came quickly and very well packed i get so many compliments on my laptop the cover is attractive and useful my laptop is finally protected and looks so good ! the price is unbeatable now i only wish it came in rose gold too ! !
i love my case the cover is n't quite as sheer as it looks in the picture , but you can barely see the apple logo through it the keyboard cover takes time to get used to but i like it better than others i 've tried i would definitely recommend it and buy it again
i 'd give it # stars if it had a flap or something to cover the exposed edge of the surface it fits best with no keyboard attached with the touch keyboard it 's a bit more snug than i 'd like , but it 's not a problem , and that might also improve after some <unk> time
i bought this on a whim because i needed some kind of sleeve for my new microsoft surface rt . this works really well and fits perfectly even with the <unk> i would have given it # stars if the leather was of higher quality : existing quality is not bad for the price
this product is pretty much what i expected it is as advertised and i would say it represents good value for money i would recommend it or buy another one , if i needed another
i used this with my surface pro with a type cover and it is great my only concern is that it leave the pen on the side exposed & offers a higher rate of getting lost the material is great as it does n't need much care the interior is soft too that you do n't have to fear of your surface getting scratched i will recommend this item
when i received this i really was not expecting too much because of the price but this is a great sleeve and my surface fits snug in this sleeve well worth the money added bonus is the extra pocket to put pens or cell phone
it 's precisely as it appears and is described : a near perfectly sized pouch for the rt and its touch cover honestly ca n't begin to say a poor word against this item it looks sophisticated , has a decent pouch for small items -lrb- mice , phones , small papers , etc . -rrb- , and provides another layer of protection for your tablet
very nice build and general feel the case is a bit snug on first use , but stretches some over a short period of time to make this a perfect fit i have the type keyboard / surface pro combo and both fit nicely in this case the pocket on the side is nice and is typically where i keep the stylus
i bought this as a case as a protective cover for my surface pro it fits perfectly the pouch is handy for the pen & my arc mouse good quality and decent looking
the case covers one of two stereo mic holes contacted moshi customer service , who said that i could ship it to them -lrb- at my own expense -rrb- , and they would send a replacement within # weeks
it developed cracks at corners of the bottom plate , within a week i am still using it # months later , the bottom plate is now slightly loose and one rubber feet came off i was very surprise with the quality
i guess that 's about it it 's a plastic cover that will protect your air it 's a bit pricey for a couple of sheets of plastic i do n't have anything to compare it to , nor do i have any major complaints it does it 's job
there are n't really any alternatives that come close to the thinness of the <unk> i love it except that the bottom portion 's sides often ` <unk> ' and will let dust/dirt in the top cover is great however , just wish the price was more around $ #
cover fits well the bottom piece is all & # # ; hard surface & # # ; though , and it will scratch anything you set the computer on im now using it with the bottom piece removed
i have an ipearl cover for my macbook air which i like a lot but tried a mosiso cover instead for my # inch macbook pro retina it was a poor fit so i returned it and went back to ipearl it 's great good fit and finish the only reason i only gave # stars is that unlike the mosiso there is little protection on the side of the macbook which leaves it a little exposed the macbook air case has this that said , this is a good cover which i can thoroughly recommend
i purchased this for my new macbook fits perfectly and i love the color i was surprised when the package arrived to also find a mcover and stylus was included for free
i was in doubt whether to buy this or not , so glad i did quality is a + + and the lower & # # ; legs & # # ; are so amazing , even more if you record music and have a <unk> controller below it
this is more affordable than most ipearl did a great job with this product it fit perfectly on my mac i recommend this case over other more expensive options like apple products , it just works :
i purchased this case after buying my sister one for christmas for her mac she loved hers and the fit was excellent so i knew just where to go the only thing i recommend , which everyone should do anyways , is read the reviews and specs to ensure it will fit your model mine was a mac pro with retina display , so the fit is different , but i would not trade it for any other cover the keys cover is interesting , i tried it a few times but just could n't get my fingers to slide across the keys fast enough while typing , but then again , my sister loves hers highly recommended , great price and excellent service
i was n't expecting more because of the high price , but i did rely on the seller 's description of what this case will do unfortunately it does n't work as described or even close to cases at half the price they claim # - and # -degree viewing angles , but only about an # -degree angle is available and the device easily topples over because the bottom of the case does n't fold flat even worse , the case extends over the screen edges too far to swipe the notification bar down another bad feature is the strap that holds the keyboard instead of strapping it in at the corners , there is a big strap from side to side right over the mouse pad , making it useless i do not recommend this for any tablet
i bought this case because it was <unk> advertised that the keyboard would fit in the case too yes , it did but i could n't use the keyboard while in the case i have returned it and hope to get a refund
adequate but not designed for the tf # this case is a generic case that works while docked only and is not suitable for protecting the pad only it appears clunky in comparison to others available
this looks nice , but does not provide any protection at all no padding and is too thin to protect a tablet ended up buying a gumdrop case as i was worried about my tablet in this leather case the gumdrop is much more protective , kind of like an otterbox for your tablet
looks great and is made <unk> material the only complaint is the strap which holds the keyboard covers the mousepad if that was fixed , i would have gave it # stars
i like the simplicity of the design and how it fits nice and snug i did n't like -lrb- after a while -rrb- that while propped up , the case only gave you about # <unk> of tilt it makes it difficult to handle while lying down or something but is easily remedied with a cushion it 's a good starter case and has great value for the price overall a good case but do n't expect all the <unk> of what a more expensive case can offer
i 'm retracting my earlier review because i was sent the wrong case it 's a nice case , especially if you are using the keyboard dock accessory with just the tablet alone , there is a bit of slack overall , this is a quality , <unk> case
this is the best case that i have found that fits the tf # with the keyboard my only complaint is the added bulk ... would love to see a gumdrop alternative or similar <unk> materials , as well
i love how it looks and feels everything fits nice the charging port access is a great feature the tablet face casing could fit a not more snuggly though but i do love how classy it looks and it is a great way to take my tablet with me wherever i go nice that it is made just for the transformer
i like all the <unk> this case especially the charging flap not only does it allow room for your charger as it should the opening is also big enough to accomodate the <unk> adapter from asus too there were # things that i was not thrilled about the finish on the case was great in all places but the strap that holds the keyboard down it was stiched at two different positions across each other so the strap did not stay on the keyboard evenly . it was always a little lower , ready to slip off on one side i guess it will do it is annoying though
nice quality case i have no complaints with it on the tablet only i do not have the dock yet so do not know how it works with that <unk> lines up perfect and all the ports are usable without removing tablet from case i have had the case for awhile now at it is holding up well to my daily travels and use thus
product is good quality and functions as promised allows for different viewing angles when used as a stand , and comfortably fits both tablet and tablet with keyboard docked as well construction quality is good and leather feels nice in the hand it smells for a day or two at first but quickly goes away i looked at almost all of the cases for the tf # t and decided on this one , given customer reviews and the fact that i wanted an integrated case for tablet and/or with keyboard i 'm very satisfied the only reason i <unk> the # th star is that using the hand strap to hold the tablet portrait style is a little odd and not the most comfortable other than that , it 's a great product
this case is absolutely wonderful to look at a wonderful color of blue appropriate for <unk> or <unk> the fit is <unk> holes align exactly the way they should so why # stars instead of # when the transformer keyboard dock is attached , it sticks up a <unk> -lrb- # & # # ; maybe -rrb- that does n't seem like a lot but it is your hands catch on it moving it when you 're trying to type , you knock it off of your lap desk for the same reason yes , you can use the elastic <unk> works <unk> it goes directly across the track pad i love this case and will buy it again by then maybe you will have sewn in a couple of elastic corner straps
i have always used a case with my tablets when i got the asus transformer , i discovered my old case would not work the perfecto pro was a more than adequate replacement in addition to allowing access to all the control buttons on the asus , i found the hand strap to be a real innovation my only complaint is that it is a bit heavy given that the asus is no lightweight itself , it is a bit of a load to carry around
i ordered this case for my asus transformer after doing a lot of research , since i was n't exactly sure what i wanted this case seems to do everything i need it to do : stylish , protective and functional it fits tightly around the screen portion , keeps the keyboard where it should be two velcro strips at the top can be undone , and the tablet slides out easily if i want to travel light , i can leave the add-on keyboard at home , and the case still works great
i paid for expedited shipping and received on the last projected day no fault of <unk> i only mention it because i ordered other materials that were not expedited at the same time and received my other items many days sooner so , in that regards i was a little disappointed especially after paying more for shipping i liked the item , i was looking for something around that style wish they had more colors or designs if you want something pretty it 's probably not going to be as protective
only thing i would change is to put pockets for the corners of the keyboard to go into so the case is completely secured to the keyboard rather then just sitting on it other then that i 'm happy with my purchase and would recommend this case to a friend
i typically buy anywhere between # and # cases for every device i own i can tell you that for any tablet that i 've ever had , this case far exceeds all of them in terms of quality , attractiveness , and usability the stitching is extremely well done and i love the <unk> color combination my only gripe is that they do n't make a case like it for my other devices
was not sure how i might like this after comparing all the similar products out there in short , it is great i use my asus transformer infinity with the keyboard attached almost all the time the fit is very good granted , the tablet with keyboard plus case makes a bit heavier package , but worth it to me the quality and construction are excellent trust me , if you appreciate the feel and durability of real leather , this is the case for you very happy with the purchase
this case is everything i wanted it to be quality , functional it is easy to hold and can hold my asus transformer # tablet and the keyboard along with a stylus it also has an area to plug in the tablet without removing it from the case i am very pleased with this case
purchased this for a newly acquired tf # t factory <unk> also acquired factory <unk> keyboard working on limited budget , so needed a case for both at a good price this item in brown from this vendor was lower cost than any similar items - assuming it is an <unk> color the color appears orange in the <unk> , but is actually more brown in live view the case fits the above components perfectly and makes a nice package with keyboard attached , but requires use of the attached elastic strap for closure in this configuration with keyboard detached the case closes with magnetic latch and leaves a little excess around the <unk> of the case , but it is not <unk> i like this case and can certainly accept this color for the significant savings
after lots of research on amazon , i found the <unk> perfecto <unk> yes , it is expensive , but the fit is fabulous i have gotten many comments from people asking about the case , i tell them all about it i highly reccomend this case , # stars
nicely constructed case that is meeting all our needs since the case does n't have a place to store an sd card , i purchased the <unk> holder that looks like a credit card but holds up to # sd cards
the product was perfect in quality and appearance not too feminine or too masculine it is a very professional looking cover that fits the tablet and the keyboard all slots for the tablet cover align ideally with the asus tf # t table including the power slot , the camera slot and the sound slot i would recommend this product to others as a high grade tablet cover i feel <unk> that i got the last one in stock i would purchase this product again
this is a very nice case for the tf # t i specifically wanted a case that would <unk> the transformer keyboard/dock while attached and this one does it perfectly i like the fact that you can <unk> the keyboard/dock without having to take the tablet out of the case the built in stand is a nice touch for those few times when the keyboard/dock is not attached
the construction of the case is nice strong and well <unk> the price , plenty of screen room to pull down notification drawer only con would be location of volume keys case sits right on them so little tight to fit fingers in still # star for beautiful case
brown case is for my wife she loves it fully designed for use with asus tf # t i previously purchased blue case for my asus tablet still happy after extensive use -lrb- not quite as pretty as hers .
this product will fit an asus transformer tf # t perfectly it 's made out of real genuine leather when it stand ups to watch movies perfect this is a very nice case i would recommend this to everyone
i wish the elastic band was about # & # # ; higher so it <unk> cover the touch pad on the keyboard and thus keep the bottom portion strapped in other than that , great case , well made , thick and sturdy i feel as if this case is going to outlast the tablet and keyboard . ;
i have another case for when using just my tf # t as a tablet , but use this one when keyboard is attached i have n't noticed any issues yet if i come up with one i will update a review
well made and light , has # internal pockets for iphone , <unk> and such , one middle compartment for laptop and one zipped external and another <unk> external pocket on each external side of the bag great as a travelling tote
i have owned my large laptop tote for about # months now , and it 's still going strong the material quality is great , and i have plenty of room to stuff my laptop and books i took a star off for a couple of reasons first , this tote closes with a simple latch i wish it zipped since i have to be very careful if it is raining also , my <unk> toshiba laptop fit at first very snugly i was worried that it would n't work over time , the place where the laptop goes stretched out so now it 's a perfect fit , but i wish there was just a little more room i know laptops come in all shapes and sizes -lrb- i 'm sure a macbook would fit perfectly -rrb- but i wish it was even just # of an inch longer overall , i 'm very please with this sturdy , fashionable tote for my laptop
perfect for my needs love the vibrant colors laptop fits perfect only thing that it could have is a zipper in case it rains , other than that it 's very nice -lrb- reason for # stars
i love the vera bradley heather bags i already have two of the travel <unk> and i purchased this tote to act as a carry-on <unk> i 've already performed a dry run and it fits everything i need perfectly also it 's just beautiful
i have very much enjoyed this laptop tote it arrived in a timely manner , and packaged carefully i know that i will enjoy this bag for a very long time
the case , sleeve and keyboard protector are really nice and easy to put on -lrb- though i 'm still getting used to the keyboard <unk> just feels weird -rrb- , but the screen protector was way to small it was about the size of an ipad -lrb- the large version -rrb- since i mostly bought it for the case , i 'm fine with not having a screen protector , but if it 's going to be included , it should at least fit the case is a lovely shade of purple that can be seen through and not nearly as heavy as the previous case i had if the screen protector had fit , i 'd have given it a higher rating
the only thing about this package is that it is a bit inconvenient to get the laptop into the case i had thought -lrb- assumed ? -rrb- it was a <unk> , but you have to fold over the top to get the laptop in
i got my item after two days and i love it it is a really good price for this package and really good quality , only thing i should mention is that the screen protector is not covering the whole screen , it just covers the inner part great value for good quality item . thanks
for the price , you just ca n't beat this the keyboard pad now feels protected and does n't get dusty the color has everyone at my job looking and asking , does apple make red macs now the snug carry case , is just for carry and protecting your computer , that is it ! but it fits so securely and perfectly , you 'll appreciate having that as extra protection did n't feel the need yet to put the screen cover on ... but it seems to be fine this is an excellent purchase wish they had it in green
i would recommend this product to anybody with a mac i love it keeps my macbook clean and protected great feel and i am able to put stickers on it and they stick
it was delivered right away in about # days it was at my <unk> the application method is soo easy i have n't yet put the screen protector but everything else took less than a minute to assemble i am in love with how my mac book pro looks
was looking for a laptop bag for my sons # & # # ; laptop his favorite color is green and i was looking for a laptop case that would n't get confused with ours this one definitely does n't get confused with our black ones it holds the computer and accessories very nicely
i love it it was big enough for my # . # laptop computer i also like the color , i wanted something different from the boring black computer bag it does not look cheap i do not have it long enough to say anything about the durability
great color and light its fits my macbook pro # & # # ; and still got room on the sides this bag is being used for commuting so the bright color and lightweight is so important to me i do n't loose it or feel it on my back # star product
this bag is exactly what i expected it is inexpensive and sturdy enough for my needs , which is mostly for transporting my laptop to and from my office it has adequate space and fits my # & # # ; asus perfectly
i needed a bag for travel and this has worked out perfectly not only can i carry whatever i need for my laptop , but can also carry my kindle and mp # and various chargers all in one bag
it 's not leather it 's not big enough the metal zipper scratches the macbook air if it could close with difficulty but marginally worth returning it 's really cheap , so i bought it
the leather stains and my macbook pro is n't secured within it yes , it covers it but the reason i bought was for securing the laptop too so not happy right now
this case did n't fit the computer well it almost fit , but the fabric around the edge does wrap around the computer , the zipper is very rough tried to get a refund but it was like pulling teeth
it looks nice , but my macbook air kept on slipping around and the zipper would scratch my computer when i closed it not enough padding i just ordered at <unk> case they are supposed to be really good
i can put only # stars because it does n't fit to macbook pro # & # # ; retina -lrb- if it does , i 'll put # stars ! -rrb- although , i decided to keep it : -rrb- pros - good design - there is no logo on surface - it looks expensive than its price - the zippers work smoothly - a way to hold macbook is good cons - it does n't fit to macbook pro # & # # ; retina ... . :
the zipper scraped up my brand new macbook air # inch if it was not for that this case would have been the best i loved it before i discovered what it had done
this is an ok case it does n't fit the device perfectly , it 's a little loose and slides around on my macbook i 'll still use it , but more like a sleeve to keep it in
gave this to my husband for christmas i was a bit disappointed with the way it fits the computer - a bit clunky that being said it does protect the computer and my husband seems to be happy with the cover
we purchased this for my daughters laptop for some additional protection and camouflage from <unk> people it works well as camouflage but has limited padding for protection . # stars is <unk> would have given it # stars if it had more padding
i purchased this case for a macbook pro retina late # model and the size was just too loose that being said , the quality of the case was nice and i think it is a great case for a slightly larger computer
too bad ; it was a good product , but only got # months out of it although i hardly ever used the zipper , after # months the stitching came undone by the zipper causing the fabric to come out now i ca n't use the zipper on that side their response : `` sorry that it should be a normal wear and tear after long term usage , therefore it is not covered in the warranty . `` not what i consider good public <unk> update # / # customer service finally came through after asking for the manager ... sent me a new one
i bought this as a gift for my husband and he absolutely loved it very beautiful , and the material is really nice my only concern is that the elastic to hold in the bottom corners of the laptop are a little flimsy , and the laptop does n't stay in place very well other than that it 's a great product and i love that my husband loves it
i love this product , it looks very <unk> and expensive it even fits with my actual macbook pro case i also use it to slip in papers with my laptop so it serves as a folder too its worth the price , the only bad thing is that it stinks for the first few days but if you allow it to air out , smell goes away
this may be the only leather or faux leather sleeve available now that works with my white plastic macbook -lrb- macbook # -rrb- the zipper is a little snug at the corners , but left zipped up when not using it loosens it up this would be a great solution for this model macbook
pretty solid sturdy case not to tight on the computer so it can breath a lil u no . id rather pouch my mac then put that stupid plastic cheap cases that
it looks great and professional it feels nice and there is some padding that will protect the laptop from bumps and bruises when placed in a <unk> the zipper does come in tight when bringing it around the back corners of the laptop and it is possible to scratch the laptop with the zipper it 's best to pull the zipper away from the laptop slightly while you are zipping to ensure that it does n't make contact with the laptop
so far it seems to be good quality padding feels like neoprene , zipper feels rugged the outer material is pleather or & # # ; <unk> leather & # # ; as <unk> <unk> would describe it , very convincing at first glance my # & # # ; macbook has no overheated in it yet the padding seems to protect the edges well with <unk> sewn in around the edges my only complaint is the elastic straps that secure to the screen are in view of the screens ' corner
i looked for a macbook sleeve at bestbuy , target , etc . they had one or two options that were $ # plus finding this nice leather one for $ # made my day
my macbook is fitted with mosiso black rubberized hard case and it still fits nice and snug in the sleeve case the color and real leather look are very nice very stylish and professional looking
i love how it looks largely i bought it for college but i 've been in love with it and get compliments everywhere yes it does have a scent but it surely loses it after some use
this case / cover is exactly what i was looking for to fit my # -inch macbook air i wanted a case that can protect the computer from dents and scrapes , as well as zip up and enclose the laptop to protect it from dust or liquids this does just that the padding within the case gives in a soft cushion feeling under the pu leather and the corners of the laptop are secured within the case for the # months i have had the case , i have never experienced any problems or inconveniences from it it is easy to open and close , and the laptop stays in place within the cover i love it
this case is everything i wanted like some of the other reviews say , it is a little bit darker that the pictures make it seem , but it 's still very classy and stylish the zipper is very smooth and has no problems zipping open or shut , which is what i was the most worried about the top corners have no trouble holding on to the screen , and you can slide the warranty between the laptop and the cover for <unk> if you need to it 's a little hard to distinguish the top from the bottom when it 's zipped all the way shut , so personalizing stickers might be helpful in that regard i just leave half of one side unzipped and that tells me how to <unk> it when i 'm trying to open it
i was hesitant about the brown color , but it looks really nice and classy the mba fits tightly , but without any force i work on the mba with the cover on i was worried this might cause overheating , but it 's not causing any troubles
i love it it came quickly and looked better than the pictures for the price i thought the leather would be cheap and fall apart quickly no it 's like a top of the line case i want it in every color
this case cover looks chic and professional it is also very durable and secure i have also a clip on case with my laptop , but use this when i take my laptop out of the house -lrb- i.e . school , work -rrb- or when traveling i enjoy the fact that i can slide the corners into the case as well , so i just have to flip my laptop open rather than just take the whole thing out i also get a lot of compliments on it as well overall , great product , especially for the price
i ordered this for my husband and he loves it it looks so rich and classy and very masculine holds the laptop in place and is easy to carry around he 's happy and loving his new accessory
it looks classy and i like it that it zips around so it makes a secure carrying case while i do n't have to take computer out of the case everytime i use the computer
