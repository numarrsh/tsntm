this is a great bag ... it saw me through a deployment to korea -lrb- and the # hour plane ride there -rrb- it was never cumbersome of stressful on my back thanks to the stretchy shock <unk> in the straps i was able to <unk> a laptop computer several stacks of important paperwork , an mp # player and enough magazines to keep me <unk> the whole way there
i 've had two of these bags when the first one was stolen , i purchased the exact some item but in red there are plenty of compartments to keep all my stuff organized the pouch that stays open in the front is a big plus to this design , i can just drop items in quickly when on the go the only minus is that it is a heavy pack for its size extremely durable and well made
this was the best backpack that i was able to find it had all the necessary things and best of all it could also hold your laptop even one of my <unk> liked it so much that they also purchased one also the quality is very good
it is a little bit larger than i cared for once i got it in the mail , but this is my new favorite item i care a laptop too and from work everyday i work at television <unk> in california so the walk from the parking structure to my office can be a very long walk i used to have a briefcase looking laptop holder that always hurt my shoulders this is red -lrb- my fave -rrb- and it is padded on the straps but also on the part of the bookbag that is against your back in fact , with the new <unk> <unk> for flying , i take out all my work stuff and pack this bad boy up for my trips on a plane it holds and awful lot , but i do n't feel like i am carrying too much at all i love it
i had the same bag and used it for almost # years when that broke , i ordered the same one just cause i was so satisfied with the product earlier but the top flap of this new bag tore in less than a week i do n't know if the product was defective or their quality has gone down , but i was a disappointed i would give a # star to the first bag i bought , but the second one was a disappointment
used it for about # months . looks very good confortable . pockets for everything . the only problem is that it only has # big section for books . and the bottom section for laptop if you only need to carry less then # books -lrb- # textbook and # note book -rrb- then get it but if you need to carry lots of books and laptop , this is not for you
note : i am not bashing the bag , its fine , however i am warning all that inandoutauctions <unk> the customers i ordered this bag , from the seller inandoutauctions , they listed this bag as new upon its arrival i found a bag that has no tags , no receipt , a worn bottom , scratches , stains , a new hp remote and a set of hp earphones inside i am a reasonable person , it is in decent condition , especially with its hidden `` <unk> `` . this would 've been fine had i ordered a used product , but i did not i would not suggest going for the lesser price of this product unless you have a prior history with that seller and if you must be cheap , like i was , do not buy from inandoutauctions after a few emails and a phone conversation inandoutauctions gave me a full refund , as they should have for the inconvenience
i am very dissapointed , the top handle snapped after # weeks and i had just one book and my computer not so good quality as i expected anyways , i guess for just a computer and charger , it wont break
i bought one of these bags during a sale at our college bookstore my <unk> rei backpack , which lasted me nearly ten years , is finally developing zipper problems and so when i saw this bag for $ # , i figured it was a good replacement for my current pack unfortunately , this backpack went to pieces pretty quickly in particular , the straps on both sides began to fray badly at the lower joint , within a month of purchase i have n't done anything with this bag but carry books in it , but it 's literally coming apart at the seams my old rei pack , on the other hand , is still in pretty decent condition despite having been used on camping trips as well as for school on top of everything else , the bookstore refused to give me a refund since this was a clearance item ... so i 'm out twenty bucks and i need a new backpack again now i know why they had extras left over
i got # of these for my kids in october , ages # and # , and both of them starting breaking after less than a couple months of daily use my son 's top strap snapped after one month , then one of the arm straps unraveled my daughters zippers broke in several places , and the same top handle and arm straps are starting to unravel as well i bought them because of the # star rating and lifetime guarantee i am beginning to doubt the <unk> of the star rating system , since i bet few people come back to comment after these back packs are in tatters
i received this laptop backpack last week and i thought it 's of better looks and quality as how it 's presented here in -lsb- ... -rsb- just do n't expect too much the price may attract you but you might regret it once you receive it i 'm a # year old woman and i have numerous shoulder bags , pocket books and at least # backpacks at home - this is nowhere close to the old ones that i have
this is my second purchase of the same product again , the same issue arises : the zipper runs off track and then its broken and the backpack unusable i 'd expect better from mobile
i 've picked up this bag about # times and the top handle just ripped off i had my laptop and # book in there . that 's it i just thought i would share that with everyone i 'm sure there are many other people out there still happily grasping their handles , but i am not one of them . mine is off
i got this bag after i was told i could n't carry the pink one at work i have had it for a month or so and the stitching on the top is coming loose i sewed it together , but i am disappointed in this bag the pink one , i have had no issues with i take it on trips and to school
it fits my # . # in widescreen laptop really well there are a ton of pockets for whatever you 're carrying i have n't really used it yet but it seems pretty practical it has a lot of padding i am just wondering about getting the notebook in and out when i have other things in there overall it 's a pretty good bag
would buy again for the amount of protection it provides for my # -inch laptop - the styling is great - the bag securely holds the laptop with a good amount of protection - outside pockets are ideal for <unk> , small digital cameras - the shoulder straps are a great <unk> for the weight of the laptop on the back - this bag can only be used for transporting a laptop there is not enough room for anything less - the inside pockets are too small for holding battery cords , and wireless devices -lrb- do fit inside general area in the main pocket - the bag is a `` hefty `` weight -lrb- i 'm a woman , and it gives me some trouble -rrb-
i like the bag ... the design is unique some of the pockets seem really useful , like the mp # player port , but you will find that you will never use it front , back and side protection is adequate , but the <unk> could use more protection like some foam <unk> the laptop pocket is actually suspended off the bottom of the bottom of the bag so maybe that makes up for it update : now seeing that the price is back up to $ # , i would not recommend this bag to anyone the quality is fine , but $ # dollars will get you a hell of a lot more if you look at other brands
this is a nice backpack i like the single large compartment and love the lumbar cushioning so far so good the reason i did n't give it # stars was because of the price and it does n't have a center strap other than that , it 'll work i 'll update after a couple of weeks
the bag arrived on time as was promised the <unk> problem i had with it is that it had only one compartment i was looking to replace the one i have had now for so many years but leaving a three compartment bag for a # compartment was not ideal for me i have rated this product a # because so students who do not need much space it is a perfect fit
when i was reading the reviews of this backpack the two that stuck out were the ones that had issues with the top handles breaking off so after i got this one home i tested it out by loading it up and shaking the thing around for a bit it seems to be pretty stable i 'm sure that some reinforcing of the stiching could n't hurt but it seems pretty solid the bottom of the pack could be bit sturdier , maybe not a solid bottom , but maybe a little more padding . the laptop compartment does sit up off the bottom so it 's not a real issue the padding on the straps and back are real nice i will use this on my motorcycle a lot and it will allow my back to get some air , so that helps all in all i like the pockets available and the pack itself i think it 's a good purchase
worked perfectly for keeping my computer and other things organized , the only issue i one of the zippers keeps catching when zipping it up , but still a good bag for the price
it 's an incredible product and the price is very nice i have a samsonite backpack that costed me around # dollars and this backpack has the same features but there 's a huge difference in price
decided to finally review the backpack i have been using daily for four years it has traveled internationally with me for work to china and mexico and still looks pretty new i did have a slight internal tear on an inner pocket which sent it in for repair and got it back timely now this backpack is on its new life as a daily med student companion i like all the pockets and use each one the large side pockets are the most convenient for # l nalgene bottles the only complaint is that i wished the bottom had a little more padding under the laptop compartment , i guess just in case i drop the bag straight down
if you only need a backpack with one slot for books or folders and a little back section for a netbook or small laptop this is for you its extremely comfortable and so far i have had no problems with this
i have used one of these daily for just over a year the padding on the bag makes it easy to carry a heavy load there are pockets for things of all sizes this year my brother needed a new bag for school and he got the same one with a different color for the stripes i think he loves the bag as much as i do
i had this bag for a day the pockets are not set up very well the ones on the side are worthless the way the bag opens its hard to get your laptop in after putting my laptop in the pocket that is attached was so tight i could not put anything in it , theres no way the charger and cables would fit the velcro pocket inside are small as well
i bought this product about a year ago , did a ton of research as i use my laptop bag for business travel about # times per week well , after about a year , the handle at the very top of the bag came undone from the bag itself -lrb- luckily , there was no damage to the contents , so the padding does work not how i wanted to test it , though ! -rrb- problem is with the design of how the handle is stitched to the bag as it tends to twist and put more stress on the stitch i 've owned a few laptop bags over the years at this price point , and i 've always got # years of use before it fails although i liked the features with this bag , because it only lasted about a year , i can not recommend this item
i bought this bag last december when i purchased my hp <unk> laptop the bag is not one of the best out there you can get much better bags from competitors -lrb- targus etc -rrb- with better feature sets as i am a student , the bag has not withstood the <unk> of my student life and already the seems are bursting on the side exposing the low quality workmanship the padding at the back is nice though especially when i am biking around the side pockets on the outside are nice as you can store the power supply , <unk> etc in them so that they do not scratch the laptop or books inside overall , it is not worth the price you pay for it i would rather buy something better next time around for the same price
i used this one semester and then it had issues no bad but not as good as i thought it would be it could be because i used it so much
i like this bag a lot , there is plenty of room for your laptop and anything else you need to carry there is only one issue i have with this bag . sometimes it is a little difficult to close the top zipper because it catches on the fabric underneath due to the design of the bag
this bag i acquired to carry a compaq presario # . # -inch , something a bit heavy when loaded distance i can say <unk> material , durable and with plenty of space inside what i dislike is that it is very wide at the sides , this makes it a little uncomfortable feeling the weight load to go to the sides do not sit at all ergonomic , tends to tire shoulders have not felt things with other bags maybe you should make them more vertically
loved the bag , my # `` widescreen laptop fit into it snugly and was almost hidden by the computer section -lrb- a plus -rrb- it does n't ` scream ' computer backpack still lots of room to put in a few cables , wires , and papers as needed really liked the side pockets too for the could easily put in a water bottle or two however after a week shy of a years use the upper strap is giving way thus <unk> the need to replace i may get another . . but , i 'm shopping around a bit first .
at first i thought this backpack was going to be too small for my # . # `` laptop but once i got it there was plenty of room for my notebook and for cds and books as well this backpack looks very resistant and it 's incredibly confortable it doesnt look like your carrying a laptop inside and you barely feel the weight my only complain is with the velcro strap that comes inside -lrb- for the laptop compartment -rrb- it doesnt do anything , because i would expect the laptop to keep steady no matter how much you move but with or without the strap the laptop tends to move back and forth inside of the compartment i know it 's nothing big , but i just want it to point that out all in all this is a great backpack i 'm happy with it
i 'm very pleased with both the product and the shipper i placed the order for the bag june # th , not expecting it to arrive until the following week , but it showed up on my doorstep the next day , even with standard shipping i was very impressed not to mention , the bag was in perfect condition and looked exactly as i expected it to i will be buying from this seller again i was very impressed
i do n't usually give high marks for items i purchased , but this item ... it 's absolutely great nice design , nice comfortably shoulder pads , cool media pocket for mp # <unk> and lots of pockets
i 've read in some reviews where people thought this bag was too big , but i find it to be the perfect size the bag is built very well seems very sturdy the white camouflage looks great and bag has more than enough pockets you open a pocket to find another pocket in that pocket great bag ! this bag has more than enough room for your laptop , and all the accessories you carry with it -lrb- cables , mouse , disks ... etc . -rrb- even though i received this as a gift i would have paid the asking price for this bag
so far so good , its pretty comfortable , and keeps my laptop secure plenty of pockets for accesories and other stuff like pens , cd 's , mp # players etc . . for the price compared to others its a great buy go ahead and buy it , do it !
bought this to carry a fairly large laptop , along with extra battery , cell phone and ipod i liked the looks of the bag when i first saw it and i was happy with it when i received it seems just a bit larger than i would have liked but overall it 's a very nice backpack
i bought this for my wife for christmas # she started using it in january , gently mind you by feb # the retractable handle broke rendering it entirely useless for the purpose of a rolling bag would n't spend my money on something so easily broken had i known
there is nothing wrong w / the potomac rolling case it 's a quality product however , i travel on regional jets quite often and find it too large to fit comfortably under the seat and heavy i enjoy the computer bag that comes w / it if you have documents and many electric accessory this bag is good
i would not recommend this case because on first use , the handle already broke off completely from the case however , beach camera came through and fully refunded back my money , including shipping i would definitely do business again with beach camera ... thanks again
everyone has these wenger cases on every flight i take i 'm pleased with the one i just received has all of the features i expected the handle slides up and down easily , but that is what went wrong with my last one which was almost # years old the handle not sliding up and down without a special <unk> was an issue for # years before i replaced it so i 'll be watching this one
the roller bag was a great idea and the wife likes it i would recommend it to anyone it is a very sturdy bag and has a seperate detachable bag that allows you to carry your pc without having to use the entire bag also has lots of room
i think i did buy this bag originally at staples about # years ago it is high quality i love the space but i really abused it i over pack it ... it handles a lot of weight ... but a month ago the wheels started to <unk> and last night the handle broke off but i dont blame the bag ... just my abuse of it i drag it around the streets of <unk> # days every week ... like i said , always over loaded since im used to it and i love the quality i 'm buying another today
good quality feel so far and great overall however , i use it for business and wish it had accordion file storage inside i will buy a small one to insert inside
this is a great book bag ... very sturdy and roomy it rolls nicely too the only thing that i do not like is the handle it is <unk> and it does n't seem to slide and click into it 's prospective levels very well it may be defective and i still need to contact the company about it , but other than that , it is good quality and not terribly heavy
the laptop rolling case exceeded my expectations with the dual use and functions however , it was n't as big as i thought it would be but it certainly does the job
compact , sturdy multiple pockets for a variety of uses wheels are sturdy the handle is easy to collapse and expand the laptop case enclosed is of good quality great price for what you get i had a samsonite rolling carrier prior to this and i like this one better
i had been looking at the wegner bags for some time before purchasing i went with the potomac because i am a frequent <unk> and if needed to store under the seat , this was as large as you can push it the bag is very sturdy a good strong handle for carrying and it glides smoothly when pulling on the wheels there are plenty of places to store all my techie cables and accessories in addition to storing a change of clothes for an overnight stay if i had one complaint about this bag is the absence of hooks for a shoulder strap sometimes i find myself in a situation where i need to be pulling other bags and the lack of a strap makes it difficult i would highly suggest this bag for the on-the-go person or business traveler you will be happy with it
this product most certainly met my expectations to be clear , i have not yet flown with it yet -lrb- that 's coming the end of this month -rrb- the trip in the trunk was a good experience ... as the bag was extremely roomy for my large dell e # laptop , a ton of paper documents i was not successful with just the one overnight though , and i had to have my -lrb- small -rrb- clothing bag to hold , shirts , toiletries , socks and stuff i think that a shirt would get more than <unk> if you tried to include in this bag
my husband said it is one of the best presents we ever got him seems as thou he looks forward to traveling on those short trips just so he can use his suit case
im a pilot and this bag is extremely useful i can load my electronic flight kit in here as well as keep my personal items well organized perfect for a
since purchasing this computer case , i have received numerous complements and <unk> as to where i got it i chose it because i trust the swissgear name and have found the quality to be unsurpassed it has numerous convenient pockets that you need with all the accessories , you are required to carry in conjunction with a business laptop i use it my daily travels and have found it to be worth the extra money if you 're looking for a rugged , yet handsome carring case then this is the one
this is the perfect sized bag for my computer and all other <unk> i need on a regular basis lots of great compartments , and not too bulky fits great under the seat in front of me on airplanes , including the smaller commuter jets my handle sticks a bit when telescoping , but otherwise i love this bag and highly recommend it
this rolling case is very high quality i used to buy a new rolling case every # months for $ # - $ # , because i tend to be pretty hard on them as a graduate student , i use my bag daily for classes as well as taking it with me everywhere to study if i have a few free moments i finally broke down and bought this one and i am so glad it is large , has room for alot of books , etc . and it is now # months old and is still in perfect condition i am sure that it will last me at least another year swiss army is the bomb
the bag is a great size and even came with an extra handle bag that i didnt expect the handle is easy to use as well doesnt fall over when taking it over bumps
i really appreciate the person who designed this product lots of room , great division of room and quality workmanship i purchased one of these as a gift for my college bound niece she loved hers so when i found myself in need of something similar i tried the same thing it is a life saver for my back and just makes life easier all around
the potomac from swissgear double gusset rolling case is exactly what i was looking for the executive <unk> of our <unk> asked me to purchase a rolling case she could take with her to conventions and <unk> one that she could put her laptop in , and several files , plus office supplies she might need it had to be light enough for her to use -lrb- she is only # ' # `` tall -rrb- , and the wheels had to roll smoothly for her to navigate turns , hallways , etc . i ordered this , and it was better than the description on amazon.com it is very well made , sturdy , has plenty of compartments to store items , the laptop section is nicely padded , the wheels roll very smoothly , and the handle telescopes up and down with ease the executive <unk> loves it , and she might want me to order another one for her <unk>
i saw the patriot , potomac 's bigger version , at staples the other day and fell in love with its sleek design and swissgear standards however , the patriot is much too big for my purposes -lrb- laptop + paperwork <unk> to/from office , business travels , etc -rrb- ... so i tried to find another swissgear bag of similar design and smaller proportions i came upon potomac on amazon and was n't too impressed with its design compared to patriot however , i read the reviews , took a chance , and ordered it it 's fantastic it looks better than it does in the photos it 's roomy -lrb- a tiny bit too big for me still but it 's all good -rrb- , sturdy , and handsome i like to remove the laptop tote and use it for everyday purposes when i do n't have to lug around paperwork from the office very happy with the purchase
got it for a birthday gift over a month ago to use for work instead of carrying my tools open it # times a day and the zipper is still good and it rolls great it is a great value for the price
way much better than i expected . good at overhead compartment on <unk> planes , but not for the e # s <unk> ; -rrb- -- they will need to keep it and bring back after landing
it is well-made rolling bag it has pretty big storage space and is very sturdy a small laptop bag is a big bonus when you do n't want to carry whole rolling case
i travel enough to have to bring along my laptop and my laptop is a # `` which i love i have a swiss backpack which is great and the # `` fits in perfectly however as i get a tad older i am in need of a roll along so i began my search . this fits the bill it 's big enough for my acer , not using the sleeve , and not too big to be <unk> so far it 's great
product as described quality and durable material with lots of compartments the laptop cover was a bonus ! ! my <unk> loved it as her going away gift when she got promoted
i saw this bag at staples and it was # dollars more i brought the bag from amazon and it arrived in # days the bags looks even better than the pictures and it has so much space to fit everything i would it buy again
i was just thinking about this today , i have had this bag for over a year and it has taken quite the beating the bag is still in great shape i stand by this item
barely enough room for laptop . spare battery and power <unk> cell phone pocket on the <unk> does not close <unk> you need something lightweight then this might do , but otherwise ... seek something
stylish laptop messenger bag and also comes with a pouch for the laptop power adapter it will be nice if it had an extra side pocket for laptop power adapter instead of putting it in the front pouch which makes the bag bulky otherwise very durable and can hold documents , cd 's , pens , etc .
the quality of this bag is just great the problem could be the very tiny front bag it also has a small bag for the ac power cable and transformer but once you use it there is no place to put it comfortably considering a # `` laptop
i gave it five stars b/c i got exactly what i expected to get everything fits in it but there is very little extra room , i wanted that the ergonomic handle is comfortable i would not have chosen this bag when i was executive because it does n't have the professional polished look it is a casual looking bag , which is also what i wanted i like the orange detail - it is not too much the only thing i 'm not crazy about is that it seems heavy to me when everything is in it since my new laptop is <unk> than the previous one , i do suspect it 's the bag that adds the weight i am overall very happy with the bag though
the targus urban messenger bag is a solid messenger-style bag with ample room for a large laptop i find it comfortable to wear on my walk to and from work and the <unk> pouch on th flap is a nice feature the bag seems to be made of high quality materials and is put together well i really enjoy this bag
i have carried multiple <unk> all over europe and the us in my brenthaven cases <unk> nylon holds up very well and resists abrasion shoulder strap sticks to your shoulder `` form follows function `` - easy to get into , computer is well-protected <unk> and physically excellent coiled zippers handy <unk> for dvds , pens , paper and cables a lot of information is packed into every stitch excellent service from brenthaven same case can be obtained for # % less at
this bag was just what my friends said to have to carry my new apple macbook pro it has kept the computer safe while being transported , for the center compartment has a padded secure area for the computer i now have had it a number of years , and it still looks new and i think the best bag to have for my mac
i am very pleased with this case i recently took it on its first trip and was pleased to find <unk> spaces for my airport express , ipod , and magsafe ... plus plenty more room for headphones and other items the handles are covered in leather which makes them comfortable the area your laptop goes into is heavily padded with thick foam which gives good peace of mind i do wish it were leather instead of canvas , but you ca n't have everything
this case was more than twice the price of the others that i looked at , yet is perfect for the macbook pro # `` it protects the laptop like no other , and has enough places to store anything you need to take with it , while being very light and easy to carry it even has room for a change of clothes for the overnight business trip
recently made the switch from thinkpad to macbook pro # `` even though the mbp weighs about a pound more , which matters a lot to a <unk> traveler old case was even too short for thinkpad , so ordered this <unk> even though it appears to be about a pound heavier than my old case when empty i am delighted to report the new case is lighter than the old one , after adjustment the `` core `` system is actually a separate padded sleeve that fits inside an already padded compartment sleeve unsnaps and comes out easily , removing # . # ounces from total and removeable strap is # . # oz without sleeve and strap , the case weighs # pounds # . # ounces - significantly lighter than my old <unk> , unpadded case -lrb- # lbs # . # oz -rrb- <unk> , it can accommodates a # `` x # `` x # `` notebook without the `` core `` sleeve but with the integral # `` padding and yes , there are plenty of compartments and pockets no negatives from me on this case
i read reviews that said this is `` the `` bag for you mac powerbook i have a # `` - and this bag is perfect i feel that my powerbook is safe inside this bag good sized pockets to carry external devices etc . i would highly recommend this bag for the protection it offers as well as the extra pockets for all my stuff
i liked but did not love this bag -- it fits comfortably , but is too heavy compared to other packs i 've owned the laptop compartment is also too wide , taking away space from the main compartment for lunch , folders , sweater , etc . now , after one month of wear , the lining has <unk> from the seams in the accessory compartment yes it has a warranty , but such a hassle
i like the look of this but it was huge ! i showed it to my friend and she thought it was a backpack with wheels the design is very attractive but too big i had to return it
i have gotten so much compliment on this bag and it is very efficient to my needs it keeps my laptop with wide screen and also have enough room to keep some documents and other needed traveling items only bad thing is that i have to take off the bag in order to access different compartments
very nice stylish backpack for women it can hold more than look like it can i only wish there was an outside pocket to store items like a boarding pass or phone besides the zip on on the side the zip on the side is not designed for that
the backpack is exactly what we were looking for and is quite stylish however , it is very large so it would be easy to overfill and make it super heavy the one drawback is that when the bag is full , it can be difficult to open the outside <unk> to open it
i was surprised how large this was when i opened the box however , i can fit my # `` laptop and several files inside it has slots for your pda or cell phone , and i carry my wallet in there as well it is very comfortable to carry , too , and i have gotten multiple compliments the only downside that i can see is having to open/close the flap each time you want your phone or pda while traveling i have taken to leaving it <unk> while i am stationary the front flap is leather
available space works for me and it 's very comfortable the fabric is really nice and it does great in the snow and rain the water bottle hideaway compartment is amazing i throw it around here and there and it has been holding up really well it looks like it will hold up for a while i am very satisfied with my purchase
i love this backpack it has enough room to carry my laptop , cords , a few notebooks , pens and other small ancillary items like my ipod and cell phone , etc . it 's not huge , though , so you ca n't carry a ton of stuff , which is good for the back , but it works and it is so dang cute , too
i have been looking for a fashion laptop backpack for so long and finally found this my # & # # ; # mac fits in there and still having a lot of spaces for my ipad and laptop chargers i am tiny and this backpack fits everything i have to carry around and it does n't look too big for me
i love the quality , size , and style of this back it is perfect and is exactly what i was wanting my laptop -lrb- macbook -rrb- fits perfectly , and it does n't cause me back pain great style , too
i have had this bag for over # years now , and it is still in perfect shape i have taken it all over the world , on over # flights as well as several cross-country driving trips i never <unk> to get compliments on it there is n't a scratch on it , and i have not been gentle or careful with it it is stylish as well as functional the laptop pocket is well-padded and the perfect size for a laptop and the charger and cords the other pockets are roomy and easy to organize this is a great , useful , stylish , tough but feminine bag i would definitely buy it again
it 's bulkier than it looks in the photos , but it 's so stylish and elegant i do n't mind i love the faux leather look , with the pink accents makes it really stylish add to that that it 's light , comfortably padded , gives easy access to the laptop , and has so many organizing inside pockets i wonder now why it took me so long to buy it i will never ever buy a laptop backpack again , at least not until this one breaks down all other brands are bulky and ugly i 'm taking my mobile edge <unk> <unk> backpack everywhere , with or without laptop
i saw this bag on glee , and i had to have it , i loved the style ! it fits my computer and books wonderfully and no one has a bag like it i have been asked where i got it cuz they love the look as well
i love this bag to the bits . # main bag compartments ; one for mini accessories with individual pockets , one for books / folders - can fit up to two a # binding folders ; one for laptop the laptop compartment has really good padding with bumps to protect even without sleeve things can be put / removed easily and there is an expandable option -lrb- if you have to fit in more stuff -rrb- design of front clasps is cool saw this on one of the <unk> of glee great design and functionality and lifetime warranty only didnt like the <unk> mobile edge logo on the print strap but it is worth every penny !
i 'm a <unk> laptop user , and i 've never had a bag that was so roomy and stylish its also very comfortable to wear on your back , which many laptop bags are not its also very durable and well constructed i have a macbook , and it fits nicely and protects the computer very well and it looks good :
love this bag i got the pink saw it on glee and had to gave it found it on here for a good price and fast shipping i received it in prime condition still in the plastic bagging it was manufactured in there were no faulty and the warranty papers were intact it was amazing and the price was very good
i have had this backpack over two years and it is still in great shape after accompanying me to work almost every day and on many flights professional looking for business environment well padded so it is comfortable to wear <unk> version adds a feminine touch and is a great way to support the breast cancer cause in a subtle way some have complained about the need to open the top flap to get to pockets that hold personal items , but i like the security of that design laptop slot that sits behind the front flap has double zipper which can hold a luggage lock for additional security
shipping was fast and <unk> online bought this product for my girlfriend and she loves it she had always complained about her shoulders when carrying her notebook computer because of the weight this backpack has many compartments and lots of padding plenty room for all her books , pens and cell phone along with computer parts i highly recommend this product and it was a pleasure buying from pc connection thru amazon.com
this is seriously the best backpack i 've ever owned im in <unk> in a graduate program and needed a sturdy backpack that looks professional - this was the perfect one it has lots of compartments and is very stylish
i am a first year female college student and i wanted to find a backpack for my # `` widescreen hp it fits perfectly and has a bunch of nice compartments but it 's pretty heavy on my # <unk> walk to class with just my laptop and battery -lrb- i 'm # ' # `` at # pounds -rrb- i was expecting the backpack to be smaller because i wanted to hide the fact that i was carrying around a laptop for safety reasons but it is very apparent that it is backpack with a laptop in it and it is kind of embarrassing to carry around this <unk> backpack i think this product would be better suited for men on the other hand , it is very sturdy and well-made but if i had to do it all over again , i would have purchased a different one
this back pack was everything i needed to protect my # `` wide screen notebook unlike other bags available like swiss gear and other cheaper brands that say it will fit # `` notebooks this one actually does there is plenty of room for papers , and other teaching materials i need daily it has the normal break down of compartments for all of your accessories the quality is also quite good this bag and the targus # `` notebook back pack which i also own are the only two i would tell anyone to buy the trade off is this one looks more rectangular `` may i say a little fancier `` and the targus has a more typical student back pack
the bag has plenty of room , opens and closes well and fits well on the back because of adjustable straps it does like more like plastic than leather so it looks a bit cheap i 'm going for function rather than style
beside the fact that my laptop weighs a ton -lrb- not to mention the mouse , power cables , ext . hdd , and tablet -rrb- , the backpack is very comfortable and easy to carry i wanted something that looked slick and professional , and not the size of a mini backpacking <unk> i also wanted a backpack that would carry everything i need from my laptop to my little thumb drive all in a compact case i found a pocket for everything and it all seems very <unk> and safe my only complaint has to be the fact that i ca n't really fit anything else in the backpack , like workout clothes , lunch , etc . not a big deal in my mind a suggestion for any potential buyers : i have a # `` dell precision and it barely fits in the designated laptop slot it has maybe an inch of room from the zipper and the strap has to really stretch to reach the velcro to keep the laptop secured other than that , i got an amazing price , a good looking and efficient backpack , and an all around great deal
