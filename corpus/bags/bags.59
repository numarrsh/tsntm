the sleeve fits okay in my mac # & # # ; just little bit tight it is a good protection <unk> <unk> when you put your lap into your back pack since it 's not sealed it wont protect it from water spills or heavy
it is too small i can barely get the laptop in it the top flap buckles up when i am able to stretch it closed i think perhaps it is for an # or # inch notebook instead of # inch
this is a decent neoprene laptop/notebook sleeve for a # inch laptop computer however , be warned that it does smell , and the smell was especially noticeable - and quite <unk> - for the first few days i owned it i found it barely covers my dell inspiron # z so have been using this in <unk> with a # inch sleeve for added protection against bumps and bruises
just got this in the mail today , seems well made and snug to my laptop , which is what i was looking for : -rrb- not sure how much protection it will give , as it is only a sleeve seems like it will take a knock or two , but doubt it will take a drop from any height , and i 'm not testing that with my new laptop also it is indeed reversible and if you are wondering the laptop has the dimensions of # . # x # . # x # . # inches the case is a bit stretchable to a extent
i bought this for my wacom tablet because it fits over it and the price is great compared to the ones sold for my tablet specifically this sleeve works nicely to protect my tablet from getting scratched up in my backpack its reversible , but its exactly the same color on both sides
i recently bought this product the very next day after putting it on my macbook , i noticed that the bottom snap portion of the case had scratched the top of my screen i am extremely upset that after buying a product to protect my computer , it actually ended up damaging it the very next day do not buy top
i ordered this because it came with a free keyboard cover , however when it came , it was about half an inch too big on either side the case fit loosely on my mac pro and when i opened my computer , the back case would just fall off the keyboard cover was not even the same color as the case
i had this product for about two months now , and i take very good care of my laptop the corners break easily , and the case also cracks easily as well do not recommend buying this product , it was a waste of money for a broken case will not protect the lap top correctly
after dropping and scratching my macbook pro a few times , i finally decided to buy this hard case cover i do like the shade of this orange , as it 's not a <unk> neon orange it fits like a glove , and also like the fact that you can open macbook all the way with the case still on there 's a hole at the top cover right at the apple logo why did n't they describe this in the details i thought there would be a clear plastic at a circle and had not imagined that there 'll be a hole because of this , this cover does n't look complete i 'm also concerned about dust going in between through the hole
this cover fits very well and looks great . was much better price than buying directly from apple the cut out for the apple logo is complete not clear plastic like the others . makes a little creaking noise when opening and closing but other tan that its just fine
it 's over a year later and this sturdy case is still holding up dropped my mac a short distance a few times one of the corners of the case is now cracked but my mac is safe and the case is still in good condition
after ordering another case that did n't even fit my macbook pro # laptop , i was so relieved when this actually fit great value for the price , it 's stylish and protects my computer as the aluminum generally scratches quite easily also , got the package way before i expected to receive it overall i 'm very pleased
the only thing that could have made the new macbook pro i recently bought for my daughter any cooler was this funky orange cover it 's her favorite color and it fits like a glove the perfect protection accessory
though it fits pretty well , it is almost impossible to separate it from the mac ... actually , it took me over an hour to take it out of my macbook without destroying it
i thought this color would be a vibrant yellow though in actuality its a golden color . and the paded grips are the cheap styrofoam material . one was already coming off . and yes , no bubble wrap but very quick shipping
all in all , the case is nice it fits well and is a pretty color -lrb- i got the tiffany blue -rrb- however , i have a decal on the back of my computer that i love , so i specifically bought this case so that i could still see my decal the case is much more opaque than they say or even how the pictures look i am pretty disappointed with the case because of that so if you are looking for a case that will still show your decal , do n't buy it
i like the case , the color is nice but my laptop does not shut all the way with it <unk> it will protect it but would have preferred a better fit
i bought this cover for my niece along with the keyboard cover she loves the both of them , especially the color she has gotten a lot of compliments on them
the case came in sooner than i expected quality is good although it seems like with a nudge the case might pop out of my laptop but for me that wont be a problem as long as there 's something covering my laptop from scratches the color is light purple like its shown in the picture
i bought the topcase clear crystal case for my macbook pro # & # # ; it arrived within four days of me buying it off amazon . . at standard shipping speed and the case fits perfectly it 's exactly what i wanted -- a clear , case with a hint of shine i have an etsy sticker on the actual laptop , and the clear case does n't cover up the design at <unk> 's perfectly clear rubber <unk> on the bottom corners keep it from sliding around , and i love that i can still access all the ports great buy , great seller
this is a great case it snaps right into place i was worried about the ports not lining up but they fit wonderfully i also like that you can see the glow of the apple from under the case
i have had this case on my computer for a few months now there is a small crack in the case on the left corner , and a few scratches i am very impressed with how this case has held up , and protects my sticker on my computer i have stuffed my computer into bags and briefcases , and while trying to be careful , i am using it for all sorts of things , and in real life the case is holding up <unk> , and is all i could ask for , in a case that was not alot of $
could n't be a more perfect fit awesome glossy finish i have had other hard covers for my mac this but this one is by far the best make sure to put the top on right side up the first time cause it is super hard to get off to redo it fits so
i have had my topcase on my macbook for over # months it has protected my computer through a few accidental drops and prevented dings too the case does not even show very many signs of wear , just a few scratches on the bottom from tons of transportation i get compliments on my pretty purple laptop all the time , and have a matching keyboard cover from topcase as well and they both look and function well worth the money , good value
at first the case was great , but it falls apart i have emailed them regarding the issue with no responds i use a table at all times and never travel or carry it anywhere it is in one spot and not misused and very careful with it i am looking for a different company and case now
i ordered this lap too case because it said it would fit my apple lap top not only did it not fit it but it came to me cracked and when i called to return it the customer service people were very rude and would not let me
my daughter was very excited to get this case for her new laptop , but it definitely does n't live up to our expectations the color is n't as vibrant as it is shown , and the top piece of the case falls off whenever she moves her computer this makes it more annoying than it is helpful or protective my advice is to save your money and buy a better fitting case , because this one is n't worth it
i got this case for a friend for her birthday and i was happy with how fast it got here but was upset when she told me that the case had a crack on it very disappointed with this i am now waiting for a respond to my email to top case in order to either get my money back or have them send me another one and they should of replied faster than this by now .
the bottom fits perfectly but the top will not stay on no matter what i do . i paid for a broken case . and they do not reply ... and no help !
the bottom fits perfectly but the top will not stay on no matter what i do . i paid $ # for a <unk> case . just work on the snaps for the top case
first off , it came very promptly and i pleasantly surprised with that the color was extremely nice , however , no matter how many times i tried to snap the case on it kept falling off , which was very frustrating another thing that frustrated me was that nothing came in the package but the case , there was no sheet that showed my order or any phone number that i could call for <unk> i thought about trying to contact the seller via amazon , but for the price i paid for it , i do n't see the point of shipping it back
the color is great the bad part it does not do its job the top part keeps coming off what protection does that do i would send it back , but why pay that much to ship it back i will order another one from someone else now waste of money
pros : it looks good both the top and the bottom <unk> all have access the color is fine since i bought for my partner cons : the top side where you see the mac logo is round and slightly <unk> the logo i would have preferred the shape of the logo , i have another one and looks much better but if this does not bother you , the product is excellent
i thought the color would be a bright pink and that is what i wanted it almost looks red unless you are in really bright light and then it is actually pink the cut out for the apple symbol is also not correctly aligned and cute off some of the symbol however it is a very protective case i just expected a hot pink i even asked people to see what color they thought it was and most people told me it was red the seller shipped quickly and it was received on time i believe this is a great seller , the product just was n't exactly what i wanted
i received the item in time for christmas and i liked the cover case however , the pink keypad cover was found to be missing i am still waiting for it and hope to receive it soon
i loved the color of the case it was exactly what i was looking for . my only problem with it was the top part would n't stay on , so every time i opened my computer it fell off
the color of the hard case was a beautiful pink i thought i was going to like a hole on the apple logo but i did n't so i returned it if you do not care about having a hole on the apple logo then you 'd like this item
awesome color , durable , though have n't thrown it on the floor to see if it will prevent the screen from breaking waited a year to buy it and should have gotten it a lot sooner
very pretty color and nice fit i read the reviews on it and i honestly do n't understand why people say it does n't fit fits perfect and the circle over the apple symbol looks fine people need to stop complaining
unfortunately , it 's not even close to the right dimensions it 's obviously made for another netbook , maybe a # & # # ; pity , i really needed to find a protective casing for this too the cover is getting really scratched and dell no longer makes any accessories for it
i got this to protect the mini laptop and it is quite inadequate it does fit tight but so tight that if it were to fall the cover would break and so would the laptop i purchased a neoprene case for the protection it needs from my # yo son
im happy with the case it protects well but when i got it one of the kick stands is lose and i wanted a black one but other than that it 's a good
this product is very easy to install it protects the outside and corners of the netbook fairly well from scratches the shell does not cover the battery portion of the netbook for convenience , but also leaves that portion vulnerable to scratches its the best protector i 've found , and works wonderfully to keep the netbook in good physical conditions would recommend installing it as soon as you buy the netbook
the tailoring around the bag is in a terrible condition i am very upset and disappointed . i want a new bag before the # nd of august and i will return the other bag to the postman
bought this thinking it looks cute , and was very disappointed the fabric looks very cheap other than that , it is large and fits my laptop well , but as a college student i was looking for something more cute this was the best i could find the strap also makes it hard to carry , because the compartment part swings around everywhere as you walk with it
i really like this bag except for the color it is a very bright pink by the time i decided that it was too pink to use , it was too late to return
the bag is good but the outside pocket do not stay securly closed because of the way the velcro is on it one piece is <unk> and the other is vertical so it does not catch very well
this case is exactly what i was looking for , it has plenty of room to carry the laptop , and any accessory i needed to bring as well as a place for my <unk>
this will fit a # `` laptop my daughter 's laptop is # `` , and there is a lot of extra space the pocket on the front is great for discs or any <unk> -lrb- external hard drive , sim card reader -rrb- accessory and we love the pink color it also comes in a very dark blue or black
i purchased a new laptop and did n't want to pay the phenomenal prices that 's associated with laptop bags i saw this one and bought it and i 'm very pleased with my purchase it 's the right size that was stated and it looks like i paid a small fortune for it i purchased another laptop bag from a computer store years ago and it cost me a lot this bag looks like it was pricey without the high price i definitely recommend this bag
i priced the bags at best buy & this is way cheaper ! ! i love that it has lots of space for storage and lots of compartments i have a # . # inch hp and it fits just fine the color is a soft pink and it looks cute another thing i liked were the clips for the straps are metal not plastic like other bags i love this bag ! ! get this bag , you wo n't regret it ! !
this is a very high quality computer case just do not expect to pack in a bunch of other extras in with your computer the two external pockets are great for the charger and other small items but inside the main sleeve with the computer , you will be hard pressed to fit even a small folder of papers
this is a great cary case for macair or small pc plenty of pocket space for mouse and other items i like to take with me the one think that could be improved on is the smooth shoulder pad on the strap could be rubber or suede to stay on you shoulder and not slip off
it is a great bag very well made - i had to return because my mac pro did n't fit well with it 's protective cover without the cover it would be an outstanding travel bag ! ! !
this is a perfect case for a # . # laptop or notebook sturdy construction and nice materials the # zippered slots on the front of the case are very useful for extras plus there is a pocket in the back dealing with baseline bargain center was a pleasure will order from them
i used two weeks , and not fun to bring it now it is in my closet and wo n't use it for a while until i find some usage might be a good <unk> for tool bag or something
my ogio backpack was getting old and i decided to go back to a shoulder type bag i also wanted to get something lighter and smaller for my yoga pro # this bag fits what i 'm looking for it has enough compartments to accommodate my pens and other essentials for work however , the shoulder strap is not removable which is a little disappointment padding is a little thin luckily i bought a laptop sleeve beforehand and used it in conjunction with the laptop bag i recommend this bag for style , function and value
this was a good case , especially for the price it was on sale for $ # it was a gift for my <unk> , he said it has a lot of compartments for all of his accessories i should have gotten him a # inch , he would have had more room for his charger , but very nice , not cheap looking and seems to be durable if there is a issue i will update
met all of my expectations , room enough to carry a book or two and a few mac accessories like the cord and internal pockets for meager office supplies ; roomy and compact
i got this bag to use with my # . # & # # ; macbook air my air is also in the incase sleeve you can purchase for it the product is very durable with a good luck to it there 's enough room for my external hd , superdrive , and cables in the big without adding bulk
this bag is perfect for me the outer most pocket is perfect for me to put my phone charger and a couple usb cables in ... the middle pocket has a mini pocket in it that is perfect for my ipad mini i could not be happier with this bag
this is my second kenneth cole <unk> bag it is perfect it holds a lot ... it is made extremely well ... the protection for the computer is there ... there are a load of functional compartments to use for extra junk it is also very reasonably priced
i love this little case it 's the perfect size and easy to carry with just enough room for accessories it 's not only functional , it 's attractive my only complaint is i wish it was available in some different colors
the title says it all ! , but i will <unk> i have the dell d # . # this bag is the perfect size for this unit being able to hold all acessories with ease the bag is very classy looking , and does not look oversize i would probably run out of room trying to point out all the well thought out features , and to be honest i do not please easly
the item i purchased appear to be low quality with several imperfections the item did not appear the same as the product i purchase from a retail company for my other laptop - material , thickness , stitches and logo is upside down
bought this sight unseen , and was iffy on the price the outside material feels a bit cheap , the inside lining feels ok -lrb- furry protection for your laptop -rrb- fits the rmbp # & # # ; a bit loosely the pockets are probably good enough for the adapter and a few dongles , maybe an external hard drive no secure pockets for small tablets , though as a laptop sleeve it works well , but as an overall office bag it falls a bit short on expectations
this case is well constructed , it fits your macbook like a glove . the cord barely fits into the front pocket , there is zero extra space in this bag for anything other then your computer and charger
i bought this last month and so far it has been great it is nicely padded and soft on the inside and my macbook pro # `` fits perfectly , definitely recommend it
this is exactly what i was looking for when i went on a search for a bag for the macbook air i just purchased i wanted something slim , that would fit my air , without it being loose my other # inch laptop bag was too thick that even strapped down it had too much room to play this bag is a decent size , fits the air nicely , has two pockets in the front that can hold smaller items theres a rear pocket that does n't zip that can hold the charger , or my ipad mini just fine it would have been the perfect bag , if it was a little more robust , but then again that would make it thicker and heavier <unk> was what i was looking for and i got it in this bag
just enough room for the air and charger , a couple of pens and a notebook perfect for the minimalist who wants a balance between protecting the laptop and not carrying too much weight well thought out design , nice shoulder strap option
made for mac , but it fit 's my dell xps # perfectly the case has nice padding all around , is about # the size , and a fraction of the weight of my previous case
used this case for the hp laptop pavilion # pc and it was a perfect fit securely held the laptop extra pockets fit the mouse and power cord case is very durable overall quite satisfied with the construction and durability of the case my son uses it daily for school definitely would buy again and recommend for anyone to purchase
this case is great , the materials and construction is of the highest quality it 's only flaw is the # front pockets , which are a little hard to get into , your hand barely makes it thru . it also has a short back pocket but you ca n't put much there than a small book or a notebook . other than that is a great case , more like sleeve with handles .
we 've carried our mackbook pro in this case many times it 's well padded , sleek , yet has room for the charger and even a mouse if you use one we feel safe with our device in this case
like the case on the computer i was at it looked blue , but it is <unk> or their fancy name for purple mbp # fits perfect even with case protector on it side pockets barley fit the charger had to take the plug in off pack the charger before you put the computer in and you will have a little easier time
it is a perfect sleeve for my rmbp i really like it this is the second of its kind that i have bought in the past its simple , elegant , cushioned on inside
this was a gift for my mom , who had recently gotten a macbook and was toting it around in a backpack ! the case fits like a glove and it 's comfortable to carry it has handles and a shoulder strap and the price was excellent all in all , a great deal and a great product
i love this case i had recently gifted my macbook pro to a good friend because it was -lrb- do n't laugh -rrb- too heavy to lug through airports the unibody construction attracted me to the macbook pro ... the air version is where i want to be this case is awesome in it 's simplicity and lightweight construction i can carry the power cord , the ethernet dongle , and ... if i choose , the outboard superdrive
i first bought this case at a local electronics store , but amazon had it for $ # less ... so returned the other one before i used it got this carry case in # days . . great amazon service and delivery enough room in outside pocket for my kindle fire hd , plus section for the charger for both
i bought this for my # & # # ; sony vaio and it fits perfectly even with the optional extended life battery there are plenty of pockets to hold a wireless mouse , charger , and other small accessories nicely lined and padded
first found at best buy paid $ # decided after do n't know why i did n't check first but anyways i wanted to check ratings on it and amazon popped up with the same product for $ # ! i returned the bag to best buy same day waited a week and literally got the same exact bag i wanted because it has the exact description on amazon and i love it ! it 's really soft on the inside , has a long side pocket and two small ones in front with one zipper that perfectly fits your charger and cord so worth the wait
i like this sleeve because it has handles which is great because i can pull the laptop out without worrying about dropping it it is light and durable the interior is great with the soft faux material to prevent any scratching the laptop nice to carry with shoulder strap if you decide to carry you laptop i like the pockets to put other things like the external dvd/cd drive for my macbook air this was priced much better than the plain sleeve at the apple store
this bag is fantastic it is very well made and fits my macbook pro # & # # ; -lrb- late # -rrb- very nicely there is just enough room in the pockets to fit your charger and a couple of other small items the pocket on the back of the case is very handy too i would definitely recommend this case for anyone that wants a very well made case to protect their mac
this case is extremely well made i 'm impressed that the machine stitching is reinforced and the fabric is good quality which is very durable the inside has a # sections one side is a very soft pocket which holds the computer and is spacious enough so my computer fits well even with the protective sleeve the other is large enough to hold papers , pencils , and even a book which is very convenient there are zipper pockets on the outside my husband bought one almost # years ago and it 's still in great shape so when i got a computer i automatically chose this case i like the strap so i can carry it over my shoulder or wear it messenger style so my hands are free the deep purple color is feminine but also professional this is a great case
i bought this bag as a gift and it 's great it seems sturdy , the lining is very soft , and there are a number of compartments for different items the only downside is that the outside pockets have somewhat awkward closures and the openings are n't wide enough as a result
this is a very durable well made bag needed something with a shoulder strap + zip pockets for my laptop + accessories that is protective from all our seattle rain this works perfect
wow ! ! this case was more than i anticipated i 'd seen a similar incase at our local apple store , and it was way over priced when i ordered this case , i thought & # # ; maybe it is n't like the one i saw at apple & # # ; . . but boy was i wrong it has plenty of space for your mac book charger , and the front of it i can even place my ipad in i really like the felt cushioning as well to protect the mac book great buy ! !
i looked around for a case that would not be too cumbersome and yet hold all the things i needed for my macbook air the thing i like about this case is that it fits my computer - which has a translucent protective case attached - quite snuggly and has exterior pockets to carry cords and other paraphernalia i looked at a lot of cases and this one was the best value for the money
i bought this case for my daughter 's macbook i have the same one for mine and love it this one was much less expensive than in the apple store - thank you
this bag is just perfect for my # & # # ; macbook air and the two zipper pockets are large enough to hold power adapter , small notebook with a couple pens my # & # # ; tablet also fits -lrb- barely -rrb- in one of the front pockets which is great construction seems very durable so far it is even better than i had hoped
i have this case 's bigger brother which has held up very well when i needed a case for my zenbook , there really was n't another choice enough room for everything you would need in there for accessories does n't add much weight , and is easy to access
this is the case i was looking for it is durable , comfortable shoulder pad , nice color and it is weather resistant i wanted it to fit my ipad and the keyboard and have room for paperwork and it does
this case is great for a small laptop or ipad it provides a pretty good cushion for protection , and the color shows little to no dirt at all very nice , sleek & simple , but professional laptop bag
i 'll put this as simple as possible i own a macbook air # , this bag fits like a glove it 's protective , well made and very light it 's also very comfortable to carry around all day i 'd buy it over and over again
this bag is great , it has enough space to carry a # ' macbook pro , it also has many pockets to put other stuff , the desing and materials are great too
i loved this case my wife does too so i bought one for her i bought the # & # # ; case for my # & # # ; macair however i have to squeeze it the cord
bought this for my lenovo thinkpad x # and it fits perfectly has a nice soft and padded interior to help protect my laptop just the right size and great quality for a <unk> laptop carrying case side pockets with zippers have room to store extra cables , power pack , and an external hard drive and whatever small documents you like very satisfied with this case
this bag is perfect it fits my # `` mac like a glove what i like most about it is the choice between handles or the strap it also has pockets in the front for the power chord , pens , etc . very well made as well , i think i have had mine for about a year and it is still in great shape
the bag is beautiful , item as described however after two business travel trips , i have noticed some of the red italian leather coloring has come off i am not sure now to correct this problem , but i am trying to use the bag gently and was disappointed after only two travel trips the bag is already showing signs of usage
love how it looks and how much it holds i 'd say it 's true to what you see in the pictures the only reason i gave it a # instead of anything higher , is the fact that this case is so heavy i ca n't use it as my purse too , despite all the space , because it is so heavy that i ca n't <unk> than the case and my laptop over my shoulder
