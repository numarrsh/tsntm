i first received mine as a gift for college , and it quickly became an absolute necessity during my day i loved it so much i bought this blue version for my girlfriend , and she says the same it has more compartments than you 'll ever need , and holds up to a # inch laptop i have been using this bag for almost # years now , and there is not a single malfunction with it it looks practically new
we 've tried a lot of brands ful seems to be the most durable and well made never a broken zipper we beat these things up and have super huge heavy books in them all the time holds up very well washed several times and comes out like new
i needed it to travel and i found it to be very comfortable when running from one flight to another it fit my # & # # ; laptop easily , my kindle , iphone , a change of clothes , my daily meds and a bunch of other stuff
so far i 'm loving this bag it has so many places to store things for my day it can hold all of my textbooks and my laptop without trouble i hope this will last for many years to come
this is a great bag and works great ! it has a sealed bottom which is great my last bag would soak water up on the boat i would order this again no problem at all fast delivery ! ! ! ! ! !
extending handle is not well made quit working after less than # months of use seller would n't replace because it was out of their warranty period i do not recommend this product
the handle would not stay locked in the extended position , which is something others had mentioned as well but the return process was easy and i received a prompt and full refund
the extending handle would not stay up also , there is a significant design flaw the top flap folds all the way back allowing you half of the top opening the flap with the carry handle is stiff and flops closed all the time you can not fully `` open `` the case to dig into it when needed the interior has a soft <unk> covering the retractable handle housing it would easily <unk> the look is nice shame the design was so bad
the first trip out the clasp broke fast forward # months and the front pouch is ripped and the one side pocket is gone for light use you ca n't beat it and the price is great however i ca n't recommend it for pilots
it is bigger then we thought he has not used it as of yet he had a regular leather briefcase with combination locks that has worn out and torn it was a birthday gift that has not been utilized yet
this will be short it is larger than you think it can hold a lot it can almost act as carry-on luggage it is not as stylish as you think it is not as easy to handle -lrb- <unk> -rrb- as other brief cases no real slot or separation for a laptop or other delicate items needing separation
this is a very nice case ... it just turned out to be a bit larger than i expected had to return it for this reason the seller made the return process very easy with great communication , etc . certainly would recommend them
at first i was a little <unk> about buying this with few reviews but i am very glad i made the purchase the handle works great though the one attached directly on top worries me that it might break but great item nonetheless
i bought one for my department and one for our attorney it makes it so much easier to tote things back and forth to court and meetings thinking about buying a third one
it has more room than i expected the back cover was a little stiff at first but moves easier with use i have had the case for four weeks and use it weekly for meetings it is working well for me
im happy with my purchase , i bought this # months ago and knock on wood , so far i like it , with all the manuals that i have to carry this is perfect
i purchased the bag # months ago this is the second one of these the first one the handle kept breaking this one the wheeled carrier started falling apart and the company said they could n't repair it they offered me a # % discount on a new one they cost too much for # months of use
the laptop bag is good quality , but the rolling attachment is nothing more than cheap junk the wheels are entirely plastic and look and feel like the cheapest junk that china could produce
the laptop case could n't be nicer : beautiful leather ; useful compartments ; fine <unk> handle ; case removes from cart section making it versatile however , the wheels are weak , cheaply made , and inadequate for their purpose i am surprised that mcklein <unk> on the wheels after putting together such a fine product otherwise some companies use inline skate wheels , which are far superior to the ones on this item
i purchased this because i travel a lot and needed a bag that has the option of attaching the plastic dolly but allows the dolly to be removed when i use it daily i 've used the plastic dolly for about # months and today the handle broke off from baggage handlers at united the design is flimsy and it does n't surprise me that it broke as for the bag itself , it 's fantastic
this is one classy , awesome bag much nicer than the pictures show , beautiful leather , well constructed i 've had no problems with the wheels and handle that folks seem concerned with
it got dirty on the very first use could not clean it after the computer was in the sleeve it was difficult to put the cord in the side pocket sent it back
the product pictured , has handles the case received does not the vendor confirmed the item # as being correct , and indicated that they do n't carry this product with handles some of the customer reviews reference the handles on the product i am very disappointed in not having received the item pictured and referenced in the reviews furthermore , i have to pay the cost of return shipping , which will not be refunded to me
purchased for my # `` asus model g # sx , and it does not fit not even close if your # `` laptop is particularly large -lrb- over # `` -rrb- or has a greater thickness -lrb- i.e . gaming laptop with larger fan for cooling , etc . -rrb- , check before you buy
love this bag , perfect for a large laptop light weight and has a compartment for power supplies four months after use the handles are ripping at the seams of the case very dissapointed , i do n't even use it everyday and the handles are ripping
new laptops for christmas that were # . # inches we wanted laptop sleeve that was neoprene and had handles to make ease of carrying the larger laptop read reviews and liked picture although settled for plain black as only color choice when cases arrived they had small side strap and no handles as seen in picture this is not what we wanted and feel <unk> description was deceiving
this item smelled so awful that i could smell it through the mailing box after a few days the smell went away it is a nice case but doesnt really fit my case well i can get it to zip without a mm to spare my daughter has the same case and loved it
out of the box this is a great bag the zippers are smooth and the ability to cary the laptop or use a <unk> bag is great however , after about a month one of the two zippers have failed leaving me to wonder if this is a defective product or just a cheap zipper
overall i am satisfied with the purchase of this bag it fits our acer aspire model # as # g- # the front pocket has room for the power cord and a mouse , it bulges out but to me that is n't a big deal the only con i had with this purchase is the # st picture shows the handles on the top and i really liked that feature if thats what you like about it , i do n't recommend this bag for you it only has the single handle on the side
seems like a good sleeve , but does n't quite fit my asus g # , which is disappointing it 's a pretty bulky laptop , so i knew i 'd have trouble finding something to fit if i really push i think i could get the thing to zip closed , but it would be stretching it out substantially and probably rip it or something i imagine gave it # stars because for more typical sized laptops it 's probably an excellent choice hoping to find something similar for larger laptops
i have a dell # `` laptop , and it 's hard to find a good neoprene sleeve that fits these larger laptops the handles are helpful but i really chose this item because i insist on having a zippered outer pocket to hold some usb cables and a travel mouse however , the zippered outer pocket has a zipper that is pulled with a little string rather than a metal clasp , and the zipper is not only hard to pull but also keeps getting stuck it 's simply a cheapo zipper higher quality zippers would make this sleeve a great one , but with zippers that always get stuck , i 'll be returning the product very sad !
one of the best purchases i made this year from amazon this case holds my # `` laptop very easily , laptop slides <unk> with room to spare i can also insert my writing tablet with cushion in with the laptop and still have room there is a side pocket that i can put a few accessories in , like a mouse , i hate touch pads , and a few minor cords the case offers sufficient protection for minor bumps but not long drops i usually throw the laptop and case in my backpack for traveling
thought this would be a good sleeve type case for my new laptop which was # inches works great , easy to carry and has a pocket for power chord and or accessories great for the price
the only thing that could have made this purchase better -lrb- besides the obvious of cheaper - <unk> -rrb- was if it had a bit more padding but it really is quite sufficient for my needs and was reasonably priced it 's exactly what i needed and expected nicely made , love the handles , red color is great -lrb- not pink or orange ! -rrb- , and nice and slim love that the outside pocket is zippered i had a really hard time finding a sleeve anywhere else that would accommodate my # `` toshiba i definitely recommend this product will be putting to the real test in a couple weekends when i go to a conference
this product was completely worth the money spent , especially because it was very difficult to find a case that would fit my labtop at such a low cost i love the color of the case as well as the material it is made out of the case also has an additional pocket on the front side of it ; which comes in handy when it comes to storing cords and accessories like that shipping was fantastic it came very quickly , earlier than the expected <unk> date the case was packaged in a hard plastic covering then into a box <unk> , not very sturdy or protective no carrying strap ; just the handles overall , this is a great product and i would recommend it to anyone
i ordered this product after ordering the case logic macbook pro # `` for my dell inspiron # `` laptop <unk> to say my computer did n't fit the macbook pro the <unk> edge slipsuit , though a bit larger than i wanted , fit my computer with addition space to spare it is heavy-duty enough to hold my heavy laptop and it 's bulky electric plug i am very happy with this purchase
this case fits my toshiba # . # lt with room to spare it 's not the best built case out there but works great for a dust cover and some travel i can get a long and bulky power cord and mouse in the front pocket and a few other items would fit as well it has a decent soft carry handle and is pretty good looking in black with white trim for the price it ca n't be beat i looked forever and finally settled on this ... glad i did as it does it 's job nicely
used this for my # `` dell xps laptop it fits snug and does the job of protecting the laptop nicely the handles on it are helpful as well like the title says , it is good value
this was just what i wanted for my husband 's laptop the carrying handles make it easy to use by itself , or you can slide it into a large backpack for extra padding the only problem i had is that i initially ordered the wrong size -lrb- this one -rrb- , so had to return it for a smaller version measure the screen size on the diagonal , not the full diagonal dimension of the laptop i returned this one for the # `` version and it fits pretty well -- could actually have gone with the # . # `` , but not worth returning again
this is the # rd laptop sleeve that i 've purchased lots of room for my hp laptops with extra space on the exterior for storing the cords , mouse , etc . definitely a must have
it 's very slim but has enough padding to protect your oversized laptop - i use it with my # & # # ; - fits snugly in there it 's not bulky like a laptop bag , but at the same time it has nice handles unlike some of the other <unk> - so you can carry your laptop in it the side compartment is big enough to stuff your charger and mouse -lrb- looks a little bulky if you put a large charging cable in there -rrb- durable and good quality product i bought this a few years ago with my # & # # ; hp laptop laptop looks like it may die in the next few months , but this bag looks still as new as the day i bought it and as functional despite heavy usage
i am very pleased with the # . # inch laptop sleeve that fits my toshiba laptop a # `` sleeve is readily available in the stores , but i needed the larger size it came in a matter of a few days and fits perfectly i also like the outside pocket for cord storage as well
i had such a hard time finding a holder for my laptop that was n't either extremely ugly or extremely expensive great quality , looks nice and easy to tote anywhere i only wish it came with a strap , but other than that , i 'm very pleased
purchased for acer aspire # , # . # screen this sleeve fit perfectly and gives the protection that i needed for a computer that never leaves the house like the pocket that allows for cd 's , flash drives and even a mouse if you do n't mind the bulge offers a <unk> of protection keeps out dust etc . again , perfect for my needs
i purchased this bag through amazon and i was extremely satisfied with the whole experience they delivered it within days and i did not need to pay extra for shipping the bag fits my new hp g # -lrb- # . # `` -rrb- perfectly , the front pocket has enough space for your wireless mouse and other accessories it 's a little tight for the ac cord but still a good buy it 's the perfect bag to carry your laptop within your house <unk> or store it in a room it is not made for travel outside , however you can still do so if you wish , but i would not recommend it
this is a good quality laptop case i could n't find any cases big enough for my laptop in stores , then i came across this on amazon i have been using this case for over a year to carry my laptop around with me on vacations and to class occasionally i have not had any problems with the case tearing up or anything like that , and even after carrying it around so much it still looks brand new i accidentally dropped my laptop once when it was in this case , and it did not get damaged at all
i bought this sleeve for my friend 's birthday gift and she absolutely loves it she can fit her # . # inch laptop in it along with some other items she uses with the laptop very well made and not as heavy as a regular case
got this for my husband for christmas for his # inch dell computer it was the perfect fit and so much better than those big , bulky computer covers he really liked it
i have a dell studio # . # inch laptop and it fits great in this bag the front pocket is big enough to hold the charger and mouse , but not much more if you 're looking for a slim bag this is the one you want
i recently bought a new laptop that measures # . # inches i had a difficult time finding a slip cover because the common measurement is # inches even i found this , i love it
it does the job it is sleek , well-padded , has nice zippers and a convenient handle the side pocket is an added bonus , as well - just enough room to stuff a power cord and/or mouse into i have a dell studio # -lrb- # in . -rrb- and it fits perfectly i am going to use this sleeve to add extra padding for my laptop when i pack it into my backpack if i ever have to only transport the laptop - this bag is sufficient i totally recommend
an awesome case for # inch laptops that 's just right for a great price ! extra pouch for power supply or other <unk> can also fits <unk> hs # a laptop cooling <unk> pad , for # -inch laptops , -lrb- black which i feel is a must and the best chill mat yet ! laptop fits more snugly too ; nice & light ; one of the best ones on amazon.com !
this slipsuit is great i do have a full on laptop case , but when it comes to riding my motorcycle to work this slipsuit works <unk> a backpack has side pocket , that fits my wireless mouse and power cords i do have a # . # gateway and it fits perfect also my did come with handles
we had just bought a # `` laptop and wanted to buy something that would offer some protection when we packed it for traveling the fit was good , the product is sturdy the handles on top and extra zippered compartment on the outside were an added bonus it was just what i wanted
this thing is great it 's very well-constructed , the neoprene is as thick as you 'd expect , and it 's exactly the right size for a # . # `` laptop -lrb- i have an hp pavilion -rrb- the pocket on the outside is just big enough for a mouse and some cables if you 're looking for a <unk> bag , like a piece of luggage or a school bag , then of course , this is n't what you want use this sleeve to protect your laptop inside your carry-on or your school bag if you really wanted to , i 'm sure you could sew a shoulder strap onto this thing , but it 's great for what it 's meant to be
i upgraded from a # & # # ; laptop to a # & # # ; and had a horrible time finding a sleeve to be able to carry my laptop around i finally found this one on amazon and could n't be happier i feel like my laptop is safe in it from the weather and have even spilled a coffee down the front of it without it making it through the top fabric yes , it 's not a thick thing to secure it in a fall but that 's not why i bought it i did notice a smell the first couple of days but after it being out of the bag the smell dissipated and i do n't notice it at all months later i almost gave this bag # -stars because it does n't have a handle or the loops for a handle but i did n't think that was fair , as i bought it knowing those were not included yes , i would love it if this company made one with that option but for this sleeve and for this price , you 're getting a great product
this is perfect for what i wanted i have a messenger bag that i was planning on using with my laptop but it wasnt going to be protected enough so , i purchased this to use for the protection aspect of my messenger bag i loves it ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! perfect for a # . # inch laptop
this sleeve fits my # & # # ; computer perfectly with enough space between the zipper and the computer so that it slides in and out of the sleeve with ease the zipper opens and closes without tugging or pulling the outside pocket extends across the body of the sleeve and is quite spacious i like this sleeve because it is well constructed and is sleek in design and a very pretty shade of red for additional protection for my computer i kept the packing form that came inside the bag and i can still slide my computer inside the case and <unk> it closed with no problem when carrying my computer in this sleeve by mobile edge i feel it is reasonably protected however when traveling for the best protection for my computer i put the sleeve inside of my computer bag and carry it that way
do not buy this bag if you value your laptop at all ! ! the design of the shoulder strap clips are such that they detach from the bag without warning this has happened on two separate occasions and both times damaging my laptop which brings me to the second major flaw ; there 's absolutely no padding for this bag in the even the straps do become unclipped
do not buy this item if you value your equipment i placed my new ipad in the rear flap pocket when i had to pick the bag up by the handle it decided that it was going to drop the contents out of the rear flap pocket all over the parking lot my brand new ipad is now pieces of junk i 'm returning this bag immediately
i bought this bag and because the handle is n't centered it pulled and ripped up the backing in the side compartment the <unk> just let go becuase of the off centered placement of the handle
i need to add to the warnings from others that the latches attached to the should strap will come off unexpectedly i have dropped my laptop more than once in the almost # years i 've used this thing it happens as i jump out of my car on my way to the office it 's unfortunate that this happens the bag itself is nice and has nice slots and pockets i need to give it one star since the latch problem makes this bag a danger to your precious laptop
i can not believe you would design a bag with the handle on one side , which makes it very difficult , if not impossible to carry in a decent manner so now i have paid $ # plus dollars for a bag i ca n't use
i paid ten extra dollars for next day shipping and did not receive the item until four days later when the item arrived it had what looks like a a <unk> stain running down the front the bag does have substantial amount of compartments though , and the padding on the back is also very comfortable however the rest of the padding and inside liners are pretty cheap and make a loud <unk> noise whenever you move the cloth around the id holder is fastened using velcro which does n't seem as safe as a carabiner or ring system overall i still prefer case logic
i purchased this in anticipation of a trip to dc first , the offset handle is completely impractical two handles would be a perfect solution otherwise , it is completely <unk> it was a very frustrating experience at the airport and on the metro the plastic clip came undone once , causing the bag to hit the floor with my laptop inside i am returning this and have purchased sometime that will hopefully work better at office depot
i have had this bag for # months the size is perfect for <unk> a laptop and some additional papers on the negative side , the carry handle is off-center , so the weight does not distribute properly additionally , the interior liner has ripped so that the rear flap pulls open every time i lift the bag i guess you could say that you get what you pay for i certainly would n't buy it again
i 'm not very happy with this bag the primary reason is that the handle for the bag actually attaches to the back of the bag , not the top -lrb- or both sides with a double handle -rrb- this causes everything in the bag to slide forward and turns it into almost a duffle back instead of a slim briefcase type bag other than that , the bag is ok , but no better than just ok i considered sending it back , but for the hassle , i will just muscle through it while trying to find a better one
yes it fits your large laptop but the weight of the laptop caused the handle to rip off withing a few months of use i loved the look but the quality was not there
the canvas itself is an okay material , as mentioned by other reviewers the laptop compartment is not very well padded the plastic clips that hold the large pocket closed broke after completely normal use piece by piece until the bag was essentially no longer usable there is a lifetime manufacturer warranty , but you need to pay for the shipping until they determine it was actually a manufacturer defect
i 've been using this bag daily for the last month i 'm disappointed that this bag comes so close to being good but falls short on some serious points - thick canvas <unk> padding in laptop <unk> olive <unk> bad - no swivels on shoulder strap -lrb- causes strap to unclip if twisted ! ! ! - front flap closures too large -lrb- frequently pinch fingers during closing , draws blood ! - poor <unk> handle is off center -lrb- causing bag to hang towards your legs when walking . i 'm writing this review after dropping my laptop in the parking lot at work for the second time due to a twist in the shoulder strap causing the strap to unclip as my laptop did not suffer any noticeable damage i can say that the padded compartment in this bag is acceptable also ibm <unk> are tough pcs
my son bought this for school it worked well for about # months , then the plastic brackets that hold the strap to the bag broke first one and the other a couple weeks later now one of the front fasteners is broken would be great if parts that handle all of the stress were made with something besides cheap plastic of course return option has expired
this bag is well constructed of good materials , but it is very badly designed the loops to hold pens/pencils do n't actually hold them in there are straps that look like they can slide but they do n't the cushioned laptop pocket is nice , and the <unk> strap is nice , but some of the other pockets hold very little
here is what the reviews said that i ignored at my <unk> - the handle is not aligned along the center of gravity making it useless - there is no padding for the laptop on the side closest to your body - there are no zipped compartments for smaller items it looks great and is priced right but will be going back as it 's not practical for laptop use
i looked to see if i could return this but after just # months it is too late the bag ripped all along the top back side they sewed thin material in the lining that holds it closed
it is durable , good looking , well constructed , but difficult to use it has two enormous buckles keeping the flap closed they are very stiff and <unk> their only function is hold the flap down it needs a lighter , more efficient closure system
you get what you pay for , as the saying goes it was cheap -- <unk> -- the handle was awkward after using it for a few weeks the cheap inside line tore away and the bag is useless and irreparable it was so cheap that i felt it is not worth returning live and learn unless you are just carrying light papers , no book or computer this would probably have lasted disappointed , but not dismayed , for as we all know & # # ; you get what you pay for . . & # # ; i did not put it at one star because & # # ; hate & # # ; is too strong an <unk> to attach to a cheap bag
i like the look of the bag , and the materials appear sturdy enough but , now that i 'm holding the actual bag i realize that none of the many pockets have zippers , or other secure means of closure also , there are no handy , easily accessible small
i thought this would be useful as my second carry-on for flights and other brief trips the material is nice enough , but there are insufficient pockets and things will fall out if it gets accidentally turned upside down the various compartments are only secured by a velcro strap inside that is inadequate zipper closures would work better bottom line , the thing will spend most of its time in my basement and will miss out on my travel i do not recommend it for business travelers . ... too many design flaws
the way the handle is <unk> to the bag all of the weight is transferred to the inner liner right below the handle this causes even moderate weight -lrb- one text book and a laptop -rrb- to cause the seam to bust while the bag is still functional after that point as the weight is more evenly distributed , it looks bad on the inside and may lead to further breakdown i have now switched to the shoulder strap and have no issues and no other damage very poorly designed , and , would n't know , the breaking of the seam occurred # days outside the return window if you 're looking for a shoulder bag , this may be it as it protects my laptop , fits a whole bunch , and has compartment to stay organized if you think your going to rely on the rubber handle , i 'd keep looking
not a bad bag however the handle is placed in a very akward position it 's offset from the top and the bag will keep hitting you in the leg it could use more storage pockets as well the pen holder is wierd i plan on buying something else
these guys almost <unk> it two issues : # only one carry handle on top and it is off center need a pair or better attention to bag balance with the placement of single handle . # the interior velcro straps are not well thought out the elastic laptop compartment strap works better for securing all the compartments using the velcro pad supplied for that purpose the strap provided for that purpose is too long -lrb- or the pad is not placed right . the laptop compartment is well padded and big enough for most any laptop , the other compartments are good , too there are not enough smaller compartments for cell phones , credit cards , business cards , etc . but , for # bucks , it is getting the job done as intended
overall , a good laptop bag however , i 'm surprised with a few weaknesses that show the designers really were n't thinking about business users first of all , there 's no business card slot on the ` gadget ' panel on the front of the bag -lrb- under the flap -rrb- that really surprised me ... how would you not expect people to need business cards in the bag secondly , the pen holders on the gadget panel are sized only for stick pens ... nothing larger will fit so - the bag is good , but not exceptional , it gets an ` average ' # stars
i realize it 's a & # # ; messenger bag & # # ; , and not a brief case but if the manufacturer is going to attach a handle , at least make it functional the placement of the handle was enough for me to give the bag to a friend the closing mechanisms are decent , but the pockets in the interior are not well organized it 's a decent value , but just not for me
its ok for what it is no problem but questioned the material its eco friendly but a sticker says that its has material that causes cancer on it and does n't tell you what part i just do n't put anything in my mouth , hahaha
love the look of this bag and it functions fine to carry my <unk> laptop , but there are things i do n't love the bag does n't hang flat and the handle does n't help it really is n't placed well i also like the closure for security , but i ended up cutting them off as they always caught on stuff
nice looking bag , good color with nice trim big problem is that there 's one handle attached off-center on one side of the bag , so when you 're carrying it by the handle , the bag hangs lopsided to the other side they should have used two handles , one on each side of center , so the bag hangs with even weight on both sides it 's a shame , there are some nice compartments inside the <unk> is a big problem , i 'd suggest keep looking i 'm going to do just that
the red in the view was more of a <unk> red and the item is a bright red also , and this is my fault , but when i see something viewed as eco-friendly , i expect it to be made of recycled materials , not just simply made of cotton
the mobileedge canvas messenger bag is a nice bag , but a hand full of design problems have me looking for a replacement already the top handle is on the back side of the bag , when you carry the bad it does n't hang straight down , it hangs at a angle , which makes carrying the bag by the handle awkward the pockets on the panel with the id holder and pen holders do n't seem to keep anything in them for long , items fall out of the bag all the time
i was torn between # and # the product essentially met what it said it was , but it could be a # with just a few adjustments it has no <unk> , which is pretty standard in laptop bags now and it has no zippered comparments , everything is velcro i could see in a year of heavy use the velcro fading and will need to replace a nice zippered compartment on the outside for quick access and a little bigger comparments for the brick and mouse would have made this a # it does sit nice on the shoulder and quality seems good for now update # - as expected the velcro on the back side no longer holds together much lifting the bag by the handle , it opens wide i will be looking for a new bag .
bag was little to big for my use i needed a # inch or smaller to take it to office everyday with my news paper and lunch ... very good materials , well made
the offset placement of the carrying handle helps to balance the bag if you are also lugging a laptop without the laptop in its slot and a few heavy textbooks in their logical place carrying by the handle is quite awkward because the bag is very <unk> unfortunately use of the shoulder strap does not alleviate the pressing against your lower body i am updating my review to report additional <unk> of the offset handle after # months of use the bag is splitting , tearing at the stress point of the <unk> this bag is <unk> it is not a messenger bag it is a <unk> carrying bag
i was looking for a bag to carry my business stuff in i was looking for a combination of an engineering bag , laptop bag , and briefcase this fit the bill very nicely it has a padded pouch for most laptops along with several other main compartments to carry other large items like files , clip boards , ect there are numerous small pockets along the front under the main flap for numerous items as well as pen holders to hold numerous pens , pencils , ect it also has a thick shoulder strap to make carrying very easy the only complaint i have is that it difficult to clean it can be thrown in the wash but due to some of the materials on the inside , i do not recommend doing it often leaving only a wipe down as a main cleaning method
the good : excellent proportions , fabric has been durable a good bag for daily use suggestions for improvement the bag is affordable enough that i would have liked to see metal instead of plastic on the clasps and connectors at a slightly higher bag price
good quality bag , lots of pockets the only negative is that the small handle is <unk> on the bag such that it hangs awkwardly when carried with this handle i have n't figured out why the handle is like that all things considered , i am happy with my purchase
i 've had it for about # years and it functions well and has held up , but with a couple problem the shoulder strap on mine will sometimes come unsnapped for reasons i ca n't identify as i pick it up , causing it fall also , if you use it briefcase-style which i generally do n't , as others have said , it is oddly weighted to one side which makes it kind of awkward to carry anything in it you 'd think a bag would be able to get that type of design feature correct
to date this has been a good bag to carry and use it has plenty of space for the items i need to carry on a daily basis the only issue i 'm having is the velcro on the portion where the laptop is stored is coming off the stitching has pulled away i bought this in august # and it 's now january #
i have had this bag for about two years it is funtional and well built the shoulder strap does tend to bite the shoulder when carrying a load in it
nice looking bag , seems well constructed , holds what i need to have with me will be interested to see how it holds up to everyday use i look very cool when using it
this fits my dell inspiron # laptop perfectly i 'm very happy with it i love the <unk> look of it i 've actually put pins and patches on it to make it more me works great for that
my teenage grandson picked this back the week before school started he received it in plenty of time for school and thinks it is the best bag he ever used
