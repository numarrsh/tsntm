this very good quality backpack has a special compartment for my # `` asus k # u , and it fits <unk> i was worried due to side opening that it would be small , it 's not and it will fit my notebook with it 's sleeve the hidden pockets and lined audio device pouch is as excellent as the rain cover all in all a very well designed go bag , although the chest straps are a little tight , i hardly use them a good bargain for the money my only real complaint is there is no real manufacture logo anywhere on my go bag , kinda like it 's for <unk> . secret <unk> or something huh .
this backpack is the perfect size for traveling as a carry on for all of my gear easily stores the laptop and ipads and all other things you need for a carryon for traveling love the product
i was very pleased how quick i got it loads of different compartments i switched all my luggage , camera bag and <unk> pack bag to this style of <unk> and all are very well constructed for the price
the lining of this case is very soft and the cushion protects well against minimal drops i was looking for something more with a tight fit i believe this case is made for the & # # ; mac pro & # # ; # inch i should have listened to other reviews but its not that big of a deal i needed something for the mean time and this does the job the material does have a shine to it the zippers are well made also the pocket allows me to store a charger , pens , small accessories , etc . overall a decent buy , again not what i was looking for -lrb- snug fit -rrb- but would recommend it
this is the best investment you can make for your laptop a carrying handle or strap would make it # stars . even if just d-rings for my own straps
this is a very nice high quality case for the macbook air # . # `` the side easily takes the power plug with some room to spare very nice case , zipper works very well , very satisfied
this sleeve looks and feels great my # & # # ; mac air is a perfect and snug fit in this sleeve , and accessories fit nicely into the pocket the sleeve padding is definitely thicker then friends ' sleeve that i have compared it too , and the quality and durability of the material is really high i have carried this around quite a bit since i purchased on amazon , and it still looks new most importantly my mac and accessories are still in the same great condition i definitely recommend this sleeve
i purchased this item for my # inch mackbook pro and love it it 's made of good quality on the outside so it wo n't <unk> and tear the inside of the case is soft and foamy , providing a protective layer for the laptop for what i paid , this product exceeded my expectations
this product seems to be explicitly designed for the samsung series # , but ... it does n't really fit i mean ... it sorta fits i wanted a nice snug sleeve for this particular laptop , but there 's still a giant gap of space at the top it 's the closest fit i 've found though , so i 'm keeping it
i found the roocase neoprene sleeve case to be quite adequate but left room for more needs of additional space this is particularly <unk> if one has a couple or more accessories to load
i was hoping that my laptop would slide in like a glove , since this product seems to have been made directly for it instead , there is about an inch of excess material around the top and side of the lap top the material is a little too stretchy for my taste if you use the front pocket for anything besides a cd or two , it winds up looking pregnant i do n't use this case very much , <unk> instead for a <unk> book bag
great case for my laptop the case is small enough that it does n't add bulk while providing cushion and the pocket is very useful for holding my mouse and <unk>
based on the dimensions listed for this case , i bought it for my new xps # -lrb- windows # convertible ultrabook -rrb- the case fits perfectly and i am very happy with it i like this style of case better than any other for a small and light laptop like the xps # quality and construction seem good
this neoprene case works great and fits my # . # `` samsung laptop perfectly the material & zippers are good quality and the price is reasonable i am happy with my purchase
i have other <unk> from case logic , and am happy with the construction and durability the laptop/tablet case equals the others in build quality and utility but falls short on appearance and <unk> the question , would you carry a laptop and a tablet if you do have the dual need for a laptop and ipad case , this works well -lrb- and given its low cost it is cheap enough to buy as a storage case
i bought this for my wife she loves the color but she think it is way too big for her ultrabook material is water resistant and well stitched i recommend this bag to laptop owners that carry a lot of accessories with them most of the time
this case served my laptop needs before i had to add my laptop into my briefcase which caused pain in my shoulders the product description says that this tote fits a # inch laptop , however , it fit my # inch laptop just fine it has just enough pockets for my power cord , a pad , a pen and a jump drive so far it seems sturdy and of good quality i do n't think i am as fond of the gray color as i would be of black overall , great product
love the length of the straps they fit like a shoulder handbag just enough storage , and very lightweight i really wish they had more in rose color , or a blue !
this is a well-padded and conveniently designed lightweight laptop/tablet carrying case if what you need is the lightest possible safe case to carry just your laptop and a tablet and a few <unk> items , this thing fills the bill nicely the shoulder straps are just the right length , the pockets are well-placed , and the two main pockets do n't interfere with each other but there is room for little else that 's the tradeoff for the light weight some days i need to carry the laptop and a whole lot of other stuff other days i value convenience more , and for those days this is the right item know your needs and if your need is for a small , light case for your computing essentials , this is a fine choice do n't blame the <unk> for not being a rhino if you need a rhino , buy a rhino
this is the perfect size for me i went from lugging a huge backpack back and forth to work each day to pretty much just this bag partly due to switching over to the macbook air from a larger notebook , but i feel almost like i 'm forgetting something when i get to work each day because i am so much lighter it has enough pockets and places to put just about any cords and peripherals you might need but no extra bulky places you do n't need a pocket for everything in the right spot and nothing more i love it
this bag has sufficient cushioning and lots of pockets the color is just as pictured i guess maybe a shoulder strap would be nice all around sturdy , cushioned bag for carrying laptop , kindle and backup hard drive
very pleased with this bag i did lots of research , trying to find the right one for me this was the one it 's very sturdy and i love the color i also really liked that it has a place for my ereader and a few extra pockets on the outside
if you are not carrying much , this is a great bag i bought the bag for my # & # # ; hp laptop and it works great for me there are lots of pockets but flat items fit better for example , i do n't really like carrying my charger cord in this bag because it makes the bag bulgy and uncomfortable to carry also , customer service is great there was a mistake on my order and i did n't receive my bag i contacted them and they reply back within # day and fix my order and sent me another bag and i received it within the next week i am very satisfied with this order
the case logic <unk> # . # -inch laptop tote is exactly as described my # -inch laptop fits perfectly in the large padded section , and my kindle fits in the other section i will be able to fit the power cord , hard drive and any other little items i need with no problem the handle is a perfect length for over the shoulder ; it fits nicely under my arm the color is not quite as bright as the photo , which is a plus in my opinion ; not much different , but enough i was more pleased than expected this tote is perfect for my needs and i would recommend it to others
this lightweight tote from caselogic features oversized carrying straps and can be slung over the shoulder it is well padded , and the ballistic nylon is waterproof -lrb- spilled coffee into the outer pocket and the inner compartment stayed dry -rrb- the styling is modern , although <unk> better suited for women
loved the compartments and sleek size needed something for everything to fit it but did not want a huge bag ipad , cords , few papers , wallet and phone all store nicely
the product was very easy to install and looked good when it was on however , within a few days of use of the computer , i could hear the fan running all the time -lrb- which it had never done before . my macbook pro is only a year old i thought that maybe the cover was causing it to overheat i took the bottom cover off and shortly thereafter the computer fan went off and the computer itself felt much cooler so now the entire cover is off the computer and i have n't heard the fan come on one time needless to say the speck cover will be going back for a refund
i got this since apple discontinued the mbp # ' and i wanted to make sure i could prolong the life of my new mbp -lrb- and probably last # ' -rrb- as long as possible # -rrb- actually caused scratches , due to dust getting between the cover and the mbp # -rrb- added a good amount of weight -lrb- just feels much heavier # -rrb- the feet that kept the case attached <unk> older mbp # ' -lrb- previous gen -rrb- never had a case , and sadly enough has less scratches in the end , i 'm really starting to think `` what is the point of this ? `` it makes your mbp heavier , and does n't really protect from scratches unless you clean very often -lrb- specially if you move around a lot -rrb-
amazons folks made a good effort trying to resolve my problem they were prompt , polite , and responsive however , in spite of talking with speck to get the right model number , this was an exercise in <unk> glad to have amazons prime and their return policy
not a bad cover , did its job for almost a year but eventually broke off some of the little handles that hold it in place i would recommend it though
very nice protective case actually , and looks great with my red keyboard cover i always make sure to check the reviews before buying something so i thought i 'd give this case a shot -lrb- with such good ratings and all . at first i put it on wrong and was bout to be pissed , because it was making the hinge <unk> and sounded like it was damaging my laptop however i took it off , <unk> and put it on the right way so my mistake there so far i really enjoy it , blk n red is a good combination only thing i do n't like about it , is that it appears to be easily scratch able - it came with a few minor blemishes new out the box and even if your hands are clean , it seems to pick up the natural grease from your fingers overall , good product - it will do the job in protecting your laptop and since it snaps on tight there is no worry about it detaching if it were to fall
i 've been using this cover for a long time , # years , and it 's still there , with a bunch of scratches but my laptop intact there are # downsides to this cover first , and i have n't seen any other cover without this problem : they 're extremely hard to take off once you put it , if you want to take it of it takes patience now , you may never want to take it off , and that 's cool the second problems is that its too heavy , maybe by itself it goes <unk> , but when you put it not , it increases the laptop 's weight substantially that 's why i sometimes want to take it off
i bought a black case for my new macbook pro i 'm happy with the product it protects my laptop from scratches and has great ventilation the only design flaw is at the front of the case along the wide keyboard edge another snap would have been useful here , since the laptop juts out a tiny bit along this edge when you lay the laptop on a flat surface other than that the case fits very well and looks great
great product from speck one drawback ... it scratches very easily i take very good care of my laptop even with the case on it , so this works well for me and i prefer the matte look my roommate has a speck glossy hard case and is very rough with handling their mac , so the hard plastic can handle the scratches much better either way , it 's a good buy
i received this product a few days ago and found that the packaging did not provide adequate protection for the case in fact , when i unpackaged it , the case almost appeared used because of several scratches i did n't pay very much for it though so i did n't want to go through the hassle of <unk> it and shipping it back otherwise , pretty happy with the functional and <unk> appeal of the product
this item is o.k for what it is , could be better though , the middle sags a little bit as another reviewer has said , but overall the build quality is pretty good
i have wanted a mac computer for about # years now i finally saved up the money -lrb- i am a college student -rrb- to purchase a refurbished mac having saved for such a long time , i wanted to make sure i had all the protection possible for the computer i bought this product and am very pleased with it it snaps on to the mac very easily and stays on firmly i feel much more comfortable transporting my mac from place to place i would buy this product again if i ever got another mac
it 's fits perfect and looks great i have <unk> to all my ports and even has some clearance for cooling on the bottom of the laptop this cover is a must for your mac
i bought this a while ago and have not had any problems with it i do n't think i have taken it off of my computer since i put it on great little case
bought this for my macbook pro at one point i pulled it too fast and ended up hurting myself , shows how strong this thing is works pretty well and protects my macbook pro would surely recommend it ! !
lightweight , perfect fit , sleek & sexy exactly what i was expecting it was n't clear to me from the pictures if the apple logo would still be visible through the case , but when the logo lights up it is
i carry my macbook without a bag around our office building constantly this case has saved me many times over also the material it 's made from is really interesting to the touch it 's almost <unk> feeling on the outside a + i will use this product for as long as i own macbookpros
i wanted a cover for my new laptop because my previous laptop did n't have one and had gotten marked i 've liked the results from this cover and it is helping my case stay <unk>
i had one for the original # & # # ; macbook pro with the <unk> adapter , and when i got a new power adapter -lrb- the l -rrb- it would not fit this case looks the same , though it has been shaved to accommodate the new power design
well this product is something that i enjoy having everyday but hopefully they can get them out in different colors in the future but <unk> purchase and arrived on time :
i was so glad i had the speck cover on my computer when i dropped it the other day it saved the day i had trouble finding the size that fit my # -inch mac , so i was so glad to find a supply available here
i bought this for a trip i took at the end of october i needed a good carry-on sized backpack for my # `` laptop , the charger & cables , mouse and an ancient kindle there 's room for much more this very comfortable backpack served me well during my trip so i decided to use it for work instead of the heavy , leather shoulder bag that i have used for years unfortunately , the shoulder strap is beginning to tear away from where it attaches at the top
i would send it back , but i 'm in afghanistan it started out looking like a great pack , but once i started wearing it everyday , it disintegrated almost all the zipper tabs have broken off , the straps are ripping from the bag al <unk> had in it was my lap top and and extra shirt if they sent me a new one , i would send this one back i am getting ready to order a different one if i do n't hear back form these guys disappointed in afghanistan
well i was very pleased with this bag , worked very well for everything i needed however after two months of use it is failing already i am just outside the window for return , may # th was last day to return i just noticed today that one of the shoulder straps is failing and will not be holding up for long term use for the price of the bag this is very disappointing wish i would of went a different route now
this laptop backpack states that it supports a # . # `` laptop my laptop did fit , but is could not handle the weight within # weeks the right side shoulder strap and handle was tearing off i returned it and am now using a swiss gear which has been great so far great customer service from amazon , they paid for the return without question
i bought this backpack along with the targus drifter ii backpack to compare i loaded this pack up and tested it with my laptop and a number of heavy files i 'm # ' # `` and found that this pack is a lot better than the targus drifter ii in fit and feel , but i have absolutely no idea why this pack is so expensive it 's lighter than the drifter -lrb- which is good -rrb- , but it 's not waterproof , and it has fewer compartments why so expensive some of the <unk> was even crooked there 's also a sort of vinyl handle in the middle of the back between the top of the straps , and it pokes you in the <unk> it 's not horrible , but it 's a very odd place for a large handle i ended up buying a large chrome backpack that is waterproof , has a laptop sleeve , and is made in the <unk> i love it it was about $ # more than this demolition pack , but worth every penny
i bought this bag because my northface bag was falling apart , after years of use i thought that since the straps were wide that they would provide more cushion when i loaded books and things in my bag but , this is not the case the straps actually put more pressure on my shoulders causing pain at times needless to say , i will be looking for another bag however , it is sturdy and does provide more room , which is another reason why i bought this bag i also like the fact that it stands and does not lean over when i put it down
the bag looks very cool and it 's got all the pockets i would want , but it does n't come remotely close to fitting my g # in the actual laptop compartment so , then if i put the laptop in the main compartment the bag weight is very bizarre the should straps <unk> a few inches * before * the actual top of the bag so the whole bag -lrb- with the laptop in the wrong compartment -rrb- hangs away from the body in an awkward fashion yes , you could tighten down the straps or always carry enough other stuff to fill the main compartment , but what i 've found is that i just stopped using it will end up putting it on ebay or <unk> fyi - still looking for a backpack that will actually fit my g # appropriately
i really loved this backpack , the desing , the space , but since # months ago it stated ripping at the seams , it seems that on the back side of the backpack is made from poor materials i do n't if the targus limited lifetime guarantee covers this kind of problems , very dissapointed !
i bought this in may of # i am always on the lookout for the ` perfect `` laptop backpack and the reviews were promising and the cost was n't terrible when i got it i was impressed i moved everything from my old bag over and it all went is very well i have a # inch mackbook pro and an ipad , it held everything just great carrying it around was a good fit i did get a little warm as it sits right on your back but no worse than many of the others i used it almost everyday -lrb- and still do -rrb- but i began to notice a rip in the <unk> of the laptop holder section and come to <unk> out there is n't a whole lot of padding the rip is now all the way accross the bottom and the material is getting caught on the laptop almost every time i get it out i am not sure if it is a defect in manufacturing , but it looks pretty terrible and only after # months of use , i thought i would have had a year or better based on the other reviews
the backpack is alright it fits my # . # & # # ; laptop with room to spare it has lot 's of soft protected pockets to keep cameras and phones and thing safe it fits weird it seems to wide on my back , and there is a leather looking handle at the top that keeps falling between my shoulder <unk> the handle is great when you just want to carry it , but the way it is sewn it just falls down when you place it on your back .
great back pack lots of space one issue was the shoulder strap was not sewn to keep the buckle from sliding out i had to sew it together myself so the strap could be used and not slide out
this is a huge bag that is well constructed the bottom is a leather material and allows the bag to stand up by itself -lrb- more or less -rrb- the stitching appears to be good quality and pockets are plentiful unfortunately , i had to return it since my asus republic of gamers series # . # `` g # <unk> # `` notebook `` does n't fit in the padded laptop area it 's about an inch too narrow to account for the additional heat <unk> the asus notebook has sticking out of it 's back which is too bad , because i really like the look and feel of this bag going to try the targus drifter ii to see if it fits in there ... http / / www.amazon.com/gp/product/b # <unk> # _s # _i #
prior to a trip to seattle i bought this backpack because it could handle both my macbookair and my wife 's ipad in well protected pockets plenty of room for other stuff like chargers etc . carried it on planes , <unk> & automobiles and the electronics came through <unk> highly recommend if you need this kind of specialized bag
i like this backpack i bought it after realizing that my # -inch laptop would n't fit into my # -year old jansport backpack pro : plenty of room , padded straps , lots of little pockets , looks pretty <unk> : laptop area open at the top and a little too roomy it allows my huge # -inch laptop to slide around i remedied by placing my laptop into a sleeve before sliding into the backpack the straps are easily adjustable , but just a little too easily they tend to slide under a small amount of pressure in sum , i 'd buy it again it has plenty of room for everything , but could stand to make the laptop compartment a little more enclosed and secure i 'd recommend an adjustable velcro strap or elastic to hold it in place a little better
i tried out a couple different backpacks before choosing this one for my trip i mainly need a bag for tech gear , but would like the option to carry a change of clothes if necessary other tech backpacks i looked at would n't have worked well for this purpose within the large center compartment it has two separate pockets for a laptop and a tablet it seems well built the only thing it does n't have that i would have liked is an actual waist strap the waist strap that they list comes across the shoulder straps , instead of from the bottom of the pack
the targus demolition laptop backpack is a very roomy and organized backpack i have two other targus backpacks that i actually use for hiking and we love them this one , however , has one disappointing problem : the clutch handle strap at the top of the bag is positioned in a strange place it is too far forward and low , so it makes the pack uncomfortable to actually wear on ones back the handle sits right at the base of my neck and rubs on my back the bag has a lot of great potential if not for this design flaw i love targus backpacks , but this one needs a little design <unk>
i really like this bag it 's made very well and has places for all of my gear the only reason i did n't give this bag # stars is because it 's pretty wide for a girl i do wish it was a little less bulky , but overall it 's still a great backpack
this is a most have great ! ! if you need a pack to hold your laptop this is it i have used it for the last two weeks and i have had not issues with it
had a swiss gear backpack before this that i loved , but it got too much use from traveling , hiking , etc . once you start <unk> around tons of clothes , books , food , water , electronics , and other gear , it can take a toll . . especially after about five years of that nonstop this targus was a great replacement high quality , strong , protective it has tons of pockets and all of the electronics areas -lrb- laptop and ipad -rrb- are very well cushioned my only problem with it is the look it 's boxy and strange and just does n't have the ` nice ' look of my swiss gear or case logic bags i 've used for my laptop regardless : great bag , great protection , definitely recommended
great backpack , but i own a asus # . # `` laptop an it is too thick to fit in the sleeve it needs to be a slim # . # laptop to fit that is my biggest disappointment targus should have made the padded area adjustable if you have a macbook pro it should fit fine
love the many compartments with easy access about the bag i use it for a day bag for outings with my # yr old son , and it does the job padded & cushy all around the padded slot for your laptop or ipad is easily accessible even when stuffed full of other items
after extensive review of all bags , i decided to go with this targus and i am not disappointed it is awesome hp # . # fits perfect , all kinds of storage , very rugged and well made dual bottle holders is an added bonus
it is roomy enough for my asus rog # & # # ; laptop , mouse , accessories like extra drives , school stuff -lrb- books -rrb- and a bluetooth keyboard excellent , works well for my needs and i do not have any complaints it arrived on time , <unk> , and as advertised ... thanks to all those who answered my questions prior to my purchase
a little pricier than some others , but it has been worth it i use it every day for work , for my laptop and for multiple books , lunch , etc . it carries it very nicely roomy , nice straps made fairly well so far i 've owned for # months i 'll update if i see any problems over time
this bag is great it holds my # `` lap top and the many electronics i need on a daily basis i still have a much room left for files and clothing when needed i am very happy with this purchase
received the backpack very quickly made a late night purchase due to <unk> issues and they rushed it to me the back is made of strong durable material and its exactly as described
i have a particularly <unk> laptop , and using a shoulder case was pretty miserable felt like my back was getting bent out of shape carrying it in this backpack is much more stable and comfortable it has plenty of room for a toshiba qosmio , a cooling pad , its large ac adapter and cable , as well as mouse , game controller , and a thin binder this was only in the main compartment i have only two minor complaints the zippers are loud not while zipping , but they tend to <unk> <unk> together while walking , and setting this down on a desk against its pockets tends to make a bit of a <unk> secondly , with my laptop 's weight , it has a tendency to bunch up my shirt in the back , but i probably just need to tighten the straps to keep the weight higher overall , it 's sturdy , has more space than it looks like it should , and is much better than what i 've had before
i bought this targus backpack to replace my # year old targus backpack the old one was still holding up but was starting to look warn in places reviewed my available options and settled on this one i mostly picked out this one for the tablet pocket which is a nice feature this backpack has much more usable space it also is balanced better and feels lighter than the old one
i wanted to buy a swiss army bag for the obvious reasons and brand but then i read the specs of targus demolition and went ahead with it the bag has lived up to my expectations so far . the cover opening upwards is a unique feature which initially seems odd but later one starts <unk> the utility of this feature also the fact that this bag sits good in an upright position unlike other backpacks makes the opening lid feature even more effective i have noticed this bag is very comfy and easy of the shoulders and back a little bigger than average backpacks , targus demolition is not a sleek slim backpack to show off as a style statement , its a backpack to work with and depend on
i was excited to open the package and found no problems with the cardboard amazon box , but the laptop case was cracked in multiple places . the packaging seemed to have been opened and <unk> with the product is decently priced but it looks cheap , not at all a quality product . very disappointed not buying again
i love this case the color is very true to what it looks like on the screen and it is smooth and softer to the touch than some other cases i 've seen it is very pretty and is a great way to add a girly touch to my macbook the only reason i gave it # stars instead of # is because after one year of use it does have one chip in the bottom corner and a small crack in the middle of the bottom while i have n't been rough in my use of the case , i have n't been overly gentle either it was very easy to put on but the top is very hard to get off and i have n't managed to do it myself for fear of breaking it however , these are all very minor details and overall i am very pleased with the case i 've had it for a year now and have no need for a replacement yet
perfect fit for the macbook pro i read that some could n't get theirs to fit , but ours fit beautifully made a great gift for the college student she was totally excited with it
this is the prettiest color ever perfect if you love reds but okay with some pink to it i am not a pink person -lrb- more of a red or purple person -rrb- but i am in love with this one i immediately showed it off to my roommates i 've also had the <unk> color -lrb- great color too ! -rrb- but i prefer this one
protects but never overheats ! ! i love my macbookpro so i was very <unk> on buying a case it was so much cheaper online than in the apple store save your money and buy it here ! i like the satin finish that this case has ... wo n't scratch your laptop as you put it on/take it off to clean
great case i 've had it for over a month now i was skeptical of getting either speck or incase because i heard that they both crack but mine seems perfectly fine either way if it cracked i would probably still get another of the same brand because it 's a lot cheaper on amazon and it 's so worth it the raspberry is a beautiful color , i love pink and it 's a perfect hot pink color
the color is perfect , just what i was looking for it came quickly , within a week not to mention , it fits on my macbook perfectly the texture of it is also really nice i absolutely love it i recommend it
i though i bought something different the product send to me was different from the one appeared on the screen , plus it costed me a fortune to order it the case is made from another <unk> and not leather
this product is well built , but overpriced in my opinion it does the job , and it does have a lot of room to keep your adapter cables and such , along with the goflex satellite that being said , it is my `` spare `` travel case , as it is simply too big to fit in my laptop bag i 'm going to find some slimline case for the goflex satellite instead this will be a good option when i go on vacation and do n't take my macbook pro bag with me , but for my normal business travel it is just too large for me otherwise , as i say it is very well build ballistic nylon , and i 'm sure it will hold up very well , as well as provide excellent protection to the goflex satellite
i bought the goflex satellite travel case along for the wireless hard drive it arrived quickly ... before the hard drive arrived it seemed a lot bigger than i wanted initially i 'd rather had a smaller , lighter case , and that would still be nice , but i 've used it for a couple months now and it does the job there is also room for the adapter , usb cable for the drive , and other <unk> you might carry around
the goflex satellite is quite small , but this case is massive that said , if you carry the ac adapter , car adapter and usb cable -lrb- s -rrb- , you do n't really have a choice shame to make such a compact product so bulky , but the alternative is a damaged $ # drive
it is bigger than i thought it would be but everything fits and makes it easy to carry the attachments has a handle on the side there is also a flap that folds over the <unk> drive to help protect it bulky but will serve the purpose when
this product appears to be sturdy and waterproof the only aspect that i would like different is the velcro flap there is not enough flap there to securely fasten to the velcro only about an eight of an inch of velcro meets to seal the flap
i bought this two weeks ago to go backpacking with my laptop , so as you 'd expect , it gets crushed and pressed around a lot the fabric and seams seem durable enough , but the ribs that keep water out in the ziplock mouth are already cracked , and will not repel water if you buy this ; i think it 's a good deal for how cheap it is be sure to not bend the mouth part <unk> , or it will break eventually
great sleeve for protecting against those little accidents has a padded inner sleeve which is really nice a little bulky , but manageable wished the velcro closure would have allowed more folding of the sleeve -lrb- gives more protection against accidental <unk> that way -rrb- , but ziploc closure should more than do the <unk>
my aqua-quest is over the top simply the best cover for me as i live on the ocean my studio third floor is # <unk> from ocean hot and wet air will blow right in no problem for my aqua-quest my macbook pro was just made brand new you figure it out
i recently upgraded the tools of my trade to include a laptop but was <unk> with the problem of fitting it into the same backpack with the rest of my gear ... binoculars , <unk> radio , rain gear my work involves transferring from a small boat to a large ship in all <unk> the backpack is bright orange for the purpose of visibility so i wanted to keep it in service the aqua-quest sleeve provided the water-proof integrity that i needed along with a degree of padded protection and it fit within the <unk> of my orange backpack precisely what i needed
i can travel overnight with my laptop using this bag i do feel like some of the back pockets could be more expandable , as the main compartment is as it is , my shaving kit fits awkwardly other than that , very nice bag
my son , a teenage shopping <unk> , raved about this backpack and the laptop compartment that provided extra padding and protection for his new college equipment he 's been using it for over a month now and , based on his feedback , it 's an invaluable piece of equipment for college as well as a sturdy and extremely well made product
great bag for everyday use <unk> pockets for everything you can think of laptop w / sleve for tablet is <unk> , i feel like my equipment is # % protected also has large compartment with plenty of room could see it work as a weekend bag or short trip north face always exceeds my expections with it 's outstanding <unk> i see this bag lasting a long time i recommend for everyone
just gave to my # year old son for his birthday he outgrew a smaller north face bag that was just too small for school supplies , ipad , laptop , gym clothes , food etc . i looked hard for the largest volume and it this fit the bill nicely he was very impressed with all of the <unk> compartments to smartly organize his gear very well made as expected and the brown color is a little more distinctive than the other three black ones we have in the family great bag for older students and business travelers i am tempted to switch from my standard messenger laptop bag to this more versatile backpack
the cover is soft and protects the computer , but it does however come off easily one bump to the side or you open your laptop quickly and it can fall off i think it needs more clips on the sides to hold it on after about # days , the cushion on the bottom of have fallen off i would not purchase this product again
the case is solid but the little rubber `` feet `` keep falling out i 've now lost two so my macbook is n't stable on surfaces annoying to the point of having to find another brand
so , it 's designed to fit an air but the top case cover does n't secure or snap i feel less secure about my computer now because when i 'm holding it with one hand i 'm worried the cover will slide off and i 'll drop it the main problem is that the top cover does n't secure near the hinge i 've searched for months for something and i think i just need to drop the serious cash for one that will protect my investment
i just got it and it seems great it fits really tightly to the computer but does n't add any bulk it has a smooth satiny finish and looks great edit : over time , this is not a great purchase the satin finish chips off , which is annoying but the real problem is the extra weight it does n't seem like that much , but over time , my screen started slipping and dropping back while i was using my computer when i took it in to apple , they said that they had seen this a lot with macbook airs that people clipped covers on the cover actually loosened the hinge , so the only way to fix it is to crack open the computer and tighten it up i have since taken off the cover in exchange for a sleeve and everything is fine
