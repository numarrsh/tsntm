i received it very quickly the cube case is very nice it is a little thinner than the one without the pocket , but i really like it the pocket is very useful and holds more than you think
this case is perfect for the disney <unk> i purchased both products at the same time and the case is quite sturdy and secures the <unk> very well i recommend this case
there are three things i liked about the kroo cube case first the color reminds me of pink cotton candy and this is a good thing it is well made with tight seams , sturdy fabric , and a strong zipper my acer fits inside to perfection last the side pocket holds the cord as snug as a bug in a rug i would recommend this item to anyone with an acer because it is made for it
the pictures show a sleeve that fits perfectly on macbook air # however , when i received it and realized the size was bigger than pictures showed the macbook air does not fit ok inside it is loose material has good quality unfortunately , it was not like expected
it 's a tight fit , which makes it a bit of a pain to put on and take off also , it has no padding , so only provides protection to the surface
fits perfectly mba # , only drawback : should have two loops on each side so inserting would be easier bought used in perfect condition as amazon stated : like new very happy with it , not worried anymore when putting macbook into another case with zips great touch for extra grip
this product was exactly what i was looking for : a lightweight , very thin , `` envelope `` type sleeve -lrb- no zipper -rrb- first off it is important to note that this is not a cushioned neoprene sleeve this provides minimal protection but the point is to protect it from scratches and liquid spills etc . this gets the job done having a macbook air # . # `` i did not want to add weight and thickness to the computer by having a sleeve that was bulky and heavy the thickness of this sleeve is about that of a sheet of paper and the material feels like `` felt `` and microfiber the sleeve itself can also be used to wipe the screen of the computer as for the fit , it fits perfectly , like a custom made glove
was looking for a slim profile case for my macbook air # `` . didnt need something heavily padded as i already carry it in a laptop backback that has sufficient protection just wanted something to protect it from scratches the case is well made , material is sort of stretchable and seems very durable serves its purpose well would highly recommend this
this case is just the right size for my acer # . # inch netbook , not too big , not too small has room for all your extras well made and the memory foam padding keeps my netbook protected from accidental bumps and bangs
the bag arrived early and i was able to carry it with me to a conference that next week it was perfect nice protective padding , lots of pockets and storage , and easy to carry with the shoulder strap lots of compliments
this case is excellent it secures the laptop inside , while protecting it from damage the outside pocket is very handy for storing the cord and other accessories the handle makes it very easy to carry ... much more portable than the laptop sleeves that are so popular for netbooks
this is a great case i spent , truthfully , an entire day going through amazons site looking for the perfect case for my new dell mini i was looking for a lightweight case with a snug pocket for my laptop and enough pockets and room to put the power cord , mouse , dvd/cd drive & misc girl stuff i 'm using this laptop for business travel purposes , but do n't need a huge case to stuff folders and papers in i must have viewed several hundred cases and found a few that i liked but not many i really loved ; until i ran across this case it is the perfect size for me the computer zipper pocket is really convenient because you can strap your computer in and keep working on it ~ then close and zip it up when you got ta run it 's great because the way the computer fits in there , you can use your case as a platform i can say this case is highly recommended ~ great size and price is just right where you do n't feel you just spent and arm and a leg for a plain black bag and the seller <unk> shipped super fast in great packaging
mine is nice , and it fits the toshiba nb # well , but after # weeks of light use there is already a hole near the flap big enough to fit one 's pinky through
bought for net book protects it well and holds all the essentials has nice carrying handle and easy to slide net book in and out quick ship , price was good
this case if perfect fit for toshiba nb # with standard # cell battery netbook since toshiba nb # have battery stick out at back , normal # inches netbook sleeve wo n't be able to fit this toshiba netbook sleeve is specially made for nb # , it 's perfect fit for nb #
title says it all this case is well constructed with nice stitching and is soft and offers decent padding for your toshiba nb # netbook i use it with a nb # -n # -lrb- the cheaper , black model -rrb- and it fits perfectly slide the netbook in , and flip the ` hood ' over it for a nice snug fit originally i wished that it had a zipper instead of the ` hood , ' but the <unk> design is nice and solid over time , the hood may eventually get looser and loose its form -lrb- e.g . get floppy -rrb- but it seems to be holding up well so far it was cheap on amazon -lrb- fifteen bills -rrb- and a no-brainer since there are n't any other cases out there that will fit the nb # perfectly like this case
i have a netbook that does n't leave my room -lrb- it 's an asus ten inch -rrb- when i saw the photo of this product i thought it was completely made from the flexible material , but in fact that 's just the reversible flap there 's a padded semi-rigid case that should look after your netbook very well the reversible cover is made with the kind of plug-in plastic locks that are on many portable cases what brenthaven has done is realized that this connection can be easily reversed , so you get a choice of two outside looks to your case the rest of the case is made to a high standard , with a good strap and handle since netbooks are built to a price , you 're unlikely to get a good case with one the brenthaven is an excellent choice for protecting your investment , and what 's even better is that it does n't scream `` i 'm a netbook - steal me !
first impressions : this is a nice sleeve that ought do what it 's supposed to do sadly , it is a bit too large , so the computer slides around and is not snug in its place worse , the thing smells like <unk> washing does n't help airing outside does n't help i returned mine you certainly would not want to take it out in public
i ordered this item thinking my # . # netbook would fit snugly and properly into the sleeve ; it does n't there 's still a lot of room for the netbook to move around in the sleeve
this sleeve is not the right size it says its for a # . # inch acer ... but it is clearly too large my acer # . # inch has about an inch of space on two of the sides when i place it in this sleeve don ; t know why it has this label but will try and return . :
the other are right , it 's not the right size but an inch off specified , i mean # inches <unk> of # , but i think is ok it looks cool and that extra space may come in handy for carry another things inside too besides it comes with that live green band , that i think is cool too
although labeled for the acer aspire one # h , i ordered this for a dell # z after comparing dimensions works perfectly and is well made a very good value check your netbook dimensions to ensure a good fit
note : i got the small one for a # `` netbook it is not exactly as pictured that being said , the big plus for this bag is that it does offer good protection for your computer it is sturdy and has very good padding the trade-off , naturally , is that it is n't very light weight it 's not like a neoprene sleeve ; it is more like luggage for your computer so if you are looking for protection , this is a # or # star bag if you are looking for something easy and light-weight , this is a # or # star bag i might not keep it , however , because it has a strong smell of rubber , which bothers me i am airing it out to see if that helps
for the cost # stars as it was cheap dont think it will hold up for years but again at the price who cares looks good and absolutely functions as a bag should which it to hold stuff
i recently brought a toshiba netbook and needed a bag to carry it in i brought this item and another bag off of amazon and love it it fits almost everything that i need , the fit is a little tight once the cords are added to the bag . but that is okay with me the only issue that i have with it is that there really is n't enough space to add thing i can get the netbook , <unk> , mouse , and a small notebook in the bag it zips close but the snaps wo n't lock other than that prefect
i ordered this bag to carry my # -inch tablet it was more than i expected it to be it was able to fit my tablet and alot of other things , i pretty much use it everyday even when i not carrying my tablet lots of space and extra compartments make it even better i would recommend this for your tablet even for daily use the quality too is very nice
first this item was listed as used but it still had tags and was in a bag maybe it was a return or something , but it had never really been used which is amazing ! it was purchased for my son for his netbook he got for christmas he loves it he can store all of his little accessories with it , and occasionally throws his ds in with chargers thanks for a good quality product at an amazing price
i loved this little bag it is handy , compact and roomy at the same time . i wanted it for my # . # inch tablet and it fits beautifully it also has room enough for all my accesories
the bag seems to be nice but certain things seem cheap the cardboard backing that is inserted into the bag broke down in less than a week the plastic loops that one would use to tighten the shoulder straps broke nearly immediately so far those are the only <unk> the zippers seem heavy duty and the pockets are well thought out i am going to see if i can exchange it
i love this product a lot and it last a good long time but the shipping that they give you sucks super bad so look for it with the option of prime
pencil pocket with a zipper , laptop section , book section , and a mesh pocket for water bottles or coffee <unk> on both sides these , and a couple other bells and whistles , make this backpack perfect for college students
my son needed a backpack for college it is a bit big , but it fits all of his stuff as well as his laptop and it is durable and well made
i 've only had it for a few months now , but it has held up perfectly it keeps my laptop well insulated and protected and has enough compartments to satisfy anyone when i go through security check points with it it always gets rave reviews for the amount of conpartments
what i love about this backpack are its color combinations , spacious compartments and its tough yet comfortable feel when you wear it i can put inside # ultra books and still have enough room for other things swiss gear is simply the best
this bag is exactly what i needed to make it through my second year of college and it does n't strain whatsoever under the weight of my never ending textbooks swiss gear has become my most trusted brand
this backpack holds all my books -lrb- they are very heavy -rrb- and is n't completely killing my back i love how it looks , i am a big swiss gear fan this is definitely worth it for me
this is the first backpack for notebooks that i have i do n't know about the others , but this one realy met my expectations it is really big , has space for two notebooks , and it not heavy although you may find others as good as <unk> but cheaper , i recommend this product
i got a new laptop for use with church work and i needed a bag to carry it i carry books and other items as times to meeting and other times i travel this backpack accommodates it all the front pens and gear pocket is very handy and accessible
this is my second swiss gear computer backpack for my laptop over the past five years lots of protection for my laptop , lots of pockets for all my laptop accessories highly recommend this product
bought it for my # year-old son , who uses it daily for college and <unk> so far he really likes it , and i am thinking of getting one for myself
i ordered this bag for my teenage daughter thinking it would be lovely plaid fabric however it is a synthetic nylon bag which looks cheap i was very disappointed and returned it
the product was pictured on the web site as a checkered buffalo plaid laptop sleeve but when it was recieved it was a <unk> plaid which was not what i ordered <unk> <unk> # <unk> buffalo plaid laptop sleeve -
the bag is very stylish and i love the color and the fact that it has material fabric on the outside however , only # days after christmas , the seam on the inside of the bag has ripped where the stitching is and <unk> the foam padding underneath what do i do now ? ? ? ?
very nice , roomy and sturdy i like the bright color for the fact that it stands out and is easily identifiable plenty of room for my asus netbook it is <unk> so storage is at a minimum but enough for the cord and manual
i bought a purple dell and the zipper is the exact color nice case , easy to carry but the only drawback is the outside pocket is a bit small my <unk> would fit much better if the pocket was the same size as the rest of the case i do admit tho , that i rarely carry my <unk> as my battery life is nice and long i usually use it for my wireless mouse and pad when traveling for business i will pack my <unk> in my checked <unk> i would purchase again
i bought this for my wife 's netbook , an asus the netbook fits fine the bag is small and she can fit it in her purse -lrb- she has a larger purse ! -rrb- and it protects the netbook from scratches i put a wireless logitech mouse in the front zipper pocket and it fits fine , but it does kinda stick out -lrb- of course -rrb- it will also fit the ac charger too , but with the asus it does have a smaller ac adapter but the bag is well made and the price was right
this bag works perfectly for my # . # acer aspire one netbook with a # -cell battery i use the front pocket for the plug in cord i love the portability and that the bag has handles the magenta is perfect for me i have n't had any accidents with dirt or water so i am unable to speak about any repellent capabilities
i love my case because i can fit my ipad in its leather case into the neoprene case and zip it up and carry it anywhere -lrb- using the handles -rrb- and know that my ipad is protected i can also fit the charging cord into the zip pocket on the front and know it is not going to fall out it is great ! works perfect and was shipped to me super fast
i read the reviews and decided to buy the case i am so pleased nice quality and the magenta is a nice color fits the ipad , but larger than the ipad room for my tripod inside the case i just ordered the black color for my husband if the dimensions meet your needs then this is the bag nice quality and price
this is a cool little bag , just perfect for my new netbook the main part is the perfect size with just enough room for the netbook , a mousepad and my recovery cd the fabric is very stretchy but thick enough so it protects the netbook the smaller outer zipper compartment stretches enough to hold my netbook cords , cordless mouse , and ipod , although of course it does `` stick out `` it is small enough to put into a carry-on , or i can just carry it with its handles for the price , i think it 's a good deal
this case is of great quality and fits the dell mini perfectly the zippered pouch on the front comfortably fits the power adapter as well i would recommend this product to my friends and family
this case for my dell inspiron is exactly what i expected and more of course there is no way to <unk> store the power supply and a little travel mouse , and that should not be expected those items would bulge in any case this item is just what is needed to protect and carry the netbook and it 's very reasonably priced
the top handle was ripped on one side i did n't feel like dealing with the return process so i just <unk> off the other side <unk> other than that it 's nice ? edit : left strap is started tearing # month in i probably just got a bad one i 'll end up buying another when i get the money for now # star
this bag was perfect in size and looks i bought it to use with a # . # -inch widescreen notebook i returned the item immediately after i opened it , because it was so flimsy and poorly made , it was really lightweight and there was barely any padding for the laptop the handles and straps and zipper pulls are all really , really cheapy i would not trust the top handle at all , it 's a <unk> piece of fabric so it is n't even comfortable to carry , and i think it would tear off very quickly basically , this is like a $ # or $ # backpack , but because it says caselogic they sell it for $ # honestly , if you 're going to spend any money on a backpack , you can get way better for way less like i said , i returned this and got a $ # generic one from lenovo and it 's twice as nicely made
i have had this backpack for less than # months and the strap is already tearing off the quality is horrible do not buy this product i give # stars to everything i buy on here , but this thing deserves zero
i was really liking this backpack , looked nice and fit everything i needed that was until yesterday when the fabric ripped in between two of the zippers , exposing the two largest compartments i 'm glad i noticed it before it could rip completely open and allow my laptop and accessories to spill to the ground and potentially break if you have a heavy laptop and actually want to carry around some accessories with it , skip this backpack and find a stronger one
i was really looking forward for this case , because of all the great reviews sadly , it does not fit my # `` asus laptop -lrb- # . # actual size -rrb- which is a shame , because the pack seems to be built properly and it does n't scream `` look at me ! expensive laptop holder ! `` . there was no way i could get my laptop in there it needed maybe one more inch of clearance even if it did fit , it would be so tight it would scratch up my laptop edit : bought another one of these for my wife , based on the great reviews after merely two weeks of use , the <unk> are falling apart and by two weeks of use , i mean twice a week , this bag carries a light laptop from the house to the car , and from the car to class meaning , barely any use avoid this junk
i used it only # weeks , and the carrying handle on top broke i do n't abuse my backpacks ... this was from normal use but i am very happy with my belkin core laptop backpack , which is smaller -lrb- ie . makes it slimmer -rrb- but perfect for my needs
one of the worst backpacks i have had i received it and they look very nice and clean and the second day i used it the handle ripped on me so i returned it and got a new one then we i got the new on i put my stuff in it and the seam ripped out on my first use the customer service tried to tell me that it was because i had put too much weight in it all i had in it was a laptop and a few folders -lrb- # lbs max of folders -rrb- lucky they will be <unk> me , but not the quality of product it should be spend a few more $ and get a good quality bagpack
only used it on rare occasions when i needed to use my laptop out of my office found a huge rip in the outermost pocket one day and it 's been expanding ever since
very good for the price it would be suitable for students or travellers , yet not formal enough for professional environment , though very confortable to carry all in all , i like my bag my bag is starting to tear apart from the inside , so i change my review to do n't recommend this product :
i purchased this for my asus <unk> # `` laptop because i wanted a simple bag without a lot of pockets my asus does n't fit in this bag i ca n't get it zipped i like the style of bag , just wish it really fit a # `` laptop now i 'm back to the drawing board by sending this one back and looking again
i bought this for my toshiba p # inch laptop the laptop did fit into the case , but i could not completely close the zipper since i need this just for short trips , it will do the job , but an extra # `` space would have made it a lot easier it is just a simple laptop case , with a little room for a few extra items there is n't a compartment for the charger all you can do is stuff it into a sections designed for a papers
straps are cheaply made and weak if you are going to carry something heavy in it like textbooks and a laptop often , choose something else i carried a textbook a # . # inch laptop and a binder in it for a week and now the straps are showing a lot of wear i 'm afraid they will rip by the end of the month either do n't be like me and abuse your backpack by carrying a lot of crap or choose something sturdier but overall its ok if you are a light traveler
the three compartments are typical for a school/work laptop backpack , <unk> of a front smaller compartment for pens , cell phone , mp # player , cords , batteries , usb drives , memory cards , etc . the wider , middle compartment is capable of carrying a few thin notebooks and one # `` wide science textbook the padded <unk> compartment fits a dell inspiron # . # `` , # lbs . laptop with no problem the main problem is that most students haul around multiple thick textbooks in addition to the laptop and other school essentials ; this medium duty packpack is not durable enough to handle those extra textbooks after # weeks , the shoulder strap attachments at the top are starting to separate savvy students will have already reinforced those attachments with some thick gauge <unk> lines but that should have been incorporated into the original design zipper quality is not the best and sometimes does n't zip together properly when carrying large loads for $ # . # including free shipping , this is a great deal on a versatile school or work backpack however , the materials and construction are only medium duty and not suitable for carrying loads heavier than # lbs
bag is only a laptop bag , great for carrying your # & # # ; laptop -lrb- if you still use something that big -rrb- and its accessories it is very thin so spare set of clothes and a water bottle is not going to fit not ideal for long travelling another one of those laptop back packs from a laptop manufacturer material is good however i wish it had more space stress the bag with weight and seems will start to tear
not the greatest laptop backpack , but for what i paid , i am completely satisfied it is hard to find a bag for a # computer , so i am not disappointed with my purchase
while this backpack was great for the price , it did break apart within the first few days the mesh of the <unk> on the outside started ripping almost immediately the divider between the main compartment and the front compartment ripped apart and the foam tends to come out these are my only two complains , however the backpack has done it 's job , and is sleek enough to take to conferences
on receiving this bag , i was excited about how sleek and great the design looked and at that price , i really felt this was a great deal however , its only been # weeks or a little more since i 've actually got this bag and it is already giving signs of wear and tear near the lower portion of the bag i 'm going to return this item back as i feel the quality of the bag is not seen in it
i actually like the pack a lot but the straps frayed almost immediately so be careful of that i still use it but it does look a bit tacky with all the threads hanging
bag is spacious with enough compartments and good designs but the bag does n't look strong enough the skin of the bag is thin and might get torn quickly as i use the bottom padding is not sufficient
i have an asus gaming laptop that 's # in . and i was hoping it would fit in this bag the bag is very nice and well designed but it just was n't enough for my giant portable desktop -lrb- aka my laptop -rrb- if you have one of the asus gaming laptops or a thicker # inch laptop , you 'll have to try something else
i bought this for my son who is going off to college this back pack does fit my son 's # . # inch laptop ... though it will not fit much else in the other pockets because the back pack does not expand but , he should be able to fit the cord and maybe a book and some pens i hope some of his books are online otherwise , he wo n't be able to take them all to class on the days he has class all day because he has not used the backpack with books , i can not comment on how sturdy it is
i liked it because it protects my laptop , has a lot of room , and is sturdy but , even as a # ' # `` tall girl , i found it to be huge and bulky when i have both straps on , the bottom hits <unk> on my butt , which makes it weird walking this would be good for a big , tall guy , but not for even a tall girl
i really like this bag but it 's falling apart it actually started falling apart less than a year after i bought it it was n't that expensive so in this case i guess you get what you pay for
i have two of these backpacks -lrb- one for me , one for wife -rrb- and they have been in use for quite some time now used daily and holding up very well good size for a carry-on bag the only issue i have with the bag is the lack of padding on the bottom of the bag in the laptop compartment the sides are well padded , but you need to be careful setting the bag down i 've banged my computer on the floor a few times there is plenty of room in the pack , so would be easy enough to add a piece of foam or something , i just have n't bothered
great purchase for $ # but it might not be for you if you treat your computer like a baby i have an incase backpack also , and i can give myself the luxury of being careless with it bc of how protected the laptop compartment is not the case with this one still , not bad either , specially for the price -lrb- i paid around $ # for the incase one -rrb- also its noisy , yes it makes a noise when its loaded , most of the time you can ignore it i guess but overall its a good backpack i have had it for over # months now with no quality issues -lrb- use it almost everyday -rrb- , its very spacious and it looks great
it is a great backpack one of the pros is its weigh as it is quite light it has a lot of pockets that are useful for all the gadgets that usually come with a laptop
i 've been using a <unk> backpack from the north face for ten years it holds my notebook pc as well as loads of other stuff with all of its exterior pockets and cords , it has met every possible need i had for a backback when i saw this case logic backpack , i considered it for a use i had n't bothered with previously : something more compact and <unk> looking for when i 'm carrying only my pc and a few other things for that use , this case logic backpack works perfectly it 's light , looks lean , and packs the pc and other electronics or papers and supplies in a compact and accessible bundle if you 're looking for a mini overnight back that can carry lots of stuff , consider something like the <unk> for everyday use , this case logic back seems like a good value that looks good and holds stuff compactly
there is a rip in the second pocket after about # months uses nothing a good sewing ca n't fix , but just disappointed that a brand as well know as case logic has bad stitching
nice budget backpack for # & # # ; laptop enough compartments to fit mouse , charger , cooling pad , and a few other things not as fancy as the swiss range but it 's # the price and decent quality
i really liked this backpack it is very compact in size , but good enough for a laptop and one or # books it has three compartment i believe it is worth for the price
i needed to get my `` college bound `` daughter a laptop backpack for the money it is a good deal it is sturdy and i think she will get a good deal of use out of it not a bad price - not a bad product
i love this backpack i was able to put some of my drawings , pens , pencils , phone , and my laptop in this backpack this backpack has a lot of space for your school and needs
nice backpack , well put together pockets are great as you would expect from case logic however bag does not fit my asus g # . # it does fit my dell inspiron # ' very tightly i would recommend this bag for someone with a # . # screen who is also using a neoprene sleeve
the bag is a lot cheaper than others in this category -lrb- able to hold a # . # inch laptop -rrb- i 've had it for a while now and had no problems other than it not being able to hold a whole lot
i had a problem getting it where i recieve my mail but , i looked up amazon 's tracking # which is it 's usps tracking # and let it be known that amazon would contact the postal service within days they located it it 's a backpack that will carry your cords , dvds , <unk> , headphones , cell phone , <unk> meds , etc . ect cost effective purchase
what it lacks in compartment size , it makes up for in compactness not the most padded bag compared to more pricier ones , but sufficient , if you 're not going to be dropping your laptop on the ground i do like it , and recommend it , especially for the price
for my job , i use a extremely bulky # `` dell precision laptop i 've been using this backpack to haul it around for about a year and a half now and have been very satisfied i work in the construction industry , and this has been ideal for moving my computer around from the office to the <unk> and back the padding has protected my laptop quite nicely , and there is plenty of room for notebooks , computer accessories , and office supplies and the straps are nicely padded as well , making even a heavy load relatively painless to carry around i 've used a messenger style bag in the past , and have to say that using this instead has been so much easier on my back if you have a large computer you need to haul around , i would highly recommend this
initially when the bag arrived , i was somewhat disappointed at the build quality after using it for a few weeks , i found it to be built quite nicely it will take my # `` laptop and a little more it does what a backpack does for # + dollars , what do you expect
i have a large laptop -lrb- # . # & # # ; x # . # & # # ; x # . # & # # ; -rrb- and it fits perfectly not the <unk> reinforcement , so i could see it tearing over time , but for now , it does everything that i need it to
i purchased this bag because i had been lugging around my # . # & # # ; laptop around in a beach bag -lrb- yes , i am ashamed -rrb- i finally went along a purchased something to carry my laptop in i was afraid that it would not fit my laptop , but it did ... perfectly with a little bit of extra room the price is also great -lrb- i compared it to prices on other websites -rrb-
the bag is of better quality than i assumed that it would be there 's nice cushioning for your back i 'm assuming , and there are enough compartments for me to store my external drive , ipod , and flash drives as i see fit not really a compartment for my charger , but it 's an overall good product , i 'm
i bought this bag for my boyfriend as he needed a sleeker , more grown-up looking backpack for grad school this is just that this thing is very spacious , and holds his laptop , a couple of <unk> , and accessories with ease the pack is much more square looking in real life than in the picture , and actually takes up most of my # ' # boyfriend 's back so far , it 's holding up well , and seems to be a great quality at a great price
it benefits from the design and the multiple sections it has a bottle carrying pocket on one side too the straps are a bit too tight so make sure to adjust the straps when you wear them first or it will be extremely uncomfortable for you to wear the bag i can fit my # `` laptop along with # books easily , and with the rest of the stuff in the front pocket it has # sections , with a mini zip pocket attached to the front pocket the quality is not as good as the usefulness of the bag -lrb- not to say it 's of bad quality -rrb- , it could be better that 's why # . **** impressions after # months -- -- - it has almost been # months since i purchased this bag , i use it daily and it is still going strong no tears or anything , it 's a solid back pack , not too big , not too small , just right , buy it
i was wanting to replace my old laptop backpack with something simple and streamlined i take my laptop home once a week , but otherwise it 's empty my laptop is # `` , and it fits well the padding on the straps and back is adequate it is light the handle at the top is only a simple strap my main complaint is i could use a few more clips , <unk> , zippered comparments , etc . in the front section with that said , this was an inexpensive bag so i should n't expect too much it basically does what it 's supposed to do
but i wrote the company and they send me a new bag , no questions so , i would buy again it is someone poorly constructed and i think that is why it ripped
first of all , i think that this bag is a great value for less than $ # it fits any <unk> sized laptop thats # . # `` or smaller it has # major compartments , # x medium , and # small the large compartment closest to your back can fit a # . # `` laptop and the other can fit a # `` or smaller while the medium sized can fit all your mouse , cables , flash drives , batteries , cell , batteries , pens , notebooks , etc . as for the smallest compartment you can wedge notes , a wallet , or anything small like a cell phone or smaller the only reason i took off a star , was because i could n't fit myasus g # <unk> # . # -inch gaming laptop - republic of <unk> it needed just half an inch more to fit i think it 's because of how it was designed , where the fan is located at the back is about an inch or two wider than any normal sized # . # `` laptops
extremely light weight and sleek the bottom padding is not as strong as you would find in other high end backpacks but pretty decent , if not for this i would have given a # star
i needed a case for my # inch toshiba laptop this case was priced better than others and has a sleek look it <unk> the weight of my heavy laptop well , and has enough room for three classes worth of books i 'm happy with my purchase
