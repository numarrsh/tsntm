i 've had larger cases than this one , but after seeing the quality of it in some store , i ordered it from amazon i 've been very pleased it holds my macbook pro snugly and my macbook air comfortably even when it 's wearing its padded sleeve some of the inside pockets might be a little small for whatever <unk> calculator you have , but no big deal the capacity of this case is just right for # % of your every day use i realized that when i had larger cases , i had stuff in them that i really did n't need to carry around this case will <unk> some <unk> on you , so you do n't become a <unk>
i was reading reviews before i made my purchase and was still unsure , but i bought it anyways i have a macbook air # inch , and i bought the # . # inch bag , i was worried it did n't fit because i have the plastic cover on but guess what , i have the plastic cover on my mac , and on top of that , i have the case logic sleeve : http / / www.amazon.com/gp/product/b # <unk> # <unk> # _s # _i # ? ie = utf # & <unk> = # and they all fit very happy that everything fits i also have an ipad mini and chargers . . this bag is perfect
i ordered this to carry my tablet and charger it all fits nicely has shoulder strap or hand straps to carry it with you also holds my journal in case i need to write down some thoughts
not a lot of bags out there that actually fit a venue # pro ; this one does offers good protection in a sturdy bag i think the keyboard will fit in well -lrb- dell still has n't delivered keyboard -rrb- <unk> wireless drive and power supply <unk> in and there is storage for more stuff nice pockets on outside for usb thumb drives , memory cards , etc . feels sturdy but not clunky comfortable to carry about my only complaint is not serious enough to reduce rating a star : i would like protective cushioning in the <unk> of the main compartment to better protect the tablet
i was thinking about getting the smaller one for my macbook air # . # but , my only problem was i had bought a macally <unk> protective case for the macbook my macbook with the cover case fits inside this # in bag just right and my ipad # rd generation which is on a case too beside that , i carry all my cables and a logitech mouse in the outside compartment love this case , it is small enough to carry everywhere
i do n't use it for laptops etc . , i use it to keep track of keys , wallet , business cards , pens , etc . this way when i drive different cars i have everything in the bag and the bag goes with me everywhere
i love my chromebook - and also want to protect it from impacts , including being dropped by me the handles and carry strap work well for me for travel - helping to keep my hands <unk> than just using a protective sleeve i also use my chromebook for <unk> work , meetings and overnight travel the carry case has my charger and even a mouse -lrb- yes , i prefer a mouse to the touch pad -rrb- two colleagues liked my bag so much , that they are also getting chromebooks
purchased this bag in place of my old roller bag this is nice and light to carry , has a great strap for hanging it off the shoulder and it also has nice storage capability i would order another of these if i ever needed one this one appears to be wearing like iron and most likely will last for years
i was surprised as to how difficult it was to find an inexpensive , yet decent case , that would simply hold a macbook air and some accessories well , this was perfect for me it holds the macbook air as well as my ipad or kindle and there is enough room for the power adapter , wireless mouse and a few other accessories with that said , it 's compact and light very happy with it
i purchased this case for a hp envy x # -lrb- # . # inch diagonal screen -rrb- primarily to protect the tablet and house its accessories in one location the primary compartment under the handles has two dividers the tablet and keyboard , either docked or <unk> , fit perfectly in the center section and a # foot hdmi cable fits in one of the side compartments the fit is perfect and holds the tablet without any slop the front zipped compartment has a main section with pockets on the interior wall the tablet 's power supply cube and associated cables fit easily in that main compartment without a bulge the pockets easily hold a microsd card , usb microsd card reader and microfiber cloth with plenty of room for more equipment a <unk> phone fits well in the smaller front pocket i am very satisfied with this case
i bought the case to carry to my surface pro # it holds the computer with surface keyboard in the main storage area with room for another # inch pad the easily accessed horizontal pocket holds the surface mouse , pen , power supply , with room for video and usb cords plus more the easy to access cell phone pocket on the side is another plus
just right for lugging my nexus # tablet , phone , external battery packs , glasses case , cables , and the other miscellaneous crap i need on a daily basis not too big , not too small , and techie enough to not look like a man-purse
the ipad fits easily even in my clamshell keyboard case and all the cords and toys go in it also still small enough to be easily carried as advertised , an inexpensive , functional , simple case
this case holds my ipad perfectly along with the accessories and a notepad it was just what i needed sturdy construction , convenient carryon strap with easy access zipper pouches to store personal items
i was looking for a small case to hold the acer c # chromebook the other requirement was that it needed to fit in my <unk> <unk> <unk> custom -lrb- <unk> -rrb- saddlebag perfect fit for the acer , with room to spare in the saddlebag
very high quality material it has a nice compact size for a bag but also has good enough space for the laptop - perfect for a # & # # ; laptop the front pockets are nice for the power cords and extra cables would highly recommend it
love this case fits my apple air perfectly plenty of extra room there are # more zippered pouches on front that easily holds my ipad and iphone material seems to be very good quality i wo n't be carrying it for business purposes a lot but i do believe it will hold up nicely for regular use
i purchased this case to protect my ipad it was a good choice , because it fits it perfectly and has padding around to keep it protected you can even keep a few more items in there as well the build quality so far is
after reading the other reviews and watching the video , i was fairly certain this would be a great fit for me upon receiving it , it does everything i want it to do i really wanted a slim bag that would hold my toshiba protege # & # # ; laptop ultrabook , my notepad , and mouse , ac cord , and folders it does all this yet when i carry it , it looks slender and sleek and looks like i have very little in my bag also have room for my galaxy phone , wallet , and other items great padding and i & # # ; m very happy you will be too
fits my dell xps # perfectly , very light and well built well padded as well , provides great protection , enough space for laptop accessories very portable and light with everything packed in great quality product and looks very professional i love it
it was n't for an ipad or ultrabook -lrb- which is what it was designed for pretty much -rrb- but works great for the laptop that i did buy -rrb- , makes it comfortable to carry and lightweight exactly what i expected out of a simple way to get it to and from school or work
i love this notebook case it arrived on schedule and packaged as expected it fits perfectly with my notebook and is constructed as advertised with pockets , handles , etc . it is all as expected
i use this with my # inch macbook air + ipad # both fit pretty well , though at first it was a little difficult to push the macbook into the case after some use the materials <unk> a bit and so it was easier to cram everything in there i also put into it the macbook air 's charger , stylus and laser pointer , ipad charger cable , thunderbolt to vga adapter and so on lately , more often than not i 'm leaving my ipad # behind and just go with the macbook , which makes it a lot easier to take the macbook out and back in ; and also drops some weight in all i 'm very happy with this case : sturdy and roomy
i tried a couple of different carry cases for my ipad # , but was still on the hunt for the perfect case my prior cases were compact and served to protect the tablet , but left little room to store anything else even the storage for the battery charging cord was a tight fit the case logic bag is a bit larger than some of the others , but has proven to be the & # # ; perfect & # # ; case for me it has plenty of room for the tablet , charger , head phones , pen , etc . . it is a very nice quality , does not attract dirt like some of the neoprene style bags , and is very easy to carry with either the shoulder strap or handles
this is so great i would highly recommend this case to anyone needing to carry their ipad on trips for me ... it 's the perfect size to hold both my ipad and kindle with ease there is an outside pocket for your cell phone , and a large zippered pocket that easily holds all of the chargers this is a great case
looks great ! fits great an all around a good solid product . i have bought case logic <unk> and have never been let down . the take a beating and last for ever
i bought this carry bag for a new # inch pc and it lives up to every word of the advertisement everything fits exactly as stated in the ad with room to spare the carry case from case logic is made of durable materials and should not be a disappointment to anyone
this case fit my mac book air perfectly i have a cover on the laptop , and it still fits in the case logic it has plenty of room for my laptop , my kindle fire , and the necessary cords
i wanted as small a bag as possible for my hp pavilion chromebook and that 's exactly what this bag provided there 's not a spare quarter inch so the chromebook is held very snugly ; nothing slides around there 's plenty of protection and there are external pockets for power supply and cord , and you could pack a tablet and usb charger as well
this case is just a tad larger then amazon basic , the strap is a bit wider , and there is more pockets in side the case my computer just fits in this case with no slipping around room -lrb- . <unk> # ca -rrb- and you <unk> leave anything plugged in the usb ports or it wont slide in -lrb- <unk> -rrb- it holds the charger plus its wires , and the mouse in the outer pocket with out any <unk> bag is made very well out of great material . -lrb- # -rrb- large zippers all the way round ... # of them are on top the out side pocket where you see a cell phone sticking out of -lrb- in the photos above -rrb- holds a external hard drive and the usb wire for it it has room for flash drives , sd cards , pens , and extra wires ... can even slide a paper notebook down in there after your computer is inserted pretty clever little bag for the money it holds it all to take with you ...
i bought this case for a samsung note # . # and it fits perfectly the tablet is well protected . there is enough room for the tablet and additional room for additional documents , etc . you may need if using the tablet like a pc for meetings in addition it has a great separate front section for power cords , adapters and i even have a power brick in there finally there is an additional zippered & # # ; pocket & # # ; on the side of the case for additional storage summary tablet fits well and is protected , divided so you can also put documents in if needed . second zippered section to store other accessories and a zippered front pocket for addition storage plenty of space for a lot of stuff the price is great i looked in local stores and this was the best deal going
this case fit my # & # # ; macbook air easily and it is <unk> the right size to carry it with several accessories and other items appears to be very well constructed
i love this case it is the perfect size to fit my macbook air and ipad , with cords it 's tight but i can even slid my nook inside as well i am very happy with it
<unk> , well-cushioned , decent looks -- it does its job the bag is definitely compact so it wo n't hold too much more beyond the laptop & charger comfortably i can also fit in a small wacom tablet , a <unk> , but that 's about it not complaining though -- it 's exactly what i was looking for :
others have written great summary reviews of this case ... so i will simply add to the conversation i have my ipad in a leather snug case , and it fits in the designated ipad pocket , albeit a bit snug i have to slide my laptop out slightly to make it easier to insert and remove my ipad in its snug case overall , this is a great laptop bag for transporting my communication devices - # . # & # # ; laptop , ipad in snug , related charge cords , and wd external hard drive
perfect for dell venue # pro with keyboard i also store the usb ac adapter , bt laptop mouse , hdmi cable , as well as cell phone and wallet in this case when needed
i 'm not sure the advertising was clear on this , but the case apparently comes in one size ; # . # inch laptop i had the impression that i was ordering a case sized for an # inch laptop my # in macbook air fits comfortably , while wearing a neoprene sleeve it is a smallish case which is exactly what i wanted and allows for carrying an inch or so of additional paper documents
i use this to carry my samsung chromebook , and it works great perfect size , with some extra space for papers and a pouch for the charger no complaints here if you want something to carry your chromebook , this works great
this bag is perfect for my net book and tf tablet it is small enough to be convenient and large enough to handle two items and keep them safe padded and extra pockets for stylus , cord , etc . would recommend it and the seller
this is the fourth case like this that i 've purchased for clients of mine and every one has loved them most get them for # . # & # # ; ultrabooks although they work great for # . # & # # ; ultrabooks as well one of my clients has a # . # & # # ; laptop and also carries his # & # # ; ipad in the front pocket the front pocket holds my pens , business cards , small yellow notepad # & # # ; , usb network adapter and highlighter it holds more than you think it can
its a small but very sleek bag , i like the fact that it has multiple pockets but isnt big and bulky like most bags out there the cushion protects everything great value for the bag
i received this laptop case in perfect condition i arrived very quickly very nice quality my # inch hp laptop fits perfectly with plenty of space for cords and charger plus extra bits
very nice quality and thoughtful design i have an # . # & # # ; laptop which fits snugly in the case in addition there is room for a wacom tablet , and external dvd player , the power cord for the computer and other cords for the accessories of course when i do n't need or want my accessories i just slip the computer in my handbag but when i do , it all fits nicely in this case it has a couple of zip pockets on the front which is where i stow all the cords , styluses , etc . the inner compartment has two dividers so in the main area i slip the computer in one of the other compartments i store the wacom tablet all zips up nicely it has a removable shoulder strap , too , which is also handy
ipad and chrome , my devices , have been a bit of a <unk> act , juggling them about in my <unk> but this case , a third pocket to fit devices that are necessary to keep safe and close , kinda like keys and wallet too big for your pocket , you know but here you 're given that extra pocket
just the right size for my ipad and <unk> and i can take this to a meeting as well as use it for travel great price and attractive
i keep my ipad air , kindle paperwhite , work laptop , anker # <unk> portable charger , portable wi-fi , and all cords in this laptop it 's a perfect fit for all of the above there is still room for papers and notepad if needed it took me awhile to finally choose a case and i feel i made the right choice i highly recommend this case
if you own a # ' macbook pro you will love it it provides a little room -lrb- not super snug , which i did n't want personally -rrb- but fits good enough to the point you do n't have to worry about it moving around too much nice pockets and overall just a great bag
i love this little case it is perfect for my ipad # i am able to carry all my ipad supplies in the generous number of pockets in fact , i have n't even used all of the pockets yet highly recommend this item
this was a gift to my granddaughter who will be graduating and going to college i wanted her to have a case for traveling she really likes all the items that i bought for her
this bag is ideal for my quick weekend trips to the <unk> fits my acer c # chromebook , my nexus # , my kindle , and all of the necessary cables and chargers everything fits snugly , but not so tight that the case might rip or anything like that there is n't a ton of padding , but it 's definitely sufficient if you have a chromebook and are looking for a travel case for it , this is a great option
not many good chromebook cases out there has plenty of pockets too for everything huge plus it 's a perfect fit too . -lsb- acer c # -rsb- unit plus the discount on it made the purchase even better
fulfills my needs it also fits perfectly into another case that i use for traveling long distances my ipad also fits into it , so all in all it 's great for my purposes , and all electronics , wires and my portable lap top stand fit into it nicely too
this case allowed me to downsize and now i have a way to carry my smaller devices around without having a huge briefcase i will recommend this to anyone who has a surface or surface pro
i am very pleased with this case , my ipad has a protective case around it and fits easily inside of this carrying case and still has room for other items the material has held up so far with no defects , so i would definitely recommend it especially for the price
we ordered this item after reading other reviews and we were not disappointed we actually ordered last year 's model , as it has a pocket for the ipad where this year 's model does not our # inch macbook air and ipad fit perfectly with room left over for cords , etc . perfect size instead of our larger and much bulkier laptop case for our macbook pro
not only doe it contain my new win # . # hp pavillion laptop , it holds my blackberry <unk> , and my kindle touch at the same time with the flexible <unk> i foresee in the future , i am glad i made this selection i highly reccomend this for a tablet and such your service is greatly appreciated , as usual
pretty cute laptop case sleeve i like the hidden handle especially , which makes it convenient to carry on i do n't need to take my backpack everywhere i go it would be better if they add some sponge to make it thicker , giving the laptop better protection
i needed a sleeve/bag for my laptop , and after searching found this totoro one it 's perfect the design and quality are good , and it even has some extra room with my # . # in . laptop inside i chose this one with handles over just the case because it 's even better to be able to use it both ways of course it wo n't zip all the way , but that 's alright the case has a really strong plastic like smell so might want to air it out it came all the way from china , and got to me in about a week and a half i 'm very happy with it :
its so cute ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! i love and my kids went crazy over it it did have a manufacturing smell to it it took a few day to air out and their was a crease on one side its so cute ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
the product looked just as it was described however there were some issues first issue , it does n't really provide very much protection second issue , the graphics have faint shadows that should n't be there maybe it was printed wrong third issue , gets dirty easily if cute is what you are going for then sure , but for the price it was n't the quality i expected
i love how the case looks it is so bright and beautiful and i have tons of people telling me how much they like it i love it also the only issue i had with it is the straps are on the inside so you ca n't close the sleeve all the way , but it does still come in handy it also had a funky smell to it the moment i opened it but it did n't take long for it to go away overall , love it
it is adorable my friends love it and so do i. my computer fits perfectly and this case keeps it from getting scratched up plus this is totoro . how could it not be great i love that it had free shipping the people also helped me when i bought the wrong one , to cancel the order so i could switch it to the correct size
i really like this product i am super happy with the quality this is a really nice sleeve it is great for carrying the laptop and the laptop in the sleeve fits into my backpack that i take to school this is great for my needs , and the hide away handles mean if i just need my laptop i do n't have to take my whole backpack
the bag is cute that 's the only reason i gave # stars the `` hidden handle `` is pretty much unusable when you `` <unk> `` it the bag no longer zips closed so you can hold it with the handle as long as you do n't mind the bag being open ... which is ridiculous i do n't recommend this product to anyone for any
it 's really super cute but if you are looking for a really heavy duty case this is not it it is more like a sleeve with small handles i needed a more durable one but if you just want something to keep dust off of your laptop then this is great
it is ok do n't like the fact that the handles are made from the inside and it wo n't zip up all the way if you decide to use them received many complaints though
bag was brand new in the package ; shipping took longer than expected but item was great handles are not outside the bag but hidden on the inside and have to be tucked in if you want it zipped all the way closed
i use it all the time it 's so adorable and the only thing i hate about it is that it does n't have pockets i even brought it across the country with me in an airport it 's durable
that 's exactly what it is it was shipped to me right away and was packaged nicely i 'm very happy with this bag and i 'm sure my daughter will be too
the bottom fit and the top never did i exchanged it and had the same problem . . not worth it too expensive , get an ipearl is cheaper and fit perfectly :
just like previous reviewers say , this case looks great , finish is really nice to the touch , but size is too small , i could not fit the top or the bottom part onto the laptop it is disappointing for a company like incipio to release such a product on the market on top of that , the seller data <unk> wants me to pay return shipping cost for something i can not even test fit it is unacceptable !
although it does serve its purpose , the case came out old and <unk> , did not fit too good and ended up making marks and indents on the <unk> part of the computer i would not recommend
this bag has a decent amount of padding and lots of pockets so things do n't get all mixed up it is not airline friendly so laptops need to come out still , but the way it closes makes it easier to to get out than most zipper close bags i was initially cautious of the fact that it did not have a zipper top , but the flap closes pretty well and the bag is more secure than i was expecting
i originally ordered this bag for my macbook air and ipad for that purpose , it works great however , if you need to carry lunch , or a snack , or really anything else , it 's a stretch the bag is perfect for just a computer , ipad , and maybe a few papers , etc .
this is the best laptop bag i 've ever owned most laptop bags have a ton of pockets and extra room for huge laptops , which makes them excessively bulky i have a slim macbook and was looking for a bag that was smaller and more streamlined than what i had already seen + slim + zipper on backside -lrb- the side that lays against you -rrb- for easy access - i use this to have my ipad handy + enough smaller <unk> for the little things i carry with me + the rings that the strap <unk> through on the side are angled which helps the bag lay across your body better - the magnetic closure is very weak i understand that you want to be careful with magnets around computers , but the bag does n't always stay closed - i wish there was a pocket on the side for water <unk> coffee mug overall , the pros for this bag far outweigh any cons i could find i 'd definitely recommend this bag
based on prior reviews , i expected the magnetic closure to be & # # ; iffy & # # ; it is , but the case meets my needs for a well padded enclosure for my ultrabook style # & # # ; laptop and quick access for my ipad after picking the case up , whether by the handle or the strap , i usually have to smooth out the cover and reset the magnetic closure , but that 's a minor inconvenience thus far good additional storage for chargers and cords , and documents in the <unk> pouch -lrb- the pouch that affords access to the ipad without opening the case -rrb- i use the larger storage slots adjacent to the padded ultrabook slot for my folding headphones and a <unk> <unk> . # auto in its holster all in all a very serviceable case
made of excellent materials you can tell it is well made and that it will last a long time the bag itself has a lot of compartments for storage and great for traveling i would recommend this bag to
very good design , very novel good protection for what you have inside ideal for riding a bike because it 's firm good quality but not great suitable quality / price ratio
its the perfect size and its super comfortable if you carry a # -in or # -in laptop and like when a bag sits tight against your back , then this is for you
i am in my second year of college and have never really cared what backpack i used i used old ones from high school or from my time in the army in an effort to protect my new electronics , i purchased this bag and was not disappointed it is easily one of the most comfortable bags i have ever worn and the build quality is excellent the stitching is sturdy and the materials used are top notch i actually feel like my laptop and dslr are protected i do n't worry about anything breaking thanks for a great product
i was riding my motorcycle on a back road and a <unk> came under my front tire long story short i crashed and this product took all the road damage for me definately buying more
i like this case , and i did subject it to a fair amount of daily wear , but i had hoped that it would last somewhat longer the little plastic catches that held it onto the laptop broke off after about two months
brackets break easily then mac will not stay in case case is protective in concept if improvements were made on brackets now useless unless rubber bands or such to hold the mac
seems pretty durable and holds the mac securely enough looks great when heading into meetings and makes the mac less of a <unk> piece and more of a <unk> tool sounds silly but less people ask me & # # ; how do you like your mac & # # ; or make & # # ; oh no , not another mac user ... & # # ; comments
good product , nice coverage and protection for # `` macbook air -lrb- june # generation -rrb- it does n't look cheap , the price certainly is reasonable , unlike certain fake leather product still requires $ # + , this is a good buy
i was quite excited when i purchased this case for my <unk> the price was great , the company is a <unk> and reputable one , and the black plastic looks great that 's where the positives end , and the negatives start firstly , the case would not even fit properly around my macbook the top part fit alright , although snugly , and recently started to crack and split at the bottom left corner the bottom part , however , does not fit well at all - it barely fits around the computer , and does not snap into place i might have gotten a defective one , but it sure is crap
my review has # parts : the case and the vendor the case : after a couple of hours following the instructions from the box -lrb- and youtube videos from other vendors -rrb- was <unk> to fit the top part in mu # & # # ; macbook pro retina this incase , or at least mine , is factory defective in terms of fit the vendor : i purchased mine new but it arrives in a damaged open box and with scratches on the top part of the case ... obviously it was used , not new my advice : don ' y buy from amazing deals online i never will again unfortunately i 'm in chile and the cost of sending it back is bigger than the cost of the case , so i lost my money big shame after # years buying from amazon ... nothing else to say :
liked everything about this case except that one month out of warranty the front bottom corner split open do n't remember dropping or abusing the laptop i put this review up in case others start having the same problem which might indicate manufacturing problems
to protect the laptop but it turned up with an <unk> yellow stain on the top cover i travel every week i dont have time to return it so i have had to order another because it looks so bad damage wise sorry just a one off bad product i received but irritating
nice cover i really like the color and the shells protects my laptop from scratches . this is hard plastic i am a little concerned about it cracking i said i was concerned with this cracking and it did . so much that i need a replacement within # months i keep my laptop in my bedroom on my bed no i did not drop it , would i recommend this i am not sure looks good <unk> it cracked
received this case today nice looking case and was excited to put in on my macbook pro # with retina unfortunately , the top of the case was too big in the back and therefore did not snap on properly leaving a gap and unprotected back edge of the computer bottom , though it fit better , snapped off really easily making me feel that it too was a bit too big sending it back today
the material is sturdy and fits the laptop well the problem is that the case , once installed , it does n't allow the laptop to open fully so there is a slight design flaw but it is grew at for the price
i got one of these for my new macbook after having one on my old # & # # ; mbp for years i 've always had really good luck with incase and i 've had their phone cases as well for years this one is sort of hit or miss it seems the first one i got broke a couple of tabs that held the case on and i sent it back the # nd one was okay , but it seems like it scuffed up way easier than the older ones i 'm not saying these are terrible now , they definitely will still protect your computer they 're just not like they used to be built
i did not know it was going to be high gloss i was disappointed that should have been stated in the description but was not it does fit the mac and is wearing okay i thought i was purchasing a matte finish
not a good fit , the bottom piece of the case does not completely cover the bottom of the computer , nor do the air exhaust holes line up with the computer 's exhaust holes it seems like there was n't much thought put into the design i bought this as a replacement for my speck case , which i broke the corners off of , so i will offer a quick comparison the plastic of this case is much thinner than the plastic of the speck case , thus providing less protection against impacts , but improving on the bulkiness of the computer as i was stating before , the fit of this case is not as good as my previous speck case which fit perfectly and snapped right into place overall this case is just ok , if you have the extra money to do so i would buy the speck
the matte black finish feels very nice to touch , and is translucent enough to let the light from the apple logo through the case does <unk> how far the screen opens to # degrees , but personally , this does not bother me too much
my only complaint would be that the fit is n't as snug as i 'd like , but overall it 's a great product with a nice look the material is nice and it does n't scratch my macbook when i remove it for cleaning like those other cheap cases i 'd definitely recommend this product if it falls into your price range it 's a bit more expensive than some of the other cases out there , but i 'm a firm believer in paying for quality if it does n't meet your expectation get a refund
this will protect your macbook pro from scratches and debris but it will not save you from a fall or other blunt force to the machine i like this case , it was easy to snap on and i am very certain this is an authentic product
i love incase cases i was a little nervous that this would bulk up my new retina mac , i love how thin these new mac 's are , but it did n't , the mac is still super slim the vent holes seem to be sufficient after a week of use running <unk> , final cut pro , motion , etc . . i do n't hear the fans spin up nor does the computer get hot on my lap
this is the exact case i have been looking for i searched all over amazon for a cheap and durable case incase had the one i was looking for all cheap cases did not cover the back of my macbook this one covers everything , does not have sharp edges , and all cut outs are perfect this case is <unk> thin , highly recommend
