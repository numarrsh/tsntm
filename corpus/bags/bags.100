was looking for a good quality case , which will offer good protection and nice look at the same time this one fits in my usual bag , so it is not bulky at all and what is very important for me , the case is made exactly to feet # & # # ; macbook air , no extra space
i like it a lot the outer edges are stiff and give the case a # inch buffer before you come to the molded area that actually holds the laptop the front and back are also a stiff , molded shape that fits the air perfectly no need to unzip or or unsnap there 's a slight opening at the top for easy access
the bag looks good but it 's going back the fabric was much stiffer than i expected and just did n't sit right on my back i also did n't like that there was no chest clip -lrb- keeps the straps together -rrb- for laptop bags i 've noticed this really helps to help the weight of the laptop be distributed evenly especially when you carry the bag for long periods of time these are all things that are my preference the bag itself looked well-constructed and durable dakine is a good brand but this bag just was n't a good fit for my needs
this bag works greater than i thought i always <unk> problems with bags especially when it twists a lot if u try to wear it from behind , but this bag lessens my work and a perfect fit for my laptop too would recommend it to my friends
i bought this as a diaper bag for the beach and hiking it is the perfect size because it fits a good amount of stuff but is n't too big i am short so most bags are way too long and big for my back there are plenty of nice pockets for organizing the colors are nice and sort of calming really the only issue i have with this bag is that it is very stiff , the straps are really rigid and are n't very comfortable i hope this gets better as i use it more and break it in
it 's a bit bigger than i <unk> but it easily fits my # . # & # # ; laptop and the colors are lovely and bright i have another dakine backpack that is very sturdy and i love it so i 'm sure i can expect good things from this one :
perfect size for my laptop without feeling too bulky i 'm a # ' # female and the # liter was just too big this is a much better fit for travel plenty of room without the excessive amount of pockets still has the sunglasses pouch on top which is also great for quick phone access
by far the best backpack i have ever owned comfortable to wear , fits a lot of materials -lrb- couple notebooks , regular books , pencil holder , laptop , textbooks -rrb- , looks great , and is not too big / bulky the only thing that i do n't completely love is that it is n't very waterproof , but the inside remains dry
great pack , not too large and bulky the construction fits a <unk> person very well it holds a laptop , a few notebooks and as many highlighters as needed the sunglasses pocket could be softer , but its a great feature
i was in need of a new backpack and did some searching and found this one it is wonderful it is high quality , durable , comfortable and large enough to fit everything i need -lrb- which at times , can be quite a bit -rrb- the water bottle holders are placed at an angle , so if a bottle is not placed in correctly , it will probably fall out , but as long as it 's at the right angle , all good
i wanted something a little more feminine than the average backpack , and was pleasantly surprised by this it fits everything i could possibly want to put in with my laptop , and is adorable the straps are extremely comfortable , and they do n't slide off when i only use one long story short , i love this backpack
this backpack arrived very quickly my toshiba laptop fits in it perfectly and is well protected i also love that it is quality material , and that there are several different pockets i am a college student and carry my laptop with me all the time , so this was perfect for what i needed
great backpack with enough pockets for storage stores my laptop safely and seems to be water resistant furthermore , i really like the purple , its a very dark eggplant color perfect for school and has a lifetime warranty also it came in the mail super fast , i think i waited like # days overall its a great girls backpack
when i bought this , i knew that the rear , secure compartment was n't a true pelican case that is , it does n't have the pressure <unk> <unk> , etc . of the more expensive u # backpack however , i did expect the u # backpack to at least have a solid , clamshell compartment instead , it just has flimsy panels on the back , front and around the edge , -lrb- what pelican describes as an `` impact frame `` -rrb- this provides no real crush protection worse still , the smaller , front panel does n't extend to the bottom of the compartment it is protecting so anything stored in there -- e.g . a tablet or portable hard drive -- will still hit the ground any time you put the backpack down honestly , beyond people trying to <unk> your computer components from certain angles , this backpack offers no more protection than any regular -- and much cheaper -- backpack if i could , i would return it
needed a backpack for transporting company issued laptop when traveling and while on motorcycle build quality , laptop and ipad protection compartment are adequately padded for moderately abusive type of handling vented back and padded straps make for easy transport and has a super duty carry handle when transporting shorter distances weight was a consideration for me and this one strikes a nice balance of <unk> and light weight so as not to wear you out if you have to lug it around all day not alot of storage compartments for other items but that was not the focus of use for me on this product well worth the money if the features you are looking for are included
i 've had many different briefcases and backpacks over thirty or so years , and this one is the most comfortable , robust and useful i 've ever had good job from a company known for quality anyone who does n't appreciate the <unk> of this case do n't know jack
i have been using it everyday for # months whilst commuting to and from work on bicycle allows me to bring my laptop safely i may die in a bike accident , but at least someone will be able to <unk> my hard drive
i am so bummed i even spent extra money to get this shipped sooner the sleeve is way too tight for my mac air -- and it is the most poorly designed unit you have to slide it in from the short end and then pull the edge over which is a total pain this is nothing like the neoprene sleeve for my mac book pro which is the simplest thing to use unless you seek aggravation every time you look to put your mac in a sleeve and take it out -- i suggest you choose a different one this one was sent back the day it arrived
did not fit a brand new macbook air # in had to send it back , was supposed to be a christmas gift definite problem with manufacturer or shipper !
i bought this case when it was on sale in preparation for my upgrade from a macbook pro to an air unfortunately , i did not realize until a few months later -lrb- when i actually upgraded -rrb- that the case was really too small for the # inch air you can squeeze the # in air into the case with a good deal of effort , but that is not convenient for regular use since i am planning to also use a hard-shell case , this sleeve definitely would not be a good fit perhaps it would work better for a slightly smaller ultrabook or an # in air the quality seems to be on par with my previous incase sleeves , it 's just too bad it is n't the right size for my needs
i 'm not sure what the going price for this is , but $ # is a pretty good deal the thing is super tight initially , but after a few attempts it loosens up and fits like a glove the color is a little brighter than what is depicted in the picture , but otherwise no different
bag was defective , to be specific , the zipper in one of the side pockets is defective and this bag is not meant to carry heavy things , even a laptop because the shoulder strap is too rough
my experience mimics several of the other negative reviews the bag is perfectly attractive and bigger than i expected ; however , it is cheaply constructed less than six weeks after i started using it all three zippers were broken , as well as the strap clasp , which snapped while i was walking beware if you carry breakable items
the bag itself is decent - plenty of room and pockets for storage however , as another reviewer said , the trap 's hook got loose and it slipped right through the connector and the bag fell to the ground this was only after # minutes of using it and i only had about # pounds of weight in it until this problem is fixed i would not recommend using it as a shoulder bag
the bag was very nice and look good i do not have any compliant about amazon service or the bag 's material however , the trap 's hook got loose and it slip right through the connector it 's not well made at all
in my first use , this bag fell on ground and my camera lense dropped and filter was broken the belt defect cause the issue if you have fragile stuff , laptop also , you may need check the belt first the <unk> do not have insurance to cover your lost the size is perfect , color is nice , the material is little soft
the metal latch on the strap that connects to the bag broke after a month there is also a piece of sharp metal that sticks out of the latch that has cut my arm several times when i bump the bag against something and my laptop is in it there is not protection for it in the bag would not recommend
i 'm still looking for a good bag this is n't it the first thing that happened is that the lining got stuck in the zipper not a good design the shoulder strap does n't have any padding it looks good , but that is about it
looks nice and stylish , has all the pockets i needed , even some hidden pockets too but , the pocket zipper on the side separated the first time i unzipped and zipped it back up . not kidding or exaggerating , the first time . sending back
i purchased this bag for use on a recent trip to europe , visiting # countries it served its purpose with flying colors and i now use it for my day trips to the city -lrb- i live on an island in <unk> washington state -rrb- the bag is well constructed , comfortable to carry , is functional in design with useful pockets , and the zippers are strong with the exception of the little tabs holding the zippers -lrb- not a big deal though -rrb- i am very satisfied with this bag
i really like this bag love the color , size and style my # & # # ; computer and other stuff fit perfectly in it one small thing is that i 'm having problem with ones of the bag 's handle but overall it is good ! !
i waited for this bag to be available after it sold out once i saw it again i jumped on it amazon shipped it on time and arrived a couple of days later it truly is a nice bag i received numerous compliments since the first day it does have a slight flaw , the center zipper really is n't sturdy , it unzipped after filling it too see its full capacity it was n't a major thing but just a concern it 's still too soon to tell how much it will take i hope this helps
this bag has a solid , comfortable feel the canvas is sturdy and thick it seems to be well-made in every detail i would give this bag # stars if a could the only -lrb- slight -rrb- <unk> i have are : # -rrb- i wish the bag were about an inch longer my laptop is older and a bit larger than most # -rrb- there is no support along the top or bottom if you put in items that are shorter than the length of the bag and then carry the bag by the strap , as shown in the picture , the bag sags in the middle this is n't a deal breaker , but you will want to make sure that paperwork is always in a folder or notebook of some sort to avoid <unk>
i bought this based on previous reviews and now can add my kudos to a great product i have to get used to it , but it has all of the features and compartments i need and also looks great now , time to put it to good use !
i decided to finally replace my old messenger bag that i had had for # years i was a little <unk> at first , but this bag helped me through the transition it has a ton of space for everything , and a neat little laptop pocket to separate it from other items
just what i was looking for i was worried about the size but it is the perfect size for my legal pads and tablet i just love it
this is an awesome little bag my # & # # ; laptop actually fits in the bigger compartment there 's a zipper that goes around the bottom to expand the width of the bag this is an awesome feature if you need to bag to become thinner , -lrb- to hold a laptop , tablet or papers -rrb- then you close the zipper if you need the bag to be wider -lrb- like to fit my # & # # ; laptop -rrb- , then you would unzip the zipper kind of letting the bag breath a little more again , awesome bag
my law student daughter was looking for a messenger bag for school we went to at least ten different stores and she just could n't find anything she really liked - either was too big , too small , no padding for computer , too whatever she saw this on amazon and said & # # ; that 's it ! & # # ; we ordered it and she loves it more in person than she did when ordering
i am a third year nursing student and ordered this for the new semester the backpack finally arrived , # days late on the first day i had two binders and a book in the backpack before my morning classes were even over both straps ripped off and all zippers busted amazon was very apologetic and quickly refunded my money the backpack is small in size and made very poorly
i bought this product a few months ago this backpack has a great size and color sadly , the zipper broke after a month of use also , it comes with a fishy smell that never quite went away completely
my daughter is # and takes care of here things very well she picked this backpack solely on the color . one zipper was missing completely and other zipper has broken already only halfway through the school year hopefully they will replace i will <unk> if they make it right with
really cute ... but ... it stinks to high heaven and i could not get the smell out no matter what i did i tried baking soda , washing it , all to no avail it 's the lining -lrb- the fabric on the inside -rrb- that smells
it 's really cute , but it smells terrible on the inside i 've tried febreeze and everything but the awful smell wo n't go away i noticed the smell right when i opened it
this backpack broke within two weeks -lrb- the black clip on the strap that allows the strap to adjust length -rrb- i now have to <unk> tape the strap together in order for the backpack to remain usable i am not rough with my backpack at all , but sometimes i will be in a rush and will have to run which caused the backpack to jump up and down resulting in a broken strap definitely would not recommend
i bought this backpack in october and really did n't start using it until november it worked like a charm for about a month and then i realized that you get what you pay for today both of the black clips that hold the straps broke while i was on the bus , the backpack fell onto the ground and almost broke my laptop the magnetic buttons that hold down the brown straps fell off sometime within the last few months i have n't been rough with this backpack , either i generally just carry my laptop and occasionally a very light book yes , it 's waterproof -lrb- unless it 's pouring rain then be careful ! -rrb- and cheap , but totally not worth it unless you plan on keeping it for no longer than a month
chose this based on reviews and when it arrived the smell of cheap plastic was <unk> the entire item is # rd rate and wish i could return it except amazon 's return process is a pain in the * $ # ! @ ! * #
this bag is really cute but very small , and for some reason it smells bad on the inside i thought the bag was going to be a light red but its not its a very dark red not what i expected
it 's not as big as it might seem it also not that strong to carry laptop , textbooks , and notes it 's good for a person who is always carrying less things
the backpack arrived and it was raining so i decided to test it out it 's not waterproof good thing my laptop was n't in there bought it for biking but i guess i can never put any electronics in it it 's an ok regular backpack would 've been perfect if it actually performed as advertised
cute and silky it even has a laptop slot however , the buttons were backwards when it arrived and i had to fix it myself the & # # ; silky & # # ; material also feels pretty cheap
the backpack is nice but the size is smaller than it looks but its great quality , the interior material is really cool the fishy smell did eventually go away but if youre looking for something spacious for books and binders , dont get this
when i first got it there was this really bad smell to it so i had to let it air dry for a couple of hours everything was going well until after # or # months of usage , one of the shoulder straps just broke off i do n't use this backpack for hiking , just normal books for school , so kinda disappointed it only lasted for #
i have received a lot of compliments with this bag ; however , the strap broke within a month of having it i had to sow it back on , but still , it was not as durable as i would have liked
it 's got a sufficient amount of pockets it looks great and feels of a study quality but when it 's clear that a certain level of quality is trying to be achieved , i think it can do much better the top pouch looks like it can be a storage pocket , so why not make it one the straps themselves are also very thin if i 'm going to be carrying a # & # # ; laptop around all day , incase straps allow for that much more comfortably all in all though , i do really like the aesthetics of the bag
the item arrived quickly and is just as expected many previous posts spoke of a & # # ; smell & # # ; with the item ; however , there was none with this one it has held up well these last few weeks of school and hope it holds up for most of the year , if not all
quality looks good for the $ $ color is not what i would call a pink , it 's more like salmon which brings me to other <unk> saying their bag had a distinct odor mine had no fishy smell what so ever i like the bag , it 's easily seen apart from others
was very surprised when i got <unk> of the cheapest backpacks online but looks classy and is waterproof -lrb- had backpack in rain and my laptop remained safe -rrb- only problem is that if you do one of the zippers one way , for some reason the zipper itself will just open up my brilliant solution : i only zip up the backpack with the zipper that 's on the other size problem <unk> issues since not really anywhere to hold a water bottle besides inside the actually bag , but regardless i really like this bag can hold a laptop , # notebooks and like # <unk> textbooks
this bag is really nice it is water proof and stylish the interior does have a fishy smell that i have n't tried to get rid of yet but it is worth its price i 'm going to clean it or air it out to see if the smell goes away
delivered sooner than expected . way sooner . appreciate it . but like other comments , it has a weird smell inside which i managed to get rid of with perfume and the sun nice colour and quite fit me well for school work
i bought this backpack because i needed a waterproof backback for my trip to orlando as rain comes and goes in orlando this backpack met my expectation i got caught in a downpour and not only did it not get anything soak inside but it also kept my water bottles inside cold i tried this backpack on a water ride at disney world and sure enough , nothing got soak inside it also <unk> up pretty fast this item is definitely worth it
this is the most <unk> backpack i 've ever had the inside material is so soft and the nylon is nice looks small but it is very spacious this is where your money should go buy this , you wo n't regret it
other then the random horrid smell that came with it , i actually love this bag the material on the outside is soft to the touch and has proved its waterproofing the inside is a durable material that is unlike any backpack i have ever <unk> it 's good though
this bag is amazing i have gotten many compliments on it and it arrived on time i am a college student , so i carry a lot of books and this bag is able to carry everything i would definitely recommend it to anyone wanting a stylish bag the only bad thing is the weird smell , but it is not terrible
the backpack was just how it was described the only thing i did n't like was the backpack came with a weird smell i got rid of the smell by turning the backpack inside out and i sprayed it with perfume in all the compartments i then let it air dry and it was fine by the next day i would definitely buy another backpack from this seller
when i stumbled across this backpack , i was thinking i had to get <unk> # days it arrived at my house and the first thing i checked out was the material nylon which is a good material does n't get wet when it rains lovely leather straps love the classy look : -rrb- i 'll give this bag a # the backpack is almost the same size if you have a jansport <unk> can fit most of the things well in this backpack i would recommend this to anyone who are looking to look classy :
i love this bag it definately is waterproof and the smell everyone talks about goes away i shipped it to my friend at college a day before i got there he aired it out for me one night and i got there it there was no smell . it is really cute and bright . and its very fuctional i carry my laptop in it everyday and it works perfect
the top part did n't fit my laptop -lrb- the # . # & # # ; samsung series # -rrb- , and the bottom part was really flimsy i thought it would break whenever i typed on it i do n't use it anymore
i bought this knowing it was n't going to be top of the line but i do n't think i could have set my standards low enough first of all , it 's made of cheep plastic i expect this thing to break in about a week second of all the protector that goes on the top screen does n't even fit its just a tad to small to clip on so that is useless the bottom protect fits but is continually falling off i am so disappointed in this purchase and i suggest to anyone thinking of getting one to skip there has got to be better cases out there
i bought this for my ultrabook <unk> # , but unfortunately it does n't fit correctly the design is not good enough and there is a part that does n't match the shape of the notebook
the black shell case i received is opaque solid black , not the translucent shell that appears in the listing so it loses style points , but seems to otherwise fit samsung # c securely
i do n't think you can get your casing scratched up with this little beauty item as described easy to attach and takes a little effort to remove which is a good thing because you do n't want it falling off randomly
i just received the product today and was excited to finally find something that might fit my macbook pro # inch snugly numerous reviews claim that it was a good fit for that particular laptop was i ever disappointed my macbook does not have a hard case around it , so once i put it in the case there was about # inches to spare width wise and around a # inch length wise my computer rolls around in there nicely so , if you want a sleeve that fits a macbook pro # inch snugly , do n't get this one i wise that i can recommend one maybe one day i will be able to ... <unk> bummed in colorado = -lrb- other than the fact that it does n't work for me size wise , it seems like a very nice case
fits my macbook and charging cords perfectly and the design is just like the picture the padding is good enough that i feel my computer is protected but not too bulky
just like the picture , my daughter is going to love the color and its pattern padded and the pocket is really big to hold all the things needed to your laptop
i searched all over for a case for my new # & # # ; macbook pro that had a separate outside pocket for cords and such this one is perfect everything fits without being bulky
i was expecting a bit more <unk> form this backpack it 's nice that it 's light , but because it 's just a fabric shell , with no support at all , everything just <unk> to the bottom needs a bit more <unk> , especially when you 're using it to carry electronics as well as your other supplies it 's a bit of a hassle to convert from a backpack to a duffel , but the ability to do so is really handy
high quality bag i love the design and quality of construction unfortunately for me , i had to return it because it is too big for me to wear as a backpack i tightened the straps as much as i could and it was still a loose fit on my shoulders i assume it was not designed for someone who is # ' # & # # ; and # pounds
just the right size for traveling light and fast through europe or asia it 's lightweight and fairly sturdy although the top compression strap <unk> from it 's stitchings after only a week other than that the bag held up really well for three weeks in thailand and japan it 's compact enough to fit in most size plane overhead compartments or beneath the seat in front of you it never needs to be checked baggage it 's comfortable to wear while hiking on the island of <unk> <unk> <unk> in thailand with a belt strap that helps take the load off your shoulders i liked how you could stow away the straps when not in use like in hotel rooms instead of having the straps and belts hanging loose getting dirty or caught on everything
i guess it 's what it 's supposed to be , but somehow i thought it would be a bit nicer honestly , i do n't like it for my laptop seems cheap looking and somewhat flimsy or poorly made for a high quality , expensive laptop i wo n't use it -lrb- the keypad cover that comes free is down right <unk> and i would n't even consider it
it is rather flimsy compared to speck and/or incase however , they had the color i wanted there are too many ventilation holes on the bottom of the case which make it less sturdy also , if you do n't extend the back legs for <unk> it tends to slide around the desk
i love the cover it 's sturdy and fits nice liked the fact that it has clips to angle the macbook would give it a # if the keyboard cover was better looking keyboard cover just looked cheap and was more of a throw in
fits beautifully ; however , if you happen to put on incorrectly , it is a bear to get off other than that , i love the cover it is attractive and does what it is suppose to do - protect my macbook pro
i love my ipearl mcover it was a little difficult snapping on the cover which makes it a little difficult to take off it fits perfect and the red color is beautiful the cover is lightweight and sturdy it does n't make your laptop bulky or heavy i would definitely recommend purchasing this product - it 's a must have item
i kid you not , i did n't have the cover on but # minutes and dropped my # week old macbook from about # feet , and not even a dent on the cover let alone the macbook will buy from seller again in the future
excellent service , the product had great packaging and was shipped quickly the case fits like a glove and looks amazing it protects my macbook pro retina i love the pop out feet at the bottom as well highly recommend if you 're looking for a great case to protect your macbook
the first time i unzipped the bag the top seam ripped about # inches this bag is incredibly cheap i highly recommend spending more on a nice bag -lrb- e.g . , samsung -rrb- the zipper fabric has the thickness of two coffee filters glued together - return ... not worth it
zipper was broken when it arrived cheap material and hardware used have an older version of the same bag and loved it , used it for # years so super disappointing
within the first two weeks the big front pocket tore and both bottle pockets on the side are torn too this is after careful use i am very disappointed with this purchase and would like a replacement
i ordered this rolling bag b/c of the laptop compartment being in the back of the bag vs. the front , in order for the bag not to tip forwards like my previous bag did that feature is great -- plenty of room for large laptops to slide right into the compartment and ca n't think why more rolling computer backpack bags do n't have that feature so the bags wo n't tip i 've marked this bag at a # star rating for # reasons first is the zippers on this bag - very poor quality these zippers feel flimsy and even brand new seem to catch when zipping and unzipping i can only think that this will <unk> over time second reason is that the overall bag construction and material seem cheap feeling compared to my last rolling laptop backpack -lrb- calpak -rrb- this bag does n't have the padding or the quality construction that calpak had , but this bag offers a # year warranty vs. calpak 's # year on any manufacturing defects , so we 'll see i 'll post an update in a year 's time to see how things have gone overall , bag style and design with the laptop sleeve compartment in the rear of the bag is great , but points off for poor material and zippers
the backpack arrived on time but the front pocket zipper does n't work properly somehow , the backpack is tilted when it is in the upright position it looks like it 'll fall i still keep it , because my son 's old back already broken
we are liking this backpack very much my son needed a rolling backpack for school and this is a good one , especially for the price my only complaint is about the configuration of the sections the main pocket is great and fits all of his books but , the two front pockets are small and you really ca n't fit anything in them , like a lunch box there is one section on the side which i do use for the lunch box , but it is an odd shape and hard to get to i am not really sure why they designed it that way but , we are still happy with the quality of the backpack and it is working well
nice bag , just a little bit larger than expected for under the seat air travel laptop compartment is great have n't put enough mileage on it to know if it will survive many flights , but seems tough enough
i like it a lot , i wanted an all in # laptop compartment / gym bag i wish there was a little compartment for the power strip / headset but i put that in the very last part of the bag where the straps are , that 's the only item that is missing
i bought this rolling backpack for a young man who travels between his mom 's and dad 's weekly so he could put his gaming units in it it is made of sturdy material , rolls well , and is comfortable if using the straps a few times i 've seen it travel to school with heavy textbooks in it thanks for the reasonably priced purchase
i bought the <unk> brand rolling back pack & was disappointed by the flimsy design that did n't last the first month my son carries several thick text books & folders and this new bag is sturdy for his load i 'm really happy with this purchase & recommend it to anyone looking for quality at a great price buy it ! !
i bought this to carry my camera equipment on an airplane . the bad holds all that i need , plus has a handy laptop compartment for easy access going through security . it also fits under an airplane seat the wheels roll smoothly and make it easy to transport , or it can convert to a backpack if needed this is a great product
i use this backpack to take my work laptop to and from work i also carry a lot of other stuff - lunch , workout clothes , and whatever else i need for the day this is perfect it holds it all the wheels roll nicely and i am able to pull it around with ease the handle pushes down into the backpack and has a zipper over it for storage the backback straps are also stored and when that pouch is opened it folds down over the wheels this is great if the wheels are wet , then you do n't get your back wet too there is a handy handle on top to carry it when needed
awesome backpack ! this is the one i ever wanted it seems professional i use it for office office and for <unk> purchasing also it can take heavy things like milk , <unk> , <unk> etc . . but wheels are little noisy almost all roller bags have same noise problem but if u r ok with little noise , then its a perfect size backpack in budget
i ordered it almost a month ago when i track it , it only says & # # ; in transit & # # ; you would think that after being in & # # ; transit & # # ; for so long , that there would be several post offices or places where it would be checked into but it says none it does not even say where i left the facilities from however , my credit card still got charged i will definitely be asking for my money back
the picture is a nice & # # ; deep purple & # # ; almost magenta i received a light <unk> color the color did not look anything like the picture but looked exactly like the other purple rubberized case listed on amazon i wanted the picture color and i returned it however the customer service was great and extremely easy to return and get a refund
