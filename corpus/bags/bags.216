i have had the ipearl mcover hard shell case for new # . # & # # ; samsung series # in blue for not quite a year i love the little legs that i can flip to give my laptop a bit of an angle which makes it easier to type the little legs also stabilize my laptop . and keeps it from tipping backwards when i 'm using the touch screen
this cover is great i had a lot of trouble finding a case to fit my laptop , but this one fits perfectly it 's a snug fit , easy to clean , and looks great on
this is a practical laptop case that also gives a touch of personalization with the many color options i purchased the aqua , when i first saw the product i thought the cases were opaque however , all the colors are transparent my computer could fit better into the case but it has a bit of physical damage that makes it hard for the case to close up completely it is very simple to put it on , but it is also easy for the case to pop out if not careful overall if you are looking for a nice and affordable hard case for your samsung ultrabook , this is a good option
be careful , it does n't fit all # . # inch ultrabook my asus book t # is too big -lrb- slightly but enough not to be able put it into -rrb- for this sleeve i have to return it
this is a cheaply made bag the texture is hard and rough , will only heat up the laptop i planned to return it but amazon would charge $ # for shipping
problem was , it does n't really fit most # . # inch laptops i was getting this for a friend who has a convertible laptop and the dimensions of that should have fit in this sleeve ... it did , but not the keyboard portion i could only get the tablet portion into the sleeve and even then it was really snug i was able to get half of the whole laptop into the sleeve with struggle thinking it might open it up some , nope i liked it , since it had a pocket for a charger -lrb- although not really big enough -rrb- and a pocket for your phone -lrb- fit my <unk> lumia # perfectly when i was <unk> around with it -rrb- personally , if i had a tablet , i probably would buy this for myself , but in red and that was if i bought and used sleeves
i got this sleeve for macbook air # inch as soon as i opened the package , there was a dark circle right in the top center i am pretty sure that its not suppose to be like that -lrb- at least according to the pictures on amazon -rrb- also it does not look as great as i thought looking at the pictures here i will be returning this due to that dark spot and look for another sleeve
fast shipping which i appreciated however , the product has a very odd smell to it and my macbook air will only fit into it if i dont have any covers or protectors on it which is a bummer
there is a stain i was not able to remove upon arrival but otherwise , it serves its purpose however , i will need to find some way of covering up the stain
- fits well - cheap - inside of bag is soft and will not scratch your <unk> - because of the material , anything u put in the side pockets slides out . i dropped my portable hd once : -lrb- - side pockets are too thin , i had trouble fitting the charger there - lots of <unk> -lrb- little fur from the edges where material was cut -rrb- got all over my macbook and the usb drive i tried keeping in the side pockets i tried wiping it and using a lint roller , but more kept coming from all the edges - material is kind of stiff so you have to keep the flap secured with the elastic band or your bag will <unk> ended up buying a zippered sleeve for the same price and i am happy with it
i bought the sleeve for my asus vivobook # . # `` touchscreen notebook . it fits the laptop well but it 's not the greatest looking cover , it looks better online the fit is snug , so if you are looking to fit your charger in this as well then it wo n't fit well it bulges out and makes the band not fit well over the sleeve since this fits my # . # inch laptop snuggly i highly doubt it would fit the # inch laptops it claims to fit very well
i ordered this sleeve for my macbook pro # . # inch i have a hard case on my laptop and it would not fit in this sleeve it was n't even close to being big enough i returned it i got a prompt refund and returning was easy
looks just as i would have expected would be a perfect purchase if it had an extra centimeter of wiggle room and i did n't have to pry my protected laptop from the sleeve i have a light casing on my laptop which does n't allow it to slide in and out easily
it is a great laptop bag for my macbook air for its suitable size and tough work indeed , if you like the color and style of it , that would be a good choice however , the only thing thing that make me unsatisfied is it is a litter bit hard , i mean i want some one that more soft
this felt case/sleeve fits the macbook air # & # # ; well enough - but i wish the pockets could also accommodate the # w power adapter a bit more <unk> than a python <unk> a large <unk>
it 's perfectly fine and functional as a product i was just expecting it to be a little nicer looking and i am not a huge fan of the grey and black felt material after seeing it in person looks a bit like a rug instead of a nice laptop carrier but it does the trick so i ca n't complain
the felt is kinda cheap looking the charger does not fit in the pocket it is really just a sleeve for a macbook air it really doesnt protect it if you would drop it not bad for the price though
my macbook air fits perfectly in the sleeve i have n't experienced any problems with the felt thus far and hope not to my only issue is the front pockets when you open the sleeve they do n't accommodate all the cords necessary to take the mac on the go should you need to power up placing the cords can be cumbersome and bulks up the sleeve wish the sleeve was more accommodating
i really like this sleeve and feel that it would be amazing , but it does n't fit my lenovo yoga # pro # . # just thought i 'd post on here to warn any other yoga owners that are considering this as a purchase but , the yoga is not listed as a computer that it fits , but i thought i 'd take a shot
the product definitely protects my computer , but so would a sleeping bag this is not as sleek as the images <unk> i bought the macbook air because it is slender , and compact this case <unk> those advantages granted , this is just a matter of style
bought this for a # -inch ultrabook , and was very excited when it arrived in the mail it is very well built out of high-quality felt and seems like it 'd offer a ton of protection in my bag unfortunately , it was too small for me to fit my ultrabook into , and i had to return it if this came in a slightly larger size i 'd be all over it
looks a little bit pretentious in real life also creases and pulls -lrb- like felt does -rrb- and so quickly starts to appear a bit <unk> for my tastes i do n't think it provides much protection either i purchased a different solution in the end did n't bother to return this as it was so cheap
i have a macbook air # & # # ; # model with a moshi clear case , and it 's difficult to pull the mac out once it 's in i have to turn it upside down and give it a little shake to take the mac out
first off , the picture makes it look better the wool feels like it 's a polyester imitation , and the black strap is extremely cheap and flimsy the inside is lined with dense foam padding i like the feel , i 'll give it that that being said , a few friends did complement it , though i do n't know what they saw i was using it as a binder for my papers at the time , so maybe that 's why point is , you 're better off finding a better deal on etsy yes , their twice as much , but their also five times better in every way
it is the perfect size - my macbook air # fits easily but snugly it looks more professional than some of the zip neoprene covers -lrb- not the fanciest if that is what you are going for though ! -rrb- it fits nicely into backpacks and protects and supports the computer from falling or bending -lrb- as can be a problem with macs in some backpacks i would recommend this
i 've purchased # sleeves for my wife 's # macbook air this one fit the best , it was only offered in grey , which is n't her favorite , but i felt it offered decent protection and fit better than the other # we tried first it 's hard to find a sleeve that fits snuggly , does n't have a zipper that will damage the air and offers some protection i like the way this one is lined inside to offer a spongy layer of protection no doubt that any sleeve wo n't protect a laptop from being left on the roof of a car and driving off , but for daily use , bumping around in the backpack this is the one to go with
it firs my vaio pro # much better than the case that was suggested by sony when i ordered my computer i think it is a little bulky and i wish the elastic was tighter , but for the price , it works for my needs and has a nice clean aesthetic for day to day use , i just slide my laptop into a built in sleeve in my work tote , but i like to have a bit more protection for when i am travelling i would probably find something a bit more streamlined if i was going to use it daily
fits snug and is great the black strap is n't the most secure because the cover can slip out from under it , so i get kind of scared sometimes carrying it and having it accidentally slip out i 've seen ones with a string and button to secure it i think that i would feel more confident if it had that included , along with the black strap or just something to secure it shut other than that , great product love the look and feel of it
so i was looking for a sleeve that would fit and look great on my macbook pro ' # and i found this case i did receive the product two days after i purchased it so that was great the outside feels a little weird not rough a but not as soft the inside either the inside like i just said is really soft the inside is the best part so you can relax because it wo n't scratch your laptop the thing that i did not like was that the rubber band to close the case is too low and looks crooked every time i close the case with my laptop the flap on the sleeve comes loose i wish they would have made the cover much bigger so the band can keep it closed the pocket are nice but only work if the phone is n't in a case
this was a case i purchased for a new laptop even though it did n't quite fit my # . # `` lenovo -lrb- my mistake -rrb- , i ended up keeping the case to use as a pretty file folder for school papers this is an adorable laptop case -lrb- for those # `` and smaller -rrb- and i highly recommend it
got this for my macbook air it 's nice , i like it the only thing is if you have a non-apple mouse and have one of those mini usb plugs for your mouse your macbook wo n't fit in here so only get if you do n't <unk> a mouse around with you or if you have an apple mouse
this case is perfect for my new ultrabook ; lightweight yet protective ; i love the grey felt which is subtle yet elegant , and i love the two little pockets in the front for accessories this felt case fits perfectly into my shoulder bag for work and protects the computer while i am on bus or train it 's easy in and out as my computer just slides in and the top flips over ; no fussy fasteners
the laptop i purchased was not a macbook , but a # . # inch lenova it fit perfectly , but there is not much room if you are looking for space to add other items it was perfect for my purposes
this sleeve is exactly what i was looking for - fits my macbook air # `` perfectly the felt on the outside is not scratchy to touch , the microfiber inside is so soft and does n't leave any little fuzzy bits on my laptop i love that it has an elastic strap - not magnets - to close it all up tightly i know they say magnets are fine , but it just <unk> me out the one thing i do n't love about this case is the little pockets on the inside they 're very snug , so you can really only fit -lrb- tightly ! -rrb- an ipod or iphone , a little notepad , etc . i did n't buy it for the pockets , so it 's not a big deal for me , but if that 's a big draw for you , just keep in mind that they do n't hold much
i use this with a lenovo thinkpad twist s # u it fits very nicely the only problem i have with this & # # ; case & # # ; is that there is not really a possibility of fitting in the charging adapter there is just nowhere it will fit there is not a lot of stretch to the case like other neoprene ones other than that it does a good job of protecting the computer with a little bit of cushion
this sleeve is stylish , cheap and fits the macbook air very well i feared pieces of lint or fur would get into my computer , but so far nothing like that has happened it 's quite flimsy , and does not protect the macbook on its own , but that was never my intention anyway i usually put a display converter in the side pocket , and find that that fits well too
strap was crooked but i love it anyway overall quality is good the strap was the only issue but for the price i can deal with it arrived fast too
i expected the black elastic band to actually hold the cover tightly closed , but it does n't really -lrb- it is sort of loose -rrb- nevertheless , it is a nice product and i am happily using it to keep my macbookair
i really like the sleeve that i purchased the product is great quality and so price effective i ordered it based on the dimensions from my computer , and it 's a little tight , so i have to fight to get my computer out my computer is # & # # ; so anything smaller than that would fit perfectly
this is exactly the kind of sleeve i was looking for - simple and attractive i had hoped that the large pocket would contain my power cord , but it does n't quite if you put something too bulky in the pockets , the flap wo n't stay under the elastic that 's the only reason i gave it # stars instead of # , even though the pockets were really just a bonus feature and i 'd give it # . # stars if i could
this is nicely made especially for the price it is a bit of a snug fit it will not fit with a plastic cover this case is a very nice color and is nice for a carry on bag
looks and fits great note to people looking at review , the felt sleeve does not have magnets some reviews talk about magnets , but it 's because there were multiple products on one page
the case works well it 's a felt material that i can see wearing pretty quickly but so far it does the job it 's small and compact and fits the computer nicely
it was tight at first but loosens to fit the air my only regret is buying a sleeve that i could n't open within my backpack with this product i have to take it all the way out and then open the flap , just an extra step its nice though
i really like this sleeve it is very easy to get the computer in and out and it fits very well the only down side is that when i carry my external dvd player the flap is not quite long enough to stay closed
i prefer sleeves to hard cases this one is great , and fits a # inch mac air nicely the elastic band could be a bit tighter , but do n't let this deter you from getting it
great product , very lightweight and cushions your laptop well had some issues with my first purchase but easy acc was super apologetic and extremely helpful , they sent me this case the next day without any additional charges and kept me updated with emails every step of the way they earned my trust big time i will definitely be staying updated on their products just because of their excellent customer service
i love this product it 's neat and it protects my new macbook air very well the top cover does n't slip out of the band when it 's closed and <unk> was my biggest concern it 's soft and thick , and provides the protection that i wanted and needed for my macbook
it 's a snug fit for my # inch macbook air , which is better than having the machine slosh around inside the case the soft lining makes me think , or at least hope , that it will keep the air from being scratched , marred , et cetera a lot of <unk> probably died in the manufacture of this product , but i do n't care , they gave their all for the noble cause of protecting a magical device
i like the material , does n't feel cheap and takes care of my new sony vaio pro # i could manage to fit my external drive and cable in it as we 'll , which is nice i did n't end up using it for too long since i bought a small leather portfolio bag for my laptop and the case was slightly too big to fit
fits my # in macbook air perfectly i 've been using it in my messenger bag for a little bit of extra protection the storage spots are handy i keep a vga adapter in the big one and have never had any trouble with it falling out the only downside for me is that the fit is snug enough that everything has to be removed from the laptop 's usb ports before i put it in
the price is cheap , and the quality is good there is nothing on the case that would scratch your laptop , and it 's thick enough to prevent anything happening to your laptop while it 's packed in your bag one of the extra slots holds my ms arc touch mouse perfectly fits my samsung series # inch laptop great
i really like this felt sleeve it fits the macbook perfectly and it is so easy to carry alone or in another bag because it is n't bulky it is made well and i think it will last for a long time i prefer a sleeve without a zipper and this is exactly what i was looking for
of course , there are higher quality items out there , but this one is great for the price i just wanted a bit extra pad in my bag on a macbook air # & # # ; it fits perfectly slightly snug , but easily slides in and out of the case the elastic just slides over the lid area . it adds about # & # # ; to the entire thickness at the thickest point obviously , it does compress a little if needed it is felt with neoprene under it
solidly built and perfectly fitting i do n't think it 's going to save my laptop from a critical fall , but it 's padded enough to keep it safe in my bag full of things
this sleeve fits my sony vaio pro # ultrabook perfectly it 's sleek and stylish and lacks bulk , so it does not take up much room in my <unk> bag i get as many compliments on it as i do on the computer
after buying my macbook air , i was split between getting a case or a sleeve turns out that if you want to have something that protects your macbook air without compromising design - then the sleeve is the way to go the interior has a type of soft padding and the exterior is made from grey felt -lrb- tennis <unk> -rrb- material it fits easily into your back pack and does n't add bulk
this is a nice sleeve i bought it for an # . # & # # ; hp elitebook with a large oversized batter the laptop fits snugly , but perfectly fine in the sleeve it offers that extra protection i desire when not using a backpack with proper laptop protection
no bulky buckles , no snaps to snag , this sleek felt envelope holds my macair # like a glove i can carry it alone or slip it into a bag and trust that my computer is protected from scrapes and scratches the sleeve also serves as a cushion to protect my laptop when in use very pleased with my purchase
i ordered this case for my new samsung series # ultra and it is a great fit i have only had it a few weeks but the quality seems to be pretty good and i hope it will last long , in addition it looks better than other laptop cases i have owned i highly recommend it for its quality and <unk>
i like this case very much it does a fine job protecting my macbook air ; easy to take it out , put it in has some small pockets , too maybe for an ipod
great purchase for the # & # # ; macbook air it 's a stylish case at just the right price i do n't use the inner pockets since they 're so thin , but my main concern was to protect my computer and this case does just that
i ordered this for a new # & # # ; macbook air , and it worked perfectly however , when the macbook pro # & # # ; was released , i returned the air for the newer , slimmer pro model the pro fits in the sleeve just fine , maybe a tad bit tighter , but it works to shield the computer from the routine bumps and scratches of day to day wear internal pockets are fine for an additional <unk> and cable do n't know how this product will hold up in the long run , but for now , it 's great
i got this for a guy friend and he loves it in fact , he ran into a friend who has the exact same one and he gets compliments on it at the office
i am in love with my case it 's super cute and i get compliments on it all the time it protects my macbook air perfectly it was a perfect fit
i bought this for macbook air late # edition this case is for carrying the computer like a book , not a briefcase i have been pretty happy with the product , my laptop fits snug , the elastic easily secures everything and the color is neutral enough go with everything
this is a must buy if you want to protect the outside of your mba from dents and dings the hard case fits snug and tight the keyboard cover , however , is not very usable for me because it blocks the backlit light for the keyboard leaving it dark when i need it to be lit you are better off buying a keyboard cover that is clear and wo n't cover your backlit light overall , good buy
i like this a lot it is perfect everything attaches to my mac and its easy to put on this is a good product for your mac book air good price i 'm happy with this
the hardcase works excellently , make sure you fully snap it in or you 'll think it 's broken i folded my keyboard cover one too many times and ca n't get it to lay flat anymore closing the lid with the cover in place leaves big prints on monitor when you <unk> ... though that could be more due to my own hands being
for the price you pay this product is great the only thing i do n't like is the way the keypad feels when using it , so i do n't use the keypad
it is n't as sturdy as i would have hoped for i wanted something with handles and this was one of the few cases i could find with handles on amazon i am a bit clumsy , so i worry about taking my laptop out of the house with the case and possibly banging it against something i do n't think this case will give the laptop the protection it needs i would have hoped for more cushioning , or a harder outer case on a positive note , it is nice looking and seems to be made well
cute case , appears durable . moderately padded . fits my mba a # even with protective cover on it i took one star off because it arrived stained on the inside had no time to exchange it so i kept it
i got my air and as soon as i had it i wanted a nice bag looked at amazon , my <unk> choice , and there this bag was this is one of the best looking cover for an air # . # <unk> that i could figure out i looked at cheaper options , however just loved this one . one less star as it doesnt look as great as in the picture , nevertheless it still looks very nice worth buying , also comes with nice pockets to keep ur mouse , adaptor and a <unk> all in all love it
so far so good , the couple weeks i 've had it does n't seem to get dirty easily , and the interior is nice and soft there 's barely enough room for a full-size mouse in the side compartment , the bag feels stressed while holding it while holding a charger & mouse it 's pretty much at max capacity , but the saving grace is that you can fit extra items in the handle <unk> all of that said , this bag is n't made to hold that much anyways most of the time i use it only to throw my air into and go -lrb- and with the new battery life of the air i do n't even bother bringing my charger most of the time -rrb-
a simple classy , sophisticated looking bag well lined inside to protect the cargo quality appears great love the option for handles or to slide them inside personally , i like having the handles offers a side storage pocket the gray color is perfect and appears as shown in the picture had it for a couple of months at this point , would definitely buy it again
looks very sleek and the inside is a soft , furry material . very nice if you try to put your macbook laptop charger in though , it fits but it bulges out the side
fits a few items besides my computer with a case once the items are in , its a little tight and i ca n't always zip the case up but i do not mind , since i would rather be able to carry multiple items around in one case then in various different carrier cases i love the material and it looks very professional i use it on a daily bases i recommend this item to anyone that needs a case for their computer the padding helps you feel secure with your computer even if the computer does not have a case on it already
exactly like the picture fits my computer perfectly -lrb- with a hardshell case also on it -rrb- , and i can store a small amount of things in the side pockets , which i was n't anticipating overall , pretty great
this case slides on my imac making it more of a hassle than what it 's worth the green is not vibrant as in the picture the keyboard cover is a bright lime green and the actual cover is a pale , mint green
i chose this item because of the color and the price -lrb- which is considerably lower than those purchased in the apple store -rrb- but unfortunately the product does n't fit despite my # % buying the right size also , one of the stickers on the retina screen is impossible to get off cleanly this item is being returned immediately for a refund
i ordered this case for my macbook air and it was terrible , it did not fit at all and the color was not see through , returning is a haul as you can only return directly to china
used it for literally two weeks , right in the trash putting it on is easy , but taking it off is a battle i swear i needed another person to help me and it still took forever now it 's not like we 're not bright people , it 's just a pain and it felt like i was going to scratch and damage my computer the reason why i was trying to take it off was because it got dirty too easily and the smudges of black would n't come off even though it was dirt cheap it 's definitely not worth using it for only two weeks , and going through that pain to take it off i would highly recommend you guys to choose another case with better quality
the picture makes the cover look transparent ... but its not also it is really really hard to get off and i am super frustrated -lrb- it still has n't come off -rrb- i have decals that i want to show and now i 'm afraid that once i -lrb- finally -rrb- get the cover off , it will ruin my decal once i get it off , i probably wo n't put it back on upset with this product
i liked the idea of this case & wanted something affordable i was not impressed with the quality the bottom piece stays on but the top cover does not . both top & bottom show every fingerprint the keyboard cover is ok but but not impressed with it it was cheap and it looks and performs cheaply ! :
i ordered this for my new macbook and did n't like it at all it did n't really fit the computer very well and just made a sleek computer look kind of crappy
i ca n't open my macbook air all the way without the case popping out , and both the mics are completely covered i love how it feels but i 'm afraid the hinges are going to break on my macbook
i loved this color and was very excited for this case but it does not accurately fit my macbook air it is supposed to fit snugly on the computer but it does n't i do like the keyboard cover though it gives some fun color to my laptop
the fit of this cover is great on my macbook air a # mid- # model all ports are exposed and the fit is tight as others have said , it is challenging to get the tabs to move to take it off strong fingernails or slipping a credit card to pop it off is the method that worked for me but my big beef is the color is not really & # # ; deep purple & # # ; it is a magenta color there is a lot of red in the purple the keyboard cover is purple but is not the same color as the cover my three star rating is a blend of & # # ; # & # # ; for fit and & # # ; # & # # ; for color
- case was easy to snap on - transparent color , but not as bright as <unk> - screen protector was missing - keyboard cover was clear , not ` robin egg blue ' to match the case - keyboard cover muffled the laptop 's sound a
i have had the case on my macbook ever since i bought it and absolutely love the style the color is very stylish and personal to my liking however , the rubber keyboard cover does not fit my keyboard very well , like it has stretched out , which makes it hard to type other people that i notice with rubber keyboard covers seem to not have this problem also , there was a small crack in the computer case after minimal travel time
****** the seller gets # stars for customer service after reading my review they contacted me and said they are happy to make the return and offered a discount on a future purchase they explained to me that i may be looking for a gel case , item was not as described , said it was rubberized but it is not i would defiantly buy from them again , with their fast response to my concerns it is obvious customer service is a priority to them knowing that if i buy from them and i 'm dissatisfied i can return with no hassle is a plus
i just wanted some protection for my macbook air , and had heard that the speck brand was not great this was my next choice , and the top piece is great , the keyboard cover is very helpful -lrb- though it blocks the backlighting on the keys -rrb- , but the bottom piece does n't quite fit it 's cracked because of the strain of trying to fit over the computer other than that - for the price & # # ; just great
it arrived extremely early the case had little to no damage was hard to put one but stays firmly in place the keyboard protector fits perfectly but feel weird when typing and some of the letter are not matching the original make me see double also its hard to clean it monitor cover was a headache to put on so much dust was getting on it before i put it on there were a lots of bubble so i kept on taking it of it clear , you can see we 'll but i think i 'm going to end up <unk> it
item was shipped fast the screen protector is ok but difficult to apply . the case is good but some of the clips are not the correct size to hold onto the computer . it does its job and the color looks nice
i love the case the color is beautiful and it fits my # macbook air perfectly the reason i 'm giving it # stars instead of # is because the keyboard cover does n't quite match the case color it 's more of a sky blue , but it does n't matter too much the keyboard cover did come with a few faults the letters & # # ; e & # # ; and & # # ; u & # # ; were faded and the down arrow had a little hole
took me a few minutes to coax this case onto the cover of my laptop but once it was on it seems to offer good protection the case is made from thicker , harder plastic so it 's really sturdy cool color and good product for the money if you like a case with a bit more heft
the color is a little off from the pictures and the case is a little hard to put on i was a little worried that i was going to damage my computer but that was probably me just being over cautious the keyboard cover works flawlessly and you can even see the lights on the keys through it overall great product for the price
i love my case the only problem for me was that the case started to chip away and crack near the corners and the plug ins however , the case still stays snug on my laptop
this product is okay . rate # out of # . one <unk> that i really dont like is that it gets dirty really really fast and all the fingerprints show on it
you get what you pay for the color is nice and the cover feels great but the side broke in less than a week it is still usable but the bottom comes off
