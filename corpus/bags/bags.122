this bag is cute and worked well for a while ... but after less than a year -lrb- and not many uses -rrb- both of the leather handles broke off , just as many other reviewers had happen to them invest in a more reliable , better <unk> bag for your laptop
i found this laptop carry case good for the mini laptops they have currently on the market , but i 'm afraid this one is just too small to fit a normal size laptop in it
this laptop bag is super cute , but it only good for light use on my second trip , i was walking through the airport and noticed that the handle was starting to rip off the body of the case
this is really adorable ... and i wanted a bag that did n't scream `` i am carrying an expensive piece of equipment `` the way most laptop bags do this looks more like a tote bag , which is what i was hoping i am definately gon na have to carry my laptop accessories in my purse or another bag the bag snugly holds my computer -lrb- which is about # `` x # `` i think -rrb- ... and nothing else no room for cds or dvds or even the power cord the outside pocket has no depth , and maybe you could slip a file folder or two in it , but that is about it and the cell phone holder on the side looks cute , but i do n't know many people that have a cell phone that narrow and this is from a person who always wants the cutest cell phone in short , it will hold my computer and look cute doing it
this bag only held my # `` ibook nothing else , like the first poster stated no cord , nothing plus after only a few months of use , one of the black straps came <unk> from the side it 's * really * cute , but it just was not at all practical if you need to carry a power cable or anything else
i bought this as a gift for my sister for christmas the outside is vinyl , so you can easily clean it it has a handy <unk> holder on the outside on the inside it is very well padded to protect your laptop i am very pleased with this purchase , and my sister loved it the price was very good too
i got this for my # inch mac book pro i like the look and feel of the sleeve a lot , and it is very well constructed however , i think the size mentioned is a bit misleading . it is a bit too snug for my laptop it is a quarter inch too small in my opinion
it 's a functional bag , my dell d # fits very nicely unfortunately the bag is rather bulky and could have been designed better , like a more fitting sleeve that does n't take up as much room in a backpack then again , for # dollars , i can not complain too much . #
i bought this sleeve for my dell inspiron e # and it is a perfect fit with a little room for my headphones the exterior is a bright pink tough nylon and the padding is pretty thick , while it could be a little better it seems durable enough the interior is cute , with soft black corduroy and little printed <unk> my computer thankfully does n't run warm , but if yours does , then this sleeve also acts as a good pad to protect you from the heat all in all , i love this notebook sleeve it is a great looking and functional sleeve , especially for those of you who do n't want the boring old black notebook sleeve
the first thing i noticed is the heavy thickness and <unk> of the outer nylon fabric i anticipated a lightweight and slippery outer nylon fabric -lrb- based on other 's comments -rrb- yet the fabric is closer to canvas a feature worth noting is the internal <unk> and <unk> flap that rests against the laptop for shock protection and keeping dust from <unk> the computer the case is well-padded to protect against mild shock and scratching but do n't expect protection from accidental drops the velcro fastener is tough and effective beware there is no room for your ac charger -lrb- for a # `` laptop -rrb- overall , the sleeve is well-made and tough this is an excellent buy at # dollars or under above this price point it makes more sense to find a sleeve/case with room for accessories
other people who have reviewed this item have complained that it 's too bulky so i knew that before i purchased it i still really like it though , especially for what i paid for it it 's kind of like wrapping your netbook in bubble wrap but it 's very durable and well-made my only criticism is that i can barely squeeze my netbook in there and it takes a lot of effort to get it out too i 'm hoping that it will stretch out a little over time
i just purchased a new macbook , and i really like the slip sleeve its really well padded and small enough that it can fit into another bag for added protection i really wanted to make sure that my computer is well protected and this sleeve does the job ... and its alot cheaper than anything you can find in the apple store
i decided to leave feedback for anyone shopping for the same thing i was i ordered this to protect my <unk> t # , which is a # . # `` screen it actually arrived before the computer , and i quite liked the construction very well padded , soft inside , and no zippers i thought the dimensions would fit because it is thicker but not as wide as stated it actually * almost * fit , like a pair of tight jeans a size too small that said , it is a nice product , so i gave it # stars even though it did n't work for me i am the one to blame for the error , after all so , if you have the same model as i do , go for a little bigger size
the nylon sleeve is padded and thoroughly protects the laptop it is easy to open and close - specially convenient when traveling for inspections and work only negative to this product is that it does n't have a pocket to store the power supply or accesories like usb drives , dvd 's , etc .
i wanted laptop sleeve , but did n't want a boring color like black this one is pricey for a laptop sleeve , but it is exactly what i wanted i am giving # stars only because of the high price the sleeve has no hardware , so nothing will scratch the machine it is nicely padded , black corduroy inside , and a velcro closure on the outside flap it fits my # `` dell d # laptop perfectly
shipped very fast , great product very good quality the case is perfect because it has the plush inside and i do n't have to worry about my mac being scratched
this sleeve is just perfect fits perfectly to my # inch laptop and the material is just strong enough to not allow damages for the laptop inside of it
compared to the available neoprene sleeves i 've seen , this one appears to be a much better option for me the neoprene sleeves feel too delicate , easy to tear and too thin as a padding material the sumo exterior seems to be made of a nice <unk> nylon seen on soft luggage and the interior made of a thick cloth similar to corduroy with about # `` of padding sandwiched between the two i can barely squeeze in my # `` macbook pro but it fits albeit snugly -lrb- it 's probable , given the materials used , that the sleeve will stretch a little over time -rrb-
i had been looking for a sleeve to protect my laptop while it was in my messenger bag i did n't want a new bag , because i liked the one i had , but all the sleeves i saw were kind of ugly and did n't seem a -rrb- very durable or b -rrb- very well made i thought i 'd give the sumo sleeve a try , although i was worried that it might be a bit small for my laptop , which is a dell but it arrived today , five days earlier than the estimate , and it 's great very sturdy and well made , and really well padded , so i have no worries about putting it into my bag with my cords and other paraphernalia plus it 's kind of unique looking , which i like i think the price is very good , as i shopped around for quite awhile before buying , and found this to be the most bang for the buck i highly recommend sumo to anyone that wants a unique and dependable solution to laptop protection
i have a # . # in screen laptop which is kinda an awkward size not many cases will fit this well i managed to find this case and i love it it is not to <unk> and i can easily carry my laptop in my backpack with it it also offers enough padding and i feel my laptop is secure inside it it will only fit the laptop , nothing else so it is useful for someone who is putting their laptop in a bag or something
not leather or if it does have leather it 's not very much other than a poor description on materials this is exactly what i was looking for in a bag this is perfect for business travelers
meets my needs leather is very soft , and could scratch or mar , but with a little care this should not be a problem the case has plenty of mesh pockets to hold accessories
i bought this bag for $ # shipped and it came in two days on amazon prime this is made for a # `` laptop and has a great little pouch for the smaller ones , but does not fit the # `` and up well the side cushions do not accommodate the large laptops well , but it can be squeezed in great quality targus bag with plenty of pouches and pockets for anything you can carry , not sure if you can find a better bag at this price
really pleased with this product ample room with numerous inside and outside pockets and is well padded nothing negative to say ; for the price it is great wish it came in <unk> leather but this black one does look and feel good carry strap and handle is an added
the price and value does n't match up i love all the extra storage in this bag and the durability is just awesome i store my # & # # ; laptop my paperwork my laptop cooler tray and id 's and so much more
this is a very nice case it is well constructed with a lot of zippered pockets to hold paperwork as well as laptop accessories such as the ac adapter and power cord it also comes with it 's own cell phone case this is without a doubt the nicest case i have ever
i used this case this last week for the first time had plenty of room for my hp pavilion dv # and all needed extras has small case for cell phone but not large enough for droid handle is very comfortable i very seldom use the shoulder strap construction is excellent and well padded
works great for my # inch laptop , it is snug and takes a little time to remove at the airport but i still would buy it again , shipping and packing was fine .
the executive leather notebook case is an excellent product in terms of price , durability , superior appearance , and quality of construction which provides a high level of protection for my electronic product
this product sounds promising it 's adequate if your bag is held to the side -lrb- hanging straight down -rrb- ; but if you wear your bag cross torso -lrb- messenger -rrb- , it just plain does not work
the device works it helps pad the load and keeps the strap from slipping off my shoulder however , it 's awkward to attach , it 's unattractive , and it 's bulky i later purchased a air cell lined velcro shoulder strap pad , and it works great , is lighter , less bulky , and more attractive
this product does its advertised job by reducing the strain of carrying around heavy computer cases and similar items unfortunately has the very bad habit of leaving rubber on those clothes by rubber i mean the type that becomes part of the sport jacket or shirt -lrb- i.e . , becomes <unk> -rrb- this is especially the case if your computer bag is heavy , you have to walk long distances and you wear light colored clothing had to get rid of it
i would have to say that this gadget will probably work for most men , but it is way too wide for use by the average woman it 's also too large to use with most shoulder purses it is not flexible and does n't `` fit `` to your shoulder all it did for me was to get my hair tangled in it
i thought this would be comfortable as a cushion for a heavy shoulder <unk> but it 's not it does stay in place but you need to adjust it perfectly secure on shoulder and it will hold ... it 's rubber and not cushioned
great for long trips where you need to do a lot of walking , i use it attached to my carryon while walking through airports on international trips i did n't have to worry about my bag falling off or the strap cutting in to my shoulder
i purchased this hoping to just have something to stop my purse from slipping -lrb- am i the only one who has this problem there is n't much on the market for this . item is about # `` long and a few inches wide it is just way too much overkill for a purse i highly recommend it if you are carry heavy loads , but not for a purse
i got one of these recently and it has made an unbelievable difference ! ! ! i am always traveling with my laptop and i even bought the fancy and expensive bag to make my traveling a little easier the amount that i spent on the bag was many times the cost of the <unk> , but the <unk> has been much more valuable this device is truly wonderful i can now stand straight while carrying my computer i do n't just use it for my laptop , though , i put it on any bag i use i never thought it would be possible i highly recommend this for everyone
this product is fantastic for a mother on the go i use it for many bags ... it keeps my heavy diaper bag on my shoulder when i am juggling my toddler and my <unk> it also keeps my carry on , on my shoulder comfortably when i am standing on long security lines in the airport i am petite and do n't have a lot of `` padding `` ... this product prevents heavy bags from digging into my shoulder it is great because it is not stuck on one bag like some `` shoulder pads `` are you can take this on and off most bags great invention ... quality product .
all pelican cases are great , but when i order this case i want the case in the picture looking on pelican site i found out that the picture do n't match the model #
i purchased this case as a gift for my husband 's birthday he had mentioned it and i was so happy to have the suggestion he was absolutely pleased to the <unk> degree we took a lengthy road trip and found that the case worked superbly
this bag is made well like a tumi bag and has the best all <unk> for your # . # `` or smaller laptop the only issue is <unk> is not a lot of extra space to carry additional items <unk> the laptop and cords , etc -lrb- not enough space for overnight clothes <unk> a pair of shoes -rrb- the price i paid was of $ # that <unk> was great considering the bag sells for $ #
this brenthaven backpack is a total package it got a well padded slot for the notebook container -lrb- # `` -rrb- , small pockets in and out however , i thought the handle will be <unk> but it 's not i like it <unk> it 's big and can contain all my office accessories
i purchased this backpack due to its core protection system as commented in a previous review , it is a rather wide backpack much less flex in the outer shell than a ` normal ' backpack although i like the built-in core protection , i 'm may get a brenthaven expandable trek backpack for everyday use it does not have the core system , but does have more pockets and a more standard backpack form factor i 'm thinking this backpack will serve me well for travel
this laptop backpack is a great product i had an incident with my previous laptop backpack when it was accidently knocked out of the overhead luggage compartment in an aircraft fortunately my laptop survived but was damaged i decided i needed a better backpack that provided better protection and began <unk> the numerous backpacks available this brenthaven backpack does just that , provides great protection it is a high quality bag offering superior protection , all they space needed for incidentals and looks good to boot
the pictures are very deceiving , when it arrived it was nothing like the picture it was very stiff and square looking it also looked and felt very plastic it was very disappointing and the disappointment was <unk> even more by the amount of time it took to receive the bag i was not very impressed with beach camera and there customer service was very disappointing when i called to ask about the return i encountered a somewhat <unk> representative that basically <unk> a reason for my return with a <unk> attitude i will not order from them again
the bag design is great holds my # in laptop great well designed , and sturdy however the bag was a <unk> or second , and had a small tear on the bottom be sure to inspect carefully
i was so excited to get this bag , which i expected to be stylish and professional ... however , it just looked like a very plain and huge purse it was high quality , and the interior was very nice however , i would have been completely embarrassed to lug this monster around
this bag is massive i ordered the large one because i wanted to make sure that i had enough space well , it turns out that this one had too much space and i had to return it for the smaller version it would have been way too large for commuting on the train further , the bag is very rectangular but i feel that the photos make it look more like a large handbag i was definitely expecting something more `` angled `` on top
i ordered this for work and it hold my macbook , ipad , both chargers and a few files the only downside i have is the zipper is faulty and sometimes does n't close , so i wish i would n't have paid so much yet , it is still a nice handbag for work
it was such a relief to finally find a bag big enough for my dell inspiron i love the way it looks - inside and out the inside is a red suede that makes it really easy to find things in and it has a ton of pockets for organization i have no trouble carrying my power cable and wireless mouse there are also pockets that i can put my mp # and cell phone in the only problem i have is that it can be a little bit cumbersome if carrying it in a crowded area and can be uncomfortable on the shoulders if you have to carry it for a long period of time other than that , i absolutely love it
i read the reviews after i had already ordered the bag yes , if you are expecting high end luxury this bag is not it if you are looking for an <unk> functional bag , then this bag is it i will warn you the bag is huge , very large i now know i could of gotten away with the # inch bag just fine
i love this bag and i have received many compliments on it it 's sturdy and fashionable and the space and pockets inside are ample one issue - the inside is a red fuzzy material - like <unk> the red fuzzies get all over whatever i put in it not a huge deal - i just pick them off but it could potentially drive someone else crazy
this is a great looking bag it 's red on the inside and has room for all of your personal and professional things it 's functional i did n't give it five stars because it 's also very popular if you are a fashion diva and like to be a <unk> , this bag is not it i purchased it just before starting a new position on my first day i realized that half the department was carrying this bag . ugh
when i purchased my laptop -lrb- toshiba p # , # `` screen -rrb- , i had no idea how difficult it would be to find a carrying case for it i had ordered another bag that was supposed to fit , but i would have been stretching it to fit the large milano looks great , fits my laptop perfectly , and the red interior makes it so easy to find everything i ca n't say enough good things about this bag - it 's perfect for every stylish business woman
i bought this to carry my # `` macbook , as well as my law school books everything fits great , including the power supply and an external mouse the style is great - i 've had many compliments on how nice the bag is , plus i feel so chic walking around with it the several pockets and pen holders help keep me organized -lrb- which is a feat in itself -rrb- i highly recommend this bag to any woman needing a stylish laptop bag for work updated # / # - i am still using this bag - now as an attorney i receive compliments on the bag frequently and it usually fits my case files -lrb- unless they are very large -rrb- the edges of the straps are getting a little ragged , but i use the bag once or twice a week and i 'm impressed at how well it has held up i still recommend this bag with five stars
this is a great bag i thought the price was reasonable and you would be suprised how much stuff -lrb- files , dvd 's mp # 's -rrb- you can fit in there even after your # `` screen lap top is inside i have gotten nothing but compliments on it this bag is a good buy
i bought this bag for my mother-in-law and she loves it it 's sexy , stylish , and still professional this bag is going to compliment her so nicely it has a beautiful red lining on the inside and the extra protection for your smart phone and laptop is definitely a bonus
i looked everywhere for a stylish bag that would hold my # `` powerbook acme has very hip designs , but no # `` tote after discovering mobile edge -lrb- which has two # `` bag styles -rrb- , i settled on the milano i could n't be more pleased now when i need to carry my powerbook along , i do n't have to carry both a computer bag and a purse and i do n't have to give up style best of all , when travelling , i can take a regular carry-on for my clothes , and take my powerbook in my `` purse `` ... the milano handbag once off the plane , i can hook it to my rolling carry-on and maneuver through the airport with ease big thumbs up
this bag is stylish , well built and easily fits my # `` dell inspiron notebook i had a hard time finding a bag that could accomodate that size of computer that also looked feminine
my wife picked this out and absolutely loves it not a lot of bags that fit this large of a laptop but this one has been fantastic we were hesitant because of of the reviews were mediocre , man we are impressed do your self a favor and grab this bag if you need something to fit a large laptop
with all the positive reviews i expected this to be a very nice bag in my opinion , it is very cheap looking inside and out and it too large and cumbersome ... returned
after reading many reviews -lrb- and <unk> the ugly standard laptop bags that are out there -rrb- , i decided to try this one - relatively inexpensive that if i did n't like , i would not be too disappointed pros : i absolutely love the look of the bag and it can fit a lot i 've fit my laptop , charger , mouse , cellphone , earbuds , <unk> , and my personal stuff -lrb- clutch wallet , kindle , few makeup essentials -rrb- with no problem the # . # `` laptop is easy to put <unk> out -lrb- esp . for airport security and client meetings -rrb- separate compartments keeps things separate so i do n't have to dig for things steel feet are great - definitely works and keeps everything upright cons : unfortunately , it 's heavy handles are stiff , so ca n't easily `` sling it `` over the shoulder like i 'm used to also , the red lining is nice , but does rub off on things i 'll continue to use it , but will continue to look for something lighter for traveling
the bag is a great utility but could use some more elegance when looking at it from the top best value for this is on amazon - best buy had the same thing listed for $ # .
i have found it does n't open wide enough at the top to find things i had to removed items to get to other items in the bag it is limited to what you can put in it as well my white cords are now pink due to color bleeding from the fabric inside the bad the straps are somewhat narrow which puts a strain on the shoulder especially when walking through an airport i do like being able to get rid of the pc roller bag and replacing it with this one
it 's meant to carry a laptop i love the design the red interior looks great , but the color rubs off onto things that are plastic my white earphones are stained and it does n't look good they look old and dirty now my kindle has a red cast on the edges , which actually looks a little bit cool my lip gloss container is almost totally <unk> now it used to be white
this is a very useful product , but was a bit bulkier than it looks in the photo it 's more of a briefcase than handbag - it 's square , and the zipper runs halfway down the side of the bag i thought it looked a bit more stylish in the photo but it works as billed - it can hold quite a bit , and your computer is well protected i bought it prior to moving overseas , and my biggest concern was that it would n't hold up -lrb- a previous purchase lasted about three months -rrb- i 've only been using it for a month now , but i get the sense that it will last for a while the other thing to note is that the red color of the interior rubs off , particularly on the white cords to my computer , which now are slightly pink
it has the perfect amount of pockets & space inside i 'm able to fit my laptop , power brick , mouse , and a couple of folders with some room to spare i was a bit concerned with a previous posters indication of `` not enough padding `` - but as long as your are n't throwing your bag around it 's ok like a previous poster , i love the red lining to easily find items be careful though , the red has rubbed of & stained my headphones -lrb- the only reason i rated at # stars
i love how this bag looks , it 's the perfect bag for a professional i work and go to school , so it 's not a everyday bag for me because of its limited space i can just get in my day <unk> , a notebook , laptop and the charger . and it does get a little heavy for my shoulders but other then that its an awesome
super stylish bag sharp red lining and lots of internal compartments which keeps everything neat and organized as mentioned by others , a downside is holding capacity of the bag extremely tight fit when adding a daytimer and some basic accessories -lrb- blackberry , writing instruments , etc . -rrb- plus a laptop overall , good buy for the price
i really love this tote bag it fits everything i need for work -lrb- including my laptop -rrb- without looking like a boring laptop bag the quality is really good and i actually think it looks better in person i have been using it for a couple of months , and there is no substantial wear visible the reason i gave it four stars is that the red lining of the bag tends to rub off on items -lrb- white phone case , gray umbrella -rrb- , so be careful with anything light in color would highly recommend to the fashion conscious
i really like the look & design of this bag , but you ca n't put too much into it there are nice compartments inside yet when i add my travel charger it 's bulky & things do n't seem to fit too good - even with my # `` laptop overall , it 's cute & a good item thus far -lrb- it 's only been a month -rrb-
this bag is exactly what i was looking for : stylish , sleek , perfect size and padding for my laptop , and enough <unk> for a spiral notebook , extra cables and a mouse i would recommend this bag to anyone looking to replace a bulky nylon computer bag
i bought this for a friend who is a real estate agent it was a birthday present it was a larger than i expected i have to say she loved her present and i liked it so much i 'm thinking of buying one for myself
my wife loved her valentine 's gift she claimed loving the look , the versatile pockets within and the computer protector she is now able to take all her typical items along , protect her laptop , while looking chic
i was a little worried about spending almost # $ on this bag , but when i recieved it i was so impressed i really love this bag very well made ! the <unk> pattern is a lot more prominent than the picture shows , but i really like it to be honest i shy away from croc patterns , but it really works with this bag i have a # . # in gateway laptop and it fit perfectly in this bag
this bag is beautiful it is sturdy and very professional looking , and the croc pattern of the bag makes it stylish another plus is it has metal feet to protect the bottom of the bag i highly recommend this item , even if you do not have a laptop computer this bag would serve you well if all you ever did was use it as a professional tote for work
i bought this handbag as a christmas gift for my wife she and i had looked other handbags in local stores , but we did not find anything that we liked when i saw this bag on amazon , i liked it and ordered it just days before the # christmas it came in time she loves it very much and uses it to carry her laptop the quality is super now she wants to upgrade her laptop to match this handbag
i bought this but still debating if i should keep this or not i like the overall design , but i do n't like the weight # . # lbs is too heavy vs others for instance , their same bland <unk> # weight only # . # lbs i only paid $ # plus tax but i am still not sure if i should keep this or not
the bag is good quality and has plenty of room for my son to carry his macbook with cords and his notebooks , pens , etc . to college it is easy to carry and light enough to lug around campus all day
the <unk> from wenger is the best laptop case available in today 's market it is quality <unk> the extra space and compartments are functional the outside is exceptionally durable and the inside affords may options quality all the way
i love the bag i got for my daughter it was a christmas gift to go along with her new laptop my aunt saw the bag last weekend and liked it so much , she ordered one too
<unk> guys , though the estimated time of delivery was # working days but i got it on # rd day i love this bag for it 's practicality with good space & pockets the design is good one attribute that i liked the most , this bag is very durable & strong trust me most good branded bags are not competitors in this aspect i love this bag and quite happy to have it
this really is a very well-constructed bag the interior and exterior materials seem as if they will be very durable , as do the zippers and handle i consider the fact that it 's a little heavier -lrb- noted by a previous reviewer -rrb- than other choices kind of obvious , because it is more durably made i 'm not buying a <unk> here the contents are going to weigh much more than the bag the main area is completely taken for length by a # . # , and there are # other pouches in that compartment opposite the <unk> strap the expanding front pocket has # smaller organizational pockets of varying sizes , and there is also a lined zipper slot between the two main compartments the non-slip material on the shoulder strap is nice the only negative i can see is that the strap is not <unk> nor removable
this was a christmas gift for my husband he was always struggling with getting out his laptop and setting it on the security belt at the airports this bag really is tsa compliant , he never takes out the laptop , just zips open the case and lays it flat love the little bag for the power cord , and the pockets , one for headphones and anything else you need the front compartment has plenty of space for phone , pens , pads , magazines or books lightweight and it easily fits under the airplane seats leaving lots of legroom the velcro rear strap is great for hooking the bag onto your rolling suitcase the shoulder strap fits tightly around the bag if not in use causing no problems this seems like it will last a long time , very good quality
great form that follows function this bag looks professional and has tons of functional storage compartments it fits a # inch laptop as well as my # . # macbook pro unibody light weight but well built highly recommend it i only wish it would sit up on its own when i put it on the floor or table ca n't go wrong with this bag if you are looking for a laptop bag i like the power supply bag that comes with it
the sierra made by wenger is a high quality pc bag with lots of useful pockets the padded strap makes the bag comfortable to carry and the bag holds a surprising amount of stuff i am very happy with this purchase
this bag is amazing i returned a previous one from `` microsoft `` label and i got this one almost same price what a difference the bag is sturdy , extremely well made and it 's not heavy enough room for your laptop -lrb- ~ # inches -rrb- , documents , pen , pencils , and more great service as well
i love this case ; absolutely love it the only drawback is that the adhesive on the logos attached to the handle are coming off - but a little bit of extra glue will fix that otherwise , it 's large enough to fit a # . # `` laptop plus wireless mouse plus ac adaptor plus two large books - and i probably could fit even more in there it 's not <unk> heavy , the shoulder strap is beautifully padded , and it looks classy if you have a large laptop , you can even use the padded adjustable divider that you use to secure smaller laptops and place it at the bottom of the bag - voila , extra padding on the bottom opens fully , which is great for airport security checks , and is super easy to carry around i 'd recommend this case to anyone with a large laptop or anyone who needs the extra space
i like this product it has a good space where i can put all my things in there it also looks nice however , i think the bag is a little bit heavy i mean it is heavy by itself before you have it filled otherwise , i really like the product
i decided to purchase this computer brief based on the one i had from the same manufacturer these are made with excellent quality material and a well thought out distribution of pockets , folders etc . . the <unk> point would be to add reinforced stitching -lrb- specially on the zippers -rrb- so as to further ad to the working life of these <unk> i used mine for two years of business school on a very though schedule and one year of work after that i would certainly recommend you get this one last , avoid the standard staples and office <unk> as they are a good # % more expensive on these retailers
i got this bag for <unk> it has plenty of space for the laptop , accessories , and a gusset for documents it is light and good looking i really like this bag and highly recommend it great bag for the price
this top-loading laptop case is well designed and made to last it has ample padding and many pockets with the three compartments , it holds everything i need to take on trips i am very pleased with it
this lap top case is very well designed and constructed it has ample padding , many pockets , and is made of sturdy material it is n't inexpensive , but obviously for a reason i am very happy with it
i bought this bag three years ago from amazon as my main carry-on and laptop bag while studying abroad in germany it fits my giant , ancient laptop with sufficient space for books and papers there 's a little pocket near the top that 's perfect for holding a cd player or small items you do n't want to get lost in the larger bag i carried this bag everywhere -- walking , on public transportation , on trains , on planes -- and never once had a <unk> , even when i , quite frankly , abused its capacity and <unk> it i regularly stuffed it <unk> it bulged and hung more items off the handles it still zips and none of the handles broke it 's a great heavy-duty bag that stands up to hard use
i have had this for a few months and use it everyday plus quite a few trips <unk> and internationally so far it has held up well and with how much i use these items i hope to get # years out of it before i need to replace
i purchased this item for a formal business trip within # days both handles had strings of leather hanging off from them unless you are purchasing this for a thin apple computer i would not suggest it as it is n't as spacious as one would assume i only had my laptop in it it would not fit my power cord which i had to carry separately it does stand up without tipping which is a huge asset it looks very nice when new
the bag is too heavy to be considered a bag for a laptop . and this is before the laptop is placed in the bag <unk> , i have defective laptop stored in this bag the product was delivered on time from amazon , but the problem is that i did n't received it in hand on time to return next , when the laptop is placed in bag , one side of the bag changes shape the purchase was a waste of money , however the appearance is beautiful
this bag is huge and keeps me organized bag weighs allot it is not for the person with a small frame the bag looks elegant and well made i was dissapointed that the material that covers the seem of the handles started to peel just after one day of use i cut of the piece i 'm afraid the rest might come off after a while i especially like all the inside and outside compartments i give this bag # stars because of the weight and second because the glue like material that covers the seems of the handle partially came off
the tote is really , really large and not too heavy ; just what i need for all day use unfortunately it is not roomy enough for my items once i put in my vivo and its cords i could not fit securely my digital camera and camcorder ; with its cords , nor could i zip it the quality is nice the leather like material looks durable the straps are a good lenght the front pocket area can be a bit wider so cords can fit well and the flap should have a bit of an overlap so it will still be magnetically secure , smoothly the laptop compartment should probably be a bit narrower ; guess the width is for the mac i have to return this item and find one that will accommodate my items neatly
this tote is quite heavy , and when you add the notebook it is a real brick however , i have been looking for a nice bag to protect and transport my # `` notebook for a while , both in stores and on line , and this was by far the nicest one i found it is good looking and solidly built it has a padded pocket to protect the laptop it also has pockets and slots for cards , pens , cables and other accessories , and there is plenty of room my only complaint , besides the weight , is that it is all black , inside and out if the inside were a different color it would be much easier to find the cables , the mouse , the flash drives , and all the other stuff i keep in there but for the most part i am happy with this purchase
