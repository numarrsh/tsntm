this case is perfect for an hp mini notebook the lining is extremely soft and the design on the case itself is very cute i love it and the price i purchased it for was a fraction of the original price i highly recommend this product to pair with any notebook # inches in size ! : -rrb- it is a little snug when you first get it , but the material allows for flexibility to safely cover your notebook you will not regret this purchase
when i purchased this case i was surprised to realize that the pc fit perfectly with the # -cell battery , which jets out a little i also purchased an lg external dvd player -lrb- lg - # x external usb # . # <unk> <unk> drive -rrb- and that fit inside the case as well ! ! everything fit inside the case except the pc battery and the cables that come with the dvd/cd drive , but those do n't really need protection anyway , so overall a very good purchase for the price !
i bought this for my asus t # tablet , and it fits the device perfectly , offering protection and a little style , too while offering protection from accidental drops , it does not add too much bulk to the table with the keyboard attached unlike some cases , this one fits like a glove , and does not allow the device to move around in the compartment
very well padded , i have another one identical to this one that came with my hp mini notebook i ordered this one because of the quality of my original
it 's ok , more pockets would be welcome i carry an asus # n and it is loose in the compartiment the bag size is fine but i do not like the shape that much not sure if i would buy again
this is a cool product to complement my netbook purchase i guess you need a slim backpack to show you have a slim netbook i found it comfortable to take around it has good fit pockets to carry my usb dvd rw drive as well as portable hard drive and usb cables a must have for road warriors like me to survive in the wild and the city likewise now if it also came with a powerful solar charger to charge the ever <unk> batteries ! : -rrb- guess i have to wait another # years for that
mostly loving my new mobile edge scanfast backpack use it daily for work and the computer pocket is the perfect size to hold my msi wind and power cord i would have liked more depth to the section that holds the computer i can only see carrying # , <unk> books , along with the netbook
this backpack is wonderful ; while small , it can carry all the essentials for school with ease and the laptop compartment is well padded my only gripe is that the pictures on amazon show the backpack as having mesh pockets on the sides for water bottles and the like , but my backpack has no such thing i was pretty disappointed , but i can fit my drinks inside the bag still , the pictures are obviously misleading
i bought this backpack for my son to use with his netbook most other netbook cases are flimsy pouches , or briefcase style bags this bag looks like a <unk> version of the backpack i have for my normal size laptop it is well made , with pretty good padding over-all , i am very happy with my purchase
i purchased this rolling computer case january # for my wife she uses it daily for an <unk> commute the case has never been used for travel and has never been through an airport both zippers on the large compartment have broken making the case unusable several months ago one of the front legs snapped out of position and we have not been able to get it back into place for almost $ # i would expect the case to last more than <unk> months this is my last targus product
there was a # & # # ; wide model a decade or so back that was just perfect -- but mine wore out almost completely this is # + & # # ; wide , and is harder to get down the aisle of a small airplane the saving grace is that it is only # + inches thick , so it does fit in smaller overhead airplane bins it has few pockets , and is not as handy as the old model , or as a shoulder carried bag -- but it is lighter when loaded
this is ideal for my needs it is big enough for my computer , but not too bulky i like to keep my computer close when i fly , but do n't want to lug around a large bag
could be a little larger , but it has the most important part : a checkpoint friendly pouch for your laptop that means you 'll never leave your laptop with security well made , rolls well , and very easy to maneuver
so i have taken this bag on # work trips so far and it really is great the tsa friendly configuration is awesome , have n't been asked to take out my laptop on any of the passes through airport security one of the great features is that the bag is made to fit under the seat in front of you so you do n't have to worry about getting in and out of the overhead bin the only problem is that on a recent aa flight i sat in a middle seat and the seat in front of me had life <unk> in boxes below it , so my bag would not fit other than that one <unk> this has been perfect i still highly recommend it
it is a great bag for daily use and for quick security check due to folding zipper this bag is definitely tight on space for an overnight if you are used to one of those bags that is really an overnighter but also can fit with some effort in the regional jet overhead compartment , this bag is not for you in my case , for daily use this is perfect size for log overseas journey , i like to carry meds and one pair of clothing in that case , this bag will not work
especially for the money quit second guessing yourself and order this now , you will not be disappointed lightweight and sturdy i will get lots of years out of it also has a shoulder strap if you are worried about rolling two items with each arm
i found this item to be very easy to travel with as it moves well and the retractable handle comes up to a good height there is also more than ample <unk> to store laptop accessories and , perhaps , personal items
i had an old samsonite laptop roller and to my horror , was made to gate check it while aboard a crj needless to say , having to pull out my laptop and hand carry it aboard was <unk> enough for me to <unk> for another bag the checkpoint-friendly aspect is a breeze - it also has icons on the inside , so even if security does n't speak english they understand that the laptop is on its own the main compartment holds a good amount of odds and ends , and it 's sturdy enough to take a few hits and not damage anything inside only con i would say is i wish they would make it in more colors or patterns ... but that 's <unk> i know =
very nice briefcase like the travel friendly computer pouch for airport security wish the <unk> for the file section were a bit better planned ... also wish there was a bit more depth with more pockets for files and
really like this bag i travel about # % of the month for work so i need something to make airport security easy this is awesome handle feels very durable and bag is well balanced when rolling or sitting alone , upright the only disadvantages from my perspective are that it has no strap across the back to attach it to my suitcase , and there is no small external pouch on the front of the bag which would have been convenient otherwise , very happy with this purchase
the only reason i gave it two stars is because it tumi and there is a nice big flex pocket that runs the width of the bag that you would not see from the pics great for quick access to whatever typically briefcases have shoulder straps that are way to wide for most women i have in the past just removed not so here , apparently a new design which is not removable , that was the first disappointment the second was the front zip pockets are pretty much useless , material is very <unk> , no pen loops , hard to imagine what i would use them for back to briggs
after # month i can day that i am really satisfied with compartments and possibilities for <unk> this bag i will <unk> to this brand and this bag will travel with me for a long
i 've purchased several bags in the past few years and within a few weeks you can tell about how long it will last i love the strength of this product , the simplicity of the compartments and the light weight -lrb- yet durable -rrb- feel i would recommend it to anyone fits my macbook pro # & # # ; no problem
this is an extremely well-designed and well-constructed bag there is a pocket , as well as some pockets within pockets , for almost anything you can imagine i used a brenthaven for about # years , until it began to fail due to excessive use that was a super bag -lrb- and a lot less expensive than tumi -rrb- for me , the key advantage of tumi is the t-pass feature i have now tried this on several domestic flights , and , as promised , you just unzip it and send it through the scanner i have not had to remove my computer from the bag that 's truly a great feature i also find myself using the water bottle pocket , sometimes for water bottles , sometimes for an umbrella , and sometimes for sunglasses finally , the shoulder strap is especially comfortable
i love not having to take my laptop out of my briefcase when going through airport security it 's one less hassle be advised though , as of october , # , <unk> airport security had n't <unk> the tsa system yet , so do n't expect to have this benefit when traveling internationally the case is very well made , lots of storage , comfortable shoulders strap
bought this last year and within # months the seam had begun to separate there is a # `` gap at the top between compartments where the bag is coming apart there are two storage compartments along the sides that are pretty much useless and i wish they would have not sacrificed the space inside the main bag
overall it 's a very sturdy and nice bag a great bargain for the price -lrb- # . # -rrb- be warned that the bag is not the one pictured see shared picture that <unk> uploaded for actual bag also , the description said that it would fit a # `` laptop the tag on the bag says # `` so i ca n't fit may laptop in the sleeve but outside the sleeve in the same compartment a little disappointing
i have looked for backpacks in almost every store but only found the right one here its been # years i bought this and there is not a single thread that has come out beautiful finish and highly durable , i bet this can last for another decade atleast without losing a hem must have , for it
i 'm using this back pack as an emergency kit the recent <unk> in <unk> reminds us of the importance of being prepared for natural <unk> i have put important documents , first aid , <unk> , pocket knives , <unk> in the back pack and i have room for more it 's a versatile and well made backpack and i recommend it highly
i was looking for a good train carry on netbook , book , <unk> , bg meter , snack , change of clothes , and one or two water bottles i wanted convenience and good looks easy to pack and easy to get at stuff i got this pack and was first impressed with how well it is made the zips are sturdy and the stitching appears very strong then i loaded it up the layout is great i loaded it up , had plenty room for more
i really like this pack it is well designed and made with high quality materials i use it on planes , <unk> , <unk> trips by car i take it to the beach , the park , the office however , i do n't take it -lrb- any more -rrb- into the mountains or on serious hikes because it is a little too heavy , and frankly , it is not designed for that purpose
warning to those of you giving a swissgear backpack for a gift i was given a bad for christmas last year without the <unk> providing me with the receipt the bags right strap is almost completely unraveled and the top handle is cracked i sent an email and got a very fast and polite email asking for pictures i provided them immediately received another very polite email this morning asking me to call another group below this very polite email was a stodgy form email telling me basically call the recipient and get the receipt or you are out of luck i am out of luck because i am not that <unk>
pros : a lot of compartments , lots of space for everything , and more , adequately protects laptop and everything you need cons : feels bulky and extremely heavy too many metallic parts makes it feel clunky
i could use at least one more pocket . haha . but its a great unit straps could use more padding on the straps , <unk> this thing with my # . # inch and all my books gets kind of painful people ask me all the time where i get this bag they have other swiss gears and tell me that they love mine more edit : the swissgear <unk> falls
this is an <unk> bag it is very well made it has plenty of pockets for all my needs it is basically a traveling office i use it for travel and love the bag i do n't carry my # `` laptop much but it fits in the bag perfectly when i do carry it
my swiss gear sa # was a very good investment of my money it is a very functional backpack based on your needs am myself a very active college kid it was very useful as it is very durable and can hold all of my study materials without seeming over packed inside there are plenty of pockets but not too much to seem that it over <unk> you some of the pockets in return have interior functions as well like a place where i can keep my laptop it is a very useful backpack for someone who moves around a lot and has a lot to carry at the same time my only point of negative feedback is the straps are not as supportive as they could be when carrying heavy loads however the back pads have a nice amount of cushion to help out in reverse overall i would say that this pack was a great purchase and would recommend it to anybody looking for a functional backpack with adequate carrying space for their needs
i bought this backpack to make it easier to lug around a hefty # lb laptop to and from work this bag has room to spare i can easily fit my laptop -lrb- # inc screen -rrb- in the special compartment and still have plenty of space for books , packages , jackets , etc . this bag also comes with a fancy adapter plug for an mp # player -lrb- the mp # player goes in a special pocket in the backpack -rrb- but i 've found that i rarely use this feature the one drawback is that the bag is a bit heavy itself but the quality construction more than <unk>
this is a great backpack the straps a very comfortable and with the belt at the bottom it helps to distribute the weight my laptop is safe in back and my camera is safe in the front area i love the built in speakers you can hear music and still hear those around you many pockets for storing different size items and the key latch is great i 'm not digging around for my keys it 's a perfect backpack
this bookbag is a great size for my son who is a # th grader and carries heavy textbooks , etc . it is very well constructed and has just enough compartments for great organization excellent bag :
this is my everyday bag lots of compartments , smooth zippers , holds my laptop just fine ... it 's a # . # `` i also like the built in ipod connection for player and headphones
perfect size and just what my son needed , but the handle pulled away from the seam after two weeks will cost more to get it fixed than to get a new one ca n't decide if i am going to try another one or a different brand targus quality is normally great
i read reviews that complained about no shoulder strap that 's true but i wanted the basics another complained about too little room to carry extra items i can easily store the power cord , a dvd case , flash drive and business cards i was n't looking for a new briefcase this was just what i was looking for i wanted to protect my mini and carry the basics
this is a great little case to carry your netbook also , a very nice case if you need to carry your cd 's / dvd 's in the price is reasonable and the carrying case protects your expensive netbook very nicely
great case for asus netbook or any # `` netbook padded with plenty of room for charger or extra battery inside clip for keys or flash drive , loops for pens and small zippered compartment
we bought this to transport an <unk> and all the extras to carry on an airplane i loved all the different compartments and storage area we were able to fit everything we needed , console , games , cords , controllers , even a couple extra things they were well protected and padded the down side is that it gets really heavy when you put all that stuff in it and the hooks -lrb- which do n't really serve a purpose -rrb- broke within an hour overall it was worth the money and there was no damage to my stuff
this backpack holds everything i need for gaming or just moving electronics or holding books and school stuff for class as a college student i find myself carrying my ps # around a lot and got sick of carrying it in the original box still i have fit my laptop , ps # and cords , <unk> headset , # controllers , # games and other little things and still not at max capacity , and still pretty comfortable to wear it opens # degrees in the main pocket and makes it easy to access everything i 'd recommend this backpack for anyone who needs a backpack to move and gaming <unk> , laptops , etc .
this gaming backpack is everything i need in a backpack it holds my <unk> <unk> pros very nicely my xbox or ps # fits very secured in the backpack it 's a lil bulky but not to bad clips near the zipper can get a little annoying but not all that bad
i purchased this bag for my xbox slim it was a little pricey but i firmly believe that you get what you pay for this bag seems top notch and well constructed i do n't care for the clasps on the side though the clasps look cool but are more annoying than helpful i think that the zippers would have done just fine it will fit my xbox console , power cords , <unk> , headphones , remote controls , games and more i feel that this bag protects my system very well , has lots of storage room , it is quite comfortable to wear and from a functional stand point i give it # stars
this backpack is everything you need to haul your <unk> # around there is plenty of compartments for everything you need to take your <unk> on the road it offers plenty of protection to keep your gear from getting <unk> or crushed the only thing i do n't like about the bag is the four clips that you have to open and close <unk> to get into the bag to me their kinda pointless , but its not enough for me to get rid of the bag again i ca n't say enough about the bag i love it and would recommend it to anyone
the kensington essentials kit arrived on time , but the original <unk> was already opened and fixed by tape so it is most likely a returned item and the worst of all , the lock does not work ps : after <unk> with oem shop , we get <unk> the second day customer service rocks
the <unk> worked several times after <unk> the combo , but then failed . # minutes out of the box , and dead fortunately it was n't attached to my machine when it did fail ; <unk> a bullet there kensington support determined this was a defective unit i only went for this lock because it seemed like a deal , but on a side note ; the tiny mouse is almost unusable due to the <unk> short length of the usb cord
i bought it just for the lock ; the lock is adequate , barely , but for under $ # it 's worth it the lock fits loosely into the lock port on my asus # n -- it locks , but it wiggles it fits better than the $ # kensington that i returned a couple weeks ago it will serve primarily as a visual deterrent -- looks to me like a good twist will pull it out of the lock port , or that a hefty pair of pliers will cut the cable the cable is # feet , but because it 's coiled , it 's functionally shorter than that i 'll use the sleeve for a portable dvd drive ; the mouse is the smallest i 've ever seen , but it works all in all , a good value for less than $ #
i ordered this mainly for the lock ; it was the best price i could find i figured the mouse was a nice extra and if the cover fit -lrb- it looked too small for my # inch netbook in the photo -rrb- that bonus points the cover definitely did n't fit my # in asus eee pc , but it would probably fit the smaller # in size -lrb- not having a # in netbook to test this on , this is my guess -rrb- the lock was easy to set and seems pretty standard i have been pleasantly surprised by the little mouse , which i use all the time now i gave this # stars instead of # because the size of the netbook cover was n't clearly listed -lrb- and it did n't fit mine -rrb- , but overall this seemed like a great buy
although this package may not be perfect , for a price of $ # . # you ca n't find a better deal the neoprene case is a little snug , but very stretchy , and looks great i have never seen a kensington lock for less than $ # . # by itself , never mind as part of a package mouse works fine , but my one complaint is that the cord is a little stiff , so when you let go of the mouse it might move around some
it looks better than what it is i bought it for my mini ipad , way to big for it may be for something else but not for a mini ipod
bought this for an android tablet around # . # inches i guess this was really made for # inches only the fit on a # inch is very sloppy there is too much material buy if you are looking for a # inch sleeve
useless for the ipad mini ad says sleeve fits tablets # inches and up `` fit `` is hardly the <unk> word `` <unk> `` is more like it offers the same degree of snugness that i 'd get from oh , say , wrapping my ipad mini in a beach towel if kensington had at least included some way to securely close the sleeve , all would not be lost come on kensington ... how much would a few lousy patches of velcro have cost , huh ?
bought this for my ipad # because of the positive reviews it does fit but not perfectly i think it 's a bit small for the ipad # just a few mm off you def have to do some pushing and tugging the price was a bit insane so let 's start shoving it in
i originally bought this for my i-pad , which is about size of a netbook it 's a bit tight for the i-pad , but will work in a pinch almost like putting on a sock for it not bad for the price , but i ended up buying another larger slip cover for it
i bought this sleeve for my ipad based on the reviews here , and the low price personally i find this sleeve too tight a fit for the ipad , it 's a struggle to get this thing on and off i just want the ipad to slide out easily , but i have to tug and pull at it i guess it depends on what your needs are , but it does n't work for me maybe i 'm just <unk> than the other folks
it 's exactly the right size for the ipad , and i do mean exactly it 's a tight fit , i have to stretch it a little to get it to fit at the price , it 's a good value it is what it is , a neoprene case , without a lot of padding , at an inexpensive price ultimately , i decided i wanted something with more padding , and a zipper , so i got this : http / / <unk> # <unk> # <unk> # ? <unk> # & s ; <unk> & qid ; = # & sr ; = # <unk> user-friendly the ipad slips in and out more easily , and it zips closed -lrb- more expensive , though .
the sleeve is nice , made of durable neoprene , and does not have a zipper -lrb- something i was looking for to reduce scratching on my ipad -rrb- it is , however , a bit tight for the ipad this is especially true if you have a silicon skin for your ipad it is n't impossible , but a bit difficult , to get the device inside
while some reviews might lead you to think otherwise , this is not specifically an ipad sleeve it 's a generic netbook sleeve -lrb- it even says so on the tag -rrb- that has found new life with the release of the ipad it fits the ipad pretty well , although a little tight if anything i 'm not personally a big fan of these slip sleeves but the price ca n't be beat it 's an <unk> neoprene slip sleeve from a reputable company if that 's what you want and the price is right for you , you 'll be happy
this is n't the nicest sleeve , but for the price it is definitely a deal i purchased this for my boyfriend 's ipad # and it 's a very snug fit the neoprene material is also very nice it stretches , just in case you 'd like to include your usb cord or other cords in there i do n't think there 's enough room for the actual charger , though just to let potential buyers know , this is not really reversible if you reverse the cover to it 's grey side , there are going to be tags hanging out and black lining from the stitching however , the grey color is very nice and if you are n't as picky as i am , you 'll like it
i just wanted a cover that would prevent screen scratches when i threw my g tab in my carry on bag this one fits very snuggly -lrb- it is slightly difficult to get the flap on but the stretchy neoprene allows it , no problem for anyone # years old or more , i 'd say unless you had arthritis -rrb- wish it had a little outside pocket for ear buds or cleaning cloth but no biggie
i bought this for my ipad # i also use a smart cover with the ipad needless to say , the ipad fits perfectly it 's a bit snug , but i prefer a tight fit over a loose one the sleeve is just a little bit too long though it 's just what i need too until you find your perfect case , this will do very , very well if anything , the price is unbeatable
got this product # days after ordering it , thanks at first i did n't think the ipad # would n't fit it does , but it stretches the material very snug fit , you will hit the on/off switch when you fold over the top flap just make sure you check to see if the ipad goes back to sleep i 'll say this , if you drop the ipad , it may survive , as the material is thin but in a back pack with other items , its protected great price and fast delivery
so i just got my case in the mail today , march # , # and i can not be mad it fits my ipad to the t . it looks just like the picture although when you turn it to the <unk> side you have black stiching do n't get me wrong it does not make it look bad , but it is there this case will not save your ipad if you drop it though now this is not a fact but it just does n't feel like it to me , and i am not going to try it out either but i will reccommend this to anyone who wants something different for their pad
every other slipcase is $ # - this one 's $ # it 's very simple , but great for covering my ipad # before throwing it in a backpack with other items that could scratch it only thing it 's missing is an extra pocket for charger
i am still looking for the perfect case for my ipad # - but this one will do nicely for now cant beat it for the price and fits very , very snuggly
i really like my kensington neoprene sleeve for my ipad , it works very well to protect my ipad it is form-fitting and light the biggest issue that i have with it is that it is a little awkward to pull my ipad out of it a small loop or tab at the closed end of the sleeve would make it so much easier to grasp the bottom while pulling the ipad out other than that , i love it
just wanted some extra padding for my ipad bouncing around in my backpack this serves the purpose just fine snug and a little cumbersome getting in and out but i think that 's a good thing ca n't beat the price and if i get a year out of it i will be happy
got the sleeve today it is sleek and is nearly a perfect fit for the ipad similar sleeves from other manufacturers -lrb- e.g incase -rrb- cost more than # times as much this one is a bargain , but does not feel cheap why pay more
my ipad # fits but it 's a very very tight fit more like a huge stretch do n't get this for your ipad would be great for a # or # inch tab it 's soft , no protection for the screen
this fits my samsung # . # perfectly it is a very affordable case it is light weight that all said , i would say this offers a fairly low level of protection it is perfect for using to cover tablet when tossed in my laptop bag -lrb- which itself offers protection for the contents inside it will protect against scratches from all sides but as far as a stand alone case , the protection is minimal i would not want to drop this # feet but that is not what it is designed for
i bought this sleeve for my acer # . # `` in bright blue <unk> to bright green i fits great , looks great and material is `` slick `` enough that putting it in and getting it out of a tote is <unk> really worth the low price
super fast shipment , i received this sleeve the day after i placed the order this is a perfect fit for my ipad # with the smart cover on when i am bringing this outside the house
i purchased this for my new ipad # and it fits it perfectly it 's very snug and tight i doubt it would work very well if you put the ipad into a separate case because of how tight the fit it already with nothing however , great sleeve and the you ca n't beat the price at all anywhere
at the beginning , i was n't so happy with the way it opens and closes but later when i get used to it , i think with the price and quality , it worth # stars ps : i can put in my ipad # with smart cover
i received my ipad # cover yesterday and liked it so much i ordered one for my husband today great buy , simple but effective product very light weight and easy to use excellent protection for the ipad
this is an amazing carrying case for your ipad i am in love with it my ipad fits perfectly , and feels safe i am very happy with this purchase the price can not be beat
i wanted something simple to protect my new ipad # when i put it in my bag , this cover does the trick it 's cheap , durable and the essence of simplicity fits my ipad # with or without smart cover on what more could you ask for
i bought this product to protect the ipad when i throw it in my backpack i have a smart cover and a snap on clear plastic back shield this case fits very snug around all of that i do n't use it all the time so i ca n't comment on durability - fits around smart cover and back shield - cheap - not
fits my ipad # g with a `` smart `` cover perfect provides great protection when i 'm just carrying it around and when i throw it into my backpack ca n't ask for a better price simple case with no useless frills , and no metal parts to scratch , no zippers , buttons or other junk recommend this to everyone i know
i bought this to toss my ipad in for transportation , as we frequently travel several road trips later , i am glad that we did , as the product holds up well , providing additional protection for a few bucks you wo n't regret it
i purchased # of these sleeves to protect my ipad # i had tried a couple of other `` larger `` covers , but they were a little loose these sleeves are definitely form fitting , but they work great the neoprene is thick enough to handle minor bumps and scraps but i would n't expect it to absorb a full # + foot fall i actually have two exist covers on the ipads : one incase magazine jacket and one macally <unk> case this sleeve fits over both - again a little snug but it stretches
this is my first amazon review i never write reviews even though i 've bought items from amazon for over a decade anyway , i felt the need to inform others that this item although not made for it , fits the motorola xoom perfectly i have a thin silicone case around the item and it 's a pretty tight fit , however i 'm pretty sure that without the case it would fit wonderfully and the price is so reasonable too either way if you have a thin case or not this sleeve will work wonderfully without breaking the bank it 's already ridiculous how much they charge for the xoom do n't let <unk> <unk> you more by buying their original accessories
i wanted a snug fitting soft case to stop my hp touchpad from getting scratched up while in my backpack the case is stretchy , and the touchpad slips neatly into it without any room on the top or the sides , exactly the way i wanted plus , the soft inside and the snug fit wipe away some of the fingerprints that inevitably gather on the screen and back of the device at about the same price as a fast food <unk> , this case ca n't be beaten
the ipad was designed to be used naked -- that is , without bulky cases and portfolios it 's too bad many people cover up the aesthetic beauty of the ipad with faux-leather or plastic cases but any ipad owner still wants protection when traveling , and this kensington sleeve is the perfect solution it fits the ipad snugly i think if kensington tried to make a sleeve for an ipad , instead of for netbooks , it would not have fit as well i like that there is no zipper -- the top sort of folds over the opening the design is clean , pure , and simple it accomplishes exactly what it needs to do , and adds nothing more to get in the way do n't buy a pricey case : get this kensington sleeve
bought this sleeve for my new ipad # while waiting for the new cases to start <unk> out fits like a glove you would think this was made specifically for the ipad looks good and for $ # dollars you ca n't beat it for minor protection for your ipad amazon prime got it to me in # days highly recommended for owners of the ipad or ipad #
i bought this case to protect my ipad in my briefcase and for that it has been absolutely perfect it fits the ipad # like a glove , has kept it from getting scratched , can be put away when i do n't need it and , most of all , did n't break the bank i would highly recommend this if you need an inexpensive case to protect your ipad from basic wear and scratches
i travel weekly and carry a work computer and a small notebook personal -lrb- for personal business -rrb- i needed a tight fitting protective cover since the dell notebook came w/a it 's one shoulder carrier that is n't practice to go into my work backpack <unk> other equipment between work computer , a kindle , and my notebook w/this protective cover i have room for other things
i bought this as a sleeve to store my # `` dell mini it fits perfectly and is a very snug fit i like the feel of the outside where it has a slight grip but not too grippy where you ca n't get the device go i would highly recommend it only for the # `` mini size anything bigger and it would not fit into the sleeve properly i now take it when i travel and feel comfortable throwing it in a bag with other things in it so the netbook will not get scratched up
this sleeve is exceptional fast to get on and off no zippers or edges to catch on the device if what you need is ipad protection while inside another bag and do n't require a handle , this is perfect no reason to spend more or look elsewhere
bought this for my new ipad and it fits perfectly with the top folded back , it also makes for a good cradle to put the ipad on while reading and you ca n't beat the price
the case is perfect for my ipad # with smart cover attached i wanted a minimal sleeve so that i could carry it in my laptop bag for daily transport i <unk> a water spill and the case did n't soak the water the water actually beaded off of the case and onto my desk i simply wiped the case with a paper towel and it was brand new again with no wet spots what i also like about this case is the fact it does n't have a zipper zippers can scratch buy it , you wo n't regret it
was n't expecting much when i got this , since it is only $ # this case has saved me $ # though there is a particular case that i bought before this one that was more durable but unfortunately <unk> ruining your ipad -lrb- which is what i bought this for -rrb- i like anyone who saves me money , and even better , anyone who provides a solid product this case is awesome , and i will recommend it to all who have ipads
this awesome case just landed on my doorstep about an hour ago and i have to say it 's perfect i was kind of on edge because people were saying in the reviews stuff like `` it 's too hard to make it fit `` and stuff like that thats way too exaggerated , as it 's very easy to put it on its just formfitting , so you kind of have to push it in , but its not even that hard anyways its perfect , very formfitting and will definitely protect my ipad when i put it in my backpack for school in the fall my ipad # fits perfectly and not only does it have the smart cover but it has a back protection case on it too i say buy this sleeve now it 's $ # which is n't bad at all when you look at the competition it 's well worth it
i really like this sleeve it is tight and compact and even holds my keyboard and netbook together when you get it , it looks like it ca n't a netbook , but it does very well
i was searching through amazon looking for an inexpensive sleeve for my new ipad this kensington sleeve was meant for a netbook , but just as the last two reviewers said , it fits the ipad perfectly my ipad is sitting inside this sleeve now the fit is snug but it 's easy to pull the ipad out when i want to the neoprene and the stitching appears to be rugged while it is reversible , i strongly prefer the black : - -rrb- i note in my title that this is a transport sleeve -- use this to carry your ipad around in your hand or inside your briefcase you have to pull your ipad out completely to use it , so if you 're going to do that every five minutes , you may want a different sleeve that lets you access the ipad while tucked away but if you 're carrying your ipad inside your briefcase , etc . , and just need an inexpensive , protective sleeve , this one is just about perfect
