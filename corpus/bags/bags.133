the bag design is excellent and very convenience , however the quality and craftmanship is very poor with just # days of use it started to break the front pocket i contacted the vendor i twice agreed on send me a new one , but never receive it
my laptop , a lenovo , does not fit into the laptop compartment i put it in the <unk> compartment a small amount of documents does fit in the bag looks good and rolls nicely while the handle does not look too sturdy , it actually is overall , it is a decent bag
i searched high & low for a bag that was stylish and functional for tracking across a huge university campus for # years as an <unk> i put some serious miles on a jansport driver # wheeled backpack which was a trooper however , as i just <unk> my graduating year , i did n't have the need for so many books and could travel lighter than previous semesters i wanted something stylish , lighter and not too big i stumbled across the kensington k # us contour balance notebook roller bag in <unk> , which did in fact fit my <unk> # -inch notebook it fits all my <unk> down accessories quite nicely the wheels are different than the jansport and do n't know yet what they will look like after # months across campus , but we shall see at the time of this review i have been using it # weeks and no complaints hopefully wo n't have any so far so good
just like another reviewer i could not fit my # & # # ; laptop in the laptop sleeve i can only fit it in the pocket outside of that sleeve which is good enough for me i suppose the case looks cheap , but it holds up fine i had trouble finding a <unk> rolling bag that was n't too big to go in an <unk> plane compartment so this will do for now
love this bag well made , super cute , very functional . # stars though because i bought it for the trade shows i go to a few times a year this does not have enough room to hold lots of papers , brochures , catalogs etc . otherwise i love it
i use this to hold my laptop , my kindle , and a change of clothes when travelling for work one criticism i have is that it does n't always sit upright so you have to watch it to make sure it does n't tip over
pros : great wheels - rolls super smooth plenty of space on the interior to store files , cords and wallets multiple compartments keep you uber organized there is a space for everything , including <unk> sorta nice feminine design - at least it is n't all black cons : even when packed lightly , it does n't fit on top of my overnight roller bag at the airport like others do because the wheels are too cumbersome because of the rollers , it 's a little heavy -lrb- although not really a problem because you 'd never carry it , making the straps useless . i disagree that you can pack for overnight in this bag , unless you were planning on only bringing pj 's and under clothes like all other bags , overpacking this one means it does n't function as well - tipping , hard to control , etc . all in all a solid , functional bag
the bag is light weight yet roomy the compartments are handy so far i 'm satisfied , and i 've used it about one month my last bag started falling apart after a week
this bag it 's very stylish and feminine i love the design , it looks good it has plenty of pockets and i can finally organise my office life one thing to note that it 's quite heavy for a small bag and the carrying strap it 's just an inch too short to carry it on the shoulder it arrived packed well and within the time slot provided
i needed a rolling bag for work and this was the perfect size for me and also a nice design i was loving the bag at first but after # days of having it , i am sad that one of the zippers split open and got stuck not sure how long this will last me now and i only work part time so this is very disappointing but do love the organization the pockets provide so it 's easy access my travel coffee cup fits into the side pocket -lrb- was worried about that from prior reviews -rrb- i 've had no issues with the handle being a single rather than a double for pulling the case and the wheels have been steady in this current winter weather up here if the zipper did n't split after # days i would have given it a # star rating , and am keeping my fingers crossed that this will be durable
i like this roller bag , but i need something bigger it does n't have enough space for big folders or big documents however , it works perfectly and it 's made with very high quality materials i 'd recommend it if you do n't need to carry more than your laptop and few papers
i was looking for a rolling laptop bag that looks like a women 's tote when carried and was so thrilled to find this one it looks great and and hold much more than it looks like it would i love the water bottle holder there is room for files and notebooks , a small make up bag and purse seems very durable too please note : there is no shoulder strap as the described
overall , it 's a great bag the downside , unlike it 's slightly larger counterpart <unk> # contour roller carrying case , there is no strap on the back which allows you to slide it over the handle of your <unk> i guess that would have meant sacrificing one more storage pocket in the back to me it would have been worth the sacrifice none the less , i like it very much i travel almost every week the size of this bag eliminates worrying about lack of overhead bin space in airplanes it fits very nicely under the seat in front of me i especially like the storage <unk> in the handle area it <unk> all of my accessories very neatly
i use this bag to carry work home with me and occasionally to meetings the size of the pockets work well and the construction seems sturdy i like the look of it i have n't carried it on a plane but it looks small enough that it could easily be stowed under the seat , with room to spare i do wish there was a shoulder strap that could be used there are times when i do n't want to pull the bag and the handles are a little short
i 've had this bag about # months i have dragged it through <unk> , banged it around , and <unk> it it still looks good and <unk> motion is smooth there 's a lot of storage , i can fit my laptop , ipad , several files , and accessories flat things store best - you likely could n't put your lunch in the bag only problem is the handle as others have mentioned at first i thought it was broken but it is just kind of cumbersome does n't snap down like luggage handles , you have to push the little buttons on each section the lowest button is buried inside the bag and difficult to reach , which is why the # star rating
a colleague of mine had this bag i generally hate roller bags but this one seemed different ... and it is ... it is light , fits under a plane seat , holds a lot and i love it the only issue i have is that there are so many places to put things , i lose track where things are i would recommend
this is a good bag and does come with the handbag handles as shown in the pic my wife loves it however the laptop compartment is a little small and will not hold anything above # . # & # # ; ... but she uses the other compartment as she uses it for daily work and not travel
this is a good laptop bag attractive , light , good compartments love the expandable water bottle holder on the side , brilliant the handle feels a little wobbly , and the fact that it is a single bar does make it harder to carry your handbag , but i 've <unk> a way to carry my handbag and it works pretty well all in all , i would buy this bag again
the bag was roomier than i thought for all it 's lean and streamlined profile it converts easily to an oversized handbag when i need to carry it i like the fact that it is said to be water resistant since i have to drag it beside or behind me so it 's reassuring to think that what i have inside will be safe in case of rain i have n't had the chance to prove this , though it seems a little pricey given that it is made of synthetic material which makes it somewhat stiff but overall i am quite happy with it and would recommend it to others
i have been using this bag for about a week i am # and in graduate school i wear suits to school and need to look professional but also need something that does n't make me feel old this bag is it it has a small look with space for notebooks , folders , my mouse and power cord as well as my laptop i have not had any issues with this bag so far and hope that i do not have any problems in the future note not for anything bigger than a # . # laptop i have a # . # so i ripped the seam on the pocket that holds the laptop so that it fits and it works just fine . : -rrb- happy user
i travel quite a bit for work and this bag fits my large # inch screen laptop as well as folders , <unk> , and other items although it is is sleek in design and appears small , it has a ton of space and pockets great for organizing fits wonderful in the overhead airplane bins
i have been looking and looking for a nice , professional , high quality roller bag for my mac & ipad this is the one i settled on it works well , is roomy , and seems high quality for the price my only complaint is that it 's boring i wish the print came in color choices great bag for the $
pretty and girly a lot of compartments not a huge bag , but it has enough space for a few books and magazines , laptop , chargers , makeup bag , water and other daily basics if you need a lot of space maybe for very large text books look for another one no shoulders straps , you can only roll de bag or hold it with your hand did not gave # stars because of the lack of the shoulders straps
i bough this for my wife as a gift , because it has a bit more of a female touch to it she absolutely loves it one thing that kensington might improve , is that when the handle is pulled out , moisture might get in where it comes out so there could be a clasp etc . overall great buy , light , holds essentials -lrb- might need a carry on in addition for longer business trips , but enough space for an extra pair of shoes for the office , docs etc ...
bag is lightweight , stylish and offers lots of pockets to put things in the one negative i found with this bag is the telescoping handle does not feel sturdy ; too much wiggle motion you have to be very careful to not pick the bag up by this handle for fear of snapping it off definitely need to use the other handles when lifting up onto a <unk> or steps
many roller bags are heavy and bulky - designed for men i have been searching for a long time and happy to finally found something that suits me i would like it even better if it was of leather or at least have leather bag handle for softer grip i have n't had this for very long so i hope the quality of the wheels and the pulling bar handle will last as i really like the design and look of it
i love this bag and it 's professional but classy design it 's saving my shoulders and back from having to lug around my old bag and laptop and files etc . now that i 've switched over to the roller bag , i think i 'll have to buy a couple more with different designs and colors my doctor had been telling me for # years to make the switch or my shoulders would wear out , so glad i did the only thing i 'm not crazy about it the single handle i 'd prefer it had the double handle which would give it more stability when navigating over curbs , up or down stairs , or around corners etc . all in all , it 's still great and i love all the compartments
this case from kensington was really what i was looking for it was a little bigger than i wanted or <unk> is plenty of room inside and lots of mesh pockets for storing computer accessories i even used it for a quick trip it rolls easily and fits wonderfully in overhead bins , even stuffed not sure about quality , as i have only used it for one trip and the stitching is already loose and extendable handle does not lock now without fiddling
although this would make a wonderful travel bag , i bought this bag for work , to carry my papers , purse contents , plus lunch , to save my back the outer pockets have nice organizational areas . the inner # compartments hold a laptop , and some papers the inner compartment did not have room for my lunch -lrb- with glass containers -rrb- so i bought a insulated built lunch <unk> to slip right over the handle pros : feminine design with lots of <unk> to use handle , rolls <unk> : inner compartment is narrow and does not hold a wide lunch ; the bag is loud when it rolls on pavement or wood update : ive had the bag now for over a year , bringing it daily to work all the parts still work , zippers and wheels etc . it saves my back and i would definitely buy it again
i really like the way this bag looks and it rolls really well too it has several pockets for putting random things which is nice i especially love the cup holder on the side and the straps on the top of the bag they make it easy to pick the bag up when going up steps and things the bag looks nice too it appears more on the girlie side , sorry guys my only complaint is that the handle frequently gets stuck when i 'm pushing it back down after having rolled it somewhere also , when pulling the handle up there is a bracket on the top of the handle that often gets hung on the inside of the bag it can get annoying having to reach down and mess with it to get it loose almost every time you use it however , overall i 'd say i 'm pretty happy with it . :
it is amazing how much you can put in this bag the bag is lighter than other bags i have had before i start loading it with stuff so is n't too heavy after i have put my computer , etc in my shoes even tuck nicely into the back compartment i walk # mile from the train to my office everyday so pack my heels to put on when i get there the contoured shape make it nice to carry does n't hit me in the leg as i walk the water bottle carrier is nice and folds in nicely when not in use tucks under the seat on the airplane with room to spare
this bag is absolutely perfect for my needs i walk several blocks to work after getting off the train and i travel on occasion i can fit everything i need and more , and it 's the ideal size for taking on the plane as well the * only * thing i wish was different -lrb- and this is minor -rrb- , is the handle it would have been better as a regular handle instead of a & # # ; t & # # ; shape other than that , it 's sturdy , light as a feather , and really awesome
this is the best briefcase i 've ever had ! ! ! it rolls great , it fits the female body in the times when i choose to carry it it also <unk> great fits under the airline seat perfectly , even the smaller regional jets the pockets are well thought out and has lots of zippered compartments for easy access love it !
this back is terrific for my needs as someone with back and shoulder issues , it 's exactly what i needed to transport my laptop back and forth from the office -- and it 's stylish too
this is one of the best laptop cases i have ever purchased it 's stylish , lightweight and has plenty of pockets and compartments for cables , notebooks , etc . the padded laptop compartment keeps your computer safe from harsh impacts my favorite feature , however , has to be the wheels compared to my other wheeled cases , the rolling action on this case is absolutely smooth and the adjustable handle height is perfect for my short # ' # `` frame the water bottle pocket is a nice bonus , as well i know that in other reviews people have complained about the flimsiness of the handle mechanism , but this is meant to be a light-weight case and not haul # pounds of stuff i 've found that the handle is just fine i highly recommend it
i have <unk> this case for # months now through airports and work and it has held up like a champ stylish and feminine yet so very functional and very affordable
i 've been very impressed with the versatility of this notebook roller bag rolls smoothly , adjusts well , the appearance is unlike the typical roller bags you see daily ; definitely the look was designed for us career women i 've received numerous compliments in my office and in airports i 've been very pleased with the purchase and it was definitely worth every penny extremely <unk> customer
the kensington contour laptop bag roller bag is perfect it has limited space which forced me to consider only including necessary items & documents resulting in a lighter weight bag for placing in overhead it fit easily under the airplane seat as well
the bag is stylish , with room enough to hold my computer , documents and more i highly recommend it to anyone needing to carry your laptop back and forth to <unk> every day taking it on my first business trip next week and i know it will be a very handy addition to my luggage
i love everything about this bag i use it to commute to work via the train the compartments are great , along with the feminine touch , convenient handles , easy going wheels , and just a great looking bag i have a larger than # -inch laptop which fits just great the only downfall was the horrible shipping the bag was simply put in a plastic bag only which was ripped on one side with one whole side of the bag exposed during the shipment the bag came via fedex
bought this for transporting my work laptop on business trips it is just the right size and it fits under the seat if it is not packed too full holds everything i may need back section has four webbed pockets to hold power cord , mouse , usb cord , etc . middle section has a padded pocket to hold the laptop , and extra room for files , magazines , books , etc . there is also another pocket that has a separate slide pocket to hold loose papers , i use it to hold my travel keyboard the front pocket had slots for pens and a flash drive , two other pockets to hold other essentials plus a zip pocket it also has a fold out pocket on the side to hold a water bottle best part it was so reasonably priced
my mom wanted a rolling laptop bag , and although i found it dorky ... this one was cuter than all the others so i went ahead and gave it to her for her birthday and guess what ? she just raves about it she says it holds everything -lrb- nice deep pockets -rrb- and very durable
i absolutely love this bag it is well worth the price it is very lightweight and my computer fits in the bag very nicely i love the bottle holder on the side and it even folds in when not in use -lrb- very cool ! i carry this all over my work -lrb- inside and outside -rrb- and it holds up very well given the mileage it <unk> i would very highly recommend this bag !
this bag is very nice - lightweight , lots of storage and appears to be well made the best part is it is very stylish my macbookpro fits nicely with plenty of room for various cords , cables and office supplies my only `` wish `` is that it had velcro closures on the outside pockets formed by the handles i would recommend this to anyone looking for a rolling laptop bag
i have been researching how to transport my lovely apple around and using a satchel which is lovely but it dies hurt the back and neck after a lot of looking up on the web i came across this in amazon us and as the shipping was reasonable and it sounded great i ordered it has arrived today and even my husband is impressed it will be perfect for work whilst allowing me to carry around the things i want without any discomfort and it is so very nice to have a proper female version i highly recommend
after # years of work travel , i finally found the right laptop bag it 's very , very light and fits easily into the overhead - even on regional jets it has a convenient padded area for the laptop that 's easy to access when going through security there are plenty of pockets inside for cords , mouse , etc . there 's also plenty of room for files , notepads , etc . the outside cover is durable and the shape and accent print are designed to appeal to the female traveler the telescoping handle seems sturdy and makes the bag easy to maneuver the outside pocket for a water bottle is really handy simply a great laptop bag
i was looking for a bag to fit my laptop , work papers and clothing that would fit under an airline seat with some airlines charging for carry on bags , i decided to downsize to the free size this is a great little bag it has so many compartments ; it 's amazing what you can fit in it and be super organized the handle is a bit <unk> but comfortable to pull and the wheels are very quiet and glide easily ; the space in the compartment around the single handle is pretty deep and held more that i expected my laptop would not fit in the compartment designed to hold it but fit perfectly just outside it i rolled and stacked clothing into the laptop compartment i sat in the exit row window seat on one flight and was able to get this bag under that small space at just the right angle i highly recommend this bag for commuters , business travelers and light <unk>
bought the roller bag for my wife and she loves it she packs it with her laptop , books and other accessories to school does n't complain of the shoulder pain anymore
everywhere i go people want to know where i found this amazing and stylish bag i did n't think the compact water bottle holder would come in handy but i have used it way more than i thought i would i love the magnetic closures on this bag as well as all the little details i would truly buy it again i have a # `` macbook pro and # ipads in it and all of their random chargers , paperwork and notepads in it so plenty of room for the average user . and it looks amazingly feminine the wheels roll very nicely and the handle totally retracts and zips close so you would never even know it is there
this bag is feminine and beautiful , rugged and sturdy and has great pockets for organizing everything it protects my computer and the wheels and handle make this super convenient i 've gotten tons of complements - love it
my sister was looking for a rolling notebook bag which has a purse look i was n't sure if she would appreciate it , but she loves it everyone at her work currently wants one of these it is light , feminine and durable one month and no complaint so far
the wife did not want a roller-bag , but constantly complained about carrying her laptop guess who got to carry it for her : -rrb- she did n't want to switch to this one when it arrived she is a corporate attorney and was a bit weary about the pattern on the bag -lrb- i think it looks very nice -rrb- once she tried it , it was all over she loves it , her friends and co-workers love it , she now walks to work and the foot and back aches are no more the pockets are correctly sized and logically placed , the build quality is <unk> the water bottle holder is very convenient , and the handle extender feels pretty solid and works flawlessly highly recommend this one
i was very pleased with the quality and style of this bag i have a large # inch hp laptop that is just a bit too big for the designated section within the bag but it fits nicely in the pocket adjacent there are lots of storage options and sections within this bag it is relatively light and rolls nicely and quietly i looked around for a bag at # + local stores and should have just started with amazon this a great value and quality for a very nice price as other reviewers have noted , the water compartment on the side is a very nice touch
this is my third laptop rolling bag i travel for a living and have ms so i need something lightweight and easy to handle this is all of those you can walk down the airplane isles easy with this bag it is not bulky and is very lightweight it is also very professional looking
i was looking for a bag that i could use every day at work i am in sales and wanted something not real bulky this bag is perfect it is feminine and very classy it has many more compartments than what you can see in the photos i love that my ipad slides right in the back the handle is a little unstable , but i am very careful with it i might just buy another one in case anything happens to this one i have recommended it to several friends and they purchased also
my wife loved it so much as she has been searching for a more feminine bag to carry her laptop and work documents this bag exceeds expectations , very functional but at the same time looks cool & pretty too
i bought this for my daughter in law as a middle school teach she constantly has her hands full this notebook roller allows her to have all her teaching materials on hand in one easy place because she teaches at different locations it reduces that chance of leaving something behind
i was looking for something a little different from the mass wheeled black bag collection this fits the bill perfectly , excellent style , quality and the perfect size -lrb- i did not personally want a wheeled suitcase ! -rrb- can not fault it
i had to really search to find a laptop bag that would carry my machine and still fit in those tiny overhead compartments this one not only holds the # & # # ; -lrb- diagonal ... # & # # ; across -rrb- machine but can still be carried onto those little jets i have n't had to <unk> my bag since getting this one
this smaller roller bag really fits my needs it has similar features to another kensington contour roller bag that i have had for years and use on international trips that bag has held up well and i expect this one will too both of these bags are well-designed in that they make efficient use of all space by having extra pockets in the area around the handle i find this space is well-protected , if you need to carry something fragile the zippers , handle and wheels all work well i have noticed that the zippers do n't lay as straight now that i have used the bag for awhile it makes it just a tad bit harder to get the bag open , but it is no big deal i like the softer style of this bag , so this is a worthwhile tradeoff to me
i am travel a lot for business and pleasure and i also go to business school part time it is not easy to maintain a car in nyc , so i wanted an <unk> bag to keep my laptop and books to go from one place to another being a petite woman carrying a heavy laptop and books on my shoulders and walking # minutes from station to school or work was not an option i also needed something that looked more professional than a backpack and i found this it is everything i wanted and more i ordered it yesterday afternoon and received it today -lrb- within # hours -rrb- even though i did n't ask for next day delivery amazon prime and this bag are just awesome
my wife loves her new computer bag ordered through amazon so much that she talked her business partner into buying one too . . fast service & a great value from amazon
i 'm an <unk> professor and have gone through a number of similar rolling laptop cases this is among my <unk> the best thing about it is that it has a really smooth feel to it when it 's rolling i really notice the difference between this bag and the other brand i use the only thing i 'm not thrilled with is that it 's really padded which takes up some room but it 's very cute with a feminine touch and comfortable handles to use if you do n't want to drag it
wow , so impressed i received this bag today a day earlier than expected and i love the bag already i transferred everything from my old bag to this one and though the old bag was bigger , everything fit great then i added my second laptop to the middle compartment and that fit easily too i 'm not sure what kind of laptops were not fitting for other reviewers , but they could not have been # inch laptops as both of mine fit at the same time with ease what i am most impressed by is the way the bag rolls it is so smooth , quiet and easy to maneuver the handle seems a little weak , but my last bag 's handle was too and that lasted , so i expect this to last as well great bag and good value
this was the perfect notebook / briefcase roller bag i was looking around for a roller bag that was efficient , organized , roomy for all of my papers and notebook this roller bag was comfortable and manageable for my thin weight and my shoulders say thank you too
the backpack i was using was giving me shoulder problems i purchased this bag to alleviate this which has been great at the same time our office moved which required me to commute rather than drive the bag is very functional , glides easy when walking and no wear and tear on the shoulders it 's light enough for me to carry up stairs as well , not big and bulky a lunch bag does n't fit inside , so instead i put the lunch items on the side pocket where the handle is and it all fits really well
i have looked for a long time for something that had even just a tiny bit of a feminine touch to it but was also practical and efficient this definitely fits the bill loved the look of it the minute i pulled it out of the box it is truly the perfect size plus has all the necessary pockets for my power cords , wireless mouse , notebook and files , etc . really a great design , not too big / not too small and seems plenty sturdy i know some of the other reviewers were disappointed that you could n't put it over your shoulder , but that is not something i would ever do anyway i would either be wheeling it or lifting it into the car by the handles very happy i purchased this roller bag
this carrier is easy to use and makes taking your paperwork and files and laptop in <unk> locations easy i also like the outside pocket for calculator pens and business cards
i would highly recommend this bag i read the reviews and noted that several people felt the handle was a little wobbly that is only true if you do not extend it to its full length this is exactly what i was looking for sleek but wide enough for my school books and papers without being near as bulky as the traditional style bags
i needed a bag for my laptop and my workpapers , this was the solution i tought it had n't enough space , but <unk> ! ! ! is amazing , has space and lots of pockets , perfect for me and every
this is a really nice notebook case it is very stylish , lightweight and a nice change from plain black it fits easily under the seat of all planes even express jets and puddle <unk> nice organizational pockets it is a little small but it forces you to do much needed <unk> space around the handle is great for cords , chargers etc .
i bought this <unk> briefcase after considerable research most i looked at were too big and too heavy this one is lightweight , stylish and durable i use it every day and continue to admire how nice it is due to this being a recent purchase , i ca n't speak to the durability only time will answer that question good storage in the area where the handle is for cords and my mouse
this wheeled computer bag is much more stylish than those plain old black cases it is fairly light the compartment for the computer is a little tight , but manageable , and keeps the size of the overall bag smaller than many , which is what i was looking for i have had it for a month now , with no sign of wear even though i wheel it quite a distance from car to office
i am very happy with this roller bag it is impressive looking ; the handle is long enough that i can easily pull or push the bag ; and , the wheels roll easy
it ' compact but spacious ; it looks sleek and it moves very smoothly i 've only had this roller bag for two months , but so far , i would highly recommend it to others
i did n't read this entirely correct so based on the size , it just did n't work for me i read the reviews of many people complaining it was too small so i think i over corrected with size and this was just too big for the laptop i was going to use it for -lrb- # in -rrb- go by the measurements of the product - it 's accurate it was of good quality the indentations around it giving it it 's unique shape are cause for concern as mentioned by other customers which is why i wo n't be buying another i 'm still on the hunt for the right product
clean , simple and effective protection for my large laptop seems durable and well-made , external pockets stretch enough to hold my mouse and power supply handily slips in my briefcase easily just enough product for the purpose
i am very pleased with my new ny <unk> laptop case i had a big bulky case for my computer but was wanting something much smaller , that could still hold the cables , mouse , and other stuff this case was absolutely perfect
this laptop sleeve is perfect i was worried it would n't fit my # . # & # # ; laptop , but it did i love the pockets as they hold the power cord , thumb drive and small mouse very happy with this purchase
my # inch laptop fits perfect , i think will be a <unk> hard trying to fit a # inch the sleeve does not pick up dust , pockets are great for power supply , mouse , <unk> a pen drive be carefull when zipping , for some reason i find the <unk> to be fragile great look , feels <unk> when carrying
does the trick , just some basic protection for my laptop before i toss it in my messenger bag , it also allows me to store my mouse and power cord in it
i have read about carrying your laptop in a bag that does not scream computer just for security reasons i use this in a camelbak pack it is well made and nicely padded i did make a cut on the outside of the bag between the top two pockets to hold my usb internet device i would recommend this bag to everyone and would buy again
the case is sturdy and made well , however it could have had more pockets or at least had better closures to the one it did have also , i was disappointed in that it did not have a shoulder strap in the picture , it appears to have one but it turns out that is just a strap handle -lrb- which is still better than nothing ! i am still going to use this case because it not only looks good , it actually does carry easily even without the strap and it has good cushion for my laptop
i got this laptop case for christmas i love the fabric it is made really well my only complaint is that it is a really snug fit for my dell laptop there is barely enough room in the extra pocket to fit my power cord and mouse i take my laptop to school with me and i have to be really careful when putting everything in the case i have to make the cord as flat as possible so that it fits in the case overall , i still like the case , but i wish it was a little bigger so that i can fit everything in the case more easily
do n't be misled , this bag has no shoulder strap i thought that thing in the picture was a shoulder strap , but it 's just a little handle for carrying the bag , and not attached very well if you have a heavy laptop , this bag is probably going to be too much to carry with the provided handle
quality appears to be good only thing is it did n't come with a shoulder strap the description does not mention a shoulder strap but we assumed there would be one
it 's very sturdy and a great buy , but i wish i would have read the reviews before buying no shoulder strap only a very small strap on the side meant to carry by hand
when i first saw the picture i thought it had a shoulder strap but it only has one side strap but even this is excellent it protects my laptop greatly
great bag ! ! fits my hp just perfect light weight and pocket in the front has more then enough room for my charger and other items only thing i did not like was that it did not include a shoulder strap i bought a shoulder strap separate and now i carry my laptop everywhere
i fell in love with it at first sight this case has a lot of room for my charger and other documents very good material , moderately padded and beautiful design my laptop fits perfectly in it and i used the side trap to carry it around
i got this case because i wanted something with pockets so i could store my power cord and mouse , and this works perfectly my laptop slides right in and fits inside snugly , and the outside pocket has plenty of room for all my accessories the material is a nice canvas , and it 's very stylish you carry the case vertically by the side strap , or you can fit it inside of another bag
serious shortcomings for a backpack this size - the inside is not deep enough for my canon # mm lens to sit upright the exterior pockets only open part of the way and have room for very little other than extra batteries or cables the waist strap is not padded to help with the weight of the camera and lenses good stuff - straps are comfortable , good mounts for short tripod on back for balance , sealed zippers to keep water out , tough fabric , enough interior fabric for attaching the velcro dividers where needed
this backpack is well made and has a lot of great features including lots of places to organize all the extra little stuff you need like extra batteries , memory cards , filters , etc . it also has excellent protection for your cameras and lenses the bag is comfortable to carry all day where it fell short for me is that access to the main compartment is in the front my old backpack accessed the gear through the back where the straps are so when the ground is wet or <unk> the parts that contacted my body and clothing remained clean and dry with this pack you have to lay the strap side side down so if where you put it is dirty and wet you get dirty and wet all in all it is a great pack typical of the quality you would expect from tamrac however , if you shoot in the back country or other places where the ground or floor is not clean this might not be the best choice
my main reason for buying this bag was was to accommodate my # mm sigma lens the middle , inside compartment fits perfectly for this when attached to the camera body although , at this time my lens <unk> is only the # mm and a # & # , i will have room for additional lens as needed i like the tripod setup and for my size , # ' # `` , the fit has a good feel and even <unk> my posture when walking the accessory compartments are easy to access and well positioned the construction quality is excellent and the design well thought out as others have mentioned , this is a large backpack which works well for me , but should be considered by those of smaller <unk> and strength
quality constructed bag great compartments and well thought out the only issue is that this bag is very deep the height and width is perfect for what i needed -lrb- # <unk> with multiple lenses -rrb- but the depth is very bulky , especially with the tripod attached if you are looking for a low profile bag , this is not for you
i didnt need a carry all for my equipment , just some where central to store it this pack is great for getting everything i need to where i am at not practical for around the town , as i dont want to <unk> that i am carrying camera equipment , plus carry a lot of what <unk> not going to need but on the plane it is a must have i would not be allowed another carry one unless it was all camera related however , once i get to where i am going to shoot , i break it down
this is by far one of the best made backpacks that anyone will ever purchase i am very pleased with this purchase ; i knew i was going to be though i have had the # x for about a year now , and i outgrew it and so i opted for the # x so i can also carry around my # `` macbook pro around as well i can carry literally everything that i will ever need for my camera and # lenses along with everything that i will need for my laptop all in one bag it will be hard to ever leave a brand like tamrac when they build excellent products such as these bags
i really like this pack it has nice zipper weather linings that seem to help the tripod holder is useful especially when camping , i did n't use it for location shooting i fit quite a few lenses though two bodies is pretty difficult but possible you can even stack a longer lens like a canon # f/ # l the larger hoods do n't fit well in the spaces so i ended up stacking them and putting them over top the # f/ # . # is this is ok but not ideal because the hoods get stuck together every time very durable pack , quite satisfied
this is a great backpack for all of my camera equipment i previously has a smaller tamrac bag but when i began to add additional lens and a # nd camera i quickly out grew it this backpack is comfortable and hold more than i thought it would because of it 's size i would not recommend this as a everyday bag but it is great for travel
tamrac # expedition # x <unk> backpack -lrb- black the expedition # x is an excellent carry all backpack for the <unk> photographer i use it to carry my nikon d # with a mounted medium telephoto , a long tele , another mid tele , # smaller lenses additionally i carry a full set of # <unk> filters with adapter rings and holders , a light meter and a small flash unit there is plenty of space for circular filters and an assortment of accessories , with room to spare for a future lens purchase the laptop compartment is spacious , as are the extra compartments for spare batteries and memory cards i am a large man -lrb- # ' # `` -rrb- and <unk> pack fits perfectly if there is anything negative to say about the # x it is that my large <unk> tripod is too big for the tripod attachment , though my monopod is easily attached to the pack this # x was a birthday gift i almost asked for the # x , but i am very satisfied with this model
