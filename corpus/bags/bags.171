i tried to let this sleeve air out for three weeks because it smelled so awful i could never get the chemical smell to go away ! it gave me a headache - would not recommend this product
the laptop sleeve is claimed for the # & # # ; macbook pro no it is not there is nearly one inches extra on each side contacted seller -lrb- top case -rrb- for return and they want me to pay shipping for product that is not as described buyer be ware
case itself is pretty nice , except i was expecting to have it better closer , zipper would work better than nothing i am returning this item , not able to use it , not practical for me on the go use
i recently purchased the # macbook air , and needed a thin sleeve that would protect my mba but as well be thin i purchased this case only to find out that it does not fit the mba properly there is at least a one inch perimeter gap from the mba and the case if the mba is placed in the middle of the case this case looks like it may fit # inch macbooks
it was very loose fit on my # & # # ; mba i wanted something more snug also this color gets dirty very easily between that and the fit it just looked sloppy after a week the material was fine i just wanted something to protect my mac from scratches in my bag . but i think i do remember it being stinky it definitely went away in my case however , in the end it was a waste i had to buy a new one
great price -lrb- obviously -rrb- but the material is thin and somewhat flimsy if you have a newer , thinner laptop , this case will be too big and it will <unk> at the opening also , it gets dirty easily in this color , but i 've thrown it in the washing machine and it comes out fine
the case color looks just like the picture and it is definitely cute , but does n't seem very protective i am going to return this product , it did not fit my # -inch macbook air , it was much too loose , and the padding was very thin might protect against scratches but that 's pretty much it also , like the other reviews said , it smells terrible when it arrives , but i 'm sure this can be fixed through a good dose of febreze overall i 'm disappointed with the lack of functionality because it really is fashionable and cute maybe it would fit the macbook pro better , but this case is definitely more for show than use
did you guys forget to measure it or something does it shrink in the wash this sleeve is about a half-inch too big for a # & # # ; macbook air it does n't fit snugly at all
i read the reviews on the laptop being to big for the air so i figured it would fit my pro and it was still too big it 's not as protective as i expected but it 's better than
it was a stain on it when i got it kind of look like a tiny little drop of blood and i hoped it would be thicker so it protect my laptop better
i own a macbook air and bought this to replace an <unk> sleeve i 'd left in a <unk> this particular version probably fits a macbook pro just fine but it 's way too loose for a macbook air
the color is great ! ! ! too bad it smells so strong hopefully the smell goes away because right now i ca n't be in the same room with it without getting a headache
it 's way too wide and just loose in general sure , the length is correct , but there is # full inch of empty space on the side of my laptop it would take adding a second macair # to be in the <unk> of being snug i 'm sending this <unk> tomorrow sorry and thank you
the product smells so bad i can not use it it has been in the garage for a week and still the smell is to strong the computer also is loose in the sleeve and it is very slippery i probably will not use this case
the product was extremely big for a # inch , and the silver stitching on the side was n't sewed on i contacted the seller , and they told me it 's meant to hold the charger as well , but you risk scratching your laptop if it does n't have a case they gave me # % of my money back , but definitely not worth the price , especially since it gets dirty easily
does not have any padding and does smell really weird however will do the job keeping your laptop dry but i would n't buy another one i would suggest caselogic or <unk>
is not fit for my new macbook pro -lrb- with retina , # -inch -rrb- <unk> too big i could probably fit two or three of the same laptop in there however , i tried fitting my friend 's old macbook pro , and it fits perfectly , so if i had one of those , it would have been fine other than the <unk> , it has really nice material and it 's very easy to get my laptop in and out
it does n't fit snuggly on the # & # # ; macbook air and is pretty thin so offers little protection false economy , i would go for a more up market product next
the case itself is exactly as described and nicely form fitting but it has a very strong chemical odor i left in in my bedroom while i was away at work and when i came home the entire room smelled of some alarming chemical odor i will likely <unk> it if the smell does not wear off in a few days
i bought this sleeve cover for my lenovo yoga pro # , and the laptop fits in the case very well i like the color and the feel of the sleeve , and it seems like it protects the laptop well however , as some reviews have already mentioned , it smells very badly it has a very <unk> rubbery smell that has now made my laptop smell as well if you do n't mind the very strong odor that will take a long time to go away , then this is a good sleeve cover for you
i do not like my new laptop sleeve the color is nice , but my praise stops there the neoprene is thin , so the protection is n't great the fabric easily stains , so within weeks my <unk> new laptop and case is looking worse for the wear the closure is <unk> although this item was cheap , i 'll need to replace it in the very near future
the color was actually a little lighter than i thought it would be it was easy to use and a good concept but end seam came apart after a little use i did not <unk> a replacement
if you buy this & # # ; bag cover case & # # ; for your kids beware that it has strong unpleasant plastic odor it was unbearable to keep it in the room for a day so i <unk> it outside for a day but i have to travel tomorrow and the product still smells
it 's okay it is n't going to give heavy-duty protection i also have a built computer case and like it a lot more because it grips the computer much more firmly and is much better styled
i love this product , but it did not ship with the mouse pad as promised in the ad and i still do n't have it ! ! ! ! after telling them over and over , they still have not shipped it out to me , and i do n't think that they will be
this case will not work for the macbook # inch retina display computer i do n't know why other people say it fits because it is at least # inch too big for this computer however , i like this case a lot and i wish it fit
i bought this for my wife she said she likes it but it smelled funny i told her it was probably because of the <unk> 's used to make it and that it might not be fully <unk> and to give it a few days in the open air needless to say the smell <unk> .
i received my order very quick it 's a three star because its only flaw is that it has a strong rubber smell ; however , i like the color its like the picture
very thin neoprene sleeve w / a distinct odor that i hope will wear off eventually fits slightly loose on my mac book pro # & # # ; w / a hardcase i wanted it to supplement my hardcase to prevent dust & dirt from getting inbetween my macbook and hardcase during transport , works well for this purpose like the fact that it is zipperless , so there is no chance of scratching
color is a exactly what i was expecting case is sturdy and an easy snap-on fit key covers are easily discolored by finger oil very obvious which keys one uses most often sleeve seam began to unravel the first day i used it - luckily , i can sew and fix it it 's what you can expect for everything together being ~ $ #
i read a review that said this case fits around a laptop with a hard case on it that does n't work for me , it 's too tight to fit around the case it is stretchy so it might fit on others it 's thin so it might not protect it that well , but it 's slim and perfect for easy mobile protection
this case has served its purpose in that it protects my macbook pro and now my mac air from the elements or if it falls however , this case gets dirty pretty quickly from being handled frequently if you do n't mind that , its for you i have now bought a leather case that is more in keeping with my style
this was shipped very fast and i got it before expected the material is not the best , of course , but it 's okay i was looking for something cheap and that would protect my computer from scratches and etc . i think this will do the job the smell is terrible , but it gets better
this sleeve is okay i do n't like that it has wrinkles and creases on it and it has a very strong smell if that does n't bother you then it 's perfect lol i 'm a perfectionist and i hate when my things look messy the shipping was fast i got it two days before the expected date it also fits my macbook air # `` perfectly i 'm still waiting for my laptop case to come in and hopefully it 'll still fit with the case on i do n't think the wrinkles will go away , but i 'm hoping if i let it air out that the smell will go away or at least not be so strong
the item itself seems to be perfect looks a little discolored but nothing huge or major you can barely notice it i love this color and it will look very cute traveling in my bag
the perfect size , arrived on time i had a macbook # inch and i also ha a shell over it , it slips in and out with no <unk>
i got this case because i had always needed a sleeve/case for my laptop and this one was a good price it 's okay but i never use it . it provides minimal protection and would be good if you needed to put your laptop in a case to then put in a backpack , etc . i like the selection of colors but i would n't get the orange again because it seems really dull and kind of gross as opposed to happy and bright and cheery like i was expecting it 's a nice product for what it is , but it turns out it was n't really what i was looking for
its great for it 's purpose , however the color picks up , ... everything i would order this product again , but in a different color - and since i have switched to cases with handles - good for the quick slip into a bag , but not tough enough for travel
it 's an okay cover my mbp # & # # ; fits in it however it is a little big , and there is extra space in the sleeve that is unused i would only recommend this for someone getting the # & # # ; macbook pro
it is loose for a computer case does not fit a # inch mac book air snuggly as the computer is more than able to shift i think in the future i am going to spend more money instead of being a <unk> expecting the cheap product to actual fit what i expect
arrived in # days of purchasing which was amazing also the color is very vibrant everything seems fine with the case , all the stitches are in place and no stains but the case does put off a very distinct smell , like paint or rubber it 's not that bad but you can still smell every once in awhile and it does n't make one full of joy hopefully the smell will dissipate with usage but if not , i 'll try washing it
i do n't use this product often ; however , i found it useful to carry around when going to and from school , workplace , or coffee shops it 's a slick sleeve with a nice feel to its touch it 's a nice bag that complements the color of my laptop device the material is a great the smell of the bag when it arrived was too strong and was similar to that of a drying paint all in all , i would recommend this to individuals who carries around their laptop ; if not , purchase a laptop bags
i 'm a little disappointed the color of this case is gorgeous , but the way they packaged it makes it crease and it is n't smooth also , its a tad bigger than my # inch macbook pro , and so it has a poof in the front when it is closed not a big deal , but it could be better
i love the turquoise color and it fits my laptop perfectly -lrb- i have a # & # # ; asus -rrb- but it smells so bad i read all the reviews before i bought it and i figured it would be alright if i aired it out for a couple days like the other customers have , but nope i had to air it out for about a week and a half and then flip it inside out and air it out for another week and a half and even still , the strong plastic-y smell is still there it was kind of disappointing , esp . cause it looks so nice but it gives me a headache when i carry it around at school
loved this product until i realized it was coming apart at the seams just after a few weeks of having it now i have a large hole along the side of the sleeve where the stitching came undone really like the product until it began to fall apart after no time
i dont like that fact its not like other sleeves this doesnt have a zipper so instead of putting it in vertically and then zipping it up you put it in horizontally and then put the flap over it theres no
it does a great job at protecting the laptop and it fits great but i would n't recommend this color , i used it one day at school and it got so dirty i 've had other light cases before and handled them the same way but they did n't get as dirty as this case got in just one day i would recommend this case to anyone but not this color , especially if you 'll be handling it a lot
i like the sleeve it feels like decent quality but it does not fit my # in macbook air very well its fairly loose actually i would have preferred it to be more tight , but oh well , it does the job , and for $ # what should you expect
did n't really expect much with this case , just needed something to protect my macbook from scratches while i 'm out with it really disappointed with the quality does n't hold its form and my unit has a poorly sewn pocket clearly came from a factory from china does the job on protecting it from scratches though if you want a case just to put in your backpack or another bag . . it 's great but if you need this for an everyday case , get another one
love the case itself , and it fits like a glove but ... i ca n't use it because it smells sooooo bad i have it sitting in my garage in hopes that it will air out if it does n't i will be returning it to amazon by the ratings of the other purchasers , it must eventually lose it 's smell i ca n't imagine anyone that could use it with the smell they really should not be able to send it out with such a smell
the sleeve wo n't provide much protection for your macbook , and it will only fit a macbook pro when it comes in the box , there is a <unk> smell that not one of these reviews can accurately put into words other than that , it fits like a glove on the macbook pro i would recommend it if you do light traveling , not suitable for carrying your laptop to/from school or work
it is the same color in the pictures provided it also fit my # in macbook pro my only complaint is that it smells horrible it is the plastic factory smell and it does not wash off ! other than that it does what it is intended to do protect my laptop
the case itself is a vibrant color and the stitches look uniform and strong - but the way that my case was shipped -lrb- free # business days -rrb- had taken a <unk> the case is <unk> through near the top of the opening and <unk> deeply in various places the case itself seems fine , but i recommend paying for your shipping as not to receive this product in poor condition
other <unk> 's said this smells bad when you take it out ... they were not kidding ! it smells sooooo bad i left it outside over a couple nights and that helped a tad but it still reeks ! my mac fits great in it and i like the color and the fact it has no zippers . it is easy to slide in and
this is the second case that i bought from this company and they work fine but they have a distinct smell of petroleum or something i bought the second because i thought it was a fluke but apparently not
case is nice color only problem is after using it for a week it , the seems have begun to come undone at the top and now there is a hole in other than that the size is true and its thin so it can fit in my bags
although the cover serves it 's purpose for protecting my computer its a little on the thin side with not much padding and is slightly oversized for the macbook air however the color is spot on and i am satisfied with it
it has a funny smell , like old shredded tires i bought it for the office macbook air # & # # ; so it was n't kept in a plastic bag i expected it to be a good tight fit , but the air just slides around in there it is about # & # # ; too big all around it is good looking sleeve/bag , it has a good pull over top so no <unk> is needed , but you could put # or # macbook airs in there and still have room as my stars state , & # # ; it 's okay & # # ; but i 'll probably look around for a better fitting one this will probably work for a macbook # & # # ; but not the air
the price is great , and seems like good quality , but i wanted more of a snug fit for my macbook air this is not a snug fit if i were to use it for & # # ; things & # # ; in addition to the actual computer , like paper work , it would be great a friend of mine order a zipper case for her macbook air and loves the fit
not as thick as i 'd like , but hey it was so cheap i 'm not going to complain too much this sleeve is probably best if you 're just wanting protection from scratches
this is a functional neoprene sleeve for my laptop , although i 'm curious as to what chemicals were used on or around the product during manufacturing it had a very harsh chemical smell when i first got the item my solution was to hang it outside for a few days to air it out , and then <unk> it with some febreeze i would n't recommend getting this item for children though - because i have no idea what chemicals the item was exposed to prior to being delivered to me it was a great price , and it definitely works - but the construction is a little questionable
i bought this for my # `` macbook air to put in my rectangular backpack my air fits in it , with some room left fit might be better for the pro the color looks exactly like the one shown in the product pic but in person , the sleeve looks cheap and had a strong smell when i first received it -lrb- went away in a week -rrb- also , it has gotten dirty already but i guess you could wash it i have only been leaving the sleeve in my backpack though ... so it might not be optimal for heavy use
i like the idea of this but was sad to see it was a dirty , darker orange than i thought it would be i was also disappointed with the size i was hoping it would 've fit my macbook snuggly , but there 's more than inch extra in the width and it slides around i 'm just too lazy to send it back , so i kept it , but will probably buy a different one soon
this is a great case , i like the construction and the <unk> closure all in all it 's nice , but probably <unk> for a macbook pro my air has an extra # of an inch or so around the whole border of the case and does n't fit nearly as snug as i 'd like it to it also did smell very strong of chemicals when i took it out of the packaging yesterday , and still does today the lack of snug fit is why i deducted two stars i 'm sure the scent will eventually diminish , but the looseness i ca n't do anything about
cute and fits good , but not very protective , and gets dirty easily but if you buy the case to keep the laptop from scratching this works great if youre looking for a more protective case , incase you drop it or keep it in your backpack , its not worth it
cases arrived on time the stitching of the case is shoddy in areas and expected case to have abit more weight to it than it does but fits the purpose & macbook for now
this is really a cosmetic cover to keep the laptop scratch free its a bit too large for the # & # # ; macbook air but it does the job of keeping it scratch free but that 's it ! !
i liked it , but it 's already coming apart at the corner of the opening i 'm going to have to <unk> it or buy a new one seems to be a & # # ; you get what you pay for & # # ; deal
it 's a good sleeve , it 's what it 's worth it 's really thin and does n't have much cushion to protect your laptop i have the speck see-thru satin case and it does fit inside of this sleeve it is really cute , i got the turquoise one and it 's adorable oh , yes it does come with this stench that can almost give you a high it smells just like spray paint other than that it 's good
in the description for this product it says that it works for macbook air 's as well as macbook pro 's i have a # inch macbook air and it is a little loose it 's more suited for a macbook pro other than that , the thickness of the padding is adequate and the fold over closure is secure i would recommend this , just not for a macbook air
for me it 's ok i used it for my macbook pro # `` and i 'm ok with it for sure you can find more better products with better quality , tissue , and design it 's kind of loose but i 'm really ok with that i hope it prevents my laptop from scratches and sudden hit
i was expecting this sleeve to be a bit thicker and tighter on my laptop it seems like my computer is just floating around in it however , i always take into consideration the price for the product -- not bad
used it in my trip to the philippines it was okay and protected my macair on the trip and back it was also easy to get in and out of however , since it was made in china , i am dubious re the quality only time will tell how long it keeps the plastic on my macair -lrb- from the same company -rrb- already cracked and was thrown away in december # i got a american speck brand instead
nice sleeve case its really too big for the macbook air i expected the air to slide in , like putting something in a manila envelope it does , yet there is over an inch of room on the sides so this takes up extra space in my briefcase good quality and seems are well put
though the sleeve is a bit on the thin side , the quality is decent enough as others have noted , there is a strong <unk> smell to the bag , at least for the first few days my main issue with this case , though , is its fit i have a # macbook air -lrb- mba -rrb- with a kuzy plastic case around it , and this sleeve still fits too loosely this is because the makers chose to sell a <unk> case for two quite different laptops - the macbook pro and the macbook air for mba owners , i would recommend getting a sleeve made specifically for the mba + # star for the price and free mini mousepad , though as a summary : good price , adequate quality , mediocre
the material of the product is good , but when i put my macbook into the sleeve , there 's a lot of open space inside it so it is n't snug at all it was cheap so whatever
i bought this to fit my <unk> # tablet , which has similar dimensions to my macbook air , so i went with this case it fits it really well , though not as snugly of course i can put the tablet , pen and power cord in there no problem , and probably fit a mini sketchbook as well , which is nice the only thing i do n't like is that i ordered the yellow , thinking it was mustard yellow like it looks on my screen the one i got is more <unk> i would have chosen a different color if i had known this was what it looked like that and it smells very strongly like & # # ; new car & # # ; or & # # ; auto store & # # ; but i 'm sure that will dissipate for # dollars plus shipping it is not worth returning over a color issue , and it does what i need it to do , so that 's good
the color is the same as in photo i ordered one of these before and it lasted me years of tough traveling unfortunately though , the fabric is now thinner than it was it used to be the thickness of a surfing wetsuit , so very sturdy it 's still neoprene , which is good , but a thinner kind , which is why i did n't give it full marks for better or worse , the price stayed the same despite the thinner fabric & # # ; i guess that 's another way of handling <unk>
it looks exactly as shown - the color is gorgeous - and it seems very <unk> for the price , but it 's baggy on my laptop it 's not designed for thin notebooks at all ; i can fit the power supply , mouse , and mousepad all in the sleeve along with my computer
it looks just like the photo , but it is a little loose for the # inch macbook i suppose i can stick in a spiral notebook or two in there to fill the space , but i was hoping my computer would of fit more snug and it does smell a bit plasticky
this item is not a snug fit for a # & # # ; macbook air but you get what you pay for and if you 're looking for a cheap easy fit , this works
this case serves its purpose to transport my macbook pro when i 'm using it for quick trips it does n't have place for the charger or mouse so it 's just the sleeve but that 's what i bought so it works for the price it 's a good quality
my laptop case came in a timely matter but it absolutely reeked of some god awful mechanical smell i was quite surprised as i did n't expect to be given a poorly scented laptop case be prepared to leave your laptop case outside for a week before use because it smells like <unk> prime <unk> on it
for $ # , this is a great case and just what i was looking for it 's not completely protective and is n't going to help you if you drop your mac or anything , but i just wanted something to put my computer in when it was in my backpack and this is perfect
it could be a little thicker for more protection , but it does what it needs to do it fits perfectly on my # `` macbook i was hoping it would be a little darker than in the picture -lrb- <unk> thinking -rrb- , but its more on the baby blue side than turquoise
the bright teal color is right up my alley and really <unk> up the product , laptop fits securely in this bag , and the bag itself successfully prevents damage to your laptop i was turned off by the smell though - even after several washes , it still <unk> and even transferred a little over to my macbook
the color as shown in the picture is spot on the material is a little bit thin , and it arrived smelling a little <unk> or something but definitely worth the money
the stitching is kinda weird on the inside but its fine on the outside which doesnt bug me at all because you ca n't see it really . the stitching isnt so bad where it 'll fall apart which is good it does smell a bit at first but that goes away with time i do love the color and it fits my # & # # ; macbook pro which also has a hard case on it its a little snug but its fine its cute and arrived in time
overall i 'm very happy with this case it does stretch out a bit it would also have enough room if you would want to have another covering on the computer
i like my topcase cover the reason i 'm not giving it a # is that it gets dirty easily which is understandable due to the quality of the material but yea just stare clear of <unk> places
before buying this product , i did read other reviews and was a little worried about the chemical smell everyone was talking about the smell was really strong , and it took about a week for it to finally wear off if you are waiting for the smell to go away , do n't put it in a small area ... like a dorm room but after the smell wore off , i absolutely love it it 's such a cute color , and easily fits my macbook pro
this is a fairly decent sleeve ; it 's a little loose and is n't as snug as i would 've liked , but for the price i ca n't complain the only thing is is that this sleeve reeks but after a little while it dissipates
color is nice , it smells plastic-y or similar to that at first still intact and <unk> but that 's because i have n't used it much over all i 'm happy with the purchase it fits my macbook pro with it 's case and all and it 's not too tight no stains as of now
i got the purple sleeve as a present for my mother it fit her macbook air `` # well it does n't have a lot of padding but it 's nice just to keep it on the laptop so it does n't get scratched around the house for the price of it i 'm not complaining at all
great little case that hugs my macbook air like a glove there is a very strong chemical smell to it but i 've been letting it air out the last few days and it 's slowly dissipating
first thing i 'm worried about the odor as the others ' comments well honestly it does have bad smell , but it turns out it does n't bother me that much if you just put it inside out near the window for several days the smell will gone but it is too long for my newest version macbook pro i do n't know if it was supposed to be like that anyway it is still pretty good thing
fits my # `` late # macbook pro perfectly , even with a shell on the outside of it the only problem i have with it is that i would rather have a zipper rather than a simple fold-over envelope top
this case <unk> once you get it out of the packaging it is cute , however i 'm going to air it out before i stick my laptop inside of it <unk> ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
i love this it 's exactly the same color as the picture the only reason i 'm giving in # stars is because it 's really loose my laptop is thicker than the mac air do if it 's loose with mine it 's definitely not going to fit that tight so it does n't really protect it
it does the job although it gets dirty easily i 've had it for about # months now and i 'm getting sick of looking at the dirty finger prints , so i might buy a new one
