very sturdy and strong bag strap makes it very easy to move about with the laptop i have a # & # # ; hp envy and it is n't too snug a fit ... with a nice side pocket for the cord ... great
i use this carrying case to storage my ipad it is more roomy than any ipad case , and i love the extra pocket where i can store all of my power cords
my laptop fits perfectly in this case i was a little dissapointed however that the bag was n't as purple as it looks in the picture it was more of a pink purple :
i like the fact that it is light weight , has color but not so bright easy to open and close and <unk> the zipper compartment for the charger or any accessories have not used the shoulder strap , but glad i have it in case i do need it i do not think it will disappoint
i just love this case the colors are beautiful and it 's the perfect size for my new <unk> notebook computer i was happy that it shipped so quickly , i received it in less than a week after ordering i love the padded shoulder strap and the extra zippered pocket is just perfect to hold the charging cord so i do n't loose it . :
i love this tote the colors are vibrant and perfect for a stylish carrying tote it 's soft but has enough padding to keep a laptop protected my # year old uses it for her laptop and it fits her age and personality -lrb- although her much older mom would use it too -rrb- the bag also accomodates her charger i would recommend this bag
i have had this case for over a week now and i absolutely love it it looks exactly like it is pictured so i am very happy about that i did n't want to get anything too bulky as that would defeat the purpose of purchasing a smaller laptop most cases with the shoulder strap on them are bulky this one is perfect the strap is removable which is great when i want to place the case into a backpack or other bag i am carrying so it takes up less space it is so great to have when i am only carrying the case i love that it has handles on it as well i was worried that it would be too bulky with the handles , but they do fold down rather nice and hardly take up space at all
this laptop carrying case was perfect for me fits my laptop perfectly love the design and the color , everything it 'll be easy to travel with keeps my laptop clean and protected when not in use it 's not a heavy-duty hard-sided protective case , but i did n't need that just a cute , lightweight , functional carrying case , and this product was exactly what i needed
terrific water-proof decorative bag for my new hp split delivery was as promised love amazon deals . amazon made it much easier to look for a bag that was attractive and fun
i bought this bag , i knew the name , and it looked good as it had lots of storage compartments for all the it things i carry however , the zippers are extremely weak and only after a couple weeks of limited use , the zippers broke not a good back if you want it to last of use it more than once a month
a chain is as strong as its weakest link ! well built laptop bag nicely accommodates my hp envy # - # nr laptop lots of compartments however , after only two days of use , my zipper has already given way ! ! very very disappointed after spending my <unk> cash for what i thought was a quality product in all respects ! ! would not recommend based on the poor quality of the zip certainly would not even consider buying this product again
i had an old case logic vnc- # which i purchased for $ # years ago and it was heavy duty with lots of pockets this was meant to be a replacement the price was the same but two thumbs down for quality and what you get for your money material was noticeably thinner and instead of a front wallet , front fold-down compartment , laptop compartment , rear compartment i got merely a laptop compartment and front wallet with no room to store electronic accessories etc <unk> their <unk> # is more like the original quality and has more pockets but at $ # <unk> guys , next time i 'll probably switch to samsonite
let me start by saying i love the many pockets and the way the zippers are so smooth my external hard drives fit perfectly in the front organizer pocket along with my phone charger and other electronics the case opens up smoothly which is good i travel a lot and i feel these smooth zippers and neat organizer will save me so much time trying to locate the things i need i just got this case from the mail and the first thing i noticed is the case is smaller than i expected my lenovo z # barely fits in this case the sides and bottom seem protected but i 'm disappointed by the fact that there is absolutely no padding on the top side of the case i hope i do n't drop this thing on it 's head overall , the case is a good concept but i wish it were slightly larger with more padding it seems this case was not built with total protection in mind
i use it every day for my computer here at the university my regular computer briefcase broke whilst i was travelling to europe and i got one there which i really prefer -lrb- and which was cheaper than this one -rrb- but this is ok around the university it is n't really very well designed however
even know it 's for a # inch laptop they could have made the bag a little bigger suggestion , buy a # inch bag for your # inch laptop by the time you put the power cord in the case you can hardly zip it up
it fits everything that needs to be put in a travel case , computer , tablet , power cords and extra accessories starts to get bulky when you begin to use all compartments still possibly one of the best laptop cases in the market the airplane ready mode does work and i have not had to remove my computer yet while traveling through airports
it meets most of my expectations for a traveling computer case to carry large laptops i do wish it had the internal air shock absorbing pads as some other cases have it could use also have bigger <unk> pockets for more room for paper files and binders
i did my research and i picked this laptop bag because of it 's security friendly status it is a well constructed , serviceable bag for my work laptop it easily carries everything that i need when i am working remotely i have n't been through a tsa security checkpoint with it yet , but my hope is that it makes that process a bit easier update : it is still an excellent carry case for my work laptop tsa still wanted my laptop out for scanning purposes
i have a # & # # ; laptop , which is heavy and use this case when travelling mostly it is well designed and protective , however i would have preferred if they provided sturdier support at the corners the flat sides are well protected but the corners allowed my laptop to dent the design is good and easy to use in the tsa line cases capable of carrying a # & # # ; laptop are few and far between , especially tsa friendly ones i would recommend this but just be alert to the corner thing
nice bag for transporting your computer and accessories to a meeting in your workplace , but not enough storage to make it a good travel case for <unk> meetings or extended travel
i really like this bag and use it everyday what i like about it most is that thought it holds # inch laptops , its not very large the design is compact and has many little compartments to organise your belongings the one thing that i would improve is the external base of the bag this should have a plastic or rubber <unk> to protect the nylon from fraying
there 's plenty of room for my mobile <unk> laptop , which is thicker than an ordinary laptop lots of room for all of the extra items that one needs to carry the bag is well made with strong zippers with large pulls the only reason for giving it # stars is the unpadded carrying handle
this case logic laptop case provides a place for all your electronics , gadgets and accessories compartments protect both a laptop with a # <unk> # -inch screen and an ipad or # . # -inch tablet i 'm very happy with this case for my hp pavilion dv # <unk> series computer a good fit in a well made product at a very reasonable price
bought this as a requested gift for a relative it seems to be well-made and <unk> all the boxes on his wish list for features he is looking forward to using it
as long as you understand this is a small bag , what i consider a minimalist type you should be very happy with this product the only reason i did n't give it five stars is because the shoulder strap is made of a type of material that immediately slides off your shoulder it has no padding , which is n't a big deal since you ca n't carry much but they should have used something that has a little & # # ; grip & # # ; to it
with many pockets , aside from the one for the laptop itself , its great i was able to transfer from my ipad carrying bag to this one it fits my books , and many other stuff this is a great material that this case was made
as a grad student i 'm constantly moving this bag is great it possesses enough compartments for me to carry my computer , phone , ipod , and chargers with room to spare for personal items no more carrying a purse and a computer bag
i hated to change from the leather case i was using for my old sony vaio , but my new hp # . # screen required it contrary to other reviews i 've read , i thought the padding was adequate there are also plenty of pockets and pouches , as well as the separate zippered <unk> in addition to the zipper compartment for the computer this new case was able to store everything i had in my old leather case which also had lots of storage space this case is the first nylon one i have used , so i do n't know yet how durable it is
this case is durable and comfortable to carry it has much more room it it than expected i can carry my # inch laptop , # inch tablet with keyboard case , accessories , all my paper work and stationary supplies with room to spare for a book or #
i bought this for my husband after purchasing a leather case that was too big , too bulky and too heavy my husband loves this case it carries his computer and everything else he needs fits in perfectly it 's sturdy and light , and provides great protection i could n't be happier

i love the airport security zipper this thing has just flips right open in half , with the laptop on one side and everything else on the other , without needing to take anything out at all it also has great organizing potential a pouch in one of the pockets that 's obviously for a mouse , good cord separation , and possibilities for documents and such as well also very solidly built , and the shoulder strap is very sturdy
great bag for frequent flyers i travel frequently and this bag accommodates the need for zipping through security without removing your laptop and has lots of pockets for your electronic
at first , i was skeptical about the `` tsa approved `` bag , but needed one really bad very roomy with lots of pockets and holds my # `` laptop perfectly well , my first trip through the check point was a success the bag unzips so that the two larger compartments can lay flat and be scanned make sure the laptop by itself within its compartment and you wont encounter any problems
i purchase this case for my # . # & # # ; laptop the case is very sturdy and has plenty of room to store accessories , cables and other various things the laptop -lrb- netbook -rrb- fits in there perfectly and i have no concerns of it getting damaged this case is a perfect choice for someone such as myself who did not want a neoprene sleeve to house the laptop and prefer something that is more sturdy and will offer more protection the shoulder strap comes in very handy to carry it around as well overall i am loving it and would easily recommend it
i needed a laptop case that i could use every day for not only my laptop , but limited accessories and documents this one fit the bill no need for my bulky old bag also , no more removing the laptop from the case at the airport just unfold it , put it on the conveyor belt and you 're on your way very pleased so far
i held off on reviewing this order because i wanted to see how useful and handy it really was and i love it ! ! ! honestly for a # ' # & # # ; woman i hate carrying those bulky laptop bags the padding is good and i can carry my laptop and my ipad it 's made going through security at airports super easy -lrb- i travel a lot -rrb- and all i do is take out my ipad there 's plenty of space for me to keep my files and papers in a separate compartment , also space to put my pens , phones , chargers , and cards one of my best purchases all year ! ! great concept :
i travel a lot for business and i was ready for a replacement bag since i downsized my laptop a year ago and no longer needed the larger back i love this new bag , it is just the right size for my # ' dell latitude plenty of room for files as well as an additional padded area for an ipad i can fit cell phone charger , computer charger as well as external hard drive along with normal accessories with no trouble the interior fabric is not the best quality and has a cheap feel to it there is only one zippered pocket and it is external i would have like to have a zippered internal pocket overall this bag represents excellent value i would definitely purchase again
this bag was perfect for my # inch mac book pro mac book fits nicely in its section plenty of <unk> for accessories highly recommended if you want a bag that is not too snug and need some room for more than just the laptop
fits my dell # z just right gives protection and allows enough room to store what i carry i will be good for airport check ins seems well build and believe it will last for a good while pleased and would buy again
this bag was perfect for traveling and made my business trips very easy i used it for about a year for business no longer <unk> it -lrb- company owned -rrb- if i ever need another laptop bag i would purchase this bag
my new macbook pro fits perfectly in this case with plenty of room for all my other & # # ; crap & # # ; sure , it 's bulky considering everything else i have loaded in it , but it does hold everything i want it to hold there is room for improvement as far as making the shoulder strap pad non slip , but it feels sturdy and the handles are strong considering what i loaded the case up with overall , it 's a winner
i carry this case daily and it has been through many airport <unk> it is well constructed and easy to access the sections and pockets it does open fully to lie flat to <unk> with tsa rules it is n't fancy or pretty but it is light to carry and the material is tough
very sturdy , lightweight but strong looks good and has plenty of storage inside have macbook pro and ipad -lrb- both with covers on them -rrb- inside along with power cords and other misc items have more room for a couple of magazines and other small items double handle or strap both are sturdy and comfortable
i wanted something that would fit my macbook pro retina and ipad along with a set of <unk> this works very well and i 'm glad i went with this bag instead of lots of others i researched
i was searching for a laptop case with space for books or papers , agenda etc . this is good buy for the money , looks good and have a lot of extra space
i like this case a lot it fits under the seat in a plane , and if i put it longways under the seat , it still leaves room for my feet next to it definitely important on long plane rides it holds a lot but it 's slim seems well made
this is a great buy roomy , light and stylish bag has become my constant companion at work convenient departments , comfortable shoulder strap , adjusted balance while wearing the handles sufficient number of pockets and compartments recommend to buy
this bag is great for the price it 's a little bulky but that 's because of the three large storage compartments and two outer pockets exactly what i was looking for i have a lenovo yoga and it fits perfectly in the center compartment i use one large side compartment for storing folders and papers the other large compartment could hold an additional ultrabook or a tablet
i thought this was a really nice , high-quality product -- that is , until it took a fall i dropped it from the about # feet up , and it not only broke the zipper , but also the casing of my chromebook now i 'm not only out a case due to the completely <unk> zipper , but my laptop is broken to all h *** way to go , roocase you really screwed me over on this one
the case is a quality product , but both of the ones i bought , the zippers broke within # weeks of use by my middle schoolers admittedly they may not be easy on things , but two weeks the vendor did replace the first one that broke the first week i have not bothered to try to get a return on the second one otherwise it would be a nice case
the front pocket is advertised as being big enough to hold power cords and whatnot while this is technically true , i find that it does n't fit them very well it 's good for usb sticks and whatnot , though
comes from the lack of protection on the bottom of the case , otherwise i would say i love it i like the styling and the protection it provides but how hard would it have been to put the bubbles on the bottom of the case too
<unk> how you put this into the sleeve , so it doesnt <unk> out however this has enough cushion so if <unk> it or hit it on a wall you dont have to worry
... for my acer chromebook i wanted to use a nice leather messenger bag as my laptop bag , but it did n't have the <unk> laptop sleeve that most messenger bags come with these days this sleeve is great it 's slim and slides into my bag easily and because is zips completely closed , it keeps out the gunk that tends to collect in the bottom of my messenger the front accessory pocket it pretty small , but the neoprene stretches a lot and i can fit my charger and have room for a small wireless mouse
it is perfect for the # . # & # # ; samsung chromebook it fits perfectly the side pocket even has room for my ms arc touch mouse and my nexus # in a <unk> tpu case
pretty solid case the inside 's firm but soft i 'm confident that my laptop will be safe in this the chromebook fits snug the zippers have a nice grip and the case looks nice overall i recommend this to anyone that needs protection for their # . # & # # ; netbook/laptop :
i purchased several covers for my students ' samsung # chromebooks this case is the best of the bunch it fits snugly -lrb- even with a protective plastic case -rrb- the zip pocket is stretchy enough to hold the charger definitely the best case i 've seen so far for this chromebook i recommended it to all the parents
i got the new acer chromebook so naturally i needed a case after looking as hundreds of different cases i decided to purchase the roocase super bubble neoprene sleeve case this case is absolutely perfect and exceeded my expectations the price is very reasonable it is not bulky which allows for easy carrying & / or travel the bubble inside gives excellent protection the front pocket is big enough to hold a charger and mouse i have been extremely satisfied with this roocase and highly recommend it for those who what a great , inexpensive , practical case
this case is very attractive -lrb- which is important to my # year old -rrb- and is tough enough to take her chromebook through a full day at school and home again in the backpack
i have the samsung # . # & # # ; chromebook and this thing works great for it i 'm able to store the complete power supply as well as a full size wireless mouse in the case the case interior is padded well for a sleeve style case , in my opinion it 's thin and i have n't a problem with it yet bought it over a month ago , if not longer , use it almost every day
love my chromebook neoprene sleeve the sleeve is exactly like the photo , fits the chromebook perfectly , and has the ability to keep charger and any extras in the zippered outside compartment i 'm confident that it keeps my chromebook protected when i carry it
i got this case for my new chrome book and it just came today and i love it it 's brand new and has a second pocket great for holding a charger or kindle i opened my case and got my chrome book and as i looked at the case i was afraid the case would be too small but i tried it and it fit perfectly any bigger and i would be out of luck thanks to seller i would definitely -lsb- recommend this to chrome book owners b # ll # <unk> samsung chromebook -lrb- wi-fi , # . # -inch -rrb- -rsb-
i use this for my new acer chromebook and it fits like a glove i also have my headphones and kindle in the front pouch and it does n't feel too full and is n't be stretched perfect case for the acer chromebook
this is exactly what i wanted i have the samsung # . # chromebook and it fits perfectly i was a little concerned that the small & # # ; pouch & # # ; for accessories would n't hold the adapter/charger and a small mouse but it does and they fit perfectly as well the case seems to be constructed well and i am very pleased with this purchase it actually exceeded my expectations
i bought this to take my chromebook to school it used to get scratched up in my backpack it is a great case with lots of cushion i ca n't say one bad thing about it
i keep my samsung note tab in a regular case for everyday use but for traveling i like to have something that zips closed for maximum screen protection this case is of good <unk> and not a fancy design but still attractive quality <unk> appears good : no loose strings , zipper works well it holds my samsung note # . # tablet in a thin leather case with about a half inch on each side and about an inch on top to spare a <unk> fit but easy to take in and out the outside pocket is generous without adding too much bulk
my chromebook fits in here perfectly used it when i traveled on plane and fits well in carry on also protects my chromebook very well very nice product and well worth the money
could n't be happier case is sharp neon colored and works fantastic to protect my samsung ativ smart pc at home and on the go front pocket deep enough to carry my bluetooth mouse as well
we purchased the <unk> mcover hard shell case for my son 's chromebook even though it is very protected , we wanted to get & # # ; extra & # # ; protection for his notebook he loves it i love the extra bubble cushion and he loves the color and the additional outside pocket well worth it when you have an # year old trying to take care of a notebook for school
these sleeves work great for the acer chromebooks issued by our school district kids were given dorky <unk> bags for their chromebooks , but these sleeves can be slipped right into the backpack and add good protection against being crushed by text books
it is a perfect fit for my macbook pro # & # # ; the leather part had a scratch on it which was a bummer but i know there will be plenty more of those to come with general use the <unk> fold built in for angling the laptop also a great feature for when you are not home and need to get good typing angles
the straps on the inside hardly touch my # `` macbook pro without setting up the triangle stand on the bottom , but it 's really nice , and good quality outside of the advertised fit
i bought this recently for my macbook pro # & # # ; it fits wonderfully i do n't carry my # & # # ; around , so it 's quite stationary the case itself hold my laptop into place quite nicely there is also a horizontal bar on the bottom of the case , so my laptop will not slip down overall , it 's a good deal
i was not impressed at all the way it 's designed makes it tight to put anything in i had a swiss pack and i think i am going to go back to swiss
i bought this bag for my husband who carries a few items around , including a macbook , his phone , some accessories and some other paper items i will say that he carries a few things that make it feel pretty heavy - so after a few uses it ripped on the side in any case , it 's a good looking bag and if you plan to not put too many things in it , it should last if you plan to stuff it with lots of heavy paper and computer like my husband , do n't buy it again , i also will say it is a good-looking bag with a few handy storage areas ... until it rips
it has the outward appearance of a messenger type bag , but the interior is disappointing the laptop sleeve functions well enough , but there really are n't enough pockets / organizers to be useful perhaps it 's that the pockets are n't properly sized / placed for example , the `` tablet `` sleeve fits an ipad , but not if it 's in a case <unk> for the phone sleeve the way the pockets are arranged , it 's really hard to access them when holding the bag you need to set it down in order to get your things out finally , the waterbottle sleeve is not well built when i zipped a water bottle inside the pocket , it split the seams i was hopeful for this design but it just does n't perform as well as a standard <unk> backpack
i love the design i <unk> it though because it was n't as streamlined or padded as the <unk> bag i ordered that cost more this bag is great <unk> but the laptop holder was a little flimsy and not a tight fit not as padded either but i <unk> do n't care about that and want a very good looking bag , get this looks better in person than in this pic
i was looking for a lightweight laptop backpack with water <unk> it is a bit too big for my # & # # ; laptop but it is still ok i can put other stuffs in it
it stands out vs. other backpacks it can be worn tightly against the body for the streamline look inside sleeve for laptop is a bit loose and thus not wrapping around the laptop nicely ; there is no bottom support for laptop sleeve either side vertical -lrb- & # # ; water bottle & # # ; -rrb- pocket is too small ; inside lining was torn apart after <unk> use the backpack is though functional and looks good wearing it , thus the # stars
after just a few weeks of use , the flimsy vinyl pockets tear apart at the seams - unless one uses extreme care when inserting or removing memory cards this is the same problem one often <unk> in the vinyl sleeves used in many otherwise fine wallets sold today p.s . i have decided that for my needs , the following alternative should work well for organizing and labeling my large collection of memory cards . -lsb- asin b # he # y <unk> # compartment memory card organizer -rsb-
so , the idea of this seemed great to me and it was pretty inexpensive but i guess i got what i paid for the cheap plastic pockets inside rip at the seams as soon as you try to put in or take out a memory card every pocket in this thing that i 've tried is now ripped at the seam
the zipper will not stay closed all the time i zip it and it looks like it is closed when i pick it up it opens but the zipper pull is still in the closed spot need a better zipper case is not worth anything to me if it does not stay closed
i suppose this is a case of getting what you pay for these are decent sized and good looking memory card cases , but almost immediately one of the plastic sheets had the seam rip as i was trying to put a memory card into the slot there are a lot of slots , so i will keep using it until they 're all torn and it is no longer functional , but the quality is lacking if you 're looking for a <unk> use , low cost option , this is probably a good choice if you 're looking for a higher quality case that you 're going to keep a while and use often , you should probably keep looking
ultimately the case is <unk> it does the job -lrb- hold cards -rrb- however it 's kind of a pain to get cards in and out and it does n't really protect them i would n't buy it again
i thought i 'd be able to fit the cards in their small cases into the plastic pages that is not how this case works you have to just put the cards in the slots personally i 'm not okay with that sand or dirt could get in there and mar the surface of the contacts i 'll be looking for another holder for my memory cards had a feeling it was to cheap to be good i should have listened to my gut
cards held with opening facing the <unk> ; so hard to get in or out , but will easily slip out while <unk> is hard , and the pockets are only on one
i really do not like it the zip is not smooth at all and the case has a strong smell which makes me feel sick i 'm not sure if it can protect my cards anyway , it is cheap i should not expect to much , while last time i bought a case for my portable hard drive , it cost me only $ # at that time on amazon , and it is really good the only good thing is that a cleaning cloth is included , but i do n't know why they make such kind of <unk>
i like the size , shape and basic outer case design of this black memory card carrying case however , i find that the plastic insert -lrb- where the disks are placed -rrb- has a bad smell i have been trying to air it out for over a week but still smells
i received this to keep track of my sd cards and was displeased to find that the plastic pockets that hold the cards are very cheap the ones on the ends of the <unk> sleeves have been ripping open and are rendered useless the outside nylon and zipper are nice , but cards falling out of the plastic just is n't worth it i 'd say spend a little more money and get the next step up
the item looks vey nice on line but when you actually get it it is way too small the slots inside for the sd cards are so small ive ripped # already i would return it for my money back but the shipping will cost as much as the item itself definitely would not recommend this product
i am finding that the little envelopes are tearing i have to rip them completely off to avoid accidentally losing a card it 's a great tool for <unk> cards in my game cameras out in the field
i was disappointed that this case is quite flimsy i was hoping to store the sd cards in the slots , but i keep them in the little plastic boxes and put them in this case so it only holds three that way
