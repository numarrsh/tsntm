it fits my mpb retina perfectly ! ! the foam circles at the bottom seem a bit cheap , but i 'm sure i can find something to replace it once it falls off
i love these cases and have multiple colors to fit my mood or look of the day it is a nice bright pink and very cheery looking easy to put on and take off
do n't pay any attention to the people on here that say that this cover does n't fit they 're obviously trying to put this on a regular macbook pro , not the retina display one the dimensions between the two laptops are different and the add very clearly states that this is for the retina display macbook pro # `` it fits beautifully -lrb- just put it on -rrb- and looks nice great price , and now i do n't have to worry about scratching up my laptop
i do n't know what these other people are complaining about , it was exactly what i expected of course the case is n't see-through , it says frosted in the title and this is for the # `` mac book pro retina , which is a different shape from the regular mac book pro and probably why it did n't fit for other people it 's that soft , smooth , rubbery texture instead of shiny , but still hard plastic even though it 's frosty , you can still see the apple light through the case was a little hard to snap on , but once you get it on , it looks great
after one afternoon of use the seams for the shoulder strap began to rip that same day i also noticed that the seam on one of the front pockets was coming undone it has now been # weeks and the shoulder strap has nearly ripped off the bag is now unusable the style of the bag is nice and it is very functional , however i can not get past the shoddy craftsmanship this bag could have earned # stars , but alas it only got # fix the craftsmanship and the bag would be very nice
i was very satisfied with this bag until the fabric loop that the shoulder strap attaches to ripped off just a few months after purchase -lrb- and also just a few days outside of my return window with amazon -rrb- i 'll have it repaired , but i was definitely not expecting this from normal use after so short a time i 've also been using the bag with a # & # # ; macbook air rather than a macbook pro , so it was carrying a lighter load than it might have been otherwise , i appreciate the bag 's qualities , particularly the outside kindle pocket i 'm able to keep my kindle in a cover and it still fits my macbook air can slide around quite a bit inside , but i still feel it 's well protected by the padding of the interior pocket i would have given this item a higher rating if the fabric loop had n't torn
looking for something light weight , simple , and with some protection for an <unk> this bag fit the bill pretty well put together and easy to see from a distance i buy another one
i got this for myself for work and i use it every day love the pockets that it comes with and it 's just the perfect size later on i got another one for my girlfriend
bought this a christmas gift for my daughter-in-law she has a # & # # ; macbook and this case looked like it would be perfect and it was she loved it and especially loved the outside pockets there is one that makes for a handy access to her cell phone
there are spaces between the laptop and the cover so everything go between them and i should adjust it every # minutes . easy to break i did n't like it bad
fun color and the price was right but the quality is lacking the corners started to crack the first month by month two , all four corners were cracked and , it was n't under particularly hard usage is it still keeping the laptop from getting scratched is it still attractive
the case arrived quickly and contained a bonus ... blue <unk> and little <unk> cloth thing ok , why not it was super easy to assemble , just clean the computer and snap on the case the color is more of a <unk> , not as bright and <unk> as <unk> , but still looks nice my only real complaint is that the case makes the computer seemingly twice as heavy and is slightly loose on the bottom i 'll deal it 's a good case for the price
i love this cover , the color is beautiful i love the soft touch to it , when i bought it i did n't know it was soft hard shell the only thing i do n't like about this cover is that you can see fingerprints on it well something like fingerprints , i 'm not sure what is it but when it arrived it already had this weird marks on the cover i also like how the apple is carved out on the case . and its exactly where it should be
i like this case it def has enough ventilation as the bottom and secures to the computer nicely the only reason it is n't a # star is it seems to really increase the weight of the computer might just be in my head though
took a while to get this must 've been lost in the mail i let the seller know and they gave me the option of a refund or resend i still wanted the product and they sent it out immediately it 's a great color and very sturdy people compliment it all the time i know it sounds strange but i 'm a teacher so we have our laptops out in meetings all the time
the organization of the bag is great the bag is built <unk> to protect your equipment however , the straps are set apart a bit and are too long i have adjusted the straps to be as short as possible , but the material used for the adjustable part of the strap is slippery and allows the straps to `` grow `` or lengthen as you use the bag the bag is fantastic for going through security at the airport as i no longer have to take my laptop out but the fact that i am continually readjust the straps to shorten them is annoying even at the shortest length -lrb- as there they adjust a couple of inches -rrb- , the bag still falls low on my back the straps are also very far apart so while the bag protects the computer well , it is not comfortable to carry or functional as a
straps need to have a non-slip surface it is impossible to carry this bag over the shoulder without it slipping this is a very poor design for such a well made product . i 'm very disappointed
the design of this bag is very well thought out , from the lining to the location of the pockets where it falls short is that the straps are too short i am # ' # & # # ; , # lbs and i feel like i am in <unk> <unk> when i try to put it on once on i can deal with it -lrb- although i would not want to walk far with the bag sitting so high on my back -rrb- others have mentioned this and i should have taken heed i will continue to use the bag , but do not recommend it to anyone over # ' # & # # ; # lbs
built well and has all the pockets you will need however the straps and the overall size of the bag is small i am # ' # & # # ; and the bag rides extremely high on my back the straps expand however it does nothing for the comfort when wearing for any extended time
this one of the best thought out products i have ever purchased the inside is well organized and has easy to zipper pockets for frequently used items the only two items that would make this better are # -rrb- the shoulder straps need to be easier to adjust once it is on your back i have big shoulders so i need to open them up all the way but then tightening them is almost impossible # -rrb- the luggage <unk> pocket is a rather tight when putting the backpack over a handle it is good that the backpack will not move around but perhaps this will loosen up with time
durable , functional and nicely stylish some of the zipper pockets not actually roomy enough to be very useful , but minor issue after lots of research have n't found a better bag
i could not give it # -stars because of the price tag also , the main compartment is tiny so if you are going to be gone more than # days , i do n't see how you could use this as your only means to pack but , with all that being said , it has met my needs i 'm in an airport # times a month , so the computer compartment is money i also pack my kindle , ipad and personal computer along with chargers and phone cords love the sunglass case i also use that to hold my phone charger along with aux cord for my rental car and car phone charger i have had the bag now for almost a year and it still looks brand new extremely sturdy , you get what you pay for
my only real complaint about this backpack is that the shoulder straps are a bit small for someone with broad shoulders other than that its great and has really good build quality
i rarely use this as a backpack , but it is still my favorite computer bag the handle pass through to ride on top of a suitcase is very nice to have
this bag is an evolution take most of the travel <unk> out there and then <unk> the features and you have this bag its not just the major features , but the little behind the zipper thinking as well there are two separate top accessible zippered compartments , one for your cell phone and wallet when going through security , and the other with a semi-hard shell to keep your sunglasses from getting crushed the side pockets are not just longer , but they have added in things like a elastic strap to keep your bottle snug around the top , as well as a place to put your keys of special note , from my perspective , this is a check-point friendly bag , so it splits open everki thought this through and included two handles that are well built so that if you wish to tie back in the shoulder straps you can use this as just a carry bag without straps flying around speaking of straps flying around , they have contained the straps so that you dont have extra flying around , which makes this a much nicer and more executive feeling bag i have had this for a month now and on several flights , it still gets high marks from me i bought the tumi <unk> , which is a nice looking bag , but it is just too small and doesnt have as much going for it as this bag does
this is a great backpack i used it for two trips so far and it worked great i packed my dslr in a soft case , my macbook air , kindle , noise cancelling earphones in a hard case , some papers , a bunch of wires and charges and some other stuff as well everything was well organized inside , easy to reach , nothing got damaged , and the checkpoint friendly feature really worked the backpack looks professional and is very comfortable to wear i highly recommend it
this bag has replaced two bags , a smaller backpack and messenger bag when i first opened the box , i thought there was no way it would replace both as i had hoped it is a perfect example of efficiency and great planning i carry ipad , laptop , very small portable printer -lrb- in the area designed for files -rrb- , all the needed cords and a few file folders the bag is completely full but not overly stuffed it zips up nicely as if it were made for my needs
i love this backpack it 's just the right size for my macbook pro enough room to also carry around my paper and supplies i also love the soft finishes inside it 's pricey , but it 's a <unk> bag
somehow a bit smaller than i thought even though it fits my # & # # ; laptop the leather is ok and the color is as expected still hope it 's somehow bigger size
i had similar handbag , but this is the best soft leather , comfortable for bearing in hand or on shoulders -lrb- on shoulder -rrb- , much the different pockets and two a big compartment drawback : handbag has <unk> of leather with different <unk> brown colour
i only thought it would be a little more rigid i 'm not talking about the quality there 's no doubt in my mind that this is absolutely # % leather i just did n't know it would be so & # # ; flexible & # # ; i guess this makes it easier to overpack which is a good thing i have no complaints it takes a few seconds to convert the bag from messenger to backpack and vice versa it 's pretty good as a business bag and as a casual bag i flip back and forth all the time and have no problems
the bag was beautiful i bought this as a gift for my son and he was impressed with its roominess and quality i can see it passed on to another generation thirty years from now
i bought this as a gift for my husband and was a little nervous about how it would look in person it looks just as good as the picture , if not better all of the pockets and different straps are a great touch it is not a huge bag but great for a laptop and a few books best part is , my husband loves it
i bought this case and placed in another case acase faux leather book cover clip on case for apple macbook air mc # ll/a and # . # -inch laptop , black -lrb- <unk> # -lrb- i really love and recommend this case by the way however , the second case does not protect the corner edges within a month , the corners of the first case have all cracked , broke or shattered i <unk> # -in- # purple rubberized hard shell case cover for # . # `` a # apple macbook air and keyboard cover -lrb- a # <unk>
this case was delivered on time but was horrible looking it came looking like it was used when i ordered it new the top cover had little smears on it that made it look dirty and it was almost impossible to get on i would not recommend this case at all
the shipping was super fast , which is the only <unk> thing i can say about this product the product <unk> is super cheap quality and it came chipped all over , specially in the corners i live outside the <unk> so i couldnt return it the case comes with a screen protector that fits -lrb- also good -rrb- and a keyboard protector that does not fit i gave this product to a friend as a present and it was the worst decision i 've ever made dont buy this product better quality at top case
it was good for about three four months , but eventually it started to break apart which pissed me off the bottom piece of the case cracked and broke so i was left only with the keyboard cover and the hard case top and of course now the top part has started to crack the keyboard cover however is okay i still use it it 's started to curl up on the sides i guess because its getting old but it has n't effected the ability to not use my key board in anywhere the purple color is pretty but after using it for a while some of the letters start to fade out but i guess i should not have expected too much being that it 's just plastic eh , no i say just splurge on a case that will keep you going long run
the case itself is nice but it was very hard to get on i felt like i was going to break my computer trying to snap the thing on once i actually got it on it looked nice and does it 's job
i was disappointed in the color of the case ... as on the photo it looks like a neon purple , which is what i was wanting , but it 's more of a pastel lavender color
i ordered along with the laptop and got it faster than expected it looks exactly like the picture it snaps on easily the key board cover fits perfectly but a few rows of keys letters do n't match up overall i 'm satisfied with my purchase
the color and case were exactly what i ordered , except the clear screen protector was very difficult to put on without bubbles -lrb- perhaps there is a trick i do n't know ? -rrb- and , a big thing : the hard case was broken when i opened it the bottom back of the hard case , to be specific , was chipped in a very obvious manner , and i could not find the pieces in the mail at all it did however still fit , and i ended up not using the screen protector at all
it fits well , but i also have a plastic case on the laptop and the corners are cracked maybe the plastic case is bad quality , or this sleeve does not offer much protection it has a strong , weird smell when it 's brand new it goes away after a few washes
i bought this actually for my ipad # it 's a bit too large for it but it does protect it well so it works out the big problem is the smell i read it on a early review that another buyer had the same problem but i decided to try it anyway the smell is disgusting and very strong i tries baking soda , even tea tree oil they helped but i still cant get rid of the smell completely
the smell wanted to make me <unk> , legit ! the product in itself was a little less than ok , that smell would n't go away and it made my computer smell , . .
i knew what i was getting into from the reviews on how this case stains easily never realized how dirty my hands were till now but the color is great and it 's fast to tuck away the computer overall i like it , it was cheap enough that i wanted it despite the reviews
its a little snug for my macbook air # inch but thats my fault for not reading the description properly im very glad it stretches or else it would n't fit
i only rated this three stars b/c i feel like it is too light and attracts dirt also it feels like it is not protective enough , i will eventually get something more protective
it 's cute and keeps the computer safe but it gets really annoying to put it in i have to stretch the case to get my book in and wrestle with it to get it back out other than that the product is good
ordered and received this product within days ordered it for my chromebook # to keep it protected when i was n't using it thin padding but fits my chromebook perfectly convenient to slip into my bag
you get what you pay for simple neoprene sleeve i would have liked a more snug fit it wo n't fall off but i like the tighter fit for how rarely i 'll use it , it will suit my needs and i 'm glad i did n't pay more nice color too had a funny smell when it arrived but that will go away
the case fits really nicely and has such a cute color , but the case stains so easily on almost nothing at all if it was a little easier to clean it would have been # stars
i ordered this case for my mac air , and it fits perfectly and is a great color however it does show dirt and is sometimes hard to keep clean but for the most part it protects my mac and keeps me from breaking it which i have a tendency to do when i drop things it fits perfectly in my bag for school and is overall exactly what i needed i would just order it in another color next time
the case is pretty good , nice color , just like the photo it does get dirty easily , but that could just be because i use it all the time only reason i did n't give five stars is because it 's a little large , occasionally makes me nervous about it slipping and sliding
i especially love the color it fits snug around my macbook air # -inch even with a shell on when i first received it , it had a chemically smell that i could not stand but after watching it in the laundry and letting it air dry , it was n't a problem
this sleeve is good protection for the computer if you are putting it in a bag or backpack i wish it had a handle for carrying alone and a pocket for the charger
it 's exactly as it looks it fits my mac air perfectly pretty color and good material since it 's light it can get dirty , but it can be reversed to use the black on the inside if you really need
fits my # inch mac air -lrb- purchased # -rrb- perfectly slides in and out easily no zippers or other pointy parts to nick the inside of my leather bag so i like this very much we 'll see how it wears i 've had it for a month now and am happy
this case and screen protector did not fit y # & # # ; macbook pro when i saw it does n't fit and tried to return it , the return price was almost as much as what i paid for it so i just kept it the keyboard fit fine and i still use the bag because the color is light , it stains easily do n't bother getting it because it does n't fit
i ordered this item for my brand new macbook pro- when it came it clearly did not fit the computer at all i contacted amazon and was put in touch with topcase they responded to my request to return the items by <unk> me as to why it did not fit the computer and demanding photos of me trying to put the case on the computer when i told them that there was no damage to the items , i simply wished to return them without being questioned as to why they refused to answer any further emails from me i had to call amazon again to make sure they approved my request to return the items it then took them over # month to issue my refund totally not worth all the hassle and dealing with the rude staff at topcase
i should have read the reviews on this product before i bought it , and not after i was hoping i would be one of the lucky ones , who got a case that fit & did n't smell i was not lucky i loved the color of the case , but the loved stopped there the bag stinks , and i could n't even handle it the shell case was far to big , thus pointless do not buy this product ! ! the price is good , but if you 're like me , you 'll just throw it back in it 's delivery bag , and never use it because it stinks too badly to want to
i do n't know if their cases are n't updated with the most current laptops sizes but i bought a case for my macbook pro # & # # ; it did not fit to return it i had to pay for the shopping to return it it would have been better for me to just keep the case instead of paying for shipping twice and so far it is taking a while to get a refund on the case i wo n't buy from them again
this case does not fit the macbook pro # inch it is way too big and falls off i was very disappointed if you are looking for a great case check out ipearl
the case does n't fit my mac book # inch there is at <unk> a # inch gap when i place the computer in it , making it worthless i am returning this product also very cheaply made
the dimensions on this product are completely off i have a # & # # ; macbook pro and this case leaves an extra centimeter on the sides , meaning that the case ca n't properly stay on the computer
i got this product for my birthday and when i opened it i was so excited but , when i tried to put everything on my computer it was way too big i love the color but the products do n't fit i am very upset
due to so many people saying this was a tight fitting case , i was surprised to find it was slightly loose also , the smell is overwhelming it took two days of airing it out to find out it did n't fit
the colour is great the smell not good . it smells like strong paint was expecting it without a bad chemical smell the bottom actually is open on the back so it does slide off . did not expect that either overall its ok and the sleeve stinks terribly - i am letting it & # # ; breathe & # # ; to see if the smell goes away
color was exactly like the photo , but to bad i was missing what i really wanted - the sleeve and the screen protector ! and what i did get was too big ! go figure
the case barely grips the computer <unk> yes i did check the serial number and it was the right one the worst part of this product was the fact that it gets so dirty so fast i 've tried cleaning it with baby wipes , a soft cloth , cleaner , etc . and nothing takes the dirt off - overall not pleased at all
the color was nice , but the case does n't fit the newest macbook pro # & # # ; size it was slightly bigger and would not snap into place it was also not translucent as the photo implies
i love the color of this case i was very excited to see how perfect the case fit my # macbook pro . sadly its only been a month or so and two corners are cracking im not very rough with my computer and it is almost always in or on the laptop sleeve the corners look like they are going to continue to chip , so i will soon have to get another case . so sad i really loved the look and feel
overall okay purchase not too expensive but the quality gives reason for that i love the color , and everything is fine but the case does n't fit my computer properly it wo n't snap on in some places but the case will still stay on the computer also , i 've had it a couple weeks now and the top coat of the case is already chipping off on the corners , but it 's not that noticeable the keyboard cover does what it says , no complaints about that
the hard cover fits my macbook pro # & # # ; well the neoprene fits , the screen protector was impossible for me to put on to satisfy my ocd i could not get the air bubbles out the only part i really was disappointed with was the silicon keyboard cover it just generally did n't fit and kept popping up of the computer i just threw it out
i absolutely loved this case for my laptop : it fit well and was a great color the only downside that i 've found is that after having it for a few months the corners have started to crumble and crack and pieces keep falling off
i really loved the case when i got it about a month ago however now its cracking at the corners would definitely suggest buying a higher quality case im going to
i only use the hard case cover , it was very hard to put on at the beginning . but after it 's on , it works fine the color makes me happy . keyboard cover it 's a bit annoying so i did n't use it . i also find the soft bag <unk> i use it to protect my other electronic stuff . oh i forgot about the screen protector , they works well
<unk> reviews that say this product does not fit i 'd bet money that those reviewers did n't check their macbook 's serial number -lrb- a # , location to find this shown in the product pictures -rrb- before buying this bundle it fits perfectly , and it is gorgeous the products do have a very chemical scent , but i hope these go away over time i just got these in the mail , so i have n't had them long enough to review durability i will update my review in a few months to review how they have held up
this case is not the most ideal case that i would have preferred but considering the cost it works great the hard shell fits my computer perfectly but the keypad cover does not fit very well and it makes it hard to type sometimes i still rated the item very well because the keypad does not necessarily bother me very much because the outside cover does the job very well i think the price is very reasonable and the fact that everything came together already matching was great because i did not have to buy several packages also the color is very cute and i believe that most girls would use this case besides fixing the keypad a little bit i would say the only other thing that i would like is if the soft cover matches a little bit more overall though i really like this product and would recommend it for other people looking for a case
for the price of this package it 's totally worth it the keyboard cover , laptop bag , and hard case are magnificent the screen protector drove me crazy because of all the little bubbles caught under it and i ended up not using it my <unk> is partially why it did n't work , but i strongly recommend this product
i love it my only complaint is that the neoprene case was n't a zip-up i think the current style will get stretched out very easily oh , one more -- the screen protector didnt fit , and it made my <unk> screen reflective , so i did n't end using it otherwise , i love the cover and the keyboard protector , and the case is really pretty what 's neat about the case is if you turn it inside out , it 's like a case of a different color instead of the seam being all ugly on the inside , like in clothes , it looks just like it does on the outside it 's like getting two cases
loved the case - both front and back however , the rubber mat slides around on the keys and is very flimsy very easy to clean - simply <unk> a microfiber cloth or rag with <unk> alcohol and gently wipe the case , keyboard screen , and keys rubber keyboard cover can be washed with soap and water - just be sure to dry thoroughly before putting back on keyboard
my boyfriend got this kit for me for my birthday last april i love this case a lot , it is super sturdy , super colorful and cute , and it fits great on my laptop i gave it four stars because within a few months one part on the bottom cracked a little bit , but not too much to need to get a new one also within the kit it says it comes with a free mouse pad , but do n't count on that because it 's super cheap and not good at all i 've had no issues with the cover bag and the keyboard cover overall this was a great buy and it was a great gift
the case is perfect i love the tiffany blue color and the finish is really nice and wo n't show any scrapes or knicks i have a few dents and scratches on my silver macbook and i love that the case is opaque enough so that you ca n't see mine but the apple logo still shines through it 's a great fit too is very secure around the laptop as for the sleeve , it does have a strong odor like i 've read in the other reviews but it does go away after some airing out i have n't used the screen protector and i 'm not a huge fan of the keyboard cover but those are nice to have the fact is i bought this & # # ; bundle & # # ; for the case itself and i would pay this price to have just the case because i love it so much
love the color , true to specs listed , very speedy at receiving most importantly i was afraid it would cause my computer to get hot and <unk> like another plastic one i tried , it did not and still exceeds my expectations the only thing was that the soft case smelt a little funky but nothing airing out did n't fix ! ! : -rrb- thanks i love it ! !
i accidentally ordered the wrong size for my computer , so i was lucky to be able to send the package back -lrb- unused and unopened -rrb- for a free exchange to the right size the case looks great , works well , is reasonably priced and you get a bunch of extras to protect your computer
the case fits perfectly around my macbook pro , no problems the color is my favorite and is soft compared to a hard plastic which is what i previously had the sleeve fits beautifully too the screen protector is great since i 'll be doing a lot of traveling and do n't want any scratches to arise the only downside is the keyboard cover it does n't lie flat on my keyboard -lrb- some areas wrinkle -rrb- and it 's hard to type while it 's on for daily internet use it 's fine but if i were typing a report , i 'd have to take it off ; you have to push hard on the keys for the letter to appear overall , i would order this product again and recommend it to others it 's a great deal , color , and quality also , i received it only # days after ordering it so that was a bonus
i bought this because it was a bundled deal and was cheaper than buying pieces separately i love the snap on case , it fits amazingly and <unk> great the screen protector was hard to get on , as i expected the keyboard protector works just fine the only bummer about this package is the soft case , but i knew that i probably would n't like it when i purchased it i find the folding flap too inconvenient to constantly take my computer in and out of the case
the product is a really lovely color i like the texture of the material for the case , it is smooth but not slippery i attempted to use the keyboard cover for awhile but it just felt strange buy this product for the case and sleeve , not the keyboard cover
i chose # stars because i love the fact that i received exactly what i ordered -- everything fits like a glove & it is a steal for the price i have a # -inch macbook pro & it 's been difficult to find cases that will fit the laptop at an affordable price the color is just as depicted on screen & the laptop -lrb- with the case on -rrb- fits inside of the sleeve very snuggly i 'd definitely recommend topcase & only request that more colors become available for the # -inch mp
<unk> , i love this entire package i honestly only wanted the little slip cover , but the snap on case and keyboard cover are awesome too i did n't use the screen protector , since i figured i 'd probably screw it up anyways it was also shipped super quick
not only was the product amazing and my wife was very happy with it the customer service could n't have been better they really did amazing to help me get the right size for my mac book i will be using them again and again for my apple products :
this is a great deal for everything included i love the color and how it protects my laptop it fits a macbook pro # inch perfectly the keyboard cover was n't specifically designed for the mac as it has a couple different keys , but it fits over it perfectly and i never use those # or # keys anyway
i 've been looking for a hardcase and silicone keyboard cover for a while , but did n't want to spend a lot on either this bundle is inexpensive and wonderful - especially since it came with the <unk> as well everything fits perfectly , and it does n't seem to be made poorly i told a few of my friends to buy this brand as well - they were all asking where i got it for so cheap -lrb-
i was kinda on the fence about purchasing this product due to mixed reviews do not believe the negative reviews this is a great product the hard case went on very simply and is very secure , the soft case does have a slight smell , but it is not bad and i am sure a spin through the wash would remove it completely also tell me were you can get a neoprene case with out a hint of the smell that always comes with it the soft case also goes on smoothly , i had no trouble getting either case on at all the key and screen protector is also wonderful the color is so pretty too its the blue like the tiffany jewelry company could n't be happier
i had a different type of case for my laptop that was much more expensive but it broke when i saw this online i could n't believe the price and assumed i would be getting a lower quality but figured i would buy it anyways and try it out the case is amazing it has a seamless fit that i dont think will break i love the color too the keyboard cover is different then i am use to because i have never had one but i think i will get use to it and eventually like it i like the soft sleeve also , it is a tight enough fit that i can still use it in my backpack the only bad thing i have to say is the lcd screen protector does n't fit quiet as nicely as i would have liked , the whole for the camera does n't line up quiet right but it will still works overall i am very pleased with this purchase and would recommend it to anyone , it is a great quality for the price
exactly what i wanted and super cheap i kept reading reviews on how the case smelled but it doesnt have a gross smell , and the smell it did have went away within a day of unpacking it really fast shipping as well i received it # days after ordering
case chipped easier than i expected but still good quality enjoyed the case and cover that came with it , but the screen protector was n't necessary and would n't recommend for those with the retina screen
ordered the wrong item and they were so patient and courteous in getting me the right case really great price and so far great considering how much my laptop gets banged on nearby items really great protection love the pouch
i ca n't believe the value on this macbook cover same thing in the apple store would have run well over $ # and my wife loves it on her computer it took about # seconds to install it great product at a <unk> good price
this was a great deal i had been putting off buying a cover for my mac but i 'm so glad i finally did the cover does n't make my laptop weigh much more and i love the <unk> of it ... perfect fit
