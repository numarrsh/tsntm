this was exactly what i was looking for to protect my laptop it 's a snug fit for the # `` apple macbook pro , but still fits , and snug is not a bad thing when protecting electronics i love the colors , very fun ! : -- rrb- i typically carry my laptop in my backpack , and this case will ensure extra protection if my bag gets bumped or set down just a little too carelessly highly recommend this product
i love this laptop sleeve it provides a nice cushion but is n't bulky the colors are slightly different then they appeared , but that was to be expected as it would depend on your monitor settings it fits my macbook pro perfectly and i have gotten a lot of compliments on it
i have had built ny sleeves in the past and they are by far the best on the market i have a # . # `` laptop and this case fits like a glove it is slim enough to allow me to slide it in my messenger bag great product , great price and super fast shipping thanks so much ! !
i think this was made for macs - fits my macbook pro # `` absolutely perfectly just snug enough and no struggle inserting stylish and hip says you 're one of the fun ones
i bought the sleeve for my macbook , and it fits perfectly , kind of a sleek-looking thing i needed something that protects the laptop from getting scratched when i put it in the carry-all with all my other electronic <unk> , and it does that but , i discovered target has something similar -lrb- not in cool red -rrb- with a handle and side pocket for $ # less
this looks sharp - a water resistant neoprene black zipper sleeve holds my laptop snug and matches my black macbook my current laptop bag had a # `` sleeve , which was too roomy , and my macbook slid around inside the sleeve nylon zipper has an inner lining that protects the laptop from <unk> against the teeth of the laptop this sleeve is handy for carrying around the laptop on its own too bad there 's no pocket for the charger great deal on amazon , price was a factor in my selection i would have liked the sleeve to have a black zipper instead of gray for a uniform look also , the sleeve is labelled with `` polycarbonate `` and `` tucano second skin folder `` on the other side , which does n't show in the image on amazon
this sleeve is a good value for money product my # `` mbp fits in perfectly i like the inner sleeve which kind of keeps mbp fix inside however , i feel the sleeve has less cushion compared to some other ones available
i liked this sleeve since the first time i saw it on amazon it does the job , but it 's not that pretty it protects my macbook pro # `` perfectly , specially the <unk> inside it i <unk> say that is a basic sleeve and for being that basic , the price is a little expensive -lrb- just a little -rrb-
this sleeve looks good and does serve its purpose the best thing i like about it it is that it fits my macbook # . # very nicely and shows its curves beautifully not <unk> the beauty of my macbook at all one grievance even though i am <unk> this product is that these tucano folks could use a better quality material to make this beauty to add to its charm , but nonetheless it is still great also tucano makes variety of products for your laptops , but they are lot more expensive so i guess you better stick with this if you do n't want to spend too much money
we had been looking for a red slip cover for a few months the apple shop could not help so we bought this cover it is perfect for what we wanted and very easy to use
the cover is perfect for scratch protection in a bookbag with other items the zipper is well designed to prevent contact with the laptop not meant for impact protection i do wish the outer cover was pure black it has mb # . # `` written in big white letters over one side and the company logo on the other
when buying a laptop sleeve i was deciding between hand made original sleeve made of fabric and neoprene sleeve and this one won i liked the looks and nature of hand made sleeve better but this is better fit for the purpose - protection for occasional travels it is robust , especially the area around the zip sometimes i miss a handle or adapter compartment but otherwise i 've been satisfied one thing to be aware of - this sleeve will not protect the laptop from sharp objects since it can be easily punctured
this case is pretty good for new mbps -lrb- old mb -rrb- it fit really well and it is stretchable which makes it easier to use it is soft and if you want to carry mbp in your hand to somewhere it is really convenient since it does not slip from your hands i only did not like the zipper color but it depends on the person
this sleeve is a great product fits like a glove and gives a nice look and great protection from bangs and scrapes love the zipper protector on the inside too , brilliant idea
this sleeve fits the # . # inch macbook perfectly its great for slipping on and throwing it in another bag without worrying about getting scratched there was a bonus about it that i had no idea as well once you slip your notebook inside , there is a small `` tuck corner `` you can encase the edges into so it will be stable hard to explain , but its simply part of the inner material that helps it stay even more stable a great buy
i just took this item to the goodwill to <unk> because i recently traded my # year old macbook in for a new macbook air i loved this sleeve and it lasted longer than my macbook did i hope it brings someone as much piece of mind as it brought me
there 's not a great deal to say about this soft , red little folder who 's only purpose is to hug your macbook when you 're not using it in short , this thing works it protects your macbook from all the scratches that might be <unk> on it while in a backpack , and does so without complaining or ever putting up a fuss on top of all of this , it manages to look , well , sexy it 's a fashionable cover for a fashionable machine , and is a great choice for all of your macbook protection needs
this is a highly recommended product it is flexible , soft , and durable to protect your precious mb i bought this item without a hesitation because i was told that this cover does very good job of <unk> mb if you own a macbook and you 're a college student like i am , this product is totally reliable to have your mb in your backpack
this case is great cases for electronics are so simple , yet there always seems to be some flaw ... not here though this case offers good protection , and does n't add to the bulk of your macbook it also has a padded flap sewn in that keeps the zipper teeth from contacting your computer -lrb- pay attention every other case manufacturer ! -rrb- it would be nice if it had handles , but as far as slim cases go , this is about as good and simple as it gets
i had a gray sleeve for my ibook and it lasted for over # years i was so impressed that i bought this tucano sleeve for my macbook it works great and i have no complaints
this product serves its purpose well in protecting your mac from getting scratches or minor damages i strongly recommend this to getting a hardshell cover that they sell for # dollars because those can scratch your mac as you put or take it off this products is well made and fits your # `` mac like a glove and is still easy to pull your mac in and out the price is perfect and the manufacturer sends it efficiently and quick completely worth the investment
i have never ever seen a better laptop sleeve than this one here are the key things you need to know * it 's neoprene and hugs tightly to your macbook it wo n't take up much extra space in your bag or backpack * it has these lips that you can pull over the corners of your macbook when zipping up this is the killer feature - it ensures the corners do n't get chipped -lrb- a common laptop problem -rrb- and keeps the zipper from scratching the computer * there is no room for anything else , so if you plan to lug around your charger , cds , dvds , etc . , you 'll need another bag for it
the internal flap makes sure your mac will not slip out when you unzip your sleeve it does n't have a handle , but that 's what i like about it great product for the price
what you get is what you see the case is durable and provides protection from what you would expect -lrb- scratches and <unk> -rrb- obviously do n't expect to be able to drop it on the floor and still not have any damage the case provides prefect cosmetic protection for mac books
as others have mentioned , this case gives a perfect fit for a # `` macbook its well made and gives enough cushioning for when you want to carry your laptop in regular backpack or shoulder bag with this case , i can also put my macbook inside the camera compartment of my lowepro flipside # camera bag , eliminating the need for a bag with a dedicated laptop compartment
so after i got my macbook and fell in love with it , the next thing to do was to protect the investment this sleeve is by far one of the best investments one can make the macbook is made in a handy size and this sleeve provides the perfect protection for carrying the computer without fear of scratches or nicks to be clear , this is not a hard case and will not provide armor like protection this is great for someone like me who will grab the macbook and toss it into a larger bag with other ` stuff ' that may rattle around if that sounds like you , you wo n't be disappointed
i had been using an old pc laptop case that was much too large for my # . # `` macbook before acquiring this neoprene sleeve initially , i looked into the equivalent incase product but was worried that it would stain my white macbook -lrb- as mentioned in several reviews -rrb- i purchased this neoprene sleeve instead and am very pleased no staining at all and it fits the # . # `` macbook beautifully the product does exactly what it says it does it is a snug sleeve meant to protect the outer surface of the laptop that you can then fit inside another bag those customers expecting to fit other items in the sleeve with their laptops would be defeating the purpose of this sleeve
absolutely great product very nicely made and perfect for my # . # `` macbook snug and protective inner liner fits over the laptop corners for extra security easy <unk> zippers let you select your own closing pattern a winner all the way around
a nice protection for macbook computers , i used it for protect my brand-new mb # `` , from usa to chile -lrb- latin am & eacute ; <unk> -rrb- and it was perfect protection against small impacts and water highly <unk> for carrying the laptop in another bag with <unk> , remember that is soft ! !
this laptop case was sold as ` new ' but is obviously used it is scuffed and dirty both inside and out and has very obvious multiple indentations on the inside surfaces where a previous laptop and cords sat over a long period of time perhaps it was a floor model but it was most definitely sold as new the seller is <unk> in failing to note the true condition of the case , and the only reason i did n't return it was because it was so cheap unfortunately i got exactly what i paid for
zipper broke the second time i used it and came completely off shortly after my # . # `` widescreen did not fit well inside the case , and when it was in there , there was hardly any room for my peripherals do n't waste your money on something that will not <unk> working within a couple weeks
this bag serves its purpose , it holds my notebook , it keeps it from burning my legs , and i can store my cords and what not in it but , and this is a big one ... the first day that i got it the zipper was giving me trouble it would snag on the fabric making it impossible to zip all the way without it either breaking the zipper open or making it impossible to unzip again it was a big disappointment and no , my notebook is n't too big for it so now its impossible to close all the way because the zipper will snag on the snagged fabric
with one of these , you can keep your laptop on your lap without worrying about the side effects on your future <unk> unfortunately , belkin chose to implement this nice looking design with somewhat cheap fabric that seems to easily collect dirt the lining dividing the main compartment from the cavernous side pocket could have used some padding as it is , i am somewhat reluctant to put my bulky power supply into it the green bag is also considerably brighter in reality than in the pictures
i did love this case it was well made and had many clever pockets however , i do not think that this case was designed to hold heavier type laptops it was difficult to carry with my computer inside due to the weight of my laptop if you have a light weight computer , go for it
very happy with the product , easy to use on your lab and transport from place to place recommend for <unk> use pocket storage for your cords all in one case
i 've always been dissapointed that i could n't find a laptop case that held all of my associated junk but did n't look generic the pocket top is really a fabulous solution for me i keep my laptop in it on my desk , so when i need to just grab and go it 's only a matter of unplugging and tucking away my power cord it 's adorable and i get <unk> of compliments on it best of all i feel very confident that my laptop is well protected as it is a very sturdy case
i bought this to use with my new hp mini netbook i needed something to carry it in when i go away from my home it works great for protection for the netbook and as a compact work station i use a wireless mouse and there is just enough room on the side to move it around if needed the top compartment can hold books , the power cord and any number of items i looked at other possible products to use but this one has truely fit my needs in fact it has been so useful that i seldom take my netbook out of it
case provides excellent protection ideal for laptops that have a power cord leading from the back design is contemporary and fun pocket holds a lot , but you have to shift it around sometimes when closing the case
this is my second speck case , as i loved my first one i dropped my # inch mac book pro and that case broke -lrb- better than my mac book -rrb- anyway , the peripheral slots on the left side are perfect , but not on the right side since i do n't use the peripheral slots on the right , it 's not a big deal , but if i do need to use them , i 'd have to take the case off i purchased it for $ # . # , so i 'm ok with it , but if/when i do use the peripherals on the right side , i wo n't be happy i 'm very happy with the red color ... my last one was green and i liked that as well
i like the case ... it 's much better than having nothing on it but there is a problem all the ports on the left side of the computer fit , but not on the right side the holes do n't line up so if i need the ports on the right i have to remove the bottom half of the case it 's easy to come on and off but i 'd rather have a case that i do n't have to remove otherwise i do n't have any complaints about this case
i was worried about this case until i got it and snapped it on very simple and does what the write-up says : protects the macbook pro 's <unk> exterior and allow complete and simple access to all ports the front latch of the mbp is slightly harder to engage , but that has always been a problem for apple 's metal laptops i got a red case and i love it note that this model is for the early mbp 's only speck also makes similar cases for current model mbps and for macbooks as well
i love this case ! this case looks great and made my macbook pro standout from all the others the ventilation is n't the best on this so you have to take it off occasionally
i love this case . fits like a glove , protects from scratches and really adds a great look to my macbook pro i 'm the most anal user , but this case really does add beauty and protection to the already perfect macbook pro like the other <unk> said , this case is only for the core duo version , but i know they are making one that fits both hands down , the best laptop case i 've ever used
i bought this laptop sleeve because an earlier reviewer said it was a perfect fit for lenovo thinkpad x # he was wrong the sleeve is about # inches too wide and does not fit properly the `` patent <unk> `` <unk> shape is ugly , uncomfortable to hold , and makes the sleeve larger than necessary the material is a dust magnet and looks <unk> with <unk> particles all the time lastly , the case smells like cheap rubbery plastic as soon as you open it if you own a thinkpad x # , i definitely do not recommend this case
i bought this item with my hp pavilion tx # us notebook i thought that it will be fit in this notebook but i was wrong , this item is too small for the laptop of the amazon 's <unk> nevertheless this items seems to be a good options for laptops with the correct
i 've bought the hp pavilion tx # us # . # -inch laptop and this product , hoping it would fit the laptop perfectly -lrb- # `` sleeve for # `` laptop -rrb- but it did not in fact , the sleeve has a very good quality , but it just does n't fit i think it would be better to buy a # `` sleeve for this laptop , but i 'm not sure
i 'm really happy with this case its a great alternative to buying a whole special laptop bag , it fits in any other backpack and gives a lot of protection it fits perfectly on my # `` powerbook g #
i bought this item without looking at the dimensions - <unk> it fits snugly to my tc # and would of course fit a tc # its a must have for working in the desert -lrb- like me -rrb- where fine sand can get into your machine and cause it to overheat i am also the sort of person who throws possessions around - its thick enough to cushion light bumps other than that , it looks so good that people keep asking me where i got it from durable , competitive price , good product
i used this for about a week and it did n't do anything to my mac , but the case itself got some ugly scratches on it i treat my computer very well and the only # places it is are on my desk , my school desk or in my book bag inside a neoprene case after a week there were some bad scratches on the case and looked really bad the plastic they use to make these is really soft , so it gets scratches easily i would n't recommend buying unless you never move your mac , which defeats the purpose looks great , but only for a short time should n't be bought for protecting your mac should n't be bought at all
i just took my cover off after having it on for # weeks and it actually scratched my computer up more than it would have not having a case buying this product was a pretty bad decision i 'm so angry right now my computer was brand new ! ! now it looks like i dropped my computer on the ground and kicked it around the only good thing about this product is that it makes the computer look cool i would not recommend this item to anyone trying to keep their computer looking new
like <unk> <unk> , i was pretty surprised to receive something i did n't think i ordered not only that , but it 's <unk> and i was surprised it fit my laptop at all i 'm returning this product too the fact that it 's not speck brand needs to be way , way higher in that description , before you have to click `` > > more `` that is way <unk> business and considering two people have bought it in the past week thinking they were getting something else entirely , the seller really needs to <unk> his description
i purchased this product and did not realize it would n't fit a mac pro i have made numerous attempts to contact this seller on a possible return -lrb- case is unopened -rrb- and have not had any response i suppose customer support is not a priority for this company
the top piece fit decent - but the bottom piece was way too big - what good does it do to have it only cover one part the top does show quite a bit of smudging - and it was scratched within a week i thought it would hold up much better for the price paid
i bout this for my brand new mac book # edition . it does n't fit on newer model mac book . there is a different casing from previous models thank you god my boyfriend found some good use to it
exactly the same issue as other reviewers . . the exact thing i bought the product to prevent , has happened because of it dirt and dust gets caught between the case and the macbook - and just grinds away , leading to deep , deep scratches
i 've had this product for much over a year now but only used it for # months it scratched not only itself but my precious mac computer as well the precise reason for getting the product inevitable occurred anyway because of the product ... quite ironic right i tried to return the product and called <unk> of times but no one ever answer my call or replied to the numerous voice <unk> i left i wanted to share my awful experience with this product with potential buyers not only is it not worth the price , it 's not even worth # <unk> dollar i 've been using one i purchased from ebay for only # dollars for almost # months now and it 's perfect word to the wise : do not purchase this product ! ! ugh ! ! !
bought this for my macbook that i bought in <unk> i got the blue shell within a month the plastic became scratched everywhere this will protect your macbook , but within a few months you will needs another case i do n't suggest this product
one of the little plastic tabs that holds it on broke , and as a result it kept moving i 'm going to try something else also , the translucent nature of the cover required me to take it off every few weeks to clean off any visible nasties -lrb- just dust -- i am responsible with my things -rrb-
i just got this and attached it with no problem but when i tried to remove it to change batteries , i ca n't , not without feeling like i 'll break apart my computer or the plastic cover i 've tried moving the tabs , but this thing seems really stuck anyone have the same problems
i bought my macbook a little over a year ago i immediately purchased the case to protect it and it seemed like a great idea at first it does however create internal scratching on its own and bumpy rough scratches end up appearing on the cover if you 're willing to remove the case ever so often and wipe it down , maybe it would keep it looking better plus , removing the case is such a frustrating process i always feel like i 'm walking on <unk> . unless you 're a neat freak and could handle the pressure while opening it do n't get it
protects the macbook well no problems with dust scratches as some reviewers have reported but i kept it pretty clean returned the product because the incase cover was better - <unk> was softer to the touch and had nice cooling holes on the bottom
when i first got the cover and had it on my macbook it was fine and i loved it however , when i took the cover off i noticed that the plastic around the edges of my laptop were starting to crack i think it was from the pressure the case <unk> on the laptop the seller was awesome i got the product within the estimated shipping dates and was in perfect condition , i would not recommend this product but i would recommend this seller
i ordered this product after reading reviews on how good it is at protecting a macbook i went through all of the cleaning steps before putting it on my macbook , but even after doing that i still noticed that there were scratches on the case since i was so excited about having it i put it on anyways , thinking that it was just my imagination not only were there scratches on the cover , but it scratched my macbook too it is possible that it could have just been the retailer i ordered it from , but i would strongly advise thinking about whether you really need it before buying it
the product does n't look like the picture the actual product look like something from a barbie warehouse the apple light at the <unk> surface of the laptop is basically blocked -lrb- they should 've cut the apple outline out -rrb- also , the top cover does n't actually touch the laptop in the middle , it bulges out a little , annoys me if i can go back in time , i 'd pay more for a better one
i have the coolest macbook ever because of this everyone comments on it and since i am a very pink person , this cover is completely me it was easy to get on and has fit on it well my only complaints would be that the computer heats up fast -lrb- which it would without the cover -rrb- i would like this cover to have bigger mounting spots underneath so that the computer is lifted a little and there can be more air flow also , the top right corner seems to come loose and i 'm often snapping it back in - not a big problem though i 've experiences the mounting grip pads underneath slide from their spots but i just put them back and they 're fine i 'd def . buy again
nice to give your laptop a special look <unk> it for my daughter they do n't uses books anymore <unk> school but very expensive and now i get a extra bill from the fedex -lrb- ? ? ?
i really like this product it fit my computer , snapped right on , and makes it look nice the colors are bright and fun , and it really helps prevent the scratches that my mac was getting
i got it because i wanted to protect my mac from damage , and because it was pretty after having the case on for about a month , scratches had developed everywhere over the surface of my mac , probably due to imperfections in the plastics rubbing together it makes it look like i have `` stuff `` between the case and the mac it is pretty though . i 'll give it that
other reviewers have noted that this case limits the movement of the screen on the macbook that 's not all . this case damages the hinge itself , and it 's happened twice the first time , i paid apple $ # to get the screen replaced and got a new case from speck i <unk> the case after a period of use , the screen would become wobbly because the hinge had become loosened , and i would remove the case to find that the <unk> would go away i kept the case on just to protect the macbook today , i noticed that the macbook hinge was actually becoming loose on the left side i immediately took off the shell i 'm getting a different case
the front cover got dust and <unk> under it in the first week so we just took it off and use the bottom cover only saw a woman at work with only the top part on and she said same thing happened to hers
for the price you pay i expected a better fit part of the case does n't actually snap on as it should i am not sure when this item is so expensive you could probably get away with a cheaper case from another vendor with the same results but overall it does the job
like others , my experience with the speck seethru has been mixed i only had it for a brief time , and i found it to be a little ugly , and the protection it provided was questionable i 'm sure it protected against scratches and minor bumps , but it also seemed unnecessary and a little unwieldy ultimately , what made me give it up and resell it was the price - i personally can not justify this price for something that seems to be primarily for looks my macbook is pretty enough without it if they made it in solid black , i 'd <unk> the speck seethru -lrb- though i guess it would n't be `` seethru `` then , would it ? get this if you want to have a <unk> macbook . if you 're looking for scratch protection , though , i suggest best skins ever or invisible shield
very cute . fits well . however , dirt collects between the computer and the case , which scratches the comp . in the long run so if you use another case over it -lrb- zipper -rrb- you should be o.k
it does exactly what you want it do , it protects your macbook from scratches and etc . i hear people talking about how it scratches their macbook , and i have to disagree it has n't hurt mine at all , and it has protected it from getting some pretty bad scrapes i think half of the issue , is people do not know how to remove their case you have to be really really careful with it
i bought this case for my new macbook and it makes it look soooo chic and fashionable i am very happy with it , the only thing that i dont like is that the macbook gets a little dirty inside the case so i have to get it off and clean and then put it again anyway its a great case
this is a great product that protects and adds to the coolness to your mb it fits perfect , no adjustment required took less than # seconds to put on the machine i would have given it # stars but it 's still a bit over priced in my opinion
fits pretty well , look great i have n't heard any of the <unk> that other reviewers have commented , pretty quite and snug the case is not meant as `` heavy duty `` protection it will protect from scratches and it does just that i 'm pleased overall i 'm glad i purchased through amazon as i saved money if i purchased through apple or speck directly , i would have paid # . # + shipping on this item personally , i do n't think this us worth $ # . #
four stars only because i just received it today and just put it on my new # `` macbook it 's <unk> red it snapped on easily ; all the holes line up , and it does n't interfere with operation or closing just wish it had arrived when my macbook did a couple weeks ago so i would have a pristine , <unk> to put it on
i really love this case i got it in a vibrant red color and i can decorate it with my fave stickers i have heard its difficult to get off which i have not tried as of yet and it is prone to fingerprints but i am always on the go as a grad student and a few fingerprint smudges do n't got me down i say its a great hard case and i would recommend it
this speck case is very good in addition to protecting the computer from surface marks and general dust , it gives a cool , distinctive look especially handy when you 're in a building filled with other students who have the exact same computer as you the case snaps on easily enough and is very effective so i 'd recommend it , especially for the $ # i paid
<unk> 's a bit ugly once you put it <unk> it totally fits my macbook i do n't want to worry about any scratch on <unk> instead of buying a soft case and take it out and put it in everytime , i choose this one then you can throw your macbook in any other case -lrb- surprisingly it wo n't make your macbook bigger , just a little bit but the issue of heat is still there it makes your macbook hotter but not too hot to work my macbook runs with it # hours a day it gets really <unk> still works
i travel a lot and my laptops tend to take a beating , so this is a great option for protecting it it does not come on and off very easily - it 's possible , but takes some effort overall , i am satisfied with it , though
i really love my macbook cover it protects my macbook very well the only downfall is it gets scratched really easy and somehow gets weird scratches underneath the cover , which made me think that there was big scratches on my actual macbook , but there were n't i would recommend this item as it protects and makes your macbook more fashionable
this is probably the best available for a laptop it has open slots on the side for easy access to plugins which is nice my only pet peeve is the red shows smudges easily which you can remedy by quickly wiping
this is an excellent product ; easy to fit and use i like the fact that it protects my laptop , but provides full accessibility to the computer and ports without undoing any zippers , buckles , or velcro it 's hard plastic so it wo n't retain any moisture or dirt like neoprene or other padded material it really enhances mobility of the laptop without adding any bulk
i got the cover and it snapped right on but when i opened up the package four little round corner thingie pieces came flying out there was no item description with the package and it does look like it attaches anywhere does anyone know what they are for other than that this is a good product i 'm glad i have it
great item but expensive it is a <unk> product so i guess the audience is small and thus the high cost it fits great and works great you can personalize and protect you macbook at the same time it 's like having another computer in other people 's eyes it does scratch a little easily but that is the point to scratch the cover and not your macbook also it can make a scratched macbook look new too would get # stars except for the price
this cover <unk> easily and provides perfect protection no need to worry about bumps or scrapes once snapped on your machine it 's like wearing leather riding clothes on a motorcycle the best part is it adds very little weight
it not only can protect my apple , but also looks very cool when i use my apple on some public places , people alway look at my macbook and say what a beautiful apple i am a pink girl and i love this magic speck
i bought this case a few months after i bought my computer because i wanted to save my mac from getting scratched up for that the case does it 's job i really like the color it gives my white macbook the only negative thing is that there are parts of the case that seem a little flimsy , like they could break if they were n't on the laptop that 's not a big deal , just keep the case on the computer i only wish i 'd bought it earlier to protect my mac from scratches
this product is good i like how it fits perfectly on my mac it does n't make it heavy and it gives a whole new look to my computer it protects it from scratches and it also helps the venting system so it does n't heat up as fast not like a mac over heats much anyway
i read numerous reviews on a variety of sites before purchasing this case in red i was nervous because several people spoke about horrible scratches to their macbooks , but i really liked the color and did not want a zip-up case i would definitely buy this case again i just took my case off -lrb- after <unk> these reviews -rrb- - fairly easy , took about # seconds the case : lots of scratches , dirty -lrb- i do take my macbook absolutely everywhere -rrb- the laptop : perfect , with one little scratch on the edge -lrb- which may have occurred before i bought the case -rrb- i give it # stars out of # because the case itself scratches easily and it 's pretty pricey but i have no regrets at all
this is a great product , i feel a lot more secure knowing my computer is protected the only caution i would give is that since it is a clear case i can still see scratches from before i got the cover so i think a colored case may have been
i have never written a review before , but i had to for this i love it i was surprised at how easily it snaps on and how well it fits all of the slots and plugs line up perfectly -lrb- just be sure you give the inside of it and the outside of your laptop a good <unk> with a lint-free cloth before you put it on , or you 'll be able to see lint through it . i ca n't say enough good about it and it does n't make my macbook noticeably thicker i read a lot of reviews about it <unk> how far the screen opens -lrb- and nearly did n't buy it because of that -rrb- , but i really do n't notice a difference the only reason this is not a # -star review is the price it 's quite pricey for plastic ... other than that , i say go for it
i just received my macbook case and it went on really easily if you follow the instruction <unk> that comes with it , you 'll have no problem ca n't say if it scratches up the computer when you remove it because i have n't tried yet it seems to fit great and is light , so the computer does n't feel much heavier with it on my only complaint is that it seems pricey -lrb- i paid $ # -rrb- for a couple of pieces of plastic but , i needed something to protect my laptop and this seems to be the only acceptable thing on the market so far so good
pretty slick for the price and the fact that it 's not permanent i was so sick of wiping fingerprints off the black macbook , this is just what the doctor ordered granted , it 's not as sexy as the black , but the red over the black at least looks different and fingerprints are much easier to tolerate on red plastic than the black matte material of the macbook
all my friends just love my red macbook cover i call it my girly computer it 's a conversation piece everyone <unk> me about it and where i got it it was easy to assemble and i love the protection it gives my computer and of course the hip red color
nice product , fits my white macbook like a glove i 've been using it for a few days and have not had any problems i would recommend cleaning both the cover and your macbook before putting it on since the cover came a bit dusty use your favorite cleaner like <unk> and give them both a good cleaning i think this will help in avoiding insides scratches as some have mentioned i would 've given it # stars , but it is a bit pricey for what it is there are some <unk> for about half as much , but i have n't seen any reviews on them with free shipping , amazon has the best deal out there , but if they were a little cheaper , i would 've gotten another color to go with the clear
speck has fantastic products and i am very happy with this one i would be sure to get all the dust and invisible specks off the computer and the case prior to attaching the two ... dust shows up very much through the see-thru case good stuff though
i ordered this for a christmas present it was to make an old computer look new for my sister to use it came quickly and works well it was a cheaper plastic than i thought and does n't look as nice as i expected it too
