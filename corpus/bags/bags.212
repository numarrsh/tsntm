the case seems to fit quite well however the small clips on the bottom piece that clip it into place stick up a tad where your wrist rests on the laptop this is a little annoying but i guess i will get used to it other than that no other issues the matte black colour is exactly what i was looking for and i love how the apple logo light is <unk> just a tad as the light passes through the cover
covers well and is virtually transparent though the metallic look is gone , that 's fine with me in favor of protection the bit of a & # # ; lip & # # ; around the edges , particularly at the trackpad <unk> is a bit a pain as my wrist rubs against it
# inch macbook with retina love this product i actually bought two different hardshell cases this one and another hardshell plastic case the other case came with a keyboard cover too however this case is much better the feel of this case is more premium the other one feels cheap this fits perfectly as well
i thought the kuzy was just what it looks like in the pictures it 's sleek , slim and fits very nicely i prefer the look and feel of this cover over the speck i did not give it # stars because i will have to wait and see how it wears all of our speck covers have cracked over time i would definitely recommend this product
i read a lot of the reviews and some said it fit and some said it did n't i bought it anyway because you ca n't complain with the price i received it and it was a bit snug to put on but definitely gets the job done
this case is a great value for basic protection , for only $ # it keeps my retina macbook pro safe from scratches without adding much bulk or weight after a week of usage , i am going to keep using it
i really love these kuzy cases this is the third one that i purchased and it rocks the rubber feel makes this the best case around fits like a glove and the color is true to advertised color
although the bottom part of the case is slightly too loose and the exterior shows fingerprints a little too easily , the case does add some protection plus , the price is affordable
snaps on easily and so far , so good i 've heard that it rubs the finish off the corners , which i 'm not thrilled about , but have n't had it long enough to experience that problem sleek , nice color , and i like that it 's translucent which allows the glowing apple to show through
this product was good . i like it a lot . the satin feel is awesome . my only complaint is that the rubber feet on the bottom are already coming off after a month or # . overall good
i bought this cover for my macbook pro with retina display , which means it does n't come with the cd rom drive it fits perfectly and the material feels sturdy the color is true to the image this product works great
i have a mac pro # & # # ; retina and it fits very well i like the color black -lrb- personal preference -rrb- so not sure about any other colors i like the rubbery smooth anti-slip feeling of the case apple logo still visible giving my mac pro & # # ; attitude & # # ; i like it
really happy with the product ordered it on a <unk> , it arrived exactly # weeks later i like its feel , its look , its price only concern is in trying to unclip the case : i had a soft go at this and it did n't budge do n't want to <unk> in case it breaks tip : watch this clip -lsb- ... -rsb- to get a quick tutorial on how to fit the case -lrb- i needed <unk> to really shove it on
i got the brand new macbook retina pro and decided to try out the kuzy case i was pretty hesitant about the cost for the item , but decided to say to hell with it and bought it off of prime the case snapped on almost perfectly -lrb- a slight edge is n't completely even -rrb- and i 've taken the laptop with me through uk and <unk> asia without any issue great cheap buy
easy installation , feels nice and smooth , and has good venting for computer to breath the only cheap part was the the bottom cover has the # rubber mounts and they are n't glued in position perfectly they are a little off center , but other than that i like the product
this case is a great choice for the price , but one thing to be wary of is the durability of the case i would n't argue that this case does n't protect my laptop ; rather , it is a stylish and relatively strong hard case but the wear and tear on the case -lrb- i 've had it for about # months -rrb- is noticeable after the first <unk> months the bottom of my case only has # of the # rubberized & # # ; grips & # # ; left on it this can be kind of annoying because it sometimes causes the laptop to wobble while one is typing
i really love the fit and look of this case but be careful when attempting to remove it i have had this case on my mac book for a few weeks but i needed to remove the case to show someone else who was thinking of purchasing it and now my case cracked <unk> i really like this case but i do n't want to purchase another
works like it should serves its purpose as designed only negative is it seems too attract and retain oily fingerprints that are hard to clean off
this seller is reliable the item came in a very professional and compact package the case was pretty much easy to attach to the laptop without any damage whatsoever it makes the laptop look really nice and <unk> the apple feel -lrb- it does not make the laptop look cheap -rrb- it does make the laptop a noticeably heavier , but manageable none the less with regards with the other cases and price that are on the market right now , this case is a solid # . #
i really like this cover the only reason it did n't get # stars is because of fingerprints , fingerprints , fingerprints though , this is just due to the nature of the material , and no fault of the manufacturer or seller i was pleased at how well it fit and now i do n't have to worry about scratching my mac :
for under # dollars , it 's a very solid case in terms of protection it 's a dust magnet , but it 's a compromise i 'm willing to take for the nice texture the only complaint i have is that the black rubber feet fall off multiple times a day i 'm super gluing them on as we speak i would give this # / # stars , but i 'll be fair and round up instead of down , since it 's a generally good cover
i have only had the case for a couple of days and i noticed some fingerprints were on the case when i installed it i tried using a damp cloth to clean them off but it never really came off # % . this appears to be a very nice case , but stay away from the black shows every fingerprint
this is a nice looking addition to my rmbp that makes it stand out in a sea of aluminum the fit and finish is very good , but not perfect -lrb- hence # stars -rrb- most importantly it should help preserve the resale value of my machine , since i tend to get a new one every year and sell the old ones while they still have significant value
real nice and tight fit case hardly knew it was on the mbp and it still allowed the beauty of the mbp to be seen feeling of the case was nice to the touch , has a nice grip to it too however , dust does get under the <unk> it i had dust get under my iphone case and caused scratches on the back since i love my mbp , i took this case off and no longer use it due to that when taking it off , , there was dust in the front on both sides of the front bezel pros : tight fit , low <unk> , clear , good texture and <unk> : allows dust to get under case which <unk> lead to <unk> on the mbp
case fit very snugly it took a little bit of work , but got it to fit correctly all around the computer the upside is that it wo n't move and certainly protects the computer the downside is that i fear removing it will be quite difficult i have no intention of doing so , so i am happy with the product the feel of the cover is nice and not <unk> like other covers i have looked at i would recommend this product
color is a little darker green than pictured , but still nice it 's a clear enough case that the color of your computer underneath really affects it , which was n't clear to me from the photo or description so , in a silver macbook , the effect is a darker , <unk> green the case fits quite well though , and , though the color is n't quite what i was expecting , i still like it no problems so far -lrb- a couple of months of use -rrb- with <unk> , so , overall , i 'm satisfied
on <unk> rubbery surface as <unk> <unk> one tiny problem , a small scratch & keep in mind that it would catch dust very fast -lrb- due to the rubber surface
good fit but not perfect in the rear corners . not a glossy surface so no risk of fingerprint smudges . cheap enough that if it breaks , no tears to replace it
the size is good and fits well . the only thing i 'd wish it better have is the material surfaces of the case cover touch feeling is so different for outside and inside the inner side feels cheaper
it is so thin , but it looks great i hope that it will be strong enough to truly protect the computer it is likely great for scratch resistance and the color is superb
i like it it fits great i 've had it for # months without it breaking no damage to my mac from using it i was just really hoping for yellow ad instead its more
edit : i 'm currently waiting on a replacement cover and hopefully it will match up with my expectations i 'm happy that kuzy is attempting to <unk> an issue i had with a product once i receive my <unk> cover , i will update my review to reflect my thoughts on it i was too quick on my comments about kuzy , the company the case 's bottom half is a perfect fit but the top half is uneven and it <unk> me a lot the corners <unk> n't even fit the upper right corner of the case i really probably should have gone with another company because when i emailed support , they referred me back to amazon instead of offering me an exchange and do n't even consider ordering a keyboard cover from them , mine came in dirty and scratched
bought the teal rubberized hard case cover together with the teal keyboard cover silicone skin for my macbook pro # & # # ; the both look fantastic and protect my new mac i would recommend this color to others who want to make a fashion statement in conjunction with great quality
fits my october # macbook pro retina # like a glove it 's so snug on there that the snap clasps wo n't come off i feel like if i forced it off , the case plastic will snap or scratch the mbp 's
i am happy that i did n't spend $ # on a case for my macbook pro retina , because this one fits perfectly and works for me the only downside is that the little pad feet on the bottom come unglued after a while , but considering how cheap this was , i can afford a little glue to <unk> them
the case is about as nice as the more expensive ones sold at the apple store it has a different locking mechanism which is even less intrusive and seems to work well the bottom of the case latches onto the machine at the back hinge instead of the more typical spot by the back of the keyboard it 's a nice touch the material is provides a nice satiny finish but it does add more bulk and heft i 'm deducting one star because the rubberized feet on the bottom of the case were glued on in a <unk> way , leaving them all misaligned slightly with the case overall a much better buy than competing products i 'm glad to have it for the added protection and <unk>
love the shell , have n't cleaned it as yet so do n't know how it will handle that or is it easy to do but i love it did n't look good thought this was a # in # but thanks
this fit perfectly and looks great - lots of compliments the only bad part is that the rubber feet have all fallen off i have tried gluing them back on with superglue but they wo n't stay
the apple logo does n't shine as bright as the picture does the little black circles on the bottom that hold the laptop off of the surface that it 's on are slowly coming out of their place but i do n't pick at them so they are fine for now
it came in wrapped very well it 's very sturdy and protects the computer well easy to snap on and snap off the only thing i dislike about it is that the color is n't what i expected i was expecting a more solid teal color
my second kuzy case in exactly the same color the old one broke down in the edges since i could n't find alternative one with the exact same cute pink color , i had to buy the same one with knowledge it is not quite lasting i think they improve the <unk> of the case a little bit it fits better than the previous one the overall quality is good
i like the case i did n't want to spend the money speck and moshi was asking although , moshi is highly rated and the quality seems to actually match the price , unlike speck i believe this kuzy case will provide the protection like it should and the price was fair it goes on easily , but like the other reviewers noted it is difficult to remove i have n't removed it yet because of concern with force required to pry it off overall , the case works , it looks good , and it does n't impede with any of the functions of the mac for # . # it 's a great buy just wish it were easier to remove when it comes time to clean the dust off
i love this case but theres only one thing wrong with it it tracks your fingerprints so by the end of the day , your case is covered with your fingerprints other than that i really enjoy it
great product , simple to install and looks quite sleek ; only issue are the bottom pads : the adhesive used is not very strong a quick application of super glue should remedy the issue
this fit my & # # ; new & # # ; style -lrb- dec # -rrb- macbook pro perfectly it & # # ; smudges & # # ; a little easier than i 'd like , but overall i really like the way the product works and it seems to be protecting the unit quite well i only rated it as # out of # because it can look a little more & # # ; smudged & # # ; than it otherwise could i would certainly buy it again
absolutely loved this cover different colors , sturdy build , ca n't ask for anything more does the job of what it is suppose to do , protect it form daily wear and tear will order more if needed
install was easy and it looks great one start <unk> due to the finger prints that are noticeable on the black finish we 'll what can you do black shows finger prints it looks good
i was able to snag this case in black at # % off for my late # rmbp the case fits very snuggly and i like the rubberized texture as it makes the laptop easy to grip as i transport it if you want to protect your mbp 's aluminum finish from scratches , scuffs , and other marks , then this case by kuzy is definitely the way to go
i wanted a cover to protect our macbook pro with retina which was a very expensive purchase for us the case itself is lightly transparent so the light up apple logo faintly shines through the case it fits perfectly on the machine with rubberized feet on the bottom and venting as well on the bottom back the description says it 's rubberized and maybe it is slightly but it feels more like a hard plastic than a rubberized i think it will protect against scratches and light impacts but i doubt it would be a big help if it were to be dropped
i like it , it fits great and the texture is great , however , it gets smudges all over normally i 'd say it gives it character but i specifically bought the blue one because most people get the black rubberized i will use this one for a while and when i get tired i 'll go black the fit is perfect for a macbook pro retina mid # & # #
this case is what i bought for my wife 's macbook pro and i actually have a speck case for my macbook compared to speck case , i got ta say the quality of this kuzy case is not as good as my speck one but anyway , this one is much cheaper and is worth that money
i 'm starting to like kuzy products it fits the new mac nice and snug i bought the black case the only downside is that you can sometimes see fingerprints on the black
nice protection for the price the case fits snug over the macbook and feels great to handle i would have preferred to have their logo on the bottom panel rather than the top panel but that is just me overall a great product for a great price
i recently purchased this case for my new mac bookpro and i love it i especially love the color but it also fits perfectly and does a great job of protecting my macbook without adding weight to the laptop i highly recommend
an essential cover for the mbp notebook computers need these sort of cases if you want to keep the <unk> in good condition the & # # ; frost <unk> & # # ; color is the best match if you want to keep the apple look
i love the teal color . it fits perfectly and its soooo soft . i had a hard time getting the top part on because once it locks it stays and was hard to readjust but glad it holds tight i 'm happy
i bought the aqua blue color for my macbook pro with retina display and it fits perfectly it 's easy to put on and take off , as well the color is almost exact , so it 's super bright i am still able to see the apple , not as clearly as the picture , but it 's certainly clear enough for $ # , it 's a great buy and great quality , and exactly what i wanted to prevent scratches
i only ordered this case because another case was out of stock however , for the price , this is amazing i dropped my # macbook pro out of my backpack whilst mountain climbing , and while the case has some damage , my macbook is dent and scratch free this is a great case it feels nice , and looks nice it 's not as dark as i thought it would be , but it 's still a nice almost matte black i highly recommend
i was n't sure i would like this case and the description of & # # ; rubberized & # # ; made me even more unsure i trusted the reviews other buyers had left and i 'm glad i did the case fits perfectly and the feel is great it 's more of a <unk> feeling but does n't feel like it will slip out of your hands i got this case to protect against scratches and dings -lrb- not for major protection -rrb- and i think it 's going to be perfect
i 've had this case for about a month now and i love it i 've had zero problems with it so far and i 'm not expecting to have any problems i love the soft touch of the satin case it fits perfect
i loved everything about this case the color was spot on with the picture , the fit is perfect nothing comes over the sides or covers any ports i loved how it feels its nice and soft to the touch so far it has been vary durable
first review i 've ever written on amazon , but had to as this cover is simply incredible had reservations about ordering at first , but so glad when it arrived - looks so sleek -lrb- my macbook pro with retina display now looks better than it did without any cover ! -rrb- , fitted perfectly amazing value really like the rubbery feel and love how the apple logo still shines through fine on the other side if you want a sleek , great value for money case for your macbook , then do n't hesitate , buy it recommended ! !
this fits like a glove on my mac book # & # # ; with retina so happy with it , i am thinking of getting another color to change it up every so often
great product , which works and looks great this is my second one , the first had a slightly green hue to it , but worked very well for protection , while still looking good this one is just pure black , but the lighted apple logo still shows through again , the fit is just right , and i 've read some complaints about how hard it is to remove ... but you ca n't really have it both ways i prefer the security , knowing that it 's not going to just snap off at some point it 's not that tough to remove . the rubberized element is wonderful if you work on your lap or knee a lot like i do , which keeps things from sliding i just wanted to say it 's a really well made product and i love the way it looks
the case is cute and snaps in easily on the retina computer . it has smooth feel and vents on the bottom i am not sure how well it will protect in a fall , but it 's good protection against scratches
fits on my macbook pro awesome and i like the matted black look so theres no shine or it does n't get slippery an awesome buy they never let me down
exceeded my expectations ! ! i purchased a $ # one from apple and compared the two and this one won i returned the other the cheaper price was a bonus because i really loved everything more it was softer , prettier color and even felt more durable it reminded me of my purple incase cover for my # ' macbook pro , it had the soft rubbery texture do n't spend more than this , it 's totally unnecessary
high quality feeling case that makes speck cases look ridiculous for their prices the color is just like photo it has a very nice soft texture and vents on the bottom i definitely recommend this case
exactly what i was looking for in all regards : excellent price , fits like a glove , great quality , durable , slim , and even color options available were impressive highly recommended for the apple macbook pro # & # # ; retina
it 's a good fit , seems like a sturdy enough plastic , and is true to advertised color -lrb- red -rrb- it looks great on the macbook pro very happy i purchase this a good combination of protection and decoration
absolutely love it much nicer than the cases at the -lrb- <unk> <unk> -rrb- store this is the color i wanted in a material that can be <unk> by smaller fingers without slipping out it is also easy to pop them off , and snap both top and bottom back in place without a wrestling match as some cases i 've tried plus -- when the case is open the lighted apple on the laptop cover shows through the hard case yeah ! ! the rubberized material provides sturdy , soft protection for the device , but would not protect sufficiently to prevent damage if dropped , or something dropped onto it it is more a cover to prevent scratches and wear to the exterior of the laptop case which is exactly what i wanted it to do
fit as promised , love the clear case came on time and no problems getting it installed have n't tried to get it off yet , but not sure why it would need to come off ? ?
this case fits my computer amazingly i am # % comfortable with carrying around my computer and fairly certain that if i end up dropping it , the case will protect it is also good for things like stickers so you do n't have to stick something on the computer directly i also purchased a key cover from kuzy and it is also fabulous i recommend any kuzy product to anyone
good snug fit and has a bit of a rubber feel so it wo n't slip out of your hands the main reason i purchased this was to keep my macbook pro from getting scratched up definitely recommend this cover
this is a very good case that fits our # inch macbook pro with retina display perfectly we are pleased with the case and it works to protect the macbook we would certainly purchase it again if it was needed
<unk> case that 's as minimalist as possible without adding bulk my # `` macbook pro snapped right in black is the way to go i love the feel of the case , it 's hard to describe but i think it adds to rather than detracts from the attractiveness of my macbook pro bought in conjunction with this keyboard cover : http / / www.amazon.com/gp/product/b # <unk> and my laptop looks like it was manufactured with the case and cover love them both
this kuzy cover is such a beautiful blue and it fits perfectly with no problems it definitely adds value to your laptop after installation which is so quick and easy my grandson loves it and we would recommend this cover to everyone who owns a macbook pro laptop
i recommend this item to anyone who a -rrb- digs teal and b -rrb- wants protective gear for their mac but not something tacky it gives the macbook a little flair without overpowering the laptop i could not be happier with the product
my # year old daughter got this for her new # & # # ; macbook pro -lrb- late # - retina / slim profile -rrb- she had to have this teal color i have other cases from higher end brands on my other macbook pro 's and am amazed at the quality of this piece it snaps on perfectly and is made of quality material great fit and finish costing half of what the other name brand cases cost , i will be getting this kuzy for my next macbook pro as well
looks great , not cheep or not well made the frost look is kinda cool , it 's not completely clear but it still lets the apple logo sign straight through it also feels soft to the touch , it 's of course a hard cover shell but it does feel really cool and smooth
fantastic , i like the feel and the texture this was very easy to snap on and looks great as well it allows a very secure grip for easy handling so far so good i have only had this for a month , however time will tell
first , this fits my macbook pro retina perfectly i was worried but , there were no problems i love the feel of the rubberized coating it also does not show scratches like some of the shiny cases that i have had in the past it feels secure in my hands without adding a lot of bulk i can still fit it in to my neoprene case that i have for travel i also like the fact that the apple logo is not a cut out like i have seen in some other cases that only allows scratches and dirt this case keeps my ocd at bay , because i can wipe it down as often as i please
fits like a glove and looks great i tried a different skin from another retailer and had to return it it looked ok but was slippery and it did n't fit snug
fits perfectly , looks good , nice texture that does not attract dust , and feels nice to hold i have the black version , and it is aesthetically the nicest laptop case i have ever owned nice and thin too so it does not make the laptop too bulky should keep the laptop clean of scratches and provide some protection for small impacts or drops it it not a big bulky case to protect the laptop from major falls or heavy damage , but i sure do n't want an annoyingly large case it is a laptop ; i do n't want to make it <unk> with some silly looking , <unk> case would definitely recommend this case for a new macbook pro
i wanted a cover for my new macbook pro # & # # ; and i did not want to spend the outrageous apple brand price so i found this snapped on easily the apple logo somewhat shines through my black colored case i doubt it would save it from a drop but i got it to protect the laptop from scratches
i needed a cover for my macbook pro for # reasons first , i did n't want the case getting scratched up because i tend to use my computer in different locations secondly , when the computer is on a table , i did n't want it to accidentally slide off lastly , my son has the same computer , i wanted to make sure my computer was easy to spot the kuzy satisfies all # reasons easy to apply it stays on prevents the computer from sliding would recommend the kuzy to anyone who needs a cover
we are very pleased with the rubberized hard case for our macbook pro we are very glad we were able to find these here online as it was much more expensive at the store where we book our mac
i love this case , it 's true to the color , mine being mint green the apple logo shines very bright , it 's a <unk> apple rather than a mint green apple so that is a major plus the feel is great , smooth and study ; rubberized plastic the bottom feet are no longer the older white foam , they have been replaced with the newer black <unk> plastic feet that are much more sturdy : -rrb- also i received a coupon for free replacement feet from <unk> in the event that they fall off the feel and look of the cover is smooth and sleek , the color is gorgeous and true to the image -lrb- mint green -rrb- all in all i 'm very satisfied with my purchase important note : this cover is meant to protect from scratches rather than drops , it will most likely break if it falls often and depending on the height and due to the plastic this case is made from it has almost a definite date it will & # # ; crack & # # ; , especially from stress cracks if you 're looking for something long lasting to protect from both scratches and drops then purchase a genuine leather case , do not buy a plastic case
i am always concerned ordering a new cover / protector online not sure how it looks or fits this cover is great at protecting top and bottom and fits tight around edges better than a zipper case !
this laptop case is half the price of the speck products . it looks and fits my laptop just the same i am thrilled and my laptop looks awesome not cheap looking at
now my mac book pro is protected i thought i had scratched the top of my laptop , but i had a <unk> so i looked for a case to protect it , do n't know why but i like purple my last lap top was black and i chose a purple case this one is silver , easier to put on i like it , and think it will last the life of the computer i want to treat it as well as it treats me
this is a slick case , it is as described , rubberized hard case , the pros its clean and has a great look the cons : it leaves finger prints on the outside , picks up on grease and a lil easy to get dirty , but so easy to clean love it and recommend it
i just experienced a recent sudden demise of my laptop i bought bought an <unk> and it seem so much more lovely and delicate than my old laptop i just wanted a hard cover and saw this one on amazon i was worried that it might not fit but fit was perfect and i feel more secure whenever i am using my computer the color was also just what i wanted
this covers my macbook pro up nicely i do notice you have to wipe it down often and it seems to quickly begin to show wear , but i guess its better for the wear to show on the shell than on the actually macbook pro itself overall i am still satisfied and glad i made the purchase
it 's perfect i had another cover that was impossible to pop off so once i got it off i ordered a new one -lrb- this one -rrb- and this one is what i was looking for
what 's there to say it snaps on effortlessly and looks sweet unless michael <unk> <unk> my mbp with a <unk> , it should remain scratch free i particularly like the <unk> <unk> feel of it i 'd seen reviews stating that this case was difficult to remove , so i tried removing it as soon as i put it on and this is what i found for the bottom piece , <unk> the rear clasps and slide it right off of the front for the top , <unk> the clasps on either side and slide it right off of the other
once again this company was fantastic in <unk> my order when i realized i had my california address instead of my florida address and they saved everything from being entirely screwed up this shell is super easy to put on and is nice with the little elevated feet on the bottom to allow proper & # # ; breathing & # # ; for the heat <unk> underside of my computer kuzy really kicks some ass !
the case came on exactly when it said it would and it fits perfect the color is the same as the picture and the apple sign shines right through i love the way the case feels i would totally buy another one in a different color
this is a review for the # & # # ; clear kuzy cover it arrived promptly and in good condition it was easy to put on and has remained in place without slipping or stretching and adds no weight or bulk i prefer <unk> covers and this fits the bill perfectly another advantage is the way it fits the front bottom sides <unk> the sharpness of the edges that were not very pleasant against my wrists i will still use a padded briefcase or backpack for traveling but for daily protection this fits the bill perfectly
i purchased this cover to use on my macbook pro with retina display it fits perfectly i also purchased the matching silicone keyboard protector i can now <unk> use my macbook this cover will protect the body of my computer from any scratches and dirt or grime that comes its way i recommend kuzy to anyone , and i will be purchasing products from kuzy in the future
