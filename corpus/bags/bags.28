i was looking for a cheaper alternative to the incase sleeves for my # `` macbook pro -lrb- $ # incl s & h ; as opposed to $ # for just the incase one -rrb- i expected this one to be of a comparable feel but it is much stiffer although it does the job , good protection , it 's not that great in the <unk> department i guess you get what you pay for however , not a bad deal overall i 'm keeping it
i own one for my macbook air and it fits perfectly this one is not correctly advertised it does not work well with `` new `` macbook pro retina display the machine <unk> around inside the case like a fish in a <unk> i 'm sure it will hold the product safely and keep it from getting scratched , but it is n't customized , and for the price it should be
i bought this case for my # inch laptop i checked the specifications and they allowed an extra inch of clearance on all sides for my laptop however , when i placed my laptop inside the case , it would n't fit the corners of my laptop were poking out overall , the case is made of a very nice material but , amazon has the wrong specs on the website and they should be corrected
the laptop may survive a big fall while in this sleeve at the same time it may not fit in a bag that it was fitting in easily without the sleeve
i love the look , feel and quality of this item , however , there is no cord storage available on it it should be used more as a sleeve to put in another bag/backpack rather than a standalone product to carry your laptop around as there is no <unk> plug adapter storage on it love it otherwise
overall , this is a great case i 've had it for a few years and my laptop has traveled a lot it always feels well-protected , and my # inch fits perfectly my only complaint is that the zippers have broken - both zippers have lost their tabs relatively easy to fix , but still annoying
this is a great laptop case for my # `` macbook pro it is sturdy , well-built , and fairly lightweight however , i found that there 's quite a bit of `` wiggle room `` for the laptop inside of the case i do n't expect it to be a problem as far as the case protecting my computer , but it does make it that much more inconvenient when transporting something this bulky in a backpack they could 've made the case fit a bit tighter around the laptop , i think
i <unk> every sleeve on the market for my # . # `` mbp , then decided on be.ez la robe yes , its a little bigger than perfect fit and i can understand why the extra room makes the zip on and off easy while knowing my mbp 's edge is <unk> from the metal zipper i like the memory foam -lrb- neoprene -rrb- material very much for durability , but the simple color and design are not to my <unk> . this style is suitable for business use , but as a <unk> , i would liked it much better if they could come up with more colorful <unk> and softer inner material its now memory foam inside and out
i bought this many years ago i do n't use on a daily basis , but i use it often enough this provides a nice level of protection , without the bulk i love putting this in my backpack when taking small flights the foam squishes around your fingers for a nice grip while walking , although a small handle would be appreciated and the zipper is still strong as ever
it 's a great sleeve that will protect the newest mbp late # model from falls i know this cause like a <unk> i dropped mine on the floor in my accounting class at my university , that was about three months ago , and there is nothing wrong with my mbp also it 's reasonable price , and it comes in cool colors but it is just a tad bit too big for the current gen mbp , not sure about the <unk> gen defiantly worth your money if your looking for a great laptop sleeve that can take a beating
i bought this for my new macbook pro `` # . i love the way it feels and its design i wish it fit just a little tighter though ... it seems to wiggle around in the case a little but other then that it 's a great product , well done
i bought this as a gift for my husband and it fit his macbook perfectly it is a stylish and safe way to take his computer with us wherever we go i have gone back and purchased one for my computer
i bought this case for my son 's first laptop he found it online and wanted to buy it immediately , but i made him keep looking to make sure it was the one he kept coming back to it sure enough , it was the best one we could find - he loves it
i bought this as a sleeve to use on my mac book pro , # inch it fits perfectly with little room to spare , does not work as a `` bag `` but then it was a sleeve , so i got what i wanted quality of workmanship is fine , zipper works well
this fits my # & # # ; retina display perfectly ! ! i was having a hard time deciding what case to get the laptop is thin and so i wanted to get something durable that looks good at the same time - this is perfect
this sleeve fit my macbook pro perfectly it is well made and affordable it is a relief to not worry about my mac being protected i would not hesitate to recommend this product to anyone who asked
this thing fits perfect for a new # inch macbook pro with -lrb- speck products see thru satin case for macbook pro # -inch -rrb- very happy with this thing looks good and will hold up to alot so please with the fit of my mac and the case together inside
this purchase has just been so helpful on campus , i just do n't feel like lugging my computer case around everywhere and this sleeve just makes it so easy to transport i can carry it easily in my bag or just with my books the memory foam is such a great feature as well it forms well to anything that may set on it and just accommodates the computer very well i rate this product # out of # and seriously recommend it for anyone
i have this product for about a month the sleeve is very good seems to protect my # . # macbook pro i use it and also put the laptop in my backpack the sleeve fits perfectly my macbook
i bought this for my macbook pro -lrb- # `` -rrb- my macbook fits perfectly in the sleeve and i can fit the whole thing inside my backback it also doubles as a nice non-slip platform to rest the macbook on while using it , e.g . , on my lap while sitting on an outdoor <unk> chair i used on a recent train trip and was very happy with it
the material the case is made of is like very dense memory foam it always returns to its original state , but it does take a solid # seconds to do so this case fits perfectly with my new macbook pro with retina display i feel very comfortable with my computer in the case because it seems to be equipped for shock absorption on a fall this case is superior and definitely worth the extra money if you want a case to really protect your computer , this is the perfect fit shipping was fast and easy from <unk> - i highly recommend ** i tried to purchase this directly from amazon originally , knowing it was expected to take at least two weeks before shipping , and once it was finally supposed to ship , they delayed shipping to another # weeks buy from <unk> and avoid the hassle
this sleeve is ideal for anyone who travels with a unibody macbook pro # in a briefcase the computer fits perfectly , with a thick <unk> lining both sides of the sleeve holding it snugly in place and <unk> it from the zipper while it wo n't help much in a major drop , the <unk> material -lrb- think hard memory foam -rrb- surely offers more protection from minor knocks than neoprene the sleeve itself fits nicely into a medium size tumi briefcase both design and manufacturing quality are superb , and the price gives it a final edge over the competition from incase , case logic , et al .
the foam is very firm , but lightweight it fits the laptop well , but there 's enough extra room to fit in a notebook if you need to i 've had mine for a little over a year and it 's held up very well
this is a terrific laptop sleeve for your macbook pro # `` it is made of super durable material and is very well cushioned -- the best i have seen and it does n't smell like neoprine -lrb- something that makes me literally <unk> with marware bags for instance -rrb- this is a great sleeve -- highly recommended
this product exceeds my expectations i feel safe to have my new , shiny macbook pro in my backpack now that it 's in this sleeve i 'm glad i got this instead of a neoprene
it does just whats is supposed to do , protect my macbook it appears to be well made throughout fit is good as my mbp is not floating around inside the sleeve no regrets in purchasing this sleeve the low <unk> polyurethane -lrb- <unk> -rrb- is great very dense but yet it has some give would recommend to those needing a mbp sleeve
i was a little hesitant to buy this laptop case after reading reviews about how it does n't fit a couple of people 's laptops however , it fits my # inch macbook fine i believe it is the new one - i bought it in july # i was having trouble finding a laptop case that would go over the macbook , as well as my speck satin case , but this works perfectly
love this thing , even the tactile feel of it , just ca n't stop touching it . bought it for my wife 's mac , wish they made one for my pc laptop . nice product
i am a college student , so this computer and my case get thrown -lrb- literally -rrb- into my backpack all the time i have yet to have a problem i will tell you i was initially really upset b/c the case <unk> on when pressure as applied i had it next to a spiral notebook and the spiral left dents i am happy to say they went away in a matter of minutes and my laptop is safe and sound i would recommend this product
an attractive product perfectly sized for the new macbook pro , easy to slip in and out , stays clean in a shoulder case with other stuff and i love the color
the quality is great the color is nice , and the protection is perfect i think -lrb- i did n't check it until now -rrb- <unk> only problem is with the pocket i need a packet for my flash drive or a pen but it 's not a big deal at all , i suggest this product i have no any problem with it
this is a nice sleeve i also use one of the be.ez sleeves for my wacom so i knew what i was getting there is a bit of wiggle room in mine , but it is n't so much it 's sliding all over the place and since i have a case on my macbook pro i 'm glad not to have a tight squeeze these are thicker than the <unk> sleeves , which i also like a lot and you may prefer if you need a slimmer profile however , i believe the be.ez offer more protection
a nice fit for my # `` unibody macbook pro has a quality zipper the memory foam material is interesting it dents under finger pressure then <unk> it 's original shape i think the material would <unk> a dropped computer nicely - at least for short distances i think they are <unk> now , just beware if it says delivery in # weeks , it is not a <unk> and be prepared to wait
i own the june # unibody macbook pro and this case fits it perfectly the polyurethane material is much more protective than the neoprene cases -lrb- and cheaper too -rrb- i have a speck case on my macbook and it still fits snug in the case the zippers are far away from the opening so you do n't have to worry about scratches i got this item two days after i ordered it on amazon and could n't be happier with the quality
been using this for over # years now . love it the only downside to it is that it does n't have a pocket to stick my charger in besides that it 's endured a long while without breaking or giving me any hassles whatsoever
the sleeve fits my fifteen inch macbook pro perfectly the foam is firm enough to act as a shield while moving it from place to place the color scheme is nice as well i recommend it to anyone who has to move their laptop around without worrying about it retaining damage or scratches
i bought this bag for myself i am a # year old women who take good care of my belongings i used this bag for school ; # days a week i carried my laptop , a notebook , a text book , and some small misc . items such as pens , my wallet , keys , etc . one semester - from september to december and this bag was destroyed using it just three days a week handles ripped off and not even on the stitching so it is <unk> and the lining of the outer pocket is ripped don ; t waste your money on this bag
looks like a <unk> bag , but not for my life it has a pretty pick lining too the handles , however , ca n't take much weight , including a normal laptop , so i will pass next time
stiff leather . big straps . wo n't relax on your shoulder . leather markings are too big , makes it look cheap inside is bright pink , not purple as shown pink so bright , does n't look professional worst part is how stiff and <unk> the leather and straps are
i had this bag for less than two months when i noticed a rip in the outer vinyl i <unk> , so in reality i only used this bag once a week , it traveled in my car on the seat next to me , and it sat on the floor between my desk and file cabinet in other words , in fewer than # uses , under very light handling conditions , the bag tore
i had one of these bags before , it was the one with the red lining the bag lasted about a year before the straps started to <unk> and look <unk> , hence why i needed a new one this bag came and right away i could tell it was n't the same craftsmanship or quality as my first after # week the handles started to tear , <unk> , and fray this bag is definitely not up to the standards my other one was and it 's a shame , because it 's such a professional and cute bag i 'm very disappointed in my purchase and will not be purchasing this product again
before i purchased this bag i read reviews about it and many said that the straps fall apart not long after you get it i 've had mine for a little over # month and the straps have slightly began to tear i understand general wear and tear , however i have n't used it enough to get to that point yet cute but not sure if it 's worth the money
i have had this laptop bag for about a year now i use it daily , but truly , that really <unk> carrying it from my house to the car , and then the car to the office , which is a matter of a few dozen steps i really like the look of the bag and the size works for me , as i carry the laptop , plus additional documents my biggest disappointment has been in how the handles have held up the stitching is coming out on both handles and the handles themselves are starting to come apart where the stitching is now missing my zipper also broke after just a few months i really like the style and size of this bag , but based on the quality i 've seen , i would not buy it again , nor would i recommend it
it does n't look cheap and is nicely padded ... but keep in mind the actual size : it is very big for a purse and most women will find it <unk> for a daily office bag
i love the look of this bag , and the magenta on the inside the & # # ; pleather & # # ; is really stiff , and the bag is cheaply made the straps started fraying after a few uses , and after a few months the corners have worn out i like the velcro compartments and being able to throw other things besides my laptop in the bag i just wish it was a better quality
it 's a cute bag with <unk> lining , and it has two sections inside to divide your laptop from other items mine held up for less than a year before i replaced it with something sturdier the shoulder straps frayed terribly and <unk> i carried it every day with my laptop , a few folders , and a book or two , so my use was pretty average
i love the look of this bag ... from a distance it 's definitely a cheap material i 've only had it for about a month now and the handles are already fraying and coming apart the inside is great for my laptop becasue it 's padded on one side -lrb- even though the velcro strap is way too big and does n't hold it in tightly -rrb- the other side has a place to keep papers and cell phone and pens and pencils i am a teacher and really wanted something like this to carry papers in that needed graded along with other important stuff and this is great for that i definitely know why it was so cheap compared to some of the other ones i saw i hope i can use it for at least a year without it falling completely apart
i have had this bag for about two years and the straps are now <unk> and ready to break also , the bottom corners have split -- it is time to replace the bag prior to it wearing out , i really liked the bag it served me well and was light weight i use it daily for travel and transporting my lap top to and from work this time around i think i will spend more money and buy something in more rugged and most likely in leather
i use it as my everyday laptop bag normal wear and tear after # months -lrb- unraveling at the straps and flaking on the bottom corners -rrb- love the pink color inside the bag and the outside pocket
this bag is not at all what i envisioned i think my standards were a little too high you get what you pay for i have a laptop bag that i love , however , it is falling apart i bought this one to replace it this bag is very large it is my fault because i did n't look at the dimensions it is also somewhat cheap <unk>
this bag is much slimmer and sleeker than the other laptop bags i 've had i * love * that it has a <unk> guarantee and that the straps are adjustable the lining is bright , making it much easier to find things than in other bags i 've used previously update as of # march # : this bag is not yet six months old and the top of the straps is falling apart i still love everything else about the bag , but now i am wondering how much longer it will last yes , i use the bag daily for work , but it 's carried from my house to my car to my office and back -- a total of about # minutes per day
great bag , fully functional and very <unk> looking but now that i 've used it for about # weeks , the handle edges are beginning to ` peel ' away i took a photo but not sure if i can post it i 'm disappointed by this and am not sure how the handles will hold up moving forward
this is n't a bad purse for people who do n't want to spend $ # on a carrying case it looks good and feels pretty sturdy the shoulder strap did wear out pretty quickly , the threads are all coming out the sides of it , but it 's mostly a visual issue as the strap is still sturdy
i ordered a magenta interior as designated in the ad what i received was a clearly <unk> `` pink `` which was very bright i was a little disappointed but i decided i could live with it as it took over a week to be delivered and i needed to be able to transport my computer the tote is light weight and it fits my # . # `` dell xs it zippers closed with no problems and it can be used as a large shoulder bag although it may give the appearance of leather it has a slight plastic bag smell which has not yet gone away all in all , it is handy , light weight , and easy to carry
i have had the bag now # months i carry back and forth to the office every day and also have flown with it a few times the bag is holding up well so far you can really cram a ton of stuff into this thing i bought the bag just because i loved the pink interior i like that it has the squared off bottom so it sits up nice if behind the car seat or next to my desk i 've gotten several compliments on how cute the bag is , and it was definitely a bargain the only reason i 'm not giving this # stars is because the straps should be padded i know it would take away from the looks a bit but i find the bag uncomfortable to carry when it 's full , especially through an airport or walking long distances i have to hold the straps when i walk , otherwise they fall off my shoulder
i have loved this bag - it goes on many trips with me and holds my # inch dell and books and supplies very well unfortunately , within a few months the straps were beginning to <unk> now they are all but busted through - though the rest looks just a good as when i bought it i am now looking for a new one or some strap covers so i can keep this one
i love the pink interior , like that it is fully padded inside , yet sleek however , after exactly # months , the straps are ripping out of the exterior granted my laptop is heavy and the charger is a brick , but my last laptop bag lasted eight years i do see comments that there is a guarantee on the bag , so i 'm happy i can just exchange it
got this as a christmas present for the wife and she was very pleased with it she uses it everyday to carry her laptop and assorted files back and forth to work and home and looks good doing it so far it has held up well and does the intended job
this bag is very functional and stylish it 's professional but also has a great style that will go with any outfit made of quality material and has several compartments on the inside overall it 's a great bag
i wanted to make sure i wrote a review for this bag i have bought probably three bags trying to find a bag i can keep my electronics -lrb- kindle or ipad -rrb- in as we 'll as my items from my purse i finally found it with this bag the pink color is really bright , but a nice contrast to the black the outside can easily be cleaned with a cloth , the bottom is made to be able to stand the bag up there are two sides i use one as a purse that has extra pockets for my phone an ipod and the other side that is padded my laptop would even fit in kind of a big bag for me as being # ' # but works well for y needs
this bag is a very dark grey color on the outside and very hot pink on the inside it fits my # inch laptop and is very easy to sling on my shoulder and carry i am able to carry the cord and the wireless mouse as well as much more this was a great buy
i had a bag just like this that my company had purchased for me several years ago i am really hard on things like this because i carry so much stuff around i wore the first one completely out i had looked for new bags , but the really pricey ones did n't hold as much stuff when i found this one i was so happy , because not only did i get my great bag back , i got a great price it does look and feel like leather once you break it in a little
i have had this bag for over # years and though it is fraying now , i keep <unk> every other bag i buy and going back to it it holds everything with style i have finally worn a hole in it from daily use the large outer pocket makes finding key easy my laptop fits and it holds a file or two i keep debating whether i really want to buy a leather bag or give up and buy another one of these
this bag meets my every need i use this to carry my hp envy laptop and it can hold everything else when i purchased it , i did n't realize it came with a # year warranty , so that was a nice surprise i highly recommend this tote
i just bought this bag for my new toshiba # . # `` laptop it fits comfortably in its ' place the velcro holds it in place and there 's still room for my other things when i opened my amazon box my dad actually though it was real leather it 's an awesome bag , it 's <unk> pink inside , but i did n't want the other colors , so i 'll manage lol it 's bigger than most bags but i 'm # ' # and i think it 's more comfortable than most of my other purses
i bought this for my daughter to carry her laptop , ipad , books , etc to college it is the perfect size to be able to carry everything she needs and it has great compartments for her to not need to carry an additional purse the magenta lining is a great color to be able to find random items in the bottom of the bag
i love this laptop bag i allows me to carry not just the laptop but a few other items in the same bag it has plenty of space and different pockets to store different items i love this bag
the zipper on the main compartment broke after only using it a few times the stitching and fabric are fine , but a case that does not close is not much good i would return it , but do not have the time
this bag has no room for anything the front pocket really does n't open you need to really squeeze your hand in there to get whatever you want from the front and back pockets i ca n't return it , because i really need a bag on a daily basis i will buy a different bag soon enough
be careful when using this laptop bag with your laptop the shoulder strap comes off easy if you are not careful while you are carrying your laptop i was carrying my laptop in this bad , the strap came loose , and my laptop hit the ground and cracked this <unk> twice so now i carry the bag using the handle
i bought this bag , because i thought the material was the same stretchy material company 's often use to make laptop `` sleeves . i would have bought a `` sleeve `` but they never have handles and a shoulder strap i am a consultant and carry many items so i wanted something simple , slim and decent looking this is simple , and kind of slim , but not good looking and very cheap quality for someone who does n't care much , this is okay i would n't recommend though for someone who cares about the quality and look i also have a # . # inch screen laptop and it fits very tight in the bag
it is well designed and build -lrb- stiches -rrb- but the materials seemed cheap than expected i bought # for the company 's laptop for my co workers and so far they works okay for the past few weeks it does get dirty but there is no need to get any expensive ones as they are normally replaced within a year
i 'm not here to bring down the willingness to buy this product for anyone else i 'm more here to inform anyone that this product is like the picture in the default photo , and the customer pictures but it is not like the other product items where it shows extra space and such i guess i was in a <unk> land to think the bag would come with all the room that was `` promised `` in the # other product pictures just a fair warning other than that i like the bag came with a shoulder strap shipping : came the day before the first day of expected arrival
i needed a bag for my laptop and this was perfect not too big and not too small just right for what i need it for i 'm very glad i purchased it
the pictures on the amazon web site do not all match the product ... they are showing different products what you are getting is a `` sleeve `` which does n't have much storage but for $ # after rebate it will do the job
based on posted pictures i was expecting more spacious and better quality but just ok for my # `` notebook pc better than a basic sleeve not the right choice if your are looking for more space for accessories and other stuff
our # . # `` display notebook fits just fine the pocket is big enough to hold the power supply and a mouse , and it has a shoulder strap not real stylish , but it does the job
a good price and a perfect fit fits like a glove on my # in laptop , with a nice outside pocket to slip in papers although no place for a mouse , i set it on top and zip it up seems fairly strong and has a removable strap
this case , at a very economical price is just what is needed i have a # . # `` acer laptop and it fits snugly , with outside pockets on front and on the back of the case , to carry the power adapter , or anything else you might need other reviewer noted , just like i do , that the picture that is shown in the page for this case is different than what is shipped the one in the picture looks like a higher priced case than this one it is a small complaint , but something i wanted to point out
received this product just fine it 's exactly what i had expected , i just wish it had a tiny bit more padding for protection , but you get what you pay for and since i do n't travel , it will be just fine
this case just barely holds my # in dell there is enough room to fit it and all the cords in the case , but i knew that it would be hard to find a case big enough to fit my larger screen good quality so far
i bought this bag for my husband to use for his computer and a small scanner to replace one he had had for years it is a great little bag for just the computer and scanner but his little wireless network device is too large for the small pocket and tends to slide around inside the larger pocket it needs a safer pocket for an air card to go overall a good bag though
ok , got my first notebook , wow such technology had to get toys for it so i purchased the sleeve to place it in now , to be honest i am new to this and did n't quite understand the difference between the sleeve and other types of cases , but i do now i like the sleeve because it 's so light , not bulky at all , and so easy to use hope this helps ,
this bag is nice and solid but my son has a custom built # & # # ; laptop and it barely fits in the beg so if <unk> laptop is thicker than normal , then it might not fit it . great product otherwise
nice , basic bag it does what it is supposed to do by protecting the laptop when traveling we use it when we need to take our laptop on a trip so that it is n't jostled around with our other items
this was everything i hoped for but just a little tall i needed the width for my widescreen so there is some dead space other than that , i like it because it 's simple , light , and affordable
i was a little worried when i saw some people stating this bag was too small for their laptop , but my # `` dell fits nicely there 's enough padding to keep it safe , the pockets are good , and there 's room enough for my adapter , cord , mic , mouse and papers the bag feels sturdy and seems to be holding up well shoulder strap is a bonus
great looking bag , gets the job done does n't get # stars because the pockets are very small and the strap is a little bit flimsy would n't put much in it beyond the laptop , even if it was on my shoulder i 'd still hold onto the hand holds just in case
i do n't expect to use it much , as i am home with my laptop most of the time it does have extra pockets and sections , but it is a tight fit for the occasional use to take the lap top with you on a trip , this is ok and worth the money if it was getting the same use as my work laptop where i am traveling almost everyday , it might not hold up
i ordered this product not to long ago for college i got it in the mail , very quickly and was sort of pleasantly surprised when i saw it the look of it was very nice and sleek , but the only thing i wish i would have known was that the padding is not very thick in it the good thing is that it has plenty of room so you can put lose papers in side of it as well , or maybe even a binder it is also a good case if you want to put your laptop in it then put it into a book bag because it is not bulky and very light weight over all i would recommend this product to someone else
i bought this for my hubby he has not yet used it he is waiting for his other carring case to give out then will use it look good and sturdy
i thought that this would hold a # inch laptop but it will not the case itself is only # inches so you would probably only fit a # inch one in there quality seems decent for the price but i did not ever actually use it
perfect bag for the price i was quite happy i wish it had one more zipper pocket , but i was able to fit my charger and some other accessories very easily i recommend it
this is a nice looking bag and will be just fine for the few times i will need one i think the fit is a bit tight , but then i guess you do n't want your laptop slamming around inside the case either there are some external pockets which add to the value ; i think it is good to <unk> <unk> items from the laptop itself these pockets add to the bulk of the case however and may be cause for being smashed into the top of the computer not sure , maybe side pockets would be better all in all i feel it is a good deal for what i want
this is a very good bag my # & # # ; laptop fits perfectly the quality is very good plenty of room for the cord and mouse comfortable to carry by either the hand or shoulder strap
case works well - probably the closest to a custom fit as you can get - the g # catches slightly going in if you go back first but if you go front first it slips right in ample storage for the usual accessories , mouse , ethernet <unk> , power supply in the velcro closure flap - probably add # or # <unk> and still fit nicely flap has a <unk> velcro closure and it stayed secure on a # <unk> airplane trip - got back with everything i left with has a rear pocket with a single velcro closure which worked well for carrying flight documents and <unk> there is padding but it 's minimal but appears sufficient it definitely wo n't take anything bigger than a # . # `` widescreen laptop but for anything that size or smaller it 's an excellent and inexpensive alternative
i looked for a long time to find this case , i even looked at dell to find a case to fit this big laptop i finally found one here it 's roomy and fits my computer even with a sleeve on it i like that it <unk> shoulder strap and carrying handles together not a flashy case , which is fine with me have n't <unk> alot yet , so i can not really comment on it 's durability at this time overall though i am very <unk> this product
arrived well packaged , on time , and in good order it was easy to install , and there have been on problems with it my larger laptop fits nicely , and there are plenty of pockets for accessories
when i ordered this sleeve that 's what i expected to get but this sleeve gives you enough space for you charger , documents etc . . bargain at this price would recommend to anyone looking for a sleeve that has enough room but is not bulky like the ordinary bag
this bag is perfect for my asus laptop and has a few extra dividers for more items i usually travel with my # & # # ; laptop and my # . # & # # ; tablet and this bag fits both with all the chargers and even a wireless mouse definitely will buy again if ever needed shipping and processing was quick
