i am using this for my toshiba # netbook it fits perfectly and i just love looking at the hip pop art design keep up the good work , digittrade
my mbp fits in here perfectly i wish there was a pocket for the cord but it 's really no big deal for the novelty and price mine does n't smell anymore -lrb- the tire scent stopped after a few days -rrb- and it just looks cool it 's such an awesome thing that i mislead my friends as to where i got it
this is a very attractive neoprene cover to transport my laptop the design nicely complements my computer as well it is lacking any kind of pocket though , which would be useful
would give it ten stars if i could this came as soon as i expected it to i love it it 's machine washable i washed it once and i 'm pretty sure i air dried it to just be safe i always get compliments on it it fits my # in and my # . # in
this case was nice because it was one of the few that was not designed only to fit a # inch macbook pro and since i have a # inch sony viao this is rather important it is rather cute too , which is often my other gripe in general , it keeps my computer safe , which is good because i take it with me everywhere i have gotten multiple compliments on it , which while not integral is certainly a plus most importantly , the zipper is strong and the padding good and for $ # that is hard to beat
it 's true that the sleeve is more green than sepia , but it doesnt actually bother me sleeve is basically exactly what i wanted moreover , my cover did n't have a strong smell that other reviewers mentioned overall , very pleased
i bought this for my gf 's # macbook it has a snug fit and great cushion to protect its <unk> surface it had a smell when it was delivered , but it went away after two days also , it can be stained if you do n't watch where you put it i used a magic eraser to remove the stain with ease
very true to color i love this case i bought it to cary my macbook pro that already had a <unk> case and it fits in perfectly , its snug with out all that move around room i love it and it is very tick and durable
it looks even better in person got it as a gift for my cousin who is a huge fan of retro everything he loved the design , and most importantly , the quality and the feeling his laptop was safe
i bought this sleeve not for my laptop -lrb- i also bought the same type of sleeve but # `` for the laptop -rrb- but for the external hard drive it is really cute thing . i like it very much very useful and no problem with damaging the hdd
fantastic <unk> to this cover perfectly snug fit for my laptop and with the thickness it offers some reasonable protection for short distance <unk> great product for the money and would highly recommend and buy again
you have a laptop , you want to protect it , why not protect it in style this company has really cool designs and their prices are reasonable so why get some plain <unk> case i never do plain i 'm the type of person that changes their computer wallpaper constantly because i get bored and need visual <unk> so i demand the same from my accessories
leaves a bit of wiggle room for current gen # `` macbookpros but it is solid sort of smelly in a weird plastic way when it comes out of the packaging though ... but it goes away in a few days so no complaints here
like most cases for any laptop you really do n't know what your getting online , i took a chance anyway , and i have never looked back i get compliments all the time , and everyone wants to know where i got it amazon baby ! !
this fits my dell inspiron # ' laptop perfectly not too tight or to loose i noticed a comment about someone adding a strap resulting in her sleeve falling while breaking her laptop i personally have not yet tried this the colors are very vivid brighter than in the picture
it is hard to find sleeves for a # in . laptop that have a bit of personality to them this one does and it is reasonably priced i am happy with it so far i have not used it extensively yet so i ca n't say anything <unk> to durability it does appear to be well made
this bag is beautiful and a great price it did not come with a shoulder strap but i was able to find a matching pink shoulder strap that came with a # dollar lunch box and use that the netbook fits perfectly in the bag -lrb- although nothing else fits in it -rrb- so it is somewhat protected
this case is anyone who was <unk> before the # s this case is great and super soft you will get a lot of compliments the price is perfect this case will protect your laptop
it was actually grey with the flowers , but it is exactly what i desired to hold my laptop there is a strong chemical smell once opened , but i 've been letting it air out i do n't have the laptop for it yet anyway no loose threads or signs of poor construction
i know some have complained about the smell of this product at first it did have a little smell from the fabric i left it opened and aired it out for a day and it was fine i do n't think the initial odor is any thing more than a synthetic product in a hot box while shipped the fit is nice and tight the padding is good for the price
when i recieved the product it looked just like the picture and i didnt even notice the smell that other people had commented on the colors are vibrant and the material feels amazing im very pleased
it 's a standard laptop cover that does the job of covering and protecting a # `` laptop it 's a great size for fitting into a backpack and protecting it from the bust and grind of school life , while not taking up too much space the best thing about it is the funky cover and the great price for a # `` sleeve , the only thing that it could use is a carry strap
she loves it while it did have the smell many reviewers have commented on it aired out within a day or two and is just fine it has room to carry a power cord or extra battery pack since we got # `` one and as i said , she loves it
this is a very cute laptop sleeve it has a plastic <unk> <unk> on it which i knew already from reading reviews about it its not a printed fabric it has very vibrant fun girly colors and it fits my # . # `` laptop perfectly it has loops for a strap but it does not come with one which i also knew from other reviews i 've had it for about # months now and so far its holding up well and the screen print has not started to peel maybe someday but its holding well i like it
fits my # . # & # # ; samsung chromebook perfectly the dual zippers work smoothly and there is no room to slosh around inside ideal for keeping your item from getting dinged up in a larger bag plus , it 's just cool
i absolutely love this sleeve it 's cool , and the feeling is very high quality i feel much better knowing that my laptop is protected by it instead of being exposed to all the other stuff i have to carry around in my bag the smell people might notice goes away in a few days , and you ca n't feel it if the sleeve is closed definitely all that i was hoping for
at first when i purchased this item , i thought it was going to be cheap , but it actually is a very good quality case it 's thick and the material certainly protect my laptop the zipper is also very sturdy , the only thing is too bad it does n't come with a strap
i got this for my # . # `` laptop and it fits perfectly its made really well and so cute i 've yet to see someone with this particular case the only issue i had with it was the same as a few other reviews mentioned , it smells i tried letting it air out for a few days and finally just washed it that reduced the smell greatly and it seems to have faded away otherwise this is perfect , i love it
i use this daily my computer stays in this whenever i am not using it it fits great i like the <unk> for the computer it suits my purpose well thank you amazon
overall nice case design goes nicely with my notebook it fits my # . # inch gateway like a glove i do wish it came with a handle but it is a good case for the
i got this for my sister and she loves the design it 's well made and fits her macbook perfectly it 's a great sleeve to protect the computer if you do n't want a bulky bag
i 'm a college student and i use my macbook pro for everything in every class so i transport it a lot this case has provided excellent protection and helped my computer endure being tossed in backpacks and the trunk of my car and still look brand new and it fits my macbook like a glove i 've used it for # semesters now and the zipper -lrb- which i abuse with frequent use -rrb- shows no sign of wear and tear and neither does the case itself i get compliments on it in almost every class - the colors are even more vibrant than the photos and if you get it dirty it 's easy to wash with a wet cloth overall extremely pleased , could n't ask for a better case
this case is decently padded , has a nice design , and fits a # . # `` toshiba laptop there is a strong <unk> smell right out of the package , but that dissipates over a couple days updated review : had this case over a year now and i love it
i usually do n't leave any reviews , but it took me a while to search for a laptop sleeve for my # `` mac book pro and finally make a decision on this one i am very happy i did i received it quickly and use it everyday like the description says , it is a little bigger , but i personally have liked the additional material to grab onto when i reach for my laptop there is n't too much cushion , but i bought the sleeve as a protective cover when i put my laptop into my school bag and it does just that -- & looks good too super cute , good quality , and great price
recently purchased a new # . # `` sager laptop and was looking for something to protect it while in my messenger bag fits perfectly and the build quality is excellent digittrade also has many cool designs ; i had trouble deciding which to purchase will likely buy another for my older laptop
i should have bought the strap for this sleeve it fits my # . # in lap top perfectly but the laptop fits a little too perfect in my backpack , i would have preferred something with handles
fits my dell # r perfectly the design is bright and cute i did n't want something with a strap , i just wanted a sleeve so the lack of strap does n't bother me a carrying handle would be a nice touch though as other reviewers mentioned , it does stink straight out of the package i 've certainly smelled worse and it 'll dissipate as time goes on very satisfied for the price
this laptop sleeve fits my # `` macbook perfectly , and it is very well made it is so much prettier in person - the colors are nice and vibrant there is a bit of a smell when you open it , but it is not overwhelming and can easily be aired out . overall , i am very pleased with it
i was in a hurry to get a sleeve for a new laptop before a trip the sleeve arrived in a hurry , as promised it 's nice to have something with a little color and design ; but not too much the zipper makes it easy to get on and off the only thing i would add is a little tab on corner to make a mini handle for pulling it out of my carry-on
the shipping was quick and my # <unk> daughter loves her case it seems to be of good quality neoprene and has good seams it looks just as the picture it is cool
i like this laptop cover as others have said , it does have a strong odor when it 's brand new i let mine air out for a couple of weeks before i used it the odor disappeared completely it 's well-made and i believe it will protect my macbook pro i like the cherry <unk> design
i am very happy with this computer case it fit 's my hp pavilion dv # z -lrb- # . # in -rrb- really well the design is on both sides of the case and the neoprene is thick enough to protect my computer the zipper and metal loops on each side are really heavy duty also i would highly recommend the cases from this seller
this is a beautiful laptop cover i use it everyday in order to keep dust off of my laptop it is n't large so i can store my laptop just as easily as if it was not in the cover i have n't used it as a purse , but there are hooks on either side so you can attach a strap to it if you want
i ordered this laptop sleeve as a graduation gift for a # . # laptop it worked perfectly the colors were beautiful and my granddaughter loved it i did n't think that the smell was as bad as i thought it might be after reading some of the reviews overall , great product and price ! !
i got this <unk> sleeve for my # ' laptop and it fits perfect the design is nice and different i really like it , but the only thing is that i am not sure if it will be a good for idea for a # . # ``
using a # -inch laptop keeping it from getting scratched is a task thank goodness from digittrade makes a fine sleeve to protect from the <unk> easy to use and well made with cool graphics to boot thanks digittrade & amazon
i 'm really happy with my purchase of this item it 's a very high quality sleeve that is well padded and snuggly fits my # `` macbook pro the fact that there 's two zippers so i can zip it to either side or to the middle is extremely nice the optional strap hooks on either side are a nice bonus i would definitely recommend this product
this case fit my # . # in laptop great it keeps my laptop safe even when i put it in my tight fit backpack i get a lot of complements on it too you can also tell that it is made of quality materials from its feel
i bought this for my # `` macbook pro it fits very nicely and is nicely padded the zippers are of a high quality and i would order this again the green leaf design is just as bright as it looks <unk> i had no problems with a smell after letting it air out for a day , but do agree that the huge box it arrives in from amazon is a big overkill
works fits my dell xps # even with the # cell battery on the material is pretty nice stretches and have decent packing so the computer is well protected . i recommend this
i had to order it because it looks just like the <unk> tapes i used to record everything on back in the day it does have a smell , but it 's not that serious looks much better in person
this case is good for carrying your laptop in another bag it has metal rings you could attach a strap to in order to carry it alone , but it does n't come with a strap the design is pretty and the padding is thicker than other cases at the same price
i love the colors of this laptop case , and the shipping was fast i got the # . # inch one i will definitely recommend this product to others digittrade <unk> # <unk> designer notebook sleeve # `` laptop cover neoprene soft carry case up to # . # inch anti shock
super sweet ! haha nicely padded and just fit my # . # `` laptop with room to slid in the mouse and charger cable give it a day or two out of the packaging to air out and that should be that
i scoured all of amazon 's totes to find the perfect one for my new ipad # i wanted a shoulder strap , ample storage , cute design and a top-loading pocket that does n't zip all around the side with this tote i got everything but the cute design i absolutely <unk> the <unk> color but i 'm keeping this tote anyway after going through three different designs already the shoulder straps are nice and long but not too long plenty of space for a portable keyboard and charger and a more unique design than i have seen anywhere else on amazon but please , pretty please offer us at least one other color choice besides this hideous fuchsia not every girl likes pink , y ' know
i bought this to use as a case for my ipad it is really a good cover but i wish it were just a little bit wider so that i could use it to put folders in as well
use it all the time plus it does n't look like you are carrying an ipad just enough room for other stuff great for a woman who is sick of the usual good job , belkin
this is a great day-to-day carrier for the motorola xoom -lrb- or similar # . # inch tablet -rrb- the tablet easily slides in and out , there are two small pockets on the outside for <unk> etc . , and larger pockets for <unk> items the straps are a good length for comfort
i really love this bag thanks amazon the bag is a perfect fit for my ipad # with the leather case on plus room for my iphone # s & other <unk> i ordered it on monday evening and it was delivered wednesday morning this bag really is <unk> without being bulky , & secures my ipad with an awesome sturdy quality ! ! i 'll rate it a #
the belkin # . # `` netbook women 's tote is ideal for carrying my # . # `` netbook with me it has pouches for my power chord , and for my cd/dvd peripheral it can even hold my wallet and avoid having to carry a purse plus it looks nice and has a very durable set of shoulder straps the netbook sleeve inside the tote also protects my netbook - no scratches , dings , or problems even if i dropped the tote finally - amazon 's price was way lower than local stores perfect all the way around
i have been searching for this bag everywhere my first one was stolen with the laptop in it earlier this year so i knew i 'd need another to hold my replacement one day thank god amazon has it since <unk> no longer carried it this bag , ladies , has the perfect cushioning for your # . # `` netbook i used to carry the laptop cord with other accessories and sneak in other items like school notebooks etc . and it still did n't show any bulges -lrb- now do n't <unk> now -rrb- the fabric it 's made from is strong and durable and i personally love the look i really believe you will too
although this item was shipped promptly , it had several scratches on it it looks as though i purchased a used cover when in fact , it was suppose to me new
this was the case i knew i wanted as i have had speck cases before the actual apple store i go to was sold out of cases so i figured i 'd try amazon because i do a lot of shopping here the color is great and exactly what i wanted , the case fits perfectly - but when i opened it up the case already had scratches on it i know that 's what the case is for to protect the computer and inevitably it will end up scratched but i was pretty bummed to open my new case and see it already had scratches
when i received the case it was scratched when you use it fingerprints are left everywhere so you constantly have to clean it the best thing about the product is the color
the color is a little more red than pictured if i were to describe it it 's kind of an iron man red it fits well and protects the case well only thing i do n't like about it is that is shows my finger prints but that 's to be expected i do n't change my case but it seems like that 's going to be a little difficult overall good product and price
the case fits well and works just as expected i love the color it is a bit darker than it looks on the computer , but other than that i have no complaints
it 's a very nice color and it 's easy to put on i feel like it offers good protection for my macbook my only complaint is that it easily gets smears all over it from fingerprints , but it does n't bother me that much it comes with a sweet cleaning cloth so at least they were thinking ahead
i ordered this because it said it was for the aluminum unibody macbook what it fails to mention is that it is for the older white macbooks , like the product packaging says i was <unk> when i realized my slightly newer macbook would n't quite fit i 'm giving only # stars because i think the description should say it is for the white macbooks it did ship fast , and was in perfect condition i do recommend this brand of case
exactly what i needed to protect my work computer as a traveling teacher , i needed something durable yet fun this arrived quickly , was easy to snap on , and looks great it 's definitely durable and holds up to me moving around all day other staff and students have commented on the color and love it definitely worth the money
i <unk> on writing my review because i really wanted to break in the product i carry my laptop everyday , and this cover does the trick very durable and fits like a glove i love it
the package came in factory sealed which was good it even came with a speck cleaning cloth i snapped it on my macbook pro # and it fit perfectly one con , fingerprints are unavoidable . it 's just so shiny that it catches everything very nice color , and the best part i like is that when i open my mac , i can still see the apple logo shine in the back
i look at reviews when i buy something so i thought it might help if this product had one if the product matches your laptops specs then this case will work well the cranberry color is true to the picture and getting it on my laptop was pretty self <unk> but it did come with instructions if they 're needed i have n't experienced any issues but there was a complaint on another review for a similar product about the case rubbing and scratching the computer i imagine that this is similar to cell phone cases and i plan on handling the problem by routinely taking the case off and wiping away any particles that may have gotten in the cracks
i thought there would be sufficient padding for my brand new laptop , unfortunately that 's not what i got it is very thin and less than # months after i ordered it , a strap broke off if it had come with an over-the-shoulder strap it would have helped but for now i have to carry the whole thing hopefully they give me a refund , i would n't bother with this case at all ; if the strap broke while i was carrying it and it fell on the ground , it would definitely be damaged
this bag is marketed as a neoprene sleeve when i think of neoprene , i think of something with a good bit of cushioning this may technically be neoprene , but it is so thin , it may as well be fabric for the cushioning factor also since it is marketed as a sleeve , i assumed it would be a tight fit my # `` macbook pro is very loose in this , further limiting any cushioning effect at the corners if you want a sack to carry your laptop this may suffice , but if looking for a cushioning sleeve , i would look elsewhere i buy a lot of stuff on amazon , and i rarely ever return anything , but i am returning this
first , i do most of my shopping on amazon and you ca n't beat the free shipping when spending over $ # but the <unk> policy is not the great on amazon if you carry the product then they should honor the guarantee what 's the point in shopping with them i placed this mobile edge laptop case order early feb # and went on vacation # and three weeks later , one side of the handle is coming apart also the gray trim part on the case has fuzzy threads showing up with in the first week however , mobile edge company has a lifetime warranty witch is why i pick this case plus love the look of the design , the easy of zipper closing and opening and my laptop glides right into the bag that 's why i still rate this # stars anyway . : - -rrb- i 'm am going to contact mobile edge and see if i can exchange for another case just like it i 'll keep you posted regarding me response on the exchange
i love this case so much i had one for my # & # # ; mac and i just got this one for my # & # # ; it is so durable it made it through # years of undergrad and # years of grad school and was very good quality i would buy one of these cases again -lrb- i actually did ! i love the pocket for my plug and mouse you will not regret your purchase of this product
the zipper broke on my old incase neoprene sleeve after three years of using it -lrb- i used it every day ! -rrb- , so when it was time to replace it , i opted for this sleeve i like the handle feature and the extra zipper pouch on the outside i can fit the charger in it this is great and compact & # # ; it works to carry alone or to put in another bag or backpack
nice product but extremely <unk> for my day to day use with my laptop or ipad i carry with me a notepad , # calculators , macbook air or ipad and some cables and till it 's not ergonomic enough with the strap due to this i 've only been able to use the briefcase # times and the super strap was & # # ; junk & # # ; . i 've requested the seller to try to exchange the product for a more suitable model <unk> the response
this is the nicest briefcases i have ever owned the color is gorgeous and the leather looks very high end quality , soft and supple with nice stitching and brass <unk> it is nice and roomy and handsome inside will hold a laptop or tablet and several files or books shoulder strap is comfortable highly recommend and would do well for women or men
purchased this item for my wife for a christmas present # however , received notification that it was out of stock and would probably not be available again until february the manufacturer 's customer <unk> were excellent in that they kept me advised as to the status of the order on a <unk> basis so that i ended up making it a valentine 's day # gift for my wife now to the product itself my wife loves it ! she takes great pride in using it for work every day -lrb- she is a professional executive manager in the financial industry -rrb- and has received numerous positive comments from other <unk> and employees just looking at the product the quality of the materials and workmanship is apparent you get what you pay for and in the case of this item it is well worth it
what a quality looking and feeling bag i bought , tried and sent back three other messenger bags before settling on this one all of the attachments feel pretty robust -lrb- although not as solid feeling as the <unk> hardware -rrb- smells great too for the money , ca n't beat it
the briefcase was on <unk> but worth the wait customer service was excellent and kept me informed about arrival the bag 's odor is that of fine <unk> too strong happy with purchase
i chose this bag over relatively cheap -lrb- ~ $ # -rrb- leather laptop bags for a young professional this is a great bag swiss gear has a good reputation and holds up very well there is a lot more space than i expected in the front `` utility `` type pocket all the bulge that you can see in the product picture is contained within that front pocket the laptop pocket has less padding than i expected , but i doubt this will be an issue also , because my laptop -lrb- # `` thinkpad -rrb- is not wide enough to fill the entire space , when carrying with the shoulder strap the sides of the bag fold <unk> slightly i would recommend to a friend
so i ordered this several years ago now and am just getting to a review this bag has traveled with me extensively and has been absolutely bulletproof i love not <unk> to take my laptop out while going through security at the airport it 's got pleanty of room for all of the gear and <unk> if there is an issue it 's that it allows me to take too much and i tend to overpack and it gets heavy , but that 's obviously my own issue you wo n't be disappointed with the purchase
i 've been more than pleased with the purchase of this wenger # . # ' notebook case i 'd looked around different stores in the mall and had noticed this brand in one of them , but they did n't carry the size i needed i found this on amazon and did some additional research on it and was certain this would meet my needs having used the product for over # weeks now , i can say i 'm completely satisfied with my purchase good quality , clean and professional design , great use of compartments , and the airport check friendly design is a great time saver when going through security i would definitely recommend others to try this
this wenger case was everything i expected and more i owned a previous , smaller version , but had upgraded to a larger screen laptop and the old bag was no longer viable this bag fit the new laptop as described , plus the extra space makes it perfect for those # day business trips to carry all your additional gear , files , etc .
after using this bag for # months i agree with the other reviews , this is a great bag for a # . # `` or smaller laptop it 's only # . # lbs so it 's light but has plenty of compartments i like the `` checkpoint `` friendly option the zippers are professional plenty of pockets all around great bag
this thing is not at all what they say it is they `` carbon fiber leather `` is maybe a half a mm thick and is not adhered to anything it feels like it will rip at any moment i sent it back twice the first time i got it i thought that the company had sent me a fake i eventually bought the case mate <unk> suite and it is what i hoped the xgear shadow would be it is sweet
do n't buy this product granted that once you receive it , put it on , and take a look ... it looks great ... for about # days then the corners wear off from simply putting it in and out of your bag then your # $ laptop looks like a cheap item from walmart then to make matters worse , the seller is terribly unprofessional and does n't care they refuse to accept any returns unless its `` unopened and in original packaging `` then they charge you a ridiculous restocking fee ! ! ! ! buyer beware ! ! ! you 'll regret it ! ! !
the product looks awesome , feels great like real carbon fiber although it 's nothing more than a textured vinyl layer but it really gives a great look and feel on top of great sturdy stylish rugged protection the product fits like a glove however due to lack of a better design to grab on to the casing of the macbook the grip latches get in the way of allowing a full contact closure with the opposing <unk> the laptop does fully close but if held any other way than upright the magnetized connection is not strong enough and it will pop - open overall i 'm # % satisfied and i love the product i would definitely buy it again and furthermore recommend it to others
the case overall is nice , good looking and protective that comes in handy considering how clumsy i am and how expensive macbooks are having said that the case is a little bulky and the plastic window is n't very secure in how it 's held in the screen does n't always open smoothly with the case getting in the way slightly also the charger fits a little strangely when the laptop is open and th case is on but these points are minor overall the case looks good and does what i need it to do , protect my laptop not great but pretty good
it is by far the most beautiful case i have ever seen and used it is leather with a carbon fiber look , and i got the matching iphone case i am amazed on how good it looks . the protection is great , but the carbon finish looks delicate so i guess i have to be careful worth the look mac pro best buy ! !
the xgear shadow case for the macbook # `` is a tough case the case looks <unk> and protects my computer like no other the inside of the case is lined with a soft felt as to no scratch the outer finish of the macbook the outside of the case is made of a <unk> material that resists scratching , feels and looks great , and does its job i do not know why other people are complaining about this as there is nothing to be complained about i have access to all of my ports , the apple logo is centered perfectly , and the case is a tight fit no instructions were included -lrb- nor needed -rrb- as it is extremely simple to put on i would recommend this case to anyone that does n't want to pay full price for a carbon fiber case but wants the look and feel of it
fits great , and looks great on my macbook pro i really like the carbon fiber look this will keep my macbook from getting scratched up a must have for the macbook owners
i 've been reading some of the reviews and i was skeptical before i decided to buy this protective case maybe the case that i got was the latest model of xgear that matches the macbook pro intel core i # that i bought recently the cutout openings are perfect , i have no problems running my power cable , no problems on inserting the usb flash drives or my sd cards i do n't see any interference with regards to heat dissipation and if ever there is , macbook pro users should bear in mind that macbook pro is made of aluminum the aluminum itself protects the macbook pro from overheating , this is one of the features that you paid for the inner side of this case is soft which gives you the assurance of not scratching the body of your macbook pro if i would compare the quality of this product with other competitors out there this wo n't go behind it will protect your macbook from minor impacts , not unless you are using your macbook in rugged <unk> and <unk> <unk> for the price compared to other protective cases plus the way they designed xgear where it shows the apple logo glowing , this is a great buy
i give this product an ok rating i do like the security pass-through feature , i have never been asked to remove my laptop , and it does work great my complaints are : this will not fit under an airplane seat , i have tried multiple times and can not make it fit secondly there are no pockets to store the small things other than these small issues it is a great quality bag , and i would recommend it
this is a typical bag , but i was disappointed with the storage area it 's nothing more than some netting attached to the lower section of one side everything you put in there falls out not too helpful at least it has handles on the outside
i bought this for my <unk> aspire as # # . # -inch black laptop - # hour battery life it seems to be put together pretty well and the price is great it 's just a little too snug for this particular notebook so snug that it 's kind of a pain to zip up around the corners of the notebook however , once zipped it does n't move at all still , it could 've used an extra # `` of room all the way around there is a tiny pocket inside but it does n't matter because there is <unk> no room for anything else besides the notebook next time i 'll just by a sleeve -lrb- no zippers -rrb-
convenient neoprene case for carrying around my netbook however the handle straps broke relatively early -lrb- within a month -rrb- and i do n't like how it is bulged when i put the laptop charger inside the case i think i should have gone with a hard case
while it does n't have room to carry any thing but the computer it does that well elastic holders in both the top & bottom allow using the computer after opening the case a great buy if all you need is to carry the netbook i recommend both the product & the seller
