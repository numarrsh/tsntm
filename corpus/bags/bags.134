i was getting ready for a trip to africa i needed something solid to carry my equipment in the backpack is nice to carry your stuff around in the airport i do n't like it as much when i am shooting because you have to take it off to access the equipment the backpack straps are solid and very comfortable
needed a photography bag to also hold my laptop and assorted electronics this backpack is great it has lots of room , very well padded and is able to keep you organized with lots of equipment i recommend it highly ...
when people say it is too big , believe them my # . # `` macbook pro swam in the compartment , and the bag in general was just too big to carry comfortably or practically i had to return it i love the look and design of the bag , i just could n't make it work for me :
i should have listened to the reviews before i bought this item people were n't lying about the buckle , i first thought that it would n't be a big deal , but it really is a pain to close you can just use the velcro but it would n't feel right i took this bag with me on campus with my laptop and # books and i did not enjoy carrying it around there is no padding for your shoulder and it is not comfortable at all it looks good in the pictures but it just did n't work out for me
this item is well built and handles everything you can put in it it has enough room for a laptop and books the laptop is cushioned well however if you but a fairly large load in the bag , the bottom of the flap around the metal clasp will rip way from the metal binding it does n't really affect the performance of the bag so far , but it make the bag look cheaper quality
the logo is just what it looks like in the picture , but it 's false advertising to show black having the actual product be at most a gray , not even a dark gray the pockets are nifty for pencils and such offers no padding for a laptop , but can easily handle # huge physics books
this bag was great and protects my laptop really well i have a few <unk> though the bag is <unk> larger than i anticipated it fits a # inch laptop pretty well there is a back velco piece that attaches the flap it 's starting to wear and become fuzzy i use the bag everyday hope this helps
i 've had this bag for a long time now i bought it as a laptop bag and also for <unk> this bag is great if you do n't need to carry very much it 's pretty weatherproof , has a nicely padded space for the laptop , and has convenient pockets for small objects this is not , however , a good bag for packing very heavy loads into the strap does not have any padding whatsoever and starts to get painful pretty quickly if you have a heavy laptop or are carrying very much at all the buckle can be difficult to get the strap through if you pack it too large , and is even a little tricky when it 's lightly loaded this is a good bag , unless you need to carry a lot of things
i loved everything about the design aspects of this bag , from the cool <unk> close thing to the bottle opener on the side and the <unk> design on the bag my only complaints would be that it is much lighter than the colour shown in the description picture i thought it would be a dark <unk> colour with a prominent contrast to the design , but it is actually a lighter grey with the design being a moderately darker grey the bag is huge a bit too large for everyday usage in my opinion -lrb- well for me anyways -rrb- and my stuff -lrb- i.e . notebooks , books , folders etc . -rrb- tend to slide a lot during transit but this bag is great as an overnight bag , i find that i can easily fit # towels , some <unk> , and some outing clothing inside with lots of room for my toothbrush and <unk> etc . overall , nice bag though would n't use it on a regularly basis and is misleading in colour and size
the overall product is ok but two issues # -rrb- no key ring tether no sign of it this sucks because i 'm tired of digging around the crap at the bottom of the bag to pull out the keys i hope i do n't <unk> their promised # year guarantee by sewing in something that should have been there from the start # -rrb- <unk> materials the cotton canvas shell is indeed `` earth friendly `` but i ca n't say the same for the nylon liner the initial finish looks ok though - overall decent value for the money
this is a very good bag it has plenty of room for all my stuff for class i do n't think the stap in the front is needed its a pain to undo and redo , the velco is enough but it looks nice there . :
any person who are looking for a bag to carry no only the laptop but <unk> stuff that <unk> to be save , this is the perfect bag you know that in the day by day we accumulate a lot of papers that goes round in places like the car backseat or in the pc desktop that steal all the spaces we can use in another way
i want to give it # . # stars , only for the simple reason that only one side has the metal fixture for the strap so i do n't know how long this bag will hold up the build quality seems good , but with the strap only stitched on i have a feeling it 'll fall off me like other bags i 've owned in the past the picture does n't quite look like the product it is a bit lighter in the dark gray which is fine the bag is extremely comfortable on my shoulders very roomy -lrb- fits my macbook pro and some textbooks just fine -rrb- , but it does n't look much bigger than any other messenger bag i 've owned i constantly get complements on it the bottle opener is a bit <unk> and i tried to open something with it once with no success there are tons of pockets that fit all kinds of things
it 's definitely one of the nice stylish messenger bags i 've had it 's huge , do n't let the picture fool you , it 's a very big bag a lot bigger than a regular messenger bag you can put a lot of stuff in there along with your laptop i have a dell xps # , it 's about # `` x # . # `` x # `` with # inch wide screen , it fits just fine with room to spare on the top i wish i got the light gray one because the print on the dark gray looks like you spilled something on your bag the buckle is a stylish design , but sometimes it 's a little frustrating to close , especially if you are in a hurry overall the bag is very big , works great and looks good , i also like the fact that it 's made with earth friendly cotton
love this bag ... it 's trendy but has tons of room for my laptop and all the gadgets that come with traveling my only wish for this bag is that there was some kind of padding for the shoulder strap toting the bag around between <unk> can become a bit painful with that fabric digging into one 's neck/shoulder
this is a great messenger bag it 's quite spacious , but still fits smaller laptops comfortably i only have two mild complaints - if you 're carrying a lot of stuff , the shoulder strap might start to hurt because it has no padding - with the way this laptop bag is closed -lrb- threading the strap through the metal piece -rrb- , a lot of wear is endured by the strap while it has n't started fraying or anything yet , i can imagine this may be a problem in the future i 've had it about # weeks now , and it does n't show any problems yet , though , so maybe this is a testament to how well these bags are made
this is an absolutely fantastic bag it carries my laptop , and any other school supplies that i need i like the overall design of the item i 've read the negative reviews about the strap on the outside of the bag , but to be honest it 's not as <unk> as i thought it was made out to be i would definitely recommend this to anybody looking for a messenger bag , it was money well spent
perfect for my over-sized laptop i had trouble finding messenger bags large enough it has great extra storage spaces the design and fabric are awesome and it rides nicely on my shoulder
i really like this bag it 's large enough to fit in all my books , notebooks and my laptop the nice thing also is that the strap is wide , which takes a lot of pressure off of my shoulder i 've had it for about # and a half weeks and i 've abused it a fair amount already , but it 's holding up well the pockets are nice ; all good places where things wo n't just pour out if you plop it on the floor i thought that i 'd hate the belt fastening feature because i thought it was the only way to secure it was closed but it 's not there 's a patch of velcro to assure the bag is closed when you just throw the flap down and this does the job just fine in a little less time than a belt fastener all in all , great amount of space , nice functionality and nice appearance to boot
it was definitely not as dark gray as advertised , but other than that this bag is fantastic it 's huge and all my books plus my laptop fit without it being ridiculously heavy i love it
its a big spacious bag really good for college students who need to <unk> laptops with them but also there is a back pocket when you do n't have you enough room inside the bag not only that they included at zipper part for important you want to keep safe i would recommend this to anyone who carries a laptop where ever they go
good sturdy construction , cool design , plenty of space for accessories the bottle opener is a nice touch , if all else it looks like a cool buckle i really recommend this product
better than i thought it would be everyone always asks where they can get one the strap to close it is a little annoying but other than that , it is worth every penny
i got this bag for me couple of weeks ago , and so far it has been good looks good as well the ipod pocket given on the front , only fits ipod nano also the flap which slides in <unk> is sometimes a <unk> to slide in but thats fine to sum up its a good bag even if you dont use it as a laptop
this bag is great <unk> of pockets , and it 's huge probably about # inches , not # like advertised -lrb- which is a good thing ! it 's also good quality and looks like it 'll last a long time the only two problems with this bag are # it 's a lighter colour than in the picture now , i was expecting this due to the reviews i read , but it is still disappointing it would be really annoying to do it up every time you close the bag again i just leave it open though and it 's fine
what a great product suprised my girlfriend for christmas with this great bag for people on the go she is an artist , namely graphic design , now she looks even more organized with all those # % s ' also great for the now smaller <unk> ' and peripherals
i got my bag like maybe two or three days after ordering and this thing is huge my mac is only # in but i also carry around my notebooks and textbooks along with various chargers in the side pockets i feel like i can <unk> a <unk> country in this thing definitely recommend for anyone whose a <unk> like me .
my daughter wanted a sturdy , cool carrying case for her laptop at college & we got it quickly -lrb- just before she moved out & started school -rrb- she loves it and it was reasonably priced
i have an earlier model of this bag its essentially the exact same thing but without the additional velcro in the front flap and without the bottle opener thing in the strap but i love this bag , it 's extremely sturdy and well put together i constantly use it every day , i 've take it everywhere and it 's help up nicely i also love that there 's plenty of room for everything in the bag i keep books , papers and all kinds of <unk> accessories with no problem i 'd be heart broken if mine were to be lost or was broken in some fashion , but i wouldnt hesitate to purchase another as a replacement i highly recommend this bag
i love this product it 's quite attractive and comfortable it almost molds to your body i like its accents of personality i use it as a bag for school , for life , work , and sometimes even a purse
i bought this for my # `` macbook to protect it from scratches when i transport it it fits snugly , is easy to pull on , and is pretty to boot i would buy it again
even though the cardboard insert says it 's designed for # `` macbook air , this works great for my new # `` macbook beautiful puffy / `` # <unk> `` red flower pattern the opening is kind of weird , so putting in and taking out my laptop is kind of cumbersome the flap does n't flip out all the way to the top , but rather is `` hinged `` near the middle it 's not worth more than $ # though if you spend a little bit more money -lrb- ~ $ # - $ # -rrb- you can get yourself a good zip-up sleeve , which is much more convenient to insert and take out your laptop than this one
i used this consistently when i first purchased it and it works great to tote my computer along and keep it clean my computer is old and dirty now and i have a mini ipad that fits in my purse now the beautifully designed case logic works great for storing all of the electronics i have <unk> from my teenage daughter until she brings her grades up
this case is perfect for my # `` macbook pro fits nice and snug , no annoying zippers , and makes it very easy to slip the whole lot in and out of my briefcase <unk> design too
i love this it 's the best thing ever i agree that it is n't really reversible because the stitching from the flower looks a bit odd it can be done , just not nearly as cute as when the flower faces out recommend this to anyone
i searched long and hard for the right case for my new aluminum macbook and i eventually decided on this one i 'm very happy with my decision it 's a perfect fit and there are no zippers to scratch the laptop the color is not quite as bright as it appears in the picture , it 's actually a very appealing darker red also the flower design is a more durable assembly than i thought it was going to be long story short , i highly recommend the case for your <unk> machine
i love my macbook sleeve it is easy to use and fits my computer like a glove i would never use it with the gray side out , so i do n't know if i 'd really consider it reversible it is very functional and looks great too
this is a good , cheap case to store your laptop in , but it 's a little unwieldy trying to carry it around the <unk> makes it kind of slide around in your hands when you try to carry it it keeps my laptop safe when i 'm carrying it in my backpack , but it would be nice if it was a little easier to carry on its own
this is cool sophisticated laptop sleeve , i would recommend it more for a # o # inch laptop that for a # i use it with a # `` and it fits well but not stretched so i think if you use it with a # it would loose fit
the sleeve is nice looking , it 's soft and it 's roomy not as roomy as a laptop carrying case but roomy enough to fit my laptop , my wireless mouse and the mouse pad in
i got this for my new alienware m # x the laptop is a monster , but this sleeve stretched just enough to fit snug i feel much better about transporting it now
i bought my # . # inch laptop six months ago and was looking for a cover so protect my laptop when i put it in my backpack i did n't want a laptop hard case or bag as i just wanted to slip it into my backpack for school i 'm not a huge fan of pink things but i really liked the look and feel of this as the <unk> states , it is made of neoprene -lrb- usually used for scuba diving suits -rrb- which makes it a little more <unk> if dropped i personally love it it 's perfect to keep my laptop safe from scratches and any external damage and it 's perfect for traveling as all the airports approve having the laptop in this type of screen the price may seem a tad steep but i found the product worth the price hope this helps
fits my asus g # vx -lrb- # inch laptop -rrb- very well , is a nice texture , and appears very well built i use it around the house when i do n't want to use a full backpack between my study and my bedroom
... that nifty inner sleeve case so <unk> <unk> in the photos -- the one reason i went with this bag and not a cheaper one -- is not included nowhere on the page does it say it is -lrb- it can be ordered separately -rrb- and , yes , i should have read the description more carefully but <unk> , talk about misleading
it has many pockets on the inside and out , and of different shapes and sizes perfect for someone who likes to stay organized the <unk> shoulder strap is nice and wide and comfortable and it appears to be quite strong the laptop slot is well padded and i never have to worry about my laptop being damaged a seam on the inside of the front flap is starting to give away it 's ripped about # `` long so far i had the bag about # months before it ripped
i picked this up on a today 's deal special and i was n't expecting how much i would like this bag this is perfect for a # inch laptop and has a slick appearance without any large flaps however , when you open the bag , you 'll be surprised to see that it <unk> out at the bottom which gives much more room to fit things i 'm able to fit a power adapter , # external drives , small belkin surge protector , and my iphone accessories without any bulges in the bag , as well as a few thin folders from the office this bag was designed very well and is made of strong heavy material the only drawback is that the shoulder strap is not detachable , but it is wide and thick and fairly comfortable to wear
i ordered this bag on amazon as i had alot of problems trying to find a good looking sturdy bag in <unk> -lrb- canada -rrb- this fits the macbook air -lrb- mba -rrb- like a glove , and i do use a hardshell case for it as well , and it all fit nice and snug construction of the bag is excellent , as it the design it 's classy , and holds quite a bit of stuff for it 's size i stuffed it full with my mba , charger , wireless mouse , a book , passport wallet , and still had a lot of room to put other things for my flight i actually had two people ask me where i got the bag on the flight it 's classy design , bright color <unk> , durability stands out only thing i wish it had was a padded shoulder strap i would definitely purchase again well worth the price
this bag was green on the inside -lrb- i hope you were n't expecting a review of the environmental qualities of this bag -rrb- it was also black on the outside -lrb- but that 's not bad either -rrb- it seems to be quite durable and my # `` macbook pro fits in it just fine it also has space for other things as well it holds the cords fine , adapters and stuff too i usually have room for a # tb drive in there as well it also holds my keys for my car -lrb- but it does n't fit my car , which is a shame because parking is expensive -rrb-
this is a fantastic bag , with well thought out pockets i first got one for christmas # , and i used it every day until the main zipper broke in the spring of # i went to a local tailor kind of shop , and the guy told me it 'd be # $ to repair it , so i just ended up buying a new one instead so keep that in mind also , i 'm not sure what 's happening to the brand -lrb- be . ez , they 're french -rrb- - they used to produce way more stuff a few years back they may be slowly going out of business ; if so , this bag will be damn near impossible to find in a few years , so jump on it while you can
i bought this case for my macbook pro after carefully selecting it from # others in best buy imagine my face when on second day i was carrying my macbook and the one end of the strap fell off and the case with my mac hit the ground it was just badly sewed in my macbook has a bent corner what a shame and i thought incase was doing durable products i tried reach out to them to see if they would cover a bottom case replacement in my macbook , but they just ignored my <unk>
although i love the design and feel of this bag , it is essentially too small for my liking there 's not much room to store anything else other than the laptop , and i have n't even used it once since i purchased it i 'm still using my old laptop bag and it 's been collecting dust in my closet ever since it arrived
i bought this bag/case and i love the design , the pockets , but it is a tight fit . the corners where the zippers go around could scratch your macbook pro if your not careful however , once inside the bag it feels great , safe and snug i would recommend this bag but it should be at least a # inch larger or deeper
this case is a perfect fit for the new macbook pro that was just released october # th it 's soft interior provides ample protection for your investment i was surprised how thin the profile of this case is ; fully loaded with the macbook pro , power adapter , extension cord , and mighty mouse the case remains sleek and not bulky at all incase has great design and workmanship in this product even down to the nice medal hardware that the shoulder strap uses to attach to the case for this price this case was ideal for me as it is thin like a sleeve , but can hold accessories and has handles and a shoulder strap as well ; a perfect mix
this backpack seems very sleek and small , but its not great for most big laptops i have a # `` dv # t and well my laptop could n't fit inside also it feels like the rectangular shape of the laptop seems to <unk> the backpacks look its a nice style , but difficult to carry a lot of things
i have n't actually used this backpack yet because i 'm trying to decide whether to keep it first of all , the color does n't match the photo at all i guess i really should have gone more with the title rather than the photo the color is a true , <unk> olive , not a lighter <unk> also , i find the medium size quite long i 'm # ' # `` - medium height - but when i put my laptop in and put on the backback , my laptop sort of hits the back of my hips , which is not what i expected maybe because it is made for men if so , i wish they would make one specifically for women however , i love that it is so lightweight -- i think it will really help take the load off my shoulders , and it has a pocket on the front for a phone i will probably end up keeping it , although i might exchange it for black
pros : feels durable , fits sleek , fits my macbook air , textbook , and <unk> : small phone pocket ca n't fit my iphone # s , should have extra mini pockets inside cant find black in this size
i had some trouble with tax , and because of that it took longer than i expected but i like it and the time it took to get here wasnt fault of the store so , i am pretty satisfied
i just love this backpack looks sleek and fits comfortably i 'm a really small person so i was looking for something lightweight and i got it my macbook pro fits perfectly and the pocket is roomy enough for all comp accessories i also carry my wallet , glasses and pencil pouch in there i carry it for work
i get compliments on it all of the time it houses my # `` macbook perfectly with some books and charger as well it 's truly the best bag i 've had since my booq bag
i 've only had this backpack for about a month and i 've been very gentle with it -lrb- as it houses my new macbook -rrb- its tearing at the bottom corners at the seems i like how the backpack looks , but i 'm pretty disappointed in the build i might be able to fix it , but i 'm probably going to end up replacing it soon
i 'm # ' # & # # ; and # pounds based on other reviews , i thought i should have ordered a large size well , the large was way too loose on me it did n't feel secure on my back at all , and the chest strap did n't come close to tightening up the slack even worse , it arrived rolled up tightly and packaged in what appeared to be a cheap trash bag seriously , i thought it was used merchandise though the medium may have worked better for me , i decided that i 'd start over in my search instead
everyone comments on how awesome this back pack is fits my samsung series # inch ultrabook perfectly along with accessories back pack is constructed reasonably well one of the # zippers on the main pocket shipped stuck and can not get unstuck , but there 's another zipper so i was n't too worried about it
i live in a dangerous city and laptops are stolen often when someone goes out with a backpack since most of the time the weather is cold , i use a coat i put only my macbook in the back pack and i wear it inside the jacket and no one notices that i am carring a laptop i wish i had bought a black one since it does not look good with my formal clothes , but everyone liked the back
it is just what i expected if your looking to just carry a laptop and a few small items then this is just the bag fits tight against your back if you wear under a baggy shirt or jacket you ca n't even tell you have it on great if your going through rough parts of the city
this is the perfect laptop carrier neopreme material offer just the correct amount of stretch to fit <unk> , & notepad in main compartment the side compartment hold power cord , mouse , and usb <unk> adapter the pocket in the shoulder strap is perfect for mp # player and earphones choice of size is important to understand that it 's your size in addition to laptop whatever shirt size you wear choose same size back pack my husband , main carrier of unit . is # ' # # s and the large fits best to give him a little wiggle room for the straps we also have a medium and although it fits him he prefers the comfort level of the large size well worth ever penny we paid for it consider any of this product line for quality products
i was disappointed immediately with the cheap look and feel of this bag , though i should have expected it at this price point what i did n't expect was a cheap zipper that broke on the first day after a couple of uses after it broke , i could only open the exterior pocket <unk> a few days later , the same zipper broke again and i could n't close the zipper this reflects an <unk> inferior product i just contacted the seller , but have n't back yet even if i get a refund , it 's not worth the hassle stay away from this manufacturer
i bought this laptop case to use for school and within a few days the strap kept breaking and the bag started to rip after about a week , the zippers would not ever zip i buy frequently off of amazon.com and have never had an issue of this sort this is a very cheaply made product and i would not recommend to anyone
i ordered a # in sleeve and got what looks like an # in case it has handles -lrb- which i did not want -rrb- and the zippers do n't look anything like the ones in the picture it came with deep wrinkles in the foam on the front contacted customer service to see if i could get my money back and i am still waiting for an answer however , it did ship pretty quickly , that was the only thing i was satisfied with
this computer sleeve fits my macbook pro # . # `` perfectly i do n't know why some reviews say it 's too snug , because it 's not i wish it were a little thicker but for the price it is good i does just what i need - protect my computer in my messenger bag the color is great this is a good buy
i love this sleeve i read reviews on the incase , also sold at the apple store and how the zipper scratches up the corners this sleeve solves that problem with a fold-over inside flap the pink is a great color and the extra pocket outside is great for flat things and , it 's not that expensive - similar things sell for double the amount !
i bought the vertical light blue # in for my new macbook pro , the new release summer # edition i 'm not sure about why others are saying that it 's not a snug fit because it 's very fitted to mine i actually have to stretch it a little to get the zipper to close the pocket in front is nice to fit the power adapter and other knick <unk> it 's a tight neoprene , not particularly thick but not <unk> thin either you get exactly the quality for this price point the only thing is that it had a very strong plastic / neoprene smell when i first opened the bag so far as it has aired out , the smell has <unk> mostly
hands down love it if i could <unk> two things about it - it would have a handle to hold it , and it would have a much thick <unk> like material i really would have liked it to be thicker , but overall the magenta color is gorgeous and it matches with the cosmos hot pink case and the keyboard cover that i also purchased on here looks great , feels great - fits my macbook pro # . # inch perfectly definitely got my money 's worth purchasing this item i highly recommend
it is a good sleeve , i had problems with the delivery and the seller was helpful the product is as described , i have only been using it for a couple of weeks
the # `` sleeve seems tailor made for the macbook pro # `` - its perfect i was also surprised with the generous amount of padding , and the pocket on the front is convenient for holding the power adapter the laptop is also protected from the zipper with some piping around the opening of the sleeve - it does n't look like zipping closed the sleeve will scratch the laptop the zipper issue was a reported problem with other sleeves i looked at -lrb- incase -rrb-
this case shipped extremely fast and so far , it seems to be high quality it fits my macbook pro # `` like a glove and the front pocket is perfect for the charger this case wo n't save your laptop from a fall but i would highly recommend it for any type of student that wants to keep scratches off of his or her macbook
when looking for a neoprene case for my asus ul # vt , i found that the macbook # `` cases fit snugly although the incase product appeared to have better padding inside , i went with this one because i liked the extra pocket to fit either my ac adapter or my external hard drive i also liked that this product cost # as much
i ordered this for my daughter to protect her macbook since she carries it in her backpack it fit perfectly and is streamline - just what she wanted the color is more what we would consider <unk> than magenta she loves it the pocket is not big enough to hold the charger/accessories but she is fine with that it was lost in shipping originally - delivered to the wrong address by the usps - but the sender immediately sent out a replacement <unk> excellent customer service
i 've had this cover for nearly # years and it is amazing it has protected my macbook from juice being spilled on it which amazed me i would highly suggest this case to anyone
i got it for my husband 's laptop and it fits great it is masculine and for a guy , he can fit in the side pocket his keys , cell phone etc .
two weeks ago i sat , what i thought , was a waterproof cooler filled with bagged ice on top of my closed leather briefcase which contained my macbook unfortunately , the ice melted , leaked through the plastic bag , leaked through the `` waterproof `` cooler , leaked through my closed leather briefcase and <unk> into my macbook after spending $ # at the apple store -lrb- water damage is not covered under the warranty -rrb- i purchased this case it fits great it looks great most of all , it appears that it would prevent light water from entering the case i am still very careful about liquids around my macbook but this product should provide one more layer of protection
i read reviews before i got this product so i somewhat figured that i would have to use the lint roller when i first got it i repeatedly lint rolled this <unk> and it would continue to shed i decided to use the product anyways for the last month when i decided to upgrade the ram on my macbook i <unk> the innner components and there was black fuzz everywhere from this product the idea of all th fuzz being trapped inside the cpu fan and other components makes it difficult for me to justify using it i do like the uniqueness of the sleeve but if there was another material used for the inner part of the bag i would he perfect
i thought that this case would be cute and functional that it is , but the fuzzy lining <unk> little bits go into all crevices of the laptop perhaps they do n't do any harm , but i suspect that there are better choices
the <unk> is a great option for your # `` macbook - if you do n't mind a little extra cleaning with it 's burlap appearance , the applesac is definitely one of the more unique and <unk> case options around the outer burlap and inner <unk> has held up very nicely and after # + years of use , it still looks new the flap at the top is held closed by a strong velcro strip , which has collected some fuzz and dust over time , but remains secure a large pocket on the rear side offers some storage for a limited selection of wires and accessories it 's enough to hold your power cable and maybe one more similarly sized item my main gripe is that the inner fleece , while providing a soft <unk> of protection , will inevitably shed you 'll probably find yourself cleaning stray <unk> off your hardware more than you 'd like however , in my experience , almost all of any `` shedding `` remains on the outside of the closed notebook
i really liked the cover it was easy to get my computer in and out i do n't know how well it would stand up to everyday use because my dog ate it the second week i had it
this is a great sleeve for my macbook pro , and i do n't regret buying it , but it has a little bit less padding than i had imagined if i were to drop the sleeve with the computer in it , it would surely damage my laptop the appearance is unique and fantastic ; i love the ruggedness of it and the fact that i 've yet to see anything like it it 's great for carrying the computer around by itself or as extra padding while carrying it in my backpack the pocket is small and not large enough to carry the power source with extension i often use it for a cd , small notebook , or my cell phone the only other drawback is that the sleeve itself has stretched a little now -lrb- a few months after buying the applesac -rrb- and no longer fits like a glove nonetheless , i remain pleased and think that this was well worth the money spent -- for aesthetic , as well as practical , reasons
when i first took this out of the package i thought : `` <unk> ... i spent how much on this ? but i have used it for over a month now and i love it it 's very nice looking and it 's doing a great job of protecting my mac and its cord in my backpack many people have remarked on how cool it is , and i love it enough to keep it on the desk even when it 's not in use a very nice product that i would recommend to anyone
i love the case i get comments on it all the time , and it 's something that stands out in the world of limited apple accessories , so you really can `` think different `` from the rest of the crowd the soft inside did shed a little at first , but not to the point of being problematic now that i 've had it for a while , the durability is proven , and even the outer pocket is durable i use it to carry everything from notebooks and pens , to my phone and ipod
mine was scratched when i <unk> and it looks very cheap unfortunately , considering the fact that i do n't actually hav a lot of options for my laptop because it 's so old , i am stuck with this it also makes your laptop super heavy
i got this case about # years ago and i have a <unk> <unk> with it i like it because it 's sturdy and makes me feel that my computer is more protected i like the little feet that flip out on the back and keep my computer venting well i like it because i can put stickers on it without having to worry about ruining an expensive case or putting them directly onto my computer however , dirt gets trapped under the case and makes my computer <unk> than it was before i had a case it 's also rather difficult to remove without breaking the tabs that keep it on , so it 's not that easy to clean the dirt that gets trapped
bought this for my daughter who really likes it was disappointed that it did n't come with a matching sleeve which i thought was included in the description however the fine print did say it had to be purchased separately
case is pretty , and i like it overall for the price it is a good buy the only thing that kind of bugs me is that despite it covering the mac pretty well , it still allows plenty of dust and debris to get between the case and the macbook i 've taken my case off a few times to see how perfect my macbook is underneath it , afterall , my macbook has never been without a case i was surprised to find a lot of gunk i had to wipe away -lrb- with my <unk> hand -rrb- on the surface of my macbook anyway , it is not perfect , but it does its main job which is to keep scratches , etc from <unk> your beautiful mac
i originally ordered the wrong size and ipearl replaced it quickly it was supposed to come with a free keyboard cover , which it did n't emails to the company regarding the free keyboard cover were ignored
this product , similar to the topcase model , is working out well for me my personal computer at home , is a slightly smaller size than the one i use at work i had to purchase a different product to fit my need thankfully , this product , too , fits my needs it 's fun and functional , and the variety of colors makes it personal
great item indeed , great protection and very comfortable legs for height , although one it 's already broken it 's a great case for your mac , just be careful with the little legs , they 're a little weak : p
i bought this item because i didnt want my laptop to get scratched . i received it super quick fast shipping and the color is great . i love love this product and also now im not scared to take it out anywhere with me because i know it is well protected will definitely purchase from them again
before i purchased this product , i read many negative reviews about its construction & quality but i still wanted to see for myself believe me when i say wow there are so many pros to this product * customer service was always consistent ... <unk> every one of my questions * product shipped & delivered faster than i expected * item was as described and was a snap to install * fits my unibody macbook perfectly i 'm glad i had the opportunity to write a review for this wonderful product and <unk> the <unk>
this is my second cover for my macbook the first one was not impressive the fit was so bad i gave it away this one is <unk> different fits my macbook like a glove makes it feel even more sturdy i got a black one but will be getting another color and will change according to my mood if you have the non-unibody macbook , you 'll be very happy with this cover do n't even bother trying another one
ordered this product for my daughter who had damaged the case on her macbook a few months before ... product exactly as described , fast shipment , courteous service i recommend i-pearl inc for all apple shell
i love this item , i have the # . # macbook from late # and it fits perfectly and is so affordable im so happy i bought this item rather than spend # x the money for the one in the mac store fast shipping , very quick response time to emails , and great product
i was looking for a good product at a reasonable price this seems to fit the bill wonderful choice of colors and flexible , sturdy material meant to last what made my decision on this product final was the retractable feet not found on other brands just snapped it on and it fits perfectly it was difficult finding covers designed to fit my older mac thank you ipearl for thinking of us as well
