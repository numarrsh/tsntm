this case is great when it stays on the bottom stays on perfectly and is really handy with its back feet the top tends to pop off occassionally which is frustrating for the price , i can live with it -lrb- the more expensive ones get the same comment . the folks at ipearl are nice and are concerned about product quality i like that
this case is very good on the basics - it fits the computer well , it is strong , and it is light , not to mention being much more reasonably priced than some of the competitors it 's good to have some sort of protection on the computer # . my only complaint is minimal - i would have preferred a case without the <unk> stand under the rear corners the hinges are not noticeable most of the time , but they make the computer harder to fit into a tightly <unk> backpack
i 'll be returning this , since my main objective was to add <unk> to my mba this one leaves it just as slippery as before + does n't show fingerprints + top shell is attractive -lrb- bottom is n't , but no one will see that - just as slippery as the bare macbook air case - really hard to attach the top cover -lrb- i also have the incipio and that is snug too , but not as bad as the ipearl -rrb-
i like the case it is lightweight , thin and hard i hardly notice the hard shell cover is on my laptop i feel comfortable that this case protects my mac while traveling -lrb- which i do # or # days a week -rrb- i like the option of colors even though i went with clear only dislike is i could not seem to get the inside of the case clean or clear a colored case next time my over-all rating is good
item arrived quickly . the bottom piece was easy to attach , and the feet that raise the rear of the laptop are extremely useful ! i did n't expect that <unk> the rear of the machine would make that much of a difference , but it absolutely does help the top piece was difficult to install i found the best method was to slide it on from the top there were times when i felt like it took just way too much force to install once the top piece is installed , you will really appreciate the tight fit the fit is absolutely amazing its like a new skin on the top of the machine i would recommend this item in a heartbeat . just be patient when installing the top piece you should be very happy with the results , and this is a steal for the price
ordered for my dad for his mac book air and he loves it i only saw it once last time i visited and it fit great and the mac book was still very light
it 's nice , looks great and almost does n't increase air 's size one more positive feature is that latches at the bottom part allows to raise the back of the air , making it more comfortable for typing
and it even came with a keyboard cover which i was n't expecting i 've purchased this same case for a macbook pro i used to have and it kept it in perfect condition , so much so that i received $ # for a # year-old laptop
after reading some of the reviews , i was hesitant to order this ipearl shell however , i just recently received it , and i am pleased with it so far one thing i was very happy with was the ease with which it fit my mac air # . # i am a klutz it took me days to get my iphone cover on , and i had to watch a video tutorial this shell , however , took no effort at all basically , i just set the mac on the cover it fit so well that all i needed to do was snap one area into place another thing i like about this , is that it is so lightweight , and let 's face it , why buy an air and then add bulk to it i also like using the <unk> ` feet ' when typing
this cover fits snugly around my laptop it does n't add any weight and it makes my laptop look <unk> until i turn it on and the apple logo shines through
i needed something to protect my brand new macbook air and at the same time camouflage it while going through airport security this cover certainly does the job i 'm considering purchasing another one in a different color just for fun
i 'm a big fan of <unk> for most of my electronics , be it for <unk> resale value , or simply for extending the longevity of my items i wo n't generally buy a case without seeing it in person , but after a little consideration i chose to get the ipearl <unk> for my macbook air # . # i 'm pretty impressed with the quality of this shell ; strong , thin snug fitting and with a nice matte finish to it that leaves my macbook looking sleek the fold out legs in the rear of the bottom shell coupled with the silicone feet near the bottom front lend a nice angle to my machine too , making it quite easy to type in perfect comfort all in all i 'd say if you happen to be in the market for a nice hardshell with great features , do n't think twice about giving this one a second look it does the job , and at a great price
cover is easy to put on it protects my mac from scratches , and is a nice look the little pop-out props on the bottom are nifty the matte black shows oily fingerprints pretty easily , so keep in mind if you <unk> your hands a lot , or are eating <unk> it wipes clean , though , so i do n't mind the cover is semi - opaque ; that is , when the mac is on , you can see the apple light up on the back - it 's cute this item is a great value
had this shell for about a month it fits perfectly and does n't add much weight or girth to the macbook air love it ... however i do not use the keypad cover due to the air <unk> needs of the computer
the reason i gave it # star is because it is extremely difficult to put the computer in and out of the sleeve instead of having zippers for easy access this has a funky design where you have to pull very tight to to squeeze the computer in it created more frustration than not having a sleeve , so i had to return it
almost impossible to fully insert my # & # # ; macbook air i am not sure it the newer # & # # ; airbook are any smaller if not , i attribute this to the bad design there is a slit near the top -lrb- about # & # # ; -rrb- on the flat part first part of the insertion is fine , but i could not get the flap on the other side of the slit to go on top of the remaining exposed airbook if i <unk> forced it i could have made it to work but i thought i would end up either tearing the flap off or hurting my <unk> -lrb- as one other reviewer commented -rrb- certainly not suitable for everyday use it 's too bad because the materials seem to be nice -lrb- but useless -rrb-
this case did not work out for me because it was for my <unk> and i needed it to be very easy to put away or take out if it was difficult then he would not use it which would result in scratches on the computer i ended up returning it for a case that had a zipper down the whole side
the edging around the neck of the sleeve is too tight for easy use after inserting in the sleeve it is hard to close it and hard to open it to slide the air out this may be a problem with the design or with this particular one
if you can possibly get this beautifully made , cushy black neoprene -lrb- <unk> -rrb- sleeve on your macbook air , it is a great , snug , protective fit , with a solid feel unfortunately , i just about <unk> off a thumb on my macbook air 's sharp edges trying to get the final corner of the cover flipped over a friend of mine with much <unk> paws tried it too , and i watched him struggle for # minutes , # seconds to insert the computer into the case this simply is n't practical for regular use , and by the time it stretches a bit to fit more easily , it will look baggy at the edge back to amazon , and back to the incase designers for this one
i also bought a case for my mac and with the case over the mac it wo n't easily fit into the neoprene case the other case i bought is a hard shell - by incase so i do like their products but this neoprene sleeve does n't allow for any additional space in the sleeve you have have your macbook air completely bare to fit it in
it does n't have a zip so it does n't close very well it is n't as nice as the incase that i have for my # inch macbook pro which does have a zip i would n't buy another one
i am just not satisfied with this sleeve for my # macbook air # `` laptop i previously had the speck pixelsleeve -lrb- http / / <unk> # <unk> # <unk> # -rrb- on my previous macbook air , which was sadly stolen along with my sleeve the speck case is simply superior to the incase sleeve , and i would have ordered it again if it had n't been out of stock the incase sleeve is too tight for my liking , and it is difficult to take on and off the computer the top flap is very difficult to slip over the computer , too difficult for comfort the top flap also does not extend over the bottom portion of the sleeve like the speck sleeve , leaving a gap between the two sections where you can see the computer inside overall , i wish i had ordered a different sleeve for my laptop that is easier to get on & off and offers fully sealed protection
i just received this item , shipping was fast , however it fits the mac book air # almost so tight that a finger cant go through its not very easy to put the mac in the case because it is very tight , i dont know if with time it will become more flexible and hence easier to use however it is much better than any other case i tried so far feels better from the outside , and can protect the mac more
as other reviewers have pointed out , this sleeve for the macbook air has a lot of great qualities to it with one flaw , it 's a little hard to use the form-fitting neoprene sleeve is like a wet suit for your macbook air , it 's svelte , it 's cushiony , and covers it completely with protection that said , you do have to tug at the opening in the back to pull it over your laptop , and would have been nicer had they simply had an opening at one end that way , you 'd have a much easier time sliding your laptop in and out with sacrificing little to no protection when this sleeve first came out , there were very few # -inch sleeves on the market but times have changed not only is there a range of cases out there , the price for this case has dropped considerably i still use mine , but would recommend checking out a few others in person before making the investment
the inside of the case is really soft without zippers , i do n't have to worry about scratching my mac , but it 's a bit difficult to completely put inside the case i usually stick the laptop in # ths of the way in , with # th of the laptop pops out from the top
the sleeve is great , really protects the macbook air especially due to the interior super smooth material it also looks great , very elegant the only thing i did n't like is that it 's kind of difficult to fit the computer inside , i mean the sleeve is really tight that 's a good thing anyway because the computer wo n't start moving once inside , but for my taste it 's just way too tight
this is a nice product fits my mac air # & # # ; perfectly no zipper is a nice feature except that there is a small gap that you can not close completely be better if the case overlapped therefore the case closes over the computer completely with no gaps i 'd give it # starts except for the gap that does n't close up after the computer is in the case
this is n't going to protect your macbook from a <unk> fall , but it will keep it from being banged up and scratched when thrown into a bag the case is snug and there are no zippers , so it slides smoothly over the computer there is still a slight <unk> at the opening , although , i 've been able to compensate for that still , one point off for the gap , since that seems like a pretty serious oversight
it has a smooth hair like material inside to keep the computer safe keep in mind though , if your going to put a hard shell case or a cover on the computer itself i suggest getting a # & # # ; sleeve its extremely snug to fit in with a computer case
this sleeve fits the late # & # # ; macbook pro with retina like a glove very happy with it i only wish that the opening at the bag could be closed securely , via zipper , velcro or similar however , it works fine as is and so far , i have n't gotten any dirt into the sleeve
having looked at dozens of similar products i chose this one and was n't disappointed my mba fits snug , maybe a little too snug but at least it does n't fall out my only concern is the top flap is hard to pull over and i question how it will last in the long term
this is perfect it 's padded enough without being bulky it 's pretty easy to get my macbook air in and out of the sleeve , but i do n't think it would ever slip out accidentally the inside is very soft other sleeves i had looked at were either too bulky , weird looking , hard to use , or ineffective this is exactly the case i was looking for
i bought this for a # & # # ; late # macbook pro since i figured at the widest it was similar to the current gen macbook air i just did n't want a case with a zipper and a sleeve was exactly what i was looking for it fits perfectly to the point where i feel like it might almost be too big for a macbook air great build quality the inside is soft and padded the edges have are <unk> seams that seem like in a drop it would provide protection
i was a little worried about this case when i <unk> bought it , thought the opening would wear out its perfect and has even saved the mac once or
feels like putting your mac into a snug soft <unk> glove was hoping it would be a little sturdier , but it works great considering i place it inside my laptop backpack anyway
after reading so many reviews on amazon , i could n't decide between incase and acme made skinny sleeve because incase is lighter , i ended it up buying it i was worried about the one inch opening that so many talked about in their reviews however , mine does n't have the opening when i put my macbook air -lrb- # `` -rrb- into the sleeve it fits perfect with my latest model macbook air and it 's not hard to put it in and take it out i like the all <unk> protection that incase provides and also not to worry about the zipper damaging my macbook
i was looking for an unassuming case to protect my mac book air when i carried with other things in my bag i did not want to have a zipper or velcro closure this case is perfect for my needs yes , there is the smallest <unk> of & # # ; <unk> & # # ; by this case , but it 's inconsequential i find it very easy to to place my mac into the sleeve and take it out i feel that my computer is very secure inside this sleeve worth the extra money for the ease of use and sense of protection this sleeve provides
the case is quality , arrived early it fits the air like a glove and really looks good carry it inside my backpack , and leave the air in the case when not in use
after ordering my new macbook , i <unk> over the numerous case and sleeve options : acme made the skinny , crumpler <unk> , and herschel <unk> sleeve to name a few i settled on the incase neoprene sleeve for its simple <unk> design and its total protection , and three weeks later i know i made the right choice simply put , the sleeve is attractive , form fitting , well made , and offers all the protection the typical user will need
as usual with incase , this is a great protector for the computer it fits precisely and it is very easy to insert the computer into the sleeve it is well padded for protection
i looked for a long time online and in stores for a case/sleeve specifically for a macbook air that would actually fit its thin profile snugly this sleeve was exactly what i was looking for simple , padded but not bulky , and pretty easy to take my laptop in and out of i know several people on here complain about a gap where their laptop is exposed , but the half of a millimeter that can sometimes show does n't bother me the only thing i wish was different about it is the current price , but it was worth it for me
great case , have used it every day -lrb- almost -rrb- for the past year and it is still holding up great i love how sleek it is when i got it , i was worried that it has flap you have to pull back to fit that comp in , and i was worried that it would get stretched out has n't yet after about a year the padding is great and i feel safe taking my computer around in my backpack in this
keeps my macbook air clean and away from scratches i usually do n't close the top , just slide it in , but the top is nice for longer trips and more security
i love this macbook air sleeve i love how snug the sleeve is i can drop my macbook and feel that it 's secure i 'm going to purchase another sleeve in a different color too fast shipping :
us airports are allowing small , thin laptops like the macbook air # `` to go through x-ray in a sleeve and this one is perfect for my needs it keeps the case from being scratched going in and out of my travel bag and protects it from minor dings i doubt it would protect against crushing if somebody goes crazy on it in overhead storage though regarding the fit : it is snug but feels just right to me to insert the macbook air , just fold the case at the slit , then push one corner against one side of the slit and pull the sleeve over the other corner you then can just push the laptop down into the sleeve and finish by flipping the bent part of the sleeve over the other two corners it is <unk> when you try it , and it fits like a snug glove the only shame is that when i went through london <unk> a couple of weeks ago they made me take the laptop out of the sleeve i wish airports would <unk> procedures
this is a well made case good for macbook air because i do n't typically carry charger or mouse when mobile with this device i leave them in the rom because touchpad works well and batteries last all day good simple case
i agree with everyone about the problems the bottom rear corner is chipping away and about to come off . and the weight makes the screen tilt backwards hoping to find a good replacement one
i bought this case to add protection to my macbook , since i often take it with me when i go to work i 've had this computer for about four months now and i am already looking to replace this case , which had not survived normal wear and tear it clips off off with light pressure and when i am not trying to remove it it also has a crack right in the center of the top there are removable rubberized feet on the bottom of the case these have fallen off on numerous occasions this case is a piece of junk do n't waste your money on it
cracked as soon as i put it on . not even close to the same quality as my speck iphone cases i have had . really poor design but , it looked cool for the # seconds before it
i 'm on my second replacement but the warranty only lasts for # year so after that period of time , i 'll be <unk> speck usually makes great cases , i can attest to the macbook pro version but this air version is too fragile and cracks too easily with normal use
i was extremely excited to get this case but as it turns out i should n't have been it fit 's very nicely onto the mba but it does not wear very well at all i have taken excellent care of my mba and already this speck case has the corner broken on the bottom part of the case i bought it just a few months ago also it has managed to scratch the underside of my mba luckily it is not to bad and i am not terribly upset about it but still i have recently bought a different case that i hope fairs better then this one if you are buying this case make sure you are ready to buy a new one in a few months
i owned two of these for my # macbook air the first was a black satin from the apple store and the second was a clear one from amazon both cracked in the rear corners of the bottom cover after a couple months after the second one cracked i contacted speck and they never responded so crappy product and worse customer service zero stars if i could
this is a beautiful cover and fits great unfortunately , the very first week i had it , the bottom cover starting cracking and breaking off in <unk> around the corners now huge chunks of it are breaking off i 've had it less than six months and the bottom cover no longer stays on by itself for this price , that should not happen i do not recommend this cover
i have owned speck cases in the past and they have been <unk> i had this one for about two weeks and it started cracking and not holding it form do not bother buying this case it 's a piece of garbage you are better off wrapping your mba in the paper back like when you were in school
i purchased this case in august # , and started seeing issues with it within the first few weeks the back bottom corners cracked and broke off first now the top cover has developed a crack which will most certainly render this case basically useless after only # months this is the worst case type product i 've ever purchased
after some usage , the product material wears and tears , it ventilation structure needs <unk> , and it does add weight to the mba , and it causes problems using a chill matt
after a little less than # months of gentle use , my speck cover has cracked on a corner and lost a good size chip a <unk> on the left side has also worn away and this makes the bottom cover partially slip off on a regular basis i 've used mcover 's products before and now i 'm wishing i stuck with them
i have had this case for a few months and the form / fit is great it holds on to the macbook pretty well and looks nice when its new after a bit of use the corners near the hinge have cracked and broken and now the corners of the case near the trackpad edge have begun to crack and break away as well i would not recommend this case
i really liked this case the bottom piece fit a little loose but that did n't really bother me the clips that hold the case to the macbook broke after a month of usage i occasionally used this laptop on a desk or on my couch , no abuse occurred
this case was priced below the comparable incase product <unk> me to purchase it the case has a nice feel to it and the apple logo does shine through -lrb- a nice bonus -rrb- the fit was good but there are a few problems with this case it broke after # month of use as one the tabs on the bottom panel snapped off also the lack of vents on the bottom panel cause my macbook air # . # inch to overheat with an <unk> loud fan kicking in this case needs vents and needs to be sturdier i do not recommend this case as it broke in one month 's time and now i have an <unk> expensive , broken case that will likely make a lovely addition to an area land fill alas , my cheapness once again failed me as i have literally purchased the perforated incase case not but an hour ago for $ # . # hopefully that case will at least last
broke after a month of use and it broke when i was opening the lid of the computer it has a great look and feel in the beginning but poorly made and designed
i purchased this cover in june of # by september , it already had cracks in it how much did my macbook air travel at this time ? # it stayed on my desk the entire time - the cracks developed simply from opening and closing the macbook now it is april of # -lrb- not even a year -rrb- and my macbook has continued to stay on my desk - i have not traveled with it at all - entire chunks of the cover have broken off if you do n't mind spending $ # every # months for this , then it is probably ok - it 's a shame it is so poorly made
bought this because i love the feel of it when i saw my friend 's computer however , after a few months , it began to tear down , and the cover cracked and the clasps broke off i treat my computer very well , and the only <unk> my computer <unk> is when i carry it to and from school i use my computer every day - probably # hours a day - class taking notes and after school watching tv <unk> online that 's about it yet the darn cover still broke off ! ! considering i paid nearly $ # for the satin speck cover , i expected it to last much longer i do n't recommend anyone purchasing this cover -- it 'll break down on you soon ! !
a friend in one of my classes had one of these and i thought it looked great i have used speck 's products before for my iphone and have been happy with the quality , so i bought this cover for my mba after about # months , cracks started to form by # months , pieces started to chip off , particularly around the corners now , at almost a year , the case does n't even stay on the laptop i like speck , but this is a poor quality product # stars for its nice design and aesthetics , and the fact that it can indeed protect a laptop from scratches and nicks
it showed some of crack before i put the cover on the mac book air . though it fitted perfectly but later the cover slipped and i had to adjust every time to open my
i was very happy with this cover in the first few month the more i used my computer the cover started to crack around the corners now i need to order another cover that hopefully will not crack in a few months
husband and i both had speck cases for macbook pro 's for nearly two years with no problems something about the thinner construction for the air case makes it less durable within two weeks the corners on the bottom half of the case were cracking
i 've had two of these they both cracked in the rear corner the plastic back there is really thin the one i just replaced cracked on the top cover when i tried to remove it
i was initially very happy with this product , it snaps on easily and looks great but after only a few weeks the corners near the hinges of the bottom shell have both cracked and it slips off constantly now not very durable material at all
this case looked nice , had a nice feel and made the apple sign <unk> through very nicely ... but it broke after one month after # month of simple use , never being dropped , and only taken in and out of a macbook sleeve , the bottom left hand tab broke completely off now the case is loose and wont even stay on save your time and money and just go for something better
i bought the speck seethru case at the end of february to cover my new macbook air almost two months later , the case is starting to fall apart at the corners i 've already lost three chunks , and it feels like the case is going to fall apart at any moment i hope i have a faulty case because the besides the corners chipping , i actually really like it the case is n't too bulky and you can still see the apple logo it seems fairly scratch resistent as well
good fit , good protection but disappointed it did not have the slotted bottom like other newer speck products for macbook maybe this is just an older model hence the good price
i 've always enjoyed speck 's products for my <unk> , but unfortunately this case is n't up to par after a few months of daily use the edges began cracking an now barely holds on i 've used super glue to keep it together , but should n't have had to i 'd highly recommend <unk> use their skins on all my iphones , ipads and now my mb air fantastic product with incredible customer service and way cheaper than zagg and any of the other skin <unk> it is only a skin though , so mostly for keeping scratches & scrapes off the device for a case , i 'd recommend <unk> but they are $ $ $ $
on one side it looks fantastic it 's soft touch it 's discreet it 's thin it looks great a few months later , it starts to peel all the soft touches do i 've seen it happen to <unk> yet , i still bought it cause it protects and looks good just be ready to have a peeling laptop eventually
i loved this case for my macbook air when i first got it the macbook is incredibly slippery and i was constantly afraid that i would drop it the finish on it is nice and grippy and it looks pretty cool you can see the apple logo light up through the case my problem is that i have had this case for about # months and almost all the clips on the bottom piece have broken off luckily the piece fits pretty snugly on the computer so it does fall right off but it does come off pretty easy now for that reason , i can only give this # stars
mine came slightly warped from shipping , but even so this is a good case easy to install , no loose parts , and complete coverage i will say this is slightly thick -lrb- noticeably thicker , but not a lot thicker if that makes sense -rrb- and a tad heavy but that 's in comparison to have the air as a machine itself but i think what makes this case a good buy is that you can see the logo light up through the case got ta let people know you roll <unk> style the matte finish has been great so far -lrb- very easy to clean -rrb- have n't owned it long enough for durability , but if you want some solid , simple protection , this is a solid buy
decent case , but was n't happy the two back clips on the bottom half of the case broke within the first month the front clips still hold it on though protects the comp and looks good
this case is great it protects the computer while still retaining the great styling from apple the satin look and feel is great aesthetically and it does n't weigh the computer down i am overall pleased
good product , met my expectations the quality is good and it looks good as well i was more concerned with the protection it provided and the looks , well the look was an added bonus
i have had this case for two years it does n't take away from the slimness of the macbook air but it still protects it very well some of the tabs that hold the case to the computer have now broken off but the case still works perfectly well i am pretty rough on my computer and i think the case has held up suprisingly well for that
i am very happy with speck products this case keeps my $ # clean from the day to day environment issues that can scratch and dent these fine machines well worth the investment also i feel better that product is made in <unk> and not china i do n't have to worry about getting some form plastic
the cover for my macbook air fits perfectly , and has done great at protecting my computer this is about the fourth speck product i have purchased , and they all do wonderful jobs of keeping my electronic items safe and scratch free
very nice case , super <unk> thin , see through which is neat ? , stylish not much to say about this case , its # % transparent , protects from scratches , matte color i actually got this used for $ # which was a deal ; i could n't tell the difference from brand new -lrb- when i visited the apple store -rrb- have accidentally dropped my laptop twice from table distance and the case protected it every time on the last drop it chipped a little on the corner of the case , but this is what it was designed for still very functional and works
this case is beautiful and fits my laptop great along with pockets on both sides for cables , hard drives etc . but low rating because the straps are sewn to the neoprene fabric instead of a separate stronger material for the edging and i have to carry the whole thing like school books because of the weight strain i do n't want the handles to rip out and my new laptop crashes to the ground during a long walk
i like this case very much the color is very cool and the case is light i would have liked a shoulder strap but i think it will be manageable without one
the case works great & i love the pockets that zip so you do n't have to worry about things falling out of them it is a little difficult to get my laptop which is a # . # inch into it but other than that it is awesome it is a great case & i would recommend it
i have a # & # # ; dell latitude and bought this because the reviews said it fit their # & # # ; laptops perfectly maybe dell just makes small # & # # ; laptops , but the case is a little too wide still love the color , the protection , the outside pockets and the handles would definitely buy again
very nice for my # & # # ; laptop generous pockets on the outside and one of them is zippered only complaint is smell not as bad now after a couple of months i had one neoprene sleeve before where the handles were on one side only and it was wierd , but this one is ok with handles on both sides
i absolutely love my new laptop case ! ! i have the new windows # computer , when i saw it was only # . # inches i was worried it would n't fit my computer when i got it in the mail i was so excited when i opened it i tried it on my laptop and it fit perfect with still some room so it was n't skin tight i also love it came with # pockets in the front and back both with zippers so nothing falls out i use the front pocket for my charger and is not squished at all the only thing bad is it collects a little dust sometimes but besides that it keeps your computer safe so it does n't scratch , it also has a portable handle , and two pockets for storage i recommend this case to anyone ! ! i love it ! ! ! :
i ordered two of these ; they arrived quickly and in pristine condition they 're beautiful to look at : colors are really vivid they appear to be made with quality in mind with precision stitching , no <unk> found , even the zipper is color matched my cons would be that they are about $ # too high in price and the outside material is made of cloth that will collect dirt easily -lrb- however attractive the color -rrb- i 'm definitely pleased with my amazon purchase
originally i was informed that some problem in transport would delay the delivery i would n't be receiving it by christmas somehow , it still got to me on the day i originally expected it great quality with many different color options but no graphic designs that ruin the look it is perfect and i 'd buy one of the bags again if i need a laptop protector in the further
i ordered this case for my # . # & # # ; hp laptop , and it fits perfectly it is snug so my laptop does not move around inside the case , but not too tight where i am unable to pull the zipper all the way shut i am very pleased with the make of the case it is well made and the color -lrb- purple -rrb- is great perfect light weight case for going to and from places i was also impressed with how much i could fit into the pockets with the laptop inside i was able to fit my laptop charger , wireless mouse , and a graphing calculator into both pockets with room to spare i would highly recommend this case
this bag fit my laptop nicely , but i did n't think it had a lot of protection the case is very thin , and stretchy not a lot of room in the side pocket either
this is a good case for a person that does n't plan to travel with their laptop it fit my dell # inch notebook very well and i have room for the charger and a folder of documents it is the material of a & # # ; sleeve & # # ; so i would n't want to take my laptop on a <unk> with it because i do n't think it would offer much protection
i bought this after a lot of reviews of other products i only needed something for the house since i do n't take my laptop out and this was perfect i only wish the pocket to house the charger and the cord was a little larger but since i am not traveling with it , i just leave the charger in another room
i was looking for a great deal on a # inch laptop case i found this one on amazon and took a chance buying it i was happy i did it has plenty of room for my laptop plus each side has a zipper compartment i am very pleased with my purchase and i got a great price
this is a nice , sleek , <unk> bag for a # `` - monitor laptop there 's not a lot of extra room for the mouse and power supply , but the bag is stretchy , and will accommodate those items in the zippered pockets i had viewed a number of other bags , but they were either heavy or very expensive this is n't a bag for someone who throws a bag around , since there 's not a lot of padding , but there 's enough padding if you are mindful of how you handle your laptop
