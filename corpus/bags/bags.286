this bag is amazing i carry a lot of stuff with me when on the road this bag is not only incredibly functional but very stylish and well put together
i have always been a huge fan of ogio backpacks in my mind there is no other brand with as good of products i carry my laptop and expensive dj gear and feel confident with the protection this backpack provides
i was looking for a backpack that would hold my laptop as well as my tablet and various textbooks etc , and this one fits the bill , it is sturdy , and has lots of room i carry my # & # # ; laptop as well as my # & # # ; tablet , and even with both of them , i still have room for a textbook it also has the strap to attach around your waist which was important to me as an extra added <unk> feature i looked at almost every backpack on here , and i 'm glad i purchased this one
this bag is perfect i read some reviews that said there was n't enough padding on the bottom if you have $ # worth of tech gear in a bag , then do n't throw it down on the ground like some kind of child there is definitely ample padding great room space to lug extra files and manuals -lrb- sorry kids , i 'm no student , an old working professional -rrb- lots of great stash pockets for the little things in life this bag brings back that relaxed <unk> feeling of being a kid , it helps ward off that whole & # # ; i 'm an adult now & # # ; <unk> love it ! ! ! !
i love this backpack you can fit a lot of stuff in it without looking like fat backpack person i have a # & # # ; laptop that fits perfectly into the little sleeve area specifically for laptops i love that it has the chest buckle too ; it helps it fit snug and it does n't move around
this is a great product tons of room i can get my ps # and my lap top with all the cords and a few games the only thing is its a little tight for a # . # screen lap top
this bag is absolutely perfect it fits everything i need , and is so light it has a ton of pockets and the side pocket on the strap is genius it 's the best bag i 've ever owned
love this bag at the airport keeps my phone and wallet tucked <unk> arm allows me to keep ipad and laptop safely next to by back , not the <unk> pocket out style and size and weight are the best
it was too big i was looking for something smaller and comfortable to carry my small laptop and notebook to school if you want a bag to carry many stuff , then this is for you however , as it is noted by other reviewers , the front flap velcro closure easily comes undone which can be a problem if you put too many things in the bag
i thought it was going to be a lot bigger it holds your laptop , and maybe a couple of folders , but if you are constantly carrying your laptop along with all sorts of other junk ... this is n't the bag for you
bought for college space was limited and did n't have enough room -lrb- this was just during orientation and not even classes -rrb- i wore jeans that i 've had for at least a year and that have been washed at least a dozen times and the color from my jeans wore off on to the backside of the bag i 'm not sure this bag can hold up for college use the outer fabric is very thin and the side pockets do n't seem to be useful , they 're not big enough for anything really and because of the flaps , not even pens there 's also no real place for a water bottle either if you buy , definitely spray some kind of protection on it like scotchguard it is cute and stylish though and ill hang on to it just not sure it 'll work for the purpose it was purchased for
pros : it 's adorable and well made cons : it can fit one large text book and a very thin binder and your laptop if you have more than one textbook , it probably will not fit
the material is much more <unk> than it looks in the pictures , but the bag is still very cute i got the yellow , which is a very bright <unk> yellow with a <unk> polka dot white lining the inner laptop compartment is padded and soft , so i do n't worry about my computer i just do n't store my phone or tablet in the front pockets because i 'm concerned they 'll fall out for the price , the front flap is kind of a big flaw that the attractiveness of the bag does n't quite compensate for i may add an additional fastener in the middle , but it will probably affect the appearance of the bag
i love the design of this bag and the red is a beautiful deep red color it fits my laptop but this bag is not very functional it has velcro closure and never stays closed it hangs open and i am always worried about my items falling out
there was polka dots on the interior , which are not my style it 's a pretty big bag , as the sizes show the outside is super cute , so bummed about the polka dots that were not in the description not nice enough for interviews or a super professional setting , but good for
right size , right volume , right shape , perfect bag of holding for my laptop , tablet and host of accessories i need to carry had this bag in its first <unk> , but my kid <unk> it for work and loved it so much she asked to keep it love the new polka dot lining , adds a sense of <unk> this bag is perfect for travelling and will hold all you need and <unk> liked it so much i even purchased the matching purse the only reason this does n't get a # are the velcro front closures you would think that with all the thought regarding protecting your stuff that went into it they would choose a more secure closing however the velcro does hold very well and i 've only had issue once i 'd highly recommend this or any of the other bags in this line
i searched for days to find a bag the reviews on this one are spot on sturdy build , padding and plenty of room and pockets the flap is held by velcro so over stuffing and bulky items can be a visually awkward problem love the bright fun interior in contrast to the black -lrb- but kind of looks super navy blue -rrb- exterior the only thing is the strap sturdy and thick , it would be nice if it came with padding it 's like an annoying seatbelt digging into your shoulder if you carry heavy items
i really liked this bag , but it just was n't big enough to use for college it held my computer and binders just fine , but would n't carry those extra things i wanted have with me if i were carrying a purse with me as well it would have worked also , the external pockets are so tight that they are unusable i bought this in terra , which is actually a brown color -lrb- not as it looks on the screen -rrb-
i bought this to carry my books , macbook air and be able to take it to work and carry important files it works perfect the quality is nice and it really holds up well through my busy day i enjoy all the compartments as well
the bag is good i just wish it closed with clips and not the velcro , which forces me to put things in the zippered pocket overall it 's a good bag , i do love the color and the buttons
i purchased this bag to carry my # & # # ; macbook it has extra compartments for a phone , cables , and other accessories it is large enough that i have my wallet , glasses case , and small cosmetic bag even though all of these items fit in the bag , it does not look to big in comparison to other messenger bags if i had to choose one thing i do n't like , it would be that the flap uses velcro to keep it closed a buckle , snap or magnet of some type would be preferred all in all , i love this bag the color is true to what is online -lrb- tide -rrb- and the interior fabric makes it easy to find things the laptop has a separate padded compartment to keep it away from other items i would recommend this bag
i ordered this bad to carry my laptop the color is very vibrant ; however , the bag is entirely turquoise with no black accents as it is pictured i love the tablet holder in the back of the bag the velcro does not hold the front of the bag closed as well as i would have hoped
it 's a nice bag it holds most of my stuff that 's only because i have a lot of stuff but it 's very sturdy i just wish i got the larger one because my lap top does n't fit but , this one was cuter i really like the bright colored polka dots it makes it a more fun bag . received a lot of complements on it i also received the bag very quickly in about # days of me ordering it that really surprised me since i just used regular
the buttons are not secured properly two were lost with in the first week of use however i love the bag and considering getting one in an other style i contacted the company who is sending me <unk>
the bag works great and is a good mix of style and professionalism for me the only con i have is the velcro which holds the front flap closed wears out like all velcro does
# changes that would make this an awesome bag - zippers on front being at the bottom - pockets on sides big enough to put a phone in - they are superfluous , at best - deeper pockets for the # pen holder
i love this bag the only reason it did n't get # stars was i wish the bag was a little more rigid considering it gets filled up with everything also , as a previous reviewer stated , it has velcro as a closure i would have preferred snaps or a zipper it fit everything perfectly , except my huge laptop -lrb- which i have a hard time finding anything to fit that -rrb- it did contain my tablet , huge wallet , cords and a tablet sized covered notepad . stays clean and is very roomy
very cute bag i wish the strap was a little more centered as the bag sort of falls forward when you set it up against a wall , etc . the strap is sewn on the back and not centered so i think that may have something to do with it the front is only secured by velcro so it comes undone at times but i think i could probably sew some snaps in there to make it more secure other than that , it 's super cute and has lots of compartments a must buy as it 's probably one of the cuter bags out there for laptops
the main message with this & # # ; messenger & # # ; bag is this : you are super chic and <unk> the blue exterior is gorgeous as well as very sturdy and the rainbow polka-dot interior is always such a fun surprise when opening the bag i get compliments on it all of the time
this bag is fantastic i 've wanted a bag that looks good and is big enough to fit my # & # # ; laptop for a while now and this one is the perfect size i use it for my school bag and have plenty of space for my books , pens , and folders the padding on this bag is great and has still held strong even though i 've already put it through quite a bit i would definitely recommend this bag and will be buying more ogio products in the future
i was totally surprised with this messenger bag , it is perfect in size , style and color the price was definitely right as well love this product ... might purchase the matching backpack thanks ogio and amazon
i receive so many compliments on this bag and i 'm very happy with it i do n't have any problems with the velcro and the strap is fine for me i can adjust the strap so that it does n't hang too low on my # & # # ; frame and if i extend the strap i can wear it cross-body style i do n't generally carry my laptop , but the few times that i have has been fine i can fit many manilla files in the back pocked and several notebooks in the front i also carry my cellphone , ipod and several other devices regularly the little <unk> are n't very useful to me because they seem too narrow and inconvenient to put anything it the inside of my bag is in a very vibrant rainbow polka dot pattern , but i kinda like that also , the black is more of a <unk> gray i have to say that i am really enjoying this bag
love the color love all the compartments love the zipper on the back to attach to a suitcase handle while traveling especially love the bright <unk> green for spring it 's the perfect bag
perfect size if you only carry a few folders -lrb- go green and use the cloud ! ! -rrb- i get alot of compliments and i am sure sales have gone up as i have seen many in my office now carrying them
i use this everyday for work i 've had this for about two months now and i absolutely love it it 's holding up great , looks great and carries both my # ' laptop and ipad with extra room to
i replaced my regular backpack with the ogio manhattan messenger bag -lrb- in the blue `` tide `` color -rrb- for college the surprising thing is , all of my stuff fits this bag has alot of room it 's definitely a well made bag too - the shoulder buckle is sturdy , the strap is like a seatbelt , and the pockets for electronics are lined with a soft <unk> like material the bottom and back of the bag are padded -lrb- the back is a black quilted panel -rrb- the only complaint i can come up with for this bag is that the little flap pockets on the sides are shallow , and ca n't fit a pen or pencil without the flap remaining up the buttons on the front of the bag are super cute also , the zipper pockets on the front are two separate pockets - one small and one large that overlap inside overall , the bag is great quality , spacious , and lovely to look at
i love my new school bag i bought this in september as a & # # ; back to school & # # ; gift for myself i 'm a teacher ... and have not only loved it myself , but have had a number of people want to get one just like it the color is super vibrant , and not something you would find in any store , so i love that the interior space for my laptop is perfect and has this nifty velcro closure that keeps everything & # # ; tight & # # ; without being difficult to get in or out the interior is lined with a cute polka-dot patterned silky fabric too , which i think is unique my only complaint is that the pockets for pens and such are a little shallow what i mean is that your pens will stick halfway out if they are normal sized i 'm not super bothered by it because i tend to just toss my pens in the bottom of my bag , but you might not like that part regardless , i would buy this bag again in a heartbeat ... maybe i 'll buy myself one of their purses
i was looking for a laptop bag that was stylish and durable , and this one fits the bill i have been very pleased with it so far there are many nice pockets large and small the bag itself if light , unlike many other bags i 've seen it 's a great travel partner with the pocket on the back allowing you to attach it quickly to the handle on your suitcase , securing it in place i have received many compliments on it , and while this is the first ogio product i have owned , i have no doubt that it will be the last
the ogio <unk> bag is great quality & very cute my laptop is about # / # x # / # and it fits perfect i love the polka dots inside -lrb- business on the outside , party on the inside -rrb- very classy but not too stuffy
this is a great everyday messenger bag there are lots of pockets and it is very attractive people stop me to tell me how much they love the bag and ask where to get one
it 's perfect i have a long commute and a few blocks walk to work everyday i typically carry my laptop home from work on days when there may be <unk> weather or when i work from home the quality of this messenger bag rivals other more expensive leather bags on the market even thought this is cloth , its seems to be highly durable and well made it often feels as though my items are lighter when using this back , compared to my other bag i am assuming this is because of the compartmentalized features that allow for each of my items to fit securely inside the strap is adjustable and also very comfortable not to mention how nice looking this bag appears
i love it medium is a perfect fit for a slim # . # laptop between the foam - it will fit one even little larger in the front compartment , but you do n't get the foam padding lots of room for stuff , lots of pockets - very pretty i ordered the tide blue and it 's a nice color with colored polka dots on white inside i 'm really really happy
i love it it has room for everything and the color of the internal pattern is great who would have thought a light interior would make such a difference i 'll probably buy another one in a different color
this is the only bag i use when going in to work for my laptop -lrb- i normally just put my wallet in my laptop bag to avoid carrying too many bags -rrb- even with the long trip from the parking lot to the office , this bag stays fairly comfortable plus , i have gotten numerous compliments on it already
i have a # `` mac book pro laptop that is hard to find covers and bags for it fits perfectly -lrb- with room to spare -rrb- in this messenger bag the color is so fun and i get tons of compliments on it the way the strap is designed , it stays so nicely on my shoulder it 's not bulky and does n't add weight to my already hefty laptop love the button design great job , ogio
i love , love , love this bag it has the best polka-dot lining i seriously have loved it it is very durable , it fits my # & # # ; laptop wonderfully i like the strap i carry this bag everyday , and it will last a long time
the fit was never quite right for my # macbook air # & # # ; i thought that it would be good enough at first , until it slightly started to chip and fall apart because of the poor fit i did contact both amazon and kuzy but never heard back from either i would spend more and get something from a vendor the responds to concerns
the plastic clips that attach to the macbook air are very weak they rear clips for the bottom portion chipped off and cracked a couple weeks after i attached the case also , this thing attracts fingerprints like crazy a damp rag will remove them , but i was n't expecting a rubberized case to get smudged up so easily
let me say that i have had no problems whatsoever with the top half of the case the bottom half of the case , however , has now lost it 's third of four clips i do not use my macbook air heavily , however with normal wear , the clips have snapped off the bottom panel now barely stays on and i have to use tape to keep it on oh , i forgot all the rubber feet fell off the bottom too so now they are just slippery hard plastic
i bought this case a little less than # months ago it fits and feels great on the macbook air , but the rubberized pads are extremely weak the case slides everywhere when placed on a flat surface without the rubber pads spend a little more money and get a case that lasts
this is for the red version of this only the case seemed decent , but i hated the red it was a very muted red , sort of a dark pink , and would not have complemented the macbook air that i was going to put it on the red you see in the images is # x darker and brighter ... and this is n't a monitor issue , they are simply <unk> the photos i 'd rather see a picture of the actual product
front cover near hinges has obvious wear and tear , looks like a used product cover for the bottom has same wear on the front in one specific spot near the left side of the trackpad it does n't fit flush and easily <unk> <unk> spend more money for a quality product or you wo n't be satisfied i 'll remove this review if kuzy accommodates me properly also , the rubber on the bottom is n't centered and there 's visible glue on them looks like they sent me a refurbished product
top snaps on bottom , <unk> snaps on i almost broke the case trying to make it fit the material is very cheap and would not protect the computer in any sort of a collision , in fact i think it may be more dangerous to have this case on your macbook air it 's great that they made a space for the second microphone , but when the case does n't even fit it wo n't work right
the color is bright , and the texture is rubberized in a good way , like it might not actually slide around too much that said , the case does not fit a macbook air a # , despite the seller clearly listing it as compatible with that model the bottom piece was loose after snapping on , and will not stay fixed will be returning
it 's an okay case not the highest of quality especially for what it 's housing , the macbook air the edges on the one i received are n't cut very well so its a little rough to the touch with some white marks but it works also there are rubber balls on the bottom of the case to keep the device from moving on the table but one of mine are missing , it 's not too bad , it does n't wobble too badly it 's an okay case i would pay a little more for a better case
is that a sticker on the outside of the one pictured with my wife 's brand new macbook air , the apple logo does not shine through the case nearly as & # # ; bright & # # ; as the picture shows nice case , but if you 're looking for the style that is shown in the picture , i 'd recommend going with a different color or maybe a different brand and hope for better luck in seeing the logo
instead , hard shell plastic there are four feet on the bottom that are the only rubber on the case at all the may be a different case altogether , but i feel like this was a bait and switch to be honest i would not rate it a # , because it is very close to the blue color on the listing
the color was as expected , and the texture was very smooth but the bottom part did not fit i tried # + times trying to get the bottom part on and still it did not work ended up with a couple scratches on my new macbook air i really liked everything else about the case though wish it fitted my macbook now i just have to return it
i loved this case , for the first # weeks after awhile , the feet -lrb- # of them that supports the <unk> -rrb- came off one by one another issue was with the rubberized case for some reason , it would leave a trail of black rubber particles on my desk i wish they made the feet more durable and the case rubber more & # # ; hard & # # ;
i returned this product for two reasons first , the color was n't as shown it 's a simple thing to get right and all products that are used for aesthetic purposes should take great care to <unk> their colors this missed the mark second , despite being well wrapped , there was a blemish on the inside of the top lid part because this is a semi-transparent cover and it 's fitting over a consistent , light surface of a macbook air , the blemish was painfully obvious macbooks are beautifully designed , and having that smudge would have made me mental i should also mention that this case retained oils from touching it , so even if it has n't been <unk> , it would have likely looked bad after some wear and tear anyway
cover is nice - lightweight , nice <unk> the bottom case cover does not <unk> onto the laptop , however it could have gotten a # or # star rating , but it does not protect my laptop debris will enter between the case cover and laptop and that will lead to a million tiny little scratches i do not recommend
i was hoping to protect my case , and give it more support as i carried the open computer around it does give a bit more support to the structure , but the plastic is cheap and the bottom piece prevents the screen from opening past a # degree angle wo n't be using this
nice and sleek design feels great , however the construction is only moderate my bottom cover would not snap on completely and the bottom front would lift out of the cover because of this also the top cover seems to add weight to my screen and makes it feel flimsy i really wanted to like this cover ... = -lrb- sorry forgot to mention , i have a brand new macbook air #
i have the a # , and the label on the bag says that this is the correct model for my laptop it even has the dual mic cutout on the right everything seemed to fit tightly -lrb- when attaching the bottom piece , i had to slide the front lip in first in order to get it to snap on tightly -rrb- however , when opened , the black plastic from the lcd case presses against the two little rear clips of black plastic from the bottom part this only allows a # -degree opening the top cover was attached properly -- the indentations met properly on all three sides my macbook is perfectly aligned , and the cover was perfectly attached , yet there was n't enough clearance to allow the thing to open all the way without putting pressure on the hinges i do n't understand how others found that it opens properly
it seems to be bent on my left side of the bottom case it does n't snap fit on that side it 's quite annoying while using it hope to do something about it
it has a matte finish color if you have greasy hands or what so ever , you can see it on the case the case it for both top and underside of macbook air my only big problem was that the under side does not fit properly
i can not get the lower shell to attach correctly the right side will not clip over the side of the macbook i bought # of these cases for my # macbook airs because they look good and are super thin , but i am having the same problem with both the case is also only $ # from kuzy where i paid $ # ordering through amazon i assume this equals out when you add in shipping
i love the color and that it is see through however , the bottom part wo n't nap in on both sides the top fits perfectly also , seems to show dirt easily because of the light color
pretty disappointed in this product the color shown on the ad is not the color of the actual case it 's a very light purple - not bright like in the photo it 's made ok enough , but not what i wanted at all
i purchased this cover for the computer i use at work , where we all have identical laptops my coworkers purchased covers that were half the price of the kuzy i purchased and there was no difference between their covers and mine we took them off our respective computers and could not tell the difference in addition , they received keyboard covers for a few dollars more as a part of the package they purchased they purchased their product on amazon as well not displeased with the product , but not worth the $ # . # price look around for a better deal before you buy
i 've been enjoying my kuzy case -- it has already saved my air from a couple of nasty falls and makes a great place to slap all my laptop stickers without marring the surface of the air my only complaint is that the rubber feet on the bottom of the case are rather easily dislodged , particularly as you pull the laptop in and out of backpacks , <unk> , etc . it 's gotten so bad that , if the air is sitting on a flat surface and i accidentally jostle it , the feet stay behind and the rest of the laptop will slide along other than that , it 's a great product it would be a # star recommendation from me , absent the feet issue
the color is beautiful and the texture is nice but for some reason the top could fit on but the bottom could n't and when i tried to get the top off it was extremely difficult i basically had to pry it off sad to return this because it would 've been so
the color is n't exactly as advertised and you can only see the apple when your light on the back is on i 've had it for # months and the rubber bumps on the bottom are falling off it is durable and soft though
i read the reviews before this purchase and still took a chance i have a # macbook air and the bottom half of this cover does n't fit onto the laptop all but one of the clips snaps onto the laptop i 've tried several different angles to get it on and i have had no success my roommate got the same exact cover and has the same exact model of laptop i think this may depend on a case by case scenario -lrb- pun intended -rrb- my case does stay on the laptop fairly well even though one clip does n't snap on it might be worth looking into another brand if you are really particular about that kind of stuff
i received by hard case a few weeks ago while overall i am happy with the purchase , i would have liked the design to be more exact when you flip the laptop open , the top and bottom pieces of the cases overlap up until now this has not caused any problems , but i for see one of the pieces eventually breaking
this is another almost great product why do so many manufacturers come up with good ideas and then fail to think them through from the user 's point of view one of the cool things about the macbook air is the lighted apple on the lid this item covers that up they use a false picture to advertise it the picture makes you think there 's a clear spot for the apple to shine through , but there is n't for the money they charge , there should be i use it -lrb- because i spent the money and it does fit well -rrb- but can not recommend buying this it could have been
the rubber legs on the bottom slide off they need to be glued better or something overall its ok just need to figure out how <unk> legs to stay
i probably just got a defective one , but the bottom piece does not snap on and never did i tried bending it and forcing the computer in , but it just is n't right the top fit perfectly and i would 've loved it if the bottom fit it 's just a millimeter too snug , which is what makes me think it 's just a defect
i 'm getting ready to order another one of these that means i liked it , but damaged it removing it for cleaning really liked the compactness and feel - and good protection for traveling , etc . but when i tried to remove it to clean it up , it broke in a couple of places
this case fits perfectly and is a gorgeous , bright sapphire blue it is a very tight fit it was very difficult to put on , but once it was on it did n't slip , <unk> , or cause any problems whatsoever ... until the day that i needed to remove it for a repair i tried and tried to get it off , and finally had to resort to prying it apart from the computer with a butter knife this resulted in a scratched computer and a broken case i 'm giving it points for beauty and fit , but taking away points for functionality i should n't have to resort to <unk> in order to remove my case i really was afraid i 'd break the computer in the process of trying to get the case off
i really liked the look and feel of this case the color is an opaque <unk> blue , and the texture is satiny but rubberized enough to provide a good grip unfortunately i had to return it because it did not fit my laptop the bottom half of this cover did not fit my june # macbook air - it would not snap on all the way and fell off easily additionally , this cover <unk> the microphone opening for this model the top of the cover fit very well but was very hard to remove
the product is just ok it fits well on my mac but there are some <unk> plastic in the edge of cover -lrb- top and bottom -rrb- which clearly means that the finishing is not that great besides that , the cover looks cool , i do not regret on my purchase , just will look for a different brand next time
fits like a glove but the rubbers below are just stuck on and less than a month later they have fallen off the case also attracts and keeps fingerprints
and the texture and it fit very well my complaint is that after only about # months of use -lrb- no heavy use and most of the time on a desk , not in a bag -rrb- , one corner piece near the computer hinge fell off it had never been dropped , hit etc . it stays on , but i am worried that more pieces might fall off
i purchased this hoping to protect my macbook air ... unfortunately when the cover is on the the screen will slowly open depending on the viewing angle sadly it seems to be the angle i always want to use i removed the cover after # days use this is not really a problem with the cover , it is a problem with the new macbook hinges ... they just do n't have enough friction
not much to review with this it does n't add to much to the air 's profile so that 's a bonus snapping on to your air is easy enough and i would say it is more plastic than rubberized after a month of use , the rubber coating is wearing off in the area where you lift the laptop open -lrb- middle top -rrb- other than that , it 's fine
i wanted to love this case , but it cracked after only a year of usage on a mac book air that i rarely transport outside my home the plastic does n't seem sturdy enough to be secure i emailed the manufacturer twice about the problem and did not receive a response
good quality case the black case looks really nice were it not for the poor quality glue used on the feet i 'd probably give it # stars instead of # the feet will eventually come off mine started coming off slowly one at a time after a couple of months going to try to glue them back on with a quality glue
the case isnt as rubberized as some other cases i have an incase on a different mac and that one is a little better , but twice as much $ it doesnt clip on all the way , but serves as a case
i love the color of this case and it fits my mid- # macbook air very well i just wish it did n't say ` kuzy ' on the front corner , although it 's barely noticeable , and i also wish it was a little easier to take off since sometimes debris gets stuck inbetween
i have had this cover for over year ive had to pop it off a few times which did break a clip but it still stays on the texture is smooth and there are feet to the case when you do take the cover off , there is some dirt that does get trapped it is so so because if you take it off to clean it could break but it has been working great for me
i really enjoy the case the negatives are the color was off from the description and it came with one of the feet broken the product is good - just if you want that & # # ; tiffany blue & # # ; this is not it
i really like my cover it was very easy to put on and it looks great the only downside is if your hands have any oil on it the cover is quick to absorb it and leave a stain i just used a wet wipe and it removed the oil and came off pretty easily other then that i would recommend this product hopefully when my wife gets her mackbook air , we 'll get her one too
well , this stylish case has cons and pros + stylish + pleasant to touch + stand out against a background of thousands of grey laptops - easily soiled - difficult to install - makes the laptop
this case is a true snap-on case , it protects the macbook on top and on bottom in fact it snaps on so well i can not get it to come off finally i managed using a credit card to lift the small hooks with which the case is attached to the macbook unfortunately that damaged the edge of the cover photo which i had put on the lid good protection , it does not come off
a perfect fit took some work to get it all the way on have n't taken it off so i 'm not sure how the clips will stand up to repeated removal will update if they become a problem overall it is exactly what i was looking for
my daughter had been wanting a cover for her laptop and i found this online she seemed to be very pleased with it the price was good ... unlike other apple products
picked this up even after seeing some comments that they do n't always fit mine fits perfect and i love it it 's got a great & # # ; feel & # # ; to it and looks just as good as the higher end products that they sell in the official apple stores it does what it needs to do , which is protect my computer from bumps and bruises
almost perfect fit on rare occasions , # of the # snaps that hold the base protector can & # # ; pop & # # ; out but does not put the lt in danger of damage just pop it back in place with firm pressure - no big deal the only reason i 'm not giving it # stars is the added thickness and bulk can put a sleeve in <unk> of no longer fitting - be careful
everything fit well after taking some time to figure out which went were color is really nice but when i got it the bottom part has a small crack on the upper left side was n't entirely broken but i hope it lasts
