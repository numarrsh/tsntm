the reviews here indicated either this sleeve is a good fit or a little loose i have no idea what people who believe it 's a `` good fit `` for a macbook air # . # `` are thinking this is a loose fitting case it will protect your computer ok and the side pockets are nice , but if you want a snug fit for a macbook air , look elsewhere
the case is nice , but the zipper broke after about two months i was not <unk> the case to my knowledge , the teeth on the zipper just separated one day and now the case is pretty much worthless as i ca n't close it anymore
overall a seemingly decent product , but ill-fitting for a macbook air ; it leaves too much room for the macbook air to slide around in , which makes it more difficult to also place into other bags for transport
as a result it is pretty easy to get the computer in and out , but it does n't snuggly fit on the computer i 'd like it a little bit slimmer the power adapter pocket works well enough , but it would be nice if it just covered the entire side instead of the corner like that i have to take the adapter out of the sleeve when going through security -lrb- depending on how much of a <unk> is running the x-ray machine -rrb- anyway but it is nice to have a place to secure it to the computer my last sleeve did n't have that as with many neoprene products , there is a strong smell that takes about a month to go away but it does go away
this is a decent sleeve and protects the macbook nicely it was a challenge finding a sleeve that would fit the # & # # ; macbook since apple does n't make that size anymore , so the options were limited this case logic sleeve has a soft touch and is padded enough to protect the only drawback is that smudges like lotion on your hands start to show up on the outside and make it look worn one feature i like is the slim pocket on the outside , though like other reviews here , it pretty much only stores the adapter and a small flash drive
i chose this product because it has the extra pocket for holding your charger and maybe a mouse which is very rare is not something that is common for laptop sleeves that i have seen it also can hold the # & # # ; macbook pro with a hard case attached which is great it does offer my laptop an okay amount of protection when travelling however the sleeve is just a little to big for my liking it really does n't give the tight fit that i would prefer also it does n't have a handle -lrb- i knew this when i bought it -rrb-
i got this for lenovo yoga # pro it fits fine . a little left over zipper side it good since i do n't want the zipper to touch it is just a sleeve it will not protect the laptop from impact , but will do prevent scratch zipper on the side can fit the lenovo charger and may be a couple of small items just do n't fit too much since the sleeve is n't really thick i am using a backpack with padding inside for laptop compartment i am still looking for a better one that has foam material under the zipper from one side to the other side so that zipper can never touch the laptop for now , this does an ok job
this case would be just what i need and want if it actually fit my macbook air better i have a # & # # ; macbook air an when i put it in the sleeve it is a little too loose for me do n't get me wrong it does fit but it has about a half of inch left of room on top of it when zippered fully closed the zipper has a lining to prevent your mac from getting scratched the sleeve does have a rubbery smell so i put some dryer sheets in it so hopefully the smell will go away overall the case is nice because of the extra pocket if it did not say it fit the macbook air on the packaging meanwhile it doesnt fit it well enough i would have given this product a # star rating not bad for the price the pocket is a big reason why im keeping it plus shipping back is a
this case is a descent case , it does what its supposed to i guess it fits the macbook pro # inch nicely even if you have a hard case on top i guess what my issue is is that it does n't seem very attractive to me the inside looks to made of a cheap but soft material that is an unusual dirty green kind of color the pocket on the outside is barely big enough to fit the massive apple wire as well all in all i do n't think it was worth the money , could have been cheaper priced
soft sleeve with & # # ; ok & # # ; fit not that impressed and would tell you to go to best buy , etc and look first , hands on <unk> to see if you like it before ordering it
i like the feel of this case and how soft the inside is the zippers work well the pouch on the outside is handy for storing the charger , etc . however , this case is not a snug fit for the newest macbook pro w / retina display -lrb- released oct # -rrb- the case 's dimensions allow for almost an extra inch in length and width i do n't like my new computer sloshing around in this case i will be returning it in a day or two when i have time to ship it back
although advertised for both the regular and retina models , you really should n't expect this sleeve to fit well on the retina model the mbp retina slips and slides around inside and is a little awkward to carry for that reason oddly , mba cases fit much better
the case itself is well made ... but it 's too big for my # & # # ; mbp non-retina that causes the sleeve to bend in areas that dont hug the laptop not particularly happy with this one , but i guess it at least protects my laptop during travels
the compartment that holds the mac is just fine - a perfect fit however the side pocket that is supposed to hold accessories is not nearly big enough to hold the power brick and cord that is my only gripe about the case i had a case logic case/sleeve for my macbook # `` , and that had a much larger pouch for accessories , and the brick and cord fit in nicely
i use a speck hard shell on my macbook pro # `` and it made the fit a bit tight the zipper broke off after only # uses or so , so i would n't recommend this case if you use a shell not necessarily the product 's fault , but i felt it broke pretty easily i 'll return it and try something else
be careful with this one if you are ordering the sleeve for macbook pro # retina display you should know that this is not nearly a snug fit the laptop will be loose in there with about # & # # ; of slack both directions it is really hard to find a snug fit for the new macbook pro -lrb- i ended up buying one of the sleeves at apple retail store for # . # times the price of this one , but at least the fit is right .
it was fast shipping , but theres almost no padding for your mac or other notebook the zipper split after week # and now im probably going to go get a real brand name sleeve . other than that , it 's nice for $ #
i have used other sleeves by incase and they are much better then this one this one is a bit then and does n't feel like there is a lot of protection there also it fits in the sleeve a little loose and i even have a shell on my mac book pro retina i do like the stretchy material , but it does n't seem real strong but hey you never know i like the fact that it has a zipper pocket to put things in if you are looking for an inexpensive sleeve that is cheap and your not worried about the quality then this is a good buy , otherwise spend more and get something better this will hold me over for a few months
it 's too loose for my # macbook air # inches the padding around the corners is not thick enough they should use some sort of rubber around the <unk> of the case the protection on top and back seems good the extra pocket is really good and helpful
purchased for a mac book pro retina laptop this sleeve provides some protection from scratches and cushioning the sleeve however has a very loose fit so it will move around a lot in the sleeve i would not purchase again as i would prefer to find a sleeve that fit more snugly it just feels strange to carry it and have the computer inside moving around
this is made of a nice material , and i really like the second pocket for the cord , but the zipper started snagging on the surrounding material after only a few days i 'm having to return it i might buy another one , but maybe there 's a better product out there
the case is very soft and the inside will not scratch your device the exterior pocket is nice to have but if you are looking for a durable and protective case this is not the one to get it will not absorb any impact
i have not experienced any problems with this case it is light , the laptop fits easily it has a slot for a usb in the zipper pouch the pouch is n't too big and cant really fit the charger too well , but it does a good job protecting my laptop
the construction of this sleeve seems great overall , i 'm happy with it , but it does not fit my # & # # ; macbook pro as well as i had expected it fits rather loosely inside the sleeve
this case does the job of being an extra layer of protection between my macbook pro and my backpack the mixed reviews are all <unk> , positive and negative it 's an affordable case but it is a little too big for my # `` laptop if you 're like me and refuse to drop # on a neoprene case this is a great choice i do n't know if it scratches the laptop corners since i 've had it for less than a month
this case is very nice we like the extra pocket for the charger in our experience , the macbookpro fits loosely in the case maybe a bit too loose others have remarked the case is too tight ... not sure why there are differences
it 's quality is very good comparing to other one which i ordered before . the color and other things are exactly as it looks in picture . it seems sturdy and durable however , the caselogic logo strings are opening and i have to somehow fix it another point is that , i expected it to be more fit to my laptop because it is said that it is designed for <unk> # <unk> the laptop stands about # inch shorter that the zip when you open the case so when you carry the case on your hands you do not feel very good
i love this case i use the extra pocket for a usb <unk> drive and power cord -lrb- the long # <unk> power cable does not fit , just the # prong on the power supply -rrb- it does n't scratch the corners at all i guess i wish the pocket was a little bigger but whatever it 's big enough for what i need . # stars for small pocket
the good : nice soft sleeve with <unk> interior very useful exterior pocket -lrb- the reason i bought this sleeve -rrb- , which can hold your power <unk> and a thumb drive / usb drive or wifi accessory pocket for easy access the <unk> : when you receive the product , you will see that on the packaging is printed `` for macbook pro `` and it also says `` fits macbook air `` yes , the air does fit , but not snuggly there is room for my # air # `` to move a little from side to side and up and down there lacks the snug and tailored fit that i was hoping that is what is keeping me from giving this # stars very few products offer exterior pockets , so this is a good buy but disappointed that it is actually tailored to the dimensions of a # `` macbook pro
i like this case it does a good job in protecting my computer , but i do with the <unk> layer was thicker also , i wish the pocket was larger as well i have a macbook so the charger is quite large and it bulges out the usb pocket is a nice touch though
the case worked great and was exactly as described it works perfectly for what i need got it at a great price too the pocket was nice for my charger and cords
the case is plush enough to protect the laptop in it the side pocket serves great as a holder for the power chord i only wish the inner lining of the case was a little bit better like those of higher end cases
this item fits the description it seems to be well built and fairly sleek unfortunately , it fits more loosely around my # `` macbook pro then what i had anticipated this is what i meant by sloppy i would have liked it to fit more snuggly other than that , great product
the caselogic neoprene sleeve works well as an added level of protection for my macbook air it was a bit larger than i expected , but that does n't cause any issues in terms of protecting the laptop
bought this for my new mac book pro the computer does not slide around in the case and the zipper does not rub against the corners of the computer the front pocket holds the charger if you finagle it a bit the padding seems just thick enough to protect against minor bumps and scratches the interior is faux suede which is holding up so far over all it is a decent laptop sleeve fro the money
i bring my macbook air on the train every day to work this is a nice case in that it is not very heavy -lrb- nice when walking to and from the train -rrb- , but really protects the computer in my briefcase the inside has a really nice soft feel that will has not caused any scratches or issues with the aluminum on my laptop
a tight case for my # `` macbook pro i ca n't say it is a big case , it is tight for my large mac it has a small compartment for taking charger and usb , even iphone also
this is a decent , inexpensive laptop sleeve at # bucks shipped , its an excellent value : it is fairly well-made , and does a good job of protecting my laptop while it 's riding around in my pack inside color , a <unk> , could have been nicer , but that 's really just a <unk> also , it does have a faint chemical smell -lrb- not nearly as bad as the # `` case-logic i ordered -rrb- perfectly fits my thinkpad x # , with room for the charger in the side pocket the small inner pocket for a flash drive is a nice touch
i bought this case after recently purchasing a new macbook pro w / retina display this case is good but you can tell it was obviously ment for the macbook pro w/o retina display i put my computer in and it had a lot of wiggle room overall , its a good product just be sure you know its a little big width-wise , and length-wise for the macbook pro w / retina
perfect for traveling short distance and it is perfect for storage around the house the pocket on the front is a little too small for the power cord but still worth the money
this case was made for older model macbookpros - i have the newest model -lrb- # -rrb- and there is some room to spare around the case this is n't a big deal , but i had a tucano case before for my # `` mbp and it fit perfect just feels better when it is all nice and snug there is ample protection because it is a rather thick case the accessories pouch is nice , but not really that useful as if you are using a sleeve , you are probably putting your computer in another bag if i had more money i would buy the tucano but this case is decent for the price
fits laptops a little bit bigger than # inch -lrb- my samsung q # is # inch screen with a # inch frame -rrb- front pocket ok , if you try to stick your charger in there , is kinda bulky
my case logic arrived fast and its a great case but it barely fit my # `` mac it was very snug and there was literally no additional room ... . measure your carefully
this sleeve looks very nice & neat and has a good feel however , i wish it was much more sturdier at least on one of the sides to protect the computer
i just got my new case and so far it looks like quality stuff the texture on the outside of the case is very appealing and the suede interior does a great job at protecting the
the case is absolutely well made i did n't realized it is for the mbp # & # # ; with cd drive its too big for the newer # & # # ; retina mbp on the bright side , i can carry folders in it as well as my mbp # & # # ; retina
the case i <unk> to use for my mac book air i love the pockets that the case provides and i do feel that the case keeps my computer safe my only issue is that the mac book air is so small and this case makes my computer seems so <unk> . overall this is a very good
if you have the latest macbook pro with retina display , it does fit pretty well although you will feel a little bit of looseness other than that i appreciate the convenient front zipper to put stuff in
i do n't use this case very often only because i am a student and i am always carrying my laptop in my backpack , but when i do use this caselogic sleeve it is awesome i enjoy being able to put my charger in the side pocket , and the usb pocket it just flat out cute
browsing around on amazon i came upon this and bought it it arrived dec # st , as scheduled , i 've had a macbook pro a year now this is something i 've been told i need to protect the laptop from falls , wish i had it before the laptop fits in sleeve comfortably , unlike others that you have to slip & slide them in , leaving room for other things the plus , in title , is for the pocket , in front , with room for battery charger , do n't leave home without that , a wireless mouse , & even a small hub all in all very good value ! !
i 'm quite satisfied i have to carry a macbook pro , power cord , and mouse home from work each day this case , which cost less than half the price of the ones i found in a store , totally meets my needs -- it 's compact , with a pocket to hold the extra components
the product is well-made , and i have n't had any problems during the one year plus that i 've owned it , although it does n't get heavy usage the only issue is that my # -inch hp laptop barely fits into it apparently a macbook is smaller than my laptop , and i need to stretch it to squeeze my hp laptop inside next time i 'll buy a larger sleeve
i purchased this case to provide extra cushion on a # & # # ; mac book pro the case is a very <unk> fit , but it is n't too tight i is working well so far and i have n't encountered any problems it was the right price and seems to be a good quality
great case that fits very well over your # inch macbook or macbook pro i love the usb stick holder inside very simple yet convenient addition the only issue i have is if you are trying to fit your power adapter inside the front pocket the standard mac power adapter fits nicely but i use the extended power adapter with the # prong ground with the extension , it does not fit inside the front pocket so well it makes it kind of <unk> definitely not a deal breaker as the case does what its supposed to do would definitely recommend to others
i like this product and i do n't have any problem recommending it but consumers need to understand that this will not completely protect your mac from the fall i use it to prevent my mac from being scratched , i put my mac in it , and place it inside my backpack or business case when i travel it is still in good condition until now , feb , # nice pocket for small hard drives , pen , etc . i do n't think the power cord will fit in the pocket i did not try , i thought it will look weird i hope you find review useful
just what i needed i am very happy with the product i would recommend this product for someone who wants to be able to store their laptop and accessories easily for transportation
this is like the standard neoprene sleeve the case is n't as snug a fit as the ones sold in apple stores , but i have no problem with that the extra pocket is very nice
a bit too large for my # & # # ; macbook pro , but still works great i like the padding thickness and feel and the pocket is what really sold me just know that a # & # # ; macbook will have # & # # ; extra space around it
at first look , it does n't look that impressive the fit is n't that tight and there is no neoprene flat to protect the computer from the zipper however , it is a well made case and the loose fit allows the case to be used even when your macbook has a hardshell cover on it the pocket is perfect for the power supply and i like the little thumb drive holder the plush lined interior is a nice touch too i would recommend it if you are looking for an affordable neoprene sleeve
well made , i bought this for my mac pro it had enough cushion , and fit perfectly it has a extra pocket for the cord and mouse i would of given # stars but it did not come with a handle
the case offers protection but it 's a little thinner than i would have liked the extra pocket for cables is really good , i am glad it 's there i wish there was a handle of some sort and had more material to it overall , but this is a good product and gets the job done i will keep it and use it for my new macbook pro for as long as it holds up no need to replace with something more expensive i am able to recommend this product , all in all
nothing spectacular to write about good quality for the price then again , i have not done much more research than reviewing others on the same product i am happy with it there may be other better product out there , go for it if you have time to search and <unk> i am happy with what i 've got and am not looking back
the fit is just right and the outer pocket is just what i want for quick runs out this is actual my second of thus style -lrb- first was for a pc -rrb- i 'm very happy with the fit and lining only down side is the third time out the main pocket zipper pull came off sure i can fix it , but should i have to thus is the reason for only # stars
an elegant and light sleeve , that easily fits my macbook pro # ' , the charger and my usb modem the only problem i had was packaging the sleeve , it came unpackaged in my shipment box , which made it vulnerable to pressure or damage from other items in my shipment
this sleeve is a perfect fit for my macbook and great for protecting my laptop when i 'm carrying it in my backpack it looks fairly stylish , but it definitely does n't have enough protection just to use it as a primary carrying case i docked a star because one of the rubber zipper tags tore off after a few months of use did n't ruin the functionality but mildly annoying nonetheless
perfect price , exactly what i wanted except it is a bit roomy for my macbook pro # & # # ; maybe the design was meant to accomodate macbooks with a hardshell case in addition to the neoprene sleeve ... who knows i would still recommend it
i have a # inch mac air with a hard plastic case on it and this sleeve is n't a perfect fit , a bit big , but it does its job the sizing is the only potential negative thus it gets # stars i like that i can fit my charger in the front pocket , the material stretches to accommodate it , but is still protective it 's a nice laptop cover , well made
it does it 's job , it fits my # ' macbook pro retina and gives added protection in my backpack -- but it is a bit big for it ... not a sleek , tight fit
quality of material is n't as good as the incase sleeves , but still pretty good there ' s a little bit of room between the macbook and the sleeve once you put it in there , but it 's not too big of a deal and the zipper never hits my macbook the pocket was useful some of the time and could hold the charger without the extension cord if you do n't mind the case being a little bulkier there 's also a usb holder inside the pocket
this is a good case for my mbp it fits really well and has a nice <unk> feeling to it however it is not going to save your mbp from a fall only one gripe i had is that the material inside could have been more polished after all it is protecting a macbook pro however you get what you pay for at the price point of this case , it is an excellent investment
i bought this sleeve for my # macbook pro # inch and i pretty much like it the fit is not so perfect yet it is reasonable inside of the case feels just perfect , very soft and nice i gave # stars sine i payed # $ for it that 's a lit more than it worth i believe i recommend to pay at most # $ for this product hope this helps , good luck
this case does its job and provides great protection what the other cases miss , and why i bought this one was the front pocket i can fit a spare micro usb cable , headphones , mac book <unk> -lrb- with wall adapter -rrb- , and my magic mouse the form could be better -lrb- different colored fur on the inside -lsb- bit ugly -rsb- -rrb- but it functions at it should please note , the zippers will come apart if you pack too much stuff inside of the case
this cover will protect my computer it is exactly what i thought it would be it does have a nice pocket to store the charging cord and a smaller <unk> a usb drive
this case is great it fits perfectly on my macbook pro -lrb- # in -rrb- the pocket is convenient the material is good , it is not too thin like a cheap walmart case , but it is not super thick like an expensive name brand
i only recently acquired a laptop , and there are so many products out there , it is difficult to sort though them all i went with classic , simple , from a company i knew and trusted and the product met my expectations a good deal for the money
i have a hard case on my laptop as well and i have to stretch this case a little to fit it in in fact , i 've kinda <unk> up the zipper on the corner because it does n't always like to stretch enough to go on easily , but it still gets the job done i 'd rather have it a little too tight than way too loose
great soft sleeve for any average user and fits perfectly with # in macbook pro my gf got this for me for xmas and i got ta say it i could n't ask for more it protects the macbook from any <unk> or dirt plus it even contains a convenient pocket to place a usb flash drive which many people bring around with them anyway
it does n't fit quite as perfectly as i 'd like and the extra pocket is n't quite big enough for the power cord to fit comfortable however it gives my computer the kind of protection that i was hoping for so , it 's a good product
bought this case for my macbook pro # `` . the material nice and look good but not that much protect your laptop i use the laptop bag too . to get more protection . because the case it self is not good enough to protect you laptop
this sleeve is thick inside , protective , and exactly what your macbook pro needs the inside is soft and cushioned the small zipper pouch on top fit my huge charger and kept it snug and protected as well recommended to everyone in need of a safe , scratch-free laptop
the product was great , except the interior feels really weird it 's not like the fuzzy incase products that feel extremely soft , it 's a weird and uncomfortable feeling it looks really ugly if you put your charger in the
laptop sleeves do n't get much better than this the inside <unk> made of brushed suede , so its noce and soft for your computer the outside is about # `` thick neoprene and works great for cushion the zippered pouch fits a large mouse , a power cord and has a little slot to store a flash drive love this thing
my girlfriend had the older model for her macbook pro so when i got my new computer i knew that this was a solid choice for a bag theres a great soft foam lining on the inside of the case to keep it from scratching fits my macbook air # in like a glove and does n't scratch my only gripe , and it 's a really minor one is that it does n't seem to be as sturdy as my gf 's old one is it 's a lot thinner honestly though i would n't let that hold you back from this product
it fits very good to my macbook pro # . # `` -lrb- a little bit loose -rrb- it offers a good protection for scratchs , and you can take the laptop easily for carry the only cons , material lacks of shock protection
reasonably priced case that provides adequate protection and a very convenient front pocket i searched long and hard to find a good case for my macbook pro # `` that would fit a speck see-thru shell this case is snug but works well i use the shell with the matte finish on my macbook and it tends to get stick to the sleeve , but not really not an issue only things i would like to see for a # star review would be : <unk> for the main pocket , and the ability to zip the case down a little further on the left side it stops very close to the top and would be a little easier to pull the notebook in and out , especially with a shell on
i was really happy to find this computer case and at such a good price it arrived in great time and quality and the extra pocket is definitely helpful for storing cords or smaller electronic items have already recommended it to several other friends
wanted something slim to carry my # inch macbook pro and it 's power cord on occasion this fits my needs perfectly it is slim , lightweight , offers sufficient protection , looks decent , and is inexpensive
i wrote a review about this company and gave them # or # star , that was because the shipment got messed up some how well i sent an email to the shipper and they sent one out again that night i recieved it in # business days the product fits my macbook pro perfectly and it is super soft on the inside
this fits my macbook pro great some seem to complain that the zipper will scratch the computer but i do n't have that problem maybe that could be the case with older models , but this sleeve fits my spring # `` macbook pro perfect about # `` extra space between the computer and the zipper the small pocket on the front is great for a small portable hard drive or power cord
glad i chose this it 's higher quality than i expected , fabric feels like suede , it 's well made , has a cute little pocket inside to hold the flash drive -- and order was well packaged and <unk> delivered
fits the mbp perfectly has room in the zipper for the power supply with some room to spare perfect for carrying your computer in your back-pack as it protects the computer from the elements however , not a hard case , so this will not help much if you drop it
like i said its great sturdy , fits my mbp with a decent amount of cushion , stretches and fits it with my protective case attached . has a funny smell but a few nights with a scented dry sheet will fix that =
gmyle -lrb- tm -rrb- black <unk> hard case skin for macbook pro # inches # `` - with tpu transparent protective keyboard <unk> a black case that i bought for my macbook pro and it fits perfectly in to the
i use this for my # `` mac book pro and love the extra pocket -lrb- i use it to hold my kindle and/or power supply and/or # g dongle -rrb- the case is easy to carry and offers padding and cover from the rain it is small enough to fit the mbp perfectly , and large enough that i can also include my ipad in there when i travel
having a new laptop , i was looking for a soft case to carry and protect it caselogic has always had quality products with innovative features , so i checked for a laptop case because my laptop was very wide , but not so tall , i chose the macbook neoprene sleeve fit perfectly , and the outside pocket holds the external power pod and small wireless mouse and , inside this zippered pocket is a tiny sleeve for what i call a ` <unk> stick ' , a flash drive
great case for a great price the case is <unk> made for the # inch macbook and the zippered front pocket is very handy for zip drives and other misc . items i highly recommend this case
my girlfriend loves these cases she was looking for a case that would allow her to bring her computer to classes , and that was a decent brand , so i told her about caselogic according to her , it 's a little snug on her late- # macbook -lrb- the only one with an aluminum body -rrb- , and pretty loose on her mid- # macbook air however , she says she loves them regardless she loves that the outside pocket has a space for a usb drive , and says that the pocket is a little snug , especially with the charger 's extension cord she just says that she 'll pack it in a bag -lrb- vaultz mesh storage bags , assorted colors and sizes , # bags -lrb- <unk> # -rrb- -rrb- and that she 'll be fine
i received this case # weeks ago , and it has exceeded my expectations i was apprehensive about the pocket on the side -- i was n't sure if it could * really * hold my power adapter , mouse and sd <unk> drives in there i was pleasantly surprised currently , along with my # `` macbook pro , i carry around my magic mouse , # sd cards , # flash drives and my charging brick with the long power cable i could probably fit a few more things in there if i needed to the neoprene is easy to hang on to and is durable on rough surfaces bottom line -- for the price , this is an all around fabulous sleeve
this case fits the # macbook pro so perfectly -lrb- well i have the speck see thru satin case on the pro -rrb- the case is so thick and strong , i was <unk> when i touched the inside , i know i can trust it for when i 'll be taking my laptop to school i strongly recommend this product if you are a little iffy , i do hope this review helps i would take some photos but having camera issues so please take my word for it * truly worth having * you need a sleeve get the caselogic :
very nice case with great protection for the laptop the outer pocket is convenient , but it is a tight squeeze to get the larger power supply and both cords in it - so i usually just pack them separately overall , i 'm very happy with this purchase
