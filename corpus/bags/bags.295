so , this is the first mac i have owned and wanted to keep it looking new well this cover is absolutely wonderful , and the color , purple , as my favorite , also wonderful perfect cover to save the computer i would definitely buy any other product from this seller since the description was so accurate , and the cover was shipped quickly it is worth the money , and that was not much at all
this case fit perfectly on the new macbook air i chose the clear color because i had a decal , which is easily seen the case does not add any noticeable extra weight like my old case that made the computer too bulky

if you are looking for a seriously protective case this is not it however if you are wanting scratch protection and a bit of fun this is it the color is beautiful , case feels good and went on my mac air perfectly
i was worried that the cover would look cheap - it does n't i wish that it had an apple cutout on the front , but it still shines through when on the color , & # # ; hot blue & # # ; was true to the picture and is <unk> & # # ; tiffany blue . & # # ; very pretty the feel is great , very smooth but not cheap looking plastic it does seem like it will protect mainly from scratches , not drops , but is still great for the price and does not add very much thickness to my macbook fits on well , snaps on easily

order this case for my new mac book air saturday and it arrived tuesday must say . i 'm very please the color is great and really makes my air stand out easy to snap on and off
ordered this to replace a speck case that had fallen apart : corners broke off and the case would n't stay on this new case seems more rubbery than plastic , but fits just as well and is working great at a fraction of the cost of the speck case
the case does just what it is supposed to do fits my macair # & # # ; snugly to protect it from scratches and wear , looks good , and the price is right i had difficulty figuring out which way top cover went initially had to turn it up and down a few times until it snapped right into place maybe the reviewers who say the cover does not fit their macair have the cover upside down the manufacturer might save many returns by simply putting a & # # ; this way up & # # ; label on top cover
received my hot blue case in the mail this morning and i 'm in love the texture is perfect , it ` s easy to install , and it ` s fit is ideal very happy with my purchase
i purchased a new macbook air and wanted something that would n't weigh it down but still provide some protection after reading several reviews and making sure i double checked the year of my macbook , i settled on the topcase cover and i love it it was just what i was looking for and it snapped right on
super cheap and fits the laptop like a glove it has a nice satin feel so you do n't feel like the laptop is going to slip out of your hands

this case is absolutely beautiful and i love how perfect it is it is a hard case so there is no need to worry about it being a gel one that is all flimsy plus the color is absolutely beautiful -lrb-
i have to say that tis covers is very nice color fits perfect into the macbook air and does not look cheap just if you are applying a palm rest cover , do this first before install the case
i got the red case i was hesitant in purchasing this case because it was so cheap in price , but its a very solid case as far as mac book air cases go i have the newest # macbook air the case went on perfectly absolutely no complaints
works great on my air provides excellent protection for the outside , makes it easy to know which laptop is mine and so far has stayed on very well only issue is with one of the hold on tabs it does not want to stay latched , but it does not cause any issues
fits like a glove the colour and material are nice and it firs perfectly the apple can only be seen when the computer is on though since it needs the light to shine through i would recommend this product
i bought both a $ # moshi macair case and this case , figuring id try both nd see which worked best the moshi corner would n't stay on the bottom right corner of the top , so every time i opened my laptop it clicked and came free this case snapped on easily , stays put , and is nice to the touch i bought the black and it looks great ca n't beat the price and the quality
i love blue and this blue hard case is a & # # ; snap & # # ; to put on the macbook air i bought the topcase sleeve bag cover in the same color and the bag fits perfectly over the computer this macbook air is the perfect computer for me i can take it anywhere and use it whenever i want
this product is great - i love the color and texture of it i was hesitant about buying a cover for my macbook air because of the thickness , but i needed something to protect it from scratches it is doing a great job protecting , while remaining thin and looking good it was easy to snap on also so far , i 'm very happy with it

our school recently bought macbooks for all of the teachers i was one of the first to get a case my coworkers who purchased the pearl case are a little jealous of the topcase because it 's rubberized the other cases are very smooth and feel cheaper i 'm very happy about the deep blue color
i ordered the purple cover and it looks fairly similar to the purple cover advertised it fits well on my # inch macbook air the bottom cover does n't block my speakers and the top cover does n't block the apple logo both pieces come off easily whenever i need to clean my laptop i received the case within two days and the top and bottom pieces wrapped neatly and separately when they arrived in the box i 'm pleased with the overall experience
this case is such a pretty color , so durable , easy to put on the laptop , thin this is indeed a great buy , inexpensive , and something that will protect the computer , for sure
the skinny macbook air is simply too skinny and too slippery for me i <unk> covering the sleek design but nearly dropped it a number of times so decided to try this it is just what i needed and fits like a glove love the color too
this is a cute case for the macbook air it does increase the weight , but i really do n't mind because the computer is so light to begin with i got it in pink and i love the color i have no complaints so far and have been using it for a few months
this product is great , it fits perfectly and the color is amazing would recommend this product to anyone that wants to protect their mac while having it look good at the same time
the case is awesome it protects my mac and makes me feel comfortable while traveling or transporting my computer the keyboard cover took about a day to get used to but has come in handy i received my packages in a timely manner with no damage or breaks

the case snaps into place very easily and stays there -lrb- i read someone struggled to remove it , but then why would one want to remove it ? -rrb- bought the case together with the silicone keyboard cover skin and i <unk> n't be more satisfied with both products wich work as i hoped and and my <unk> looks sharp also , the delivery was much faster than <unk>
i mistaken ordering the wrong size and they even received it back and then <unk> the right one : -rrb- the color is beautiful ! ! & # # ; # now my mac air looks beautiful :
this is a great product i really enjoyed giving this case as a gift it came quickly in the mail i have absolutely no complaints i am very happy with my purchase
i had problems with my original order the size was wrong this company stayed on the case until i was happy and satisfied they sent me a new at no charge i love the color
protects my imac air very well i am pretty hard on devices and this hard shell keeps outer cover from getting so scratched up i am a + + + + satisfied with this
i love the look and feel of this cover easy to apply and stays on with no gaps or bulges easy to coordinate with other accessories of same color , even from different companies get one and protect your investment
this product kept my computer perfectly dry when a coffee spilt on it easy to put on and take off - ultimate protection i was very impressed and would recommend it to anyone not to mention it is a great price compared to the outrageous listing other cases go for
the case snaps on easily - and stays on despite the little extra bulk , it fits in my carrier for it still plus , the color is exactly as pictured i love it
this case fits perfectly and it looks amazing on my mba only downside was that a small bit of one the corners fell off from day # but i 'll be honest and say that this did n't change anything , is not loose or anything by the way i have had this for a year already
i ordered this feeling a little skeptical , but it came in the mail really quickly and it fits very well it isnt loose and it stays on id buy it again
this item does exactly what it is supposed to it covers my employer issued macbook air wont keep out water , etc , but i feel fine pushing it into my back pack , not worried about scratching it
i absolutely love my new case i 've looked at cases at stores around me and all were so expensive when i first found this one online , i was a bit hesitant because of the price but ordered it anyways giving it a try when i got it , it was all that i expected the color is perfect and is exact to what it looks like online and it snaps on easily has a smooth rubbery feel to it and does not bulk up my laptop would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for something lightweight and protective without all the extra bulk
the case was just as described and the hot blue color is just beautiful in person a very pretty tiffany color the fit is great and was very easy to install
this is a beautifully made bag with all i needed in a computer case unfortunately , it is not the color shown this was a bit shocking when i opened the delivery the bag is actually a light <unk> color the photos look yellow but that is not even close to the true shade of the bag i am keeping the bag for the quality and functionality but recommend that the photos be change to reflect the true appearance of this bag
this bag is beautifully made and i have received many compliments on it its just different enough and feels stylish and even a bit luxurious with the high quality leather and soft chocolate lining i will buy from this company again for sure already looking forward to choosing my winter bag
i first heard about this unique brand at the buy local fair in <unk> i was amazingly surprised a brand of this international reach would be located in my <unk> of <unk> , and not new york or los angeles even more , their presence in the <unk> events like the buy local fair made me really proud to buy local from them i picked the london bag for my wife because i liked the leather it 's called vegan leather and has a really soft suede feel to it my wife loved it it works really well with her different styles and wardrobe changes throughout the day hope my opinion helps
the fashionable london bag goes with any outfit whether you are in yoga pants or a little black dress , the london bag makes you feel like a million bucks it is beyond functional , you will never be losing your keys and phone again
i absolutely love my graceship laptop bag the design is <unk> perfect and it is so functional i can go from work to school to dinner with my friends just like that there is so much room for my daily accessories as well as my school books and my laptop the fact that it is made from vegan leather is even better best purchase i have made in my college career
this bag has a nice style , but i was disappointed for a couple of reasons i knew that this bag was not leather , but it has a plasticy feel that makes it look and feel sort of cheap the zipper does not glide very smoothly so i 'm concerned about how long it will last the color is a fairly bright blue , and it looked darker on my computer screen -lrb- darker is just personal preference i like more neutral colors for business attire -rrb- i tried returning it and spent $ # to ship it back to graceship they sent it back to me stating they thought it was used i do n't usually write reviews but i felt i should warn others not to purchase from this company unless you are absolutely sure that you wo n't return it
i am a college student that is moving from classes to <unk> , <unk> jobs , hours at the gym , and <unk> meetings and my graceship chicago bag could n't be more perfect for all my needs my laptop is secure inside the pouch and i still have room for binders , books , and even tennis shoes to work out i love the color and the durability of the material , and it is so easy to clean the removable cross body strap is nice when i have it packed for the entire day , but the shoulder straps are great for when i 'm just headed off to a meeting i also love all the pockets and the secure zippers , especially the one in the front that can easily hold my phone and keys while i am busy
this laptop bag is perfect for me , i am able to hold everything i need in it without it becoming to heavy the color is even more beautiful in person i also have it in black and i like that one as well this is a very durable bag , for a reasonable price
the chicago style bag definitely has everything i needed ; i wanted a bag that did n't look like a traditional briefcase , but would store my laptop and other work materials easily this bag helped me get organized and i feel much better i would recommend it to anyone looking to upgrade their bag to something more chic and functional
i purchased this bag as a gift for my mother after she expressed her difficulties in finding a laptop bag suitable for a business women my mother absolutely loves the bag she carries it everyday mom said this was one of the best , most useful gifts she has ever gotten i want to thank the people at graceship for making me look good !
i purchased the bag for my girlfriend and mother who are both professionals in the business world they love the bag and enjoy that people do n't even realized it 's a laptop bag they call it a `` laptop bag in disguise `` it 's great for business women who are on the go and constantly have things to do directly after work like running errands or having a drink with friends it 's very functional and durable for the affordable price tag i would recommend this bag to any woman who wants that all in one bag , but wants to stay ahead of the fashion curve
this bag is great it is always hard for me to find a bag big enough to hold all my stuff and that i actually like , so buying the chicago bag was a perfect decision it is stylish enough for me to carry around everywhere and functional enough for me to be able to carry my laptop and agenda book to work and class the color is fun and it has a shoulder strap that makes it easy to carry anywhere i would definitely recommend this bag and this company to all my friends
this laptop bag is like no other i wanted a laptop case that was n't the traditional bulky , <unk> bag and i found the chicago style it has the ability to be so practical but chic at the same time i love the different compartments for extras like my money , lip gloss and keys so i do n't have to carry an extra purse around that can cause strain from weight this bag is just so functional if you are a student or business woman who does n't want to compromise style , the chicago style laptop case is for you
thought this would be great because i ca n't put carry on overhead does not protect the corner of the computer the hinge of my dell laptop got broken because there is no protection on the corners very disappointed ! !
this product is not the same as the baggallini rolling tote this one has only one large compartment hence one less zipper you can tell from the side photo -lrb- which has just been removed -rrb- just a week ago -lrb- august # -rrb- this product was selling on amazon for $ # . # i wanted the extra compartment so i bought the other one , the rolling tote , for $ # , not this quilted <unk> one i have taken it on one trip as a carryon it held a lot and i am very pleased with it
i bought this on special for $ # figuring if the regular price was $ # this was a really nice piece of luggage it 's ok , just ok i was going to return it because i feel it 's not worth the money i paid , but i like the style and size so will keep it
this bag does what it has to do it has huge storage space the handle goes up easily and the wheels appear as though they will last it 's heavy when empty <unk> of <unk> will last long if you have an <unk> everywhere you may go , this bag is perfect if you plan on taking stairs at any point during your day , which i do , the bag has the weight of the stuff you put in and the weight if the bag itself i believe the weight comes from the material and wheels
good outter quality but inner <unk> feels like tent lining but i gave it a # as the hidden compartment for the extendable puller hides away and is long enough for myself at # ' # comes in handy
nice lightweight bag i bought it primarily to use as a carry-on found it a bit hard to squash under the seat in front of me , but it fit fine in overhead bin i think it will be a great overnight bag i own many <unk> bags and find the quality is consistently good
i have really enjoyed using this bag for one or two night stays away from home it 's very attractive , lightweight and is easy to maneuver using the extension handle the wheels roll smoothly the bag has held up well to a year of occasional use , but it does n't seem very heavy duty the fabric is classy , but possibly not durable i 'll check back later with an update
i like this rolling tote bag my electronics fit in the front and clothes , etc . , fit in the middle i was able to pack three days of clothes , including two pairs of jeans , in the case it did fit in the overhead bin on the larger airplanes but the little commuter airplane was a bit of a squish
i bought this on amazon `` today 's deal `` , and i 'm glad i did ! its amazing how much stuff you can get in this bag its very easy to roll it anywhere , with its built in wheels and handle also , in one compartment , which is extremely well padded , is great for a laptop , tablet , etc . . this is an exceptionally well made piece of luggage ! i would highly recommend this product to anyone !
i do a lot of research before i order that is why most my reviews are positive , i do my homework this is a winner , it is <unk> and can fall forward but it serves my needs and the price was great
this is a beautiful bag that i got for a gift for a grandmother who is taking a trip in jan and needed a small stylish carry on bag and this is perfect i ordered it on a lighting deal and got a fantastic price ... not sure i would pay the regular price the handle extends so that it will work well for tall people the inside is also beautiful and has a section for a change of clothes , <unk> , meds , a book and even a place for a small laptop or tablet the brown color is a nice change from the traditional black if you are looking for a carry-on that does n't look like a laptop bag but has lots of versatility this is worth the hunt to find a good price
exactly what i expected bag is great and has plenty of compartments to hold everything you need this size only fits a # & # # ; inch laptop , and it fits very securely if you have a bigger laptop than this it will not fit would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a new laptop/messenger style bag
i bought this as a christmas gift for my man he is super particular about the things he uses everyday ... like this bag i was worried he would n't like it because of its <unk> red lining he loves it ! ! ... and so do i
absolutely not disappointed . it perfectly matches with my expectations i am satisfied by this <unk> bag used everyday on a working day basis from home to the city -lrb- walking , bike , <unk> , subway and plane -rrb- <unk> are well done and the bag is resistant and not bulky . and design is nice
fits # inch laptop , internal is bright red but doesnt hurt the eyes , as long as not flipped open bag keeps a low profile bag design is superior to timbuk # in that weight is distributed in such a fashion that the bag does not feel heavy even though its carry laptop , text book , and other gadgets strap is durable but attached to bag as shown in image perhaps the only addition that would be appreciated is an exterior bottle holder if your intent is to carry a bulky laptop i.e alienware i would <unk> the large version of the <unk> for comfort
the various pockets work perfectly for me ; the laptop pocket fits my # & # # ; macbook pro perfectly ... and i can tuck a bunch of a # sheets in there with it if need be the main pocket is spacious and the bright inside colour makes finding things easy i love the strap ; it 's comfy even with a heavy load tough construction and it deals well with light rain if you want a bag that 's <unk> big without actually being big ... this is a good option to consider
i get so many compliments on this case for the daily great price for a great product one thing the little tab to open it on one side fell off but i believe that was because i am a bit rough on my laptop cases but i wanted to mention it
this case is cute and affordable it fits my hp laptop perfectly with room for the charger i love the unique design , no one else will have it it arrived several days before the estimated delivery date , too , which was very nice overall i love this case , no complaints
i really love the outside graphics of the stars the size of the case says # inches and my mac is # . # , but the case is a bit bigger then the laptop it still works just fine but has a little extra room in it
it arrived on time with amazon prime and is beautiful it looks even brighter than in the picture and fits my # & # # ; laptop with a little extra room i love it
the base color is black with a hint of pink at the upper corner , no true purple it was way too large for the # . # inch netbook i bought it for
nice case for laptop but poor quality ... colors are amazing ! ! and is comfortable to carriage but its really weak . i dont feel my laptop is actually protected when i use this case
the case is ok , still deciding if i am going to keep it it is a bit larger than i had expected and the print is too bold to be professional looks well made , so no complaints there
got this for my daughter and she loves it great design and exactly what we wanted but it 's not a hard case just remember that it is a pad case
gave to my wife to carry her new notebook computer she likes the quality of the tote and the fact that it has the side zippered compartment for the power adapter , etc .
i bought this case for my daughter who is attending university and she loves it its very girly but not too <unk> and the size is perfect for her sony laptop
