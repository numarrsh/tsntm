this sleeve works well for folks who are gentle with their equipment and do n't need to carry accessories it is soft , very lightweight , and provides some padding , making it a nice form-fitting `` book jacket `` for my macbook air since i also carry a shoulder bag , i keep the accessories there which works well because i do n't need them often and i can slip the macbook in and out of the shoulder bag as needed if you want something that provides heavy-duty shock protection and/or you want to carry any accessories with the laptop , look elsewhere
it was exactly what i wanted , the only thing that was not clear to me was that it does not have a zipper or velcro closure the computer -lrb- i have a # inch mac air -rrb- fits into the case well and the is completely enclosed , but there is no secured closure i like how it does n't look like other covers and is fairly plain because i carry my computer around and the less obvious the better
i can highly recommend this sleeve this is the second one i have purchased of this brand and i can attest to its high quality and protective ability if you are going to get a sleeve , get this one
as a full time student and professional , i needed something durable , clean cut , and reasonably priced the best feature of this sleeve is the lack of velcro or a zipper the macbook air is held securely without the annoying sound of velcro peeling or zipping when i need to access it this is great when i need to pull it out during a lecture or during a meeting shipping was fast and cost was extremely reasonable the packaging was secure and sufficient for a soft case without being over the top and running up the shipping cost would happily buy from this seller again and would recommend this brand to buy friends and family
item is exactly as described it does have the very soft inner and fits the macbook well if you are hesitant to order this due to the reviews about it being to tight , just get it it 's a good product and does the job perfectly
just what i needed for my new macbook air the case fits great , perfect size and plenty of protection for it no zippers to scratch the case and inside is a plush fabric way to go speck
it 's economical , sleek , and minimalistic the outside feels like comfy mesh and the inside is really really soft , feels like <unk> it also doubles as a nice mat for your air and it is perfectly sized for the # -inch model
i bought the caselogic pas- # -inch macbook neoprene sleeve previously my mba was literally swimming in it this is the case you want for the mba form fitting and perfect for the slim mba totally what i was looking for , and what any mba owner should choose for theirs
... and this is a great case the interior keeps the macbook clean and snug this will not protect against hard drops , but is great to carry around the macbook for everyday use great at airports because it is zipper free no need to remove from this case less chance of damaging macbook at airports
i got this for my hp folio # , it 's a new computer , not a lot of accessories out yet for it and it 's really thin the macbook air case is thin enough to fit around it well hp is a little bigger , so the corners need to stretch just a bit , but it works perfect for me nice product that does what i need it to soft , <unk> sleeve to protect it
i bought this to go with my brand new macbook air , and it fits like a charm i like the inside that feels like fleece and it feels like it 'll take a fair amount of abuse without damaging the precious cargo inside it 's a tight fit but quite secure i love the fact that it 's zipperless since that 's a big point of failure and a nice opportunity to scratch your laptop for the price , it does the job well what 's better than that
no zipper , no clip , yet it does n't open by accident airport security friendly does n't add too much bulk to the air which is great and consistent with the laptop good and clean looking very soft and cushioned inside
big enough to provide protection without being bulky and easy to get a laptop in and out i bought this for and acer aspire ultrabook and it fits as if it were custom made
i am really particular about the cases i buy and it took me a couple months to decide on which one this speck case fits like a glove and is oh , so soft inside
fits snug , offers good protection no zipper or velcro to mess around with and laptop stays in case perfectly fine smells a little funny but i think anything w / that material would smell that way too for the money , it 's a great deal
it is # and i am finally reviewing this case , which i bought in # it is easy to slip my laptop into and easy to carry although i think people might have said something about the flap getting a little looser , it really does n't put my laptop in any danger overall , still satisfied # yrs after buying -lrb- with pretty consistent use -rrb-
i took my # `` mac air with me on a cycle trip through northern england and scotland the sleeve did an excellent job of protecting my mac it fits well , is easy to slide in and out of , has no metal parts to scratch my mac , and adds a nice layer of padding
this case works perfectly with the macbook air # in version the interior is extremely soft and there is no worry about anything scratching it that i would be worried about with other cases such as zippers the mba fits snugly in the case <unk> the case is perfect and exactly what i wanted i am extremely pleased with this product
bought this for my late # edition # -inch macbook air very tight fit at first , but after only a few weeks of usage it has loosened to the point where it is easier to put on it has some nice , <unk> material on the outside -- but i would n't recommend carrying it around <unk> in your arm a laptop this light is actually easier to drop simply because you are tempted to hold it one hand good price , good material , very pleased overall
protects the computer with just enough extra room in the sleeve for a few papers might be nice if it had a handle , but it 's slim enough to carry like you would a book just what i needed
i use this to bring my # & # # ; macbook air with me to and from school everyday has held up very well over the last year i like that is has no zipper , which gives it less little pieces to break and dosent cause scratches
protects the macair very well against most light weight bumps , but i also have a zagg invisible shield on my macair for protection from scratches i would say you have to have both to keep your device in good shape for higher resale value -lrb- you know you 'll eventually need an upgrade
air fits nice and snug inside no zippers so no risk of scratching definitely feels premium , not at all cheep in terms of fabric quality as for how long it will last , that is yet to be seen , but it definitely feels like it will withstand quite a long time of shuffling around in my backpack just based on the build quality i would have liked it to be just a little bit thicker , just to add a few more layers of protection i knew i was getting a low profile sleeve and it does n't deter from the product itself , just something to note if your looking for a cover with ultimate protection it is definitely more protective than those snap on plastic covers , though , and could probably withstand drop of a couple feet since it feels like there is a silicon layer of padding overall fantastic cover that feels premium just like my macbook air : -rrb- definitely the best cover for the # `` air edit : almost # months in and this thing is in perfect shape :
allow me to <unk> this by saying that i was not sent the keyboard that is photographed in the listing , but rather a very similar other model i was initially upset about this , but turned out to be very happy with the product the only differences in the two are that in the listing , the dual side pockets had zippers , whereas the sleeve i received had velcro for this reason i deducted only one star , because the sleeve works great & # # ; perfect slim , versatile case for you macbook the two side pockets are perfect for a mouse and charger the two pockets at each carrying handle are great to hold memory cards or usb drives , and the wide side pocket holds papers and folders finely even with the sleeve packed full of all of these items it is still surprisingly slim the inside of the case features a soft , furry , plush gel material that <unk> confidence in placing your computer inside between this soft protection and a hard case , your computer will be very safe overall , i would 've given this product # stars if i had been sent the correct
this is a great minimalist bag for a # & # # ; macbook pro i 'm able to comfortably fit the laptop , power supply , as well as an iphone charger and kindle can carry via shoulder or hand straps
saw this bag at a store , but thought it was too expensive . then i looked it up on amazon and it was a decent price , so i ordered it perfect for my needs -lrb- small laptop , notebook , headphones , etc -rrb-
my husband recently bought this great case for his new macbook pro when i got this exact case # years ago at the apple store , it was twice amazon 's price and then some this is an awesome carrying case the pro fits perfectly in it , there is a nice , adjustable shoulder strap with additional short carrying handles , plenty of storage and the inside of it is velvety soft i highly recommend this case for the quality , features and amazon 's unbeatable price
love the case/bag however you call it fits perfect with my macbook pro # & # # ; not too bulky , just right quality material and nice pockets for my macbook accessories
slim , functional , lightweight and perfect for the # macbook air or macbook proi was checking out different bags , cases and sleeves at the apple store and came across the incase cl # it 's a great looking , simple and understated bag and fits the # & # # ; macbook air and macbook pro like a glove versatility is a strong point : it can be carried with the handles that can be hidden , or use the detachable strap to carry your macbook over the shoulder or as a messenger bag the quality is excellent , the interior is extremely soft and there is just enough storage for the essentials
this bag was cute and inexpensive , but you get what you pay for i had this bag for two weeks to carry my laptop when i took this back on a trip with me , the straps began to pull away from the bag an tear i was thoroughly disappointed i would not recommend this bag if you plan on doing any traveling with your laptop
the bag is very cute and functional it 's a bit large but not overly so i can keep my <unk> and laptop with my air card , cord , cell , wallet , pens , etc . the only issue is that it is very uncomfortable to carry this is due to the weight of the bag and stiffness of the shoulder straps i am sure there is a way to fix but i have yet to find it i travel a lot for work so this bag would be perfect other than cutting into my shoulder
this bag holds my # inch laptop plus room for paperwork , etc . i need to bring from work i do like the <unk> style so the bag does not bulge i 'm glad i purchased from amazon because the same bag was $ # . # more expensive at target
it 's a nice bag , and i really loved it ... great shape ... unfortunately i had to return it because it did n't fit my needs at the moment the seller was great and the return process was a snap i will buy from them again i wish i could have kept it
pros : <unk> , it 's quite nice fits my # `` dell , even with the extended battery , and the expansion is a nice plus it appears to be very well made cons : see how it 's standing up in all the pictures yeah , it 's never going to do that the bottom is n't flat , so it 's going to lie on the front or back everywhere you go think about all the places you might want to set a bag down it 's going to lie flat on all of them it wo n't even stand up against something because the metal zipper going around the outside makes it extra slippery on hard floors also , the two snaps that hold it closed would be much better replaced by a zipper
i 'm very disappointed in this knapsack i ca n't fault its functionality -- but : if your main reason for selecting this design is that you want something minimalistic and sleek ... you may be disappointed as well i suppose on a large back , or a set of broad shoulders , this might seem low-profile i have narrow shoulders and a slight frame ; when i put on these puffy <unk> straps , i feel -lrb- and look -rrb- like i 'm wearing a life jacket i also find the look of the bag , with the big loose overlapping flap that protrudes and has a sheen , and the plastic <unk> , anything but stylish it just looks ... like a bulky black school knapsack and that 's ok ... if that 's what you 're after just do n't make the mistake i did and think this is going to look a little more chic or a little more discreet than that
this bag has all the features i want in a bag : large enough for laptop , book , and lunch , top loading , and closes with a flap to keep out rain fatal flaw : there is very little padding around the laptop
i was excited to order after reading all the good reviews but was highly disappointed after it arrived nice bag but it was much smaller than it looks in the pictures on amazon the style of this bag is way too feminine looking for a guy imo -lrb- maybe its just me though -rrb- and definitely looks like a purse to me that being said its definitely a good functional & fashionable backpack for a woman but for a guy , not so much i ended up returning this and getting <unk> <unk> bp <unk> x-ray friendly laptop / tablet backpack - <unk>
i got this bag a year ago and it 's still going strong the only problem i 've had so far is one of the side pockets burst a seam from over stuffing i was worried it would be too small , but in expanded mode i can fit in a # `` binder , <unk> , ipad , and a # `` mac pro retina just fine all the other pockets are great for storing pens , cables , etc . i 'd definitely recommend this
dragging around my # `` # lbs notebook was always a pain for me never i was able to combine my <unk> for <unk> and freedom of movement with necessity of taking my work with me between corporate buildings now it all solved with one elegant solution , with extra place for my <unk> and umbrella for <unk> <unk> weather perfect choice for anyone willing to be light on the go : -
i love this bag it is quite possibly the most well thought-out bag on the planet it has pockets for everything and has a dedicated , padded laptop pocket , tablet pocket and even an umbrella slot on the outside , for easy reach my favourite feature of this bag is that it can slide over the handle of a carry-on roller bag for when i travel - keeping my back pack nice and secure i 've owned this bag for almost two years now and i 'm constantly impressed with how well thought out the pockets were being a bag <unk> i am constantly trying to replace this case logic <unk> with something better - but i have yet to find it
it 's small enough to stay out of the way , but big enough to hold my full sized macbook pro , tablet , chargers , cables and even a bicycle tire changing kit i 've been using this bag for at least # years and it 's been great every day
this is a nice quality laptop backpack what i like about it - it 's nicely <unk> interior is light green -lrb- instead of black -rrb- which makes it easier to see the contents of the bag - many compartments and zippered pockets - there 's a velcro security strap on the back that you can use to attach the backpack to the handle of a rolling suitcase -lrb- i really like this feature - it 's expandable you can add ~ # inches to the width of the bag when you unzip it
the case logic <unk> # is ideal for a commuter it fits my macbook pro # inch with my ipad and the associated cords it has two pockets externally that hold my sunglasses and umbrella to cover both ends of the weather <unk> it has nice inside pockets for organization it is not too big , not too small nor too sloppy or loose like a messenger bag seriously , this bag is nearly perfect it even has a clip for my keys which i like case logic <unk> # <unk> # to # -inch laptop backpack -lrb- black
great build quality , used it for over a year half and it barely frays on the edges of the strap has many nice compartments and i really love how the inner lining of small compartment beside the main laptop compartment is like felt the same for the front compartment , where you would put smaller devices like your phone or an ipod , helps to not scratch the brushed <unk> of the product can hold alot of stuff if you unzip the bottom expander only problem is that it gets hot if you sleep your computer after a long use and immediately put it in -lrb- the laptop and your back is very close , there is n't much insulation to prevent that -rrb-
if you are looking for a smaller backpack , this is a great option i carry a macbook air , ipad , chargers , and a bunch of misc cables to connect to anything on the planet the backpack remains small and light
i 've been using it for a few weeks now and love it sleek look and feel but still roomy inside with plenty of storage seems very well built and designed
i bought this due to falling in love with how it looks combined with it 's footprint and claims to have a lot of internal capacity in spite of negative reviews here , though few and far between this product is beyond all expectations and professional looking as well as <unk> with room enough for books , binders , laptop and all your other <unk> needs with room to spare i find myself hardly using the expansion zipper on the side -lrb- adds ~ # in -rrb- because it 's simply efficient in storage as is the padding inside makes me feel secure about my valuables being in there and the rugged outer material is a durability plus the straps are padded and nice as well honestly i dont think it 's possible to design a better pack
love this backpack i wanted something smaller to keep me from overloading a backpack with stuff i do n't need wo n't hold many books -lrb- probably only # medium or # large book n addition to laptop -rrb- it has a clean , minimalist look to it i have enjoyed this backpack quite a bit
pro- - lots of pockets and bag has a nice <unk> -- strap is atrocious ... and fully extended it is not long enough to be a cross body bag as photographed that is misleading at this time , i do like the shape , so i will work around the straps
i wanted to like this bag and selected it after much searching it has a nice sleek design that would appeal to those who dislike bulky bags and it has a nice layout of pockets and padding but - two factors made it difficult to easily get my # -inch laptop into it the narrow profile of the bag and the way it 's top edges round upward toward the handle make it tough to pull apart enough to easily drop the laptop in i tried it about three times but just do n't have the time or patience to spend on packing my bag when i all i want to do is head for home after work so i sadly returned it if you are more patient or you have a smaller computer , this bag might work for you
me <unk> la <unk> , el color y material del case logic , es perfecto para mi mac book pro # , tiene mucho espacio interior y <unk> <unk> <unk> lo <unk> de mi <unk> y el <unk> es <unk> y <unk>
after struggling with uncomfortable carry on bags for years , this one fits the bill no more backpacks for me this bag looks professional and stylish but is very comfortable to carry through multiple airports my laptop fits perfectly inside , along with snacks in the divider part i could find everything and even left my glasses in the main pocket this would be great bag to double as a purse for long trips thank you case logic
first of all the quality of the material used in construction the bag is extremely good it feels smooth and strong and can easily hold a # `` laptop the only gripe is that because of slim nature of this bag - if you laptop has a big power brick - it can appear to bulge out it can comfortably rest over your shoulders without breaking your shoulders
its for best use if you have a # inch laptop , any kind well a skinny one not one that is too bulky its very durable , and secure and comfortable to wear around your shoulders i really enjoy it a lot also its very professional looking love love love it
i am a college student in need of a durable bag i bought this bag because i liked the design and had a slightly larger width that would allow for more school supplies to be carried the second week into school the bags zipper and stitching started to come apart i would not purchase this product ! it looks nice but , will not last more than a semester
i had ordered this bag to hold my laptop in when studying abroad in london last year and had been delivered the wrong bag it said it was this model , but it looked nothing like the bag in the picture the strap broke in the airport on the way to my plane heading to the uk -- only about # hours after i started using it i ended up throwing it away once i got to my flat in london , since there was no way to fix the frayed and torn strap not worth the money
i purchased this bag as an inexpensive work bag i did not need an extremely sturdy bag but something to carry lightweight items i am not a big believer in taking work home -lrb- home is for family -rrb- so i only carry things like notebook , ipad , phone , wallet etc . the old saying `` you get what you paid for `` is true i did not pay much for this bag and got a poor bag in return the outside pockets do not close so they are unusable there are no pockets in the main compartment so all of the things that you carry are loose and difficult to find the zipper broke in less than a month worst of all , the bag started fraying almost immediately after purchase this is a great looking bag but of poor quality
i bought this bag because i liked the graphic on the front and because i thought it would be good material i have only had the bag for a month and it is completely falling apart i am very disappointed and i do not suggest anyone to buy it i have also almost ripped off my finger nail from the inside pocket , from the way it is designed and i do not have long nails
bag looks nice , but could have better construction buckle design is terrible , and had to be modified to fit my laptop strap was not the best , but not terrible construction on pocket flaps was lacking the flaps were essentially useless and bag has begun to fall apart overall however the bag was passable not the best bag , but far from the worst
the bag is nice , but after a few weeks of being filled and not maintaining it 's shape it has begun to look like something a grade school drags behind them it really needs some stability built in to the sides and bottom . overall not bad for the price
unfortunately the bag is only # weeks old and already is showing signs of falling apart the two front pockets are nice and close ok even though another reviewer said there was an issue , however there is some leather cover over them which is held on by a clip and it easily popped off somehow if you are looking for a hard wearing bag then this is probably not it if you are looking for an occasional bag they looks good this works well
great style my wife loves it as a <unk> carrying case although commenting on the construction it looks and feels a bit cheap in composition for the price it is not bad if you like the british military inspired theme with <unk> faux brass pirate emblem . lol it is cute
i bought this bag as a gift for my boyfriend we 're in college so he uses the bag for carrying textbooks and whatnot he loves the design of the bag our only problems with the bag are that the metal piece connecting the strap to the bag stretched apart and broke right away my boyfriend only puts a couple textbooks and notebooks in there and the books are actually pretty small and light weight our other problem is that the side pockets barely open and you ca n't put much in there it 's a good place for instant access to pens and pencils though over all i would recommend this product , but you should include a carabiner or something to replace the metal strap piece when it stretches open and breaks
this bag is great , it is a good size i did have one problem with the zipper , it was n't sown across at the bottom and it came <unk> , i had to replace the zipper because my son threw the packing slip away but we have n't had any other problems and my son loves it
it 's actually better than i expected the color and the size is perfect for all my school books and even a laptop if necessary i would recommend this for school use and it 's durable
i really loved the design of this bag when i bought it , the <unk> thing was that i did n't see the pirate head emblem when i bought it but i still love the bag it was great for the price
this year , my daughter really wanted a messenger style bag for school , once we ordered and received this item , she was really happy the style and design of the back is quite fashionable , and the bag works just right for her needs
i really like this idea it had never <unk> to me before to buy a case for a laptop until i bought my new dv # this case is very sturdy plastic and the majority of it fits very well with ports , speaker openings , and vents all left open in an <unk> fashion it does its job well the only thing i can say i dislike is the fact that <unk> top piece does not form perfectly to the computer i imagine they did this so that the same top could be used for both models of the dv # -lrb- old and new -rrb- this is very minor but i can not help but notice the extra edge around the screen in my opinion , highly annoying
i bought it thinking it would fit my new hp pavilion dv # t notebook that i bought last month , but the bottom part does n't fit the lid enclosure fit perfectly , but the bottom seems to be smaller plus the openings of the case didnt match up with my laptop other than that , the product is made of hard plastic , and a very good deal for the price
i love it : -rrb- it fits perfectly on my hp pavilion dm # the bottom part was hard for me to put on , because i was scared to break it but , you can get someone to help you and it will fit right on i like how it 's clear , because i can put stickers without sticking it on my laptop and i can also put cute drawings in it as well then simply remove the cover and take the stickers or drawings out if i do n't want them anymore i highly recommend people to buy this
i bought this for my son before he left for college he has a few accidents with technology and i thought is was a good idea he back home for a visit and sure enough he dropped his laptop it cracked the mcover case but there was no damage to the computer the little legs that stand it at an angle are really handy too the case fit like a glove without any gaps
not what i expected , it 's better i was thinking this was a ` briefcase ' kinda carry case this shell unit is not going to be returned though it 's like sealing your pc in plastic it protects as well as it possibly can while leaving room for dvd sliding door and all plugins i.e usb , power plug etc . bottom half elevates the unit so it can ventilate better and top half protects unit when lid is closed now , just have to wait for my additional soft carrying case order to arrive : <unk>
a # . # laptop such as a lenovo y # will not fit into the side compartment as pictured it will -lrb- barely -rrb- fit into the main compartment the product seems fine otherwise , but i would recommend it only for laptops smaller than # . # inches
i received my brenthaven in a timely fashion there is a pouch for everything you need my macbook pro # & # # ; fits like a baby with soft fur <unk> it inside there 's space for my ipad , mouse , power supply , pens , my iphone and even my external cd drive the only thing is i do n't like is i think everything fits a little too snug i would have like it if they had made it just a little wider but maybe i 'm just pushing for perfection that 's why i gave it # stars all in all it 's made of high quality stuff and i would definitely recommend this to anyone
excellent product : good construction , extremely light ; however , not as protective as the prostyle <unk> not too much available space , but good enough to carry your laptop , power adapter , tablet , mouse , some other small items excellent choice for light traveling with style and a good level of protection for your computer
good looking bag , excellent quality easily holds a small laptop and a tablet at the same time while still having room for a writing pad , pen , papers , business cards , etc . i especially like the super soft material that <unk> the separate compartments for the tablet and the laptop with some more small pockets for better organization this case would have earned # stars
a very good product i am quite happy with this product , i purchased it for my husband for his laptop and he too is very pleased with it , but bulky and looks very professional
the brenthaven prostyle lite # is an excellent buy detailed craftsmanship , with structural elegance this is my third brenthaven briefcase only because my laptop keeps getting smaller the two prior purchases are still in use by family or friend
this is a great case and deserves the top rating i would highly recommend it to anyone who wants to wants to carry a laptop , ipad , and papers all in one case
the size seems to be a bit off i can barely slide my laptop in - a snug fit when it is in there a little too pricey for the product
this bag is great it fits my macbook <unk> , it 's comfortable , and it 's stylish it 's the perfect bag the only thing better would be if it were made in usa
i do like this bag a lot it is a good size the shoulder strap is long enough to stay over my shoulder the neoprene is nice and stretchy so that the bag fits more than it looks like it should i did not buy it as a laptop bag really , but to carry things to work including lunch i thought the laptop sleeve would be good for my lunch but it is lined with fuzzy fabric to cushion a laptop and i have to put another lunch bag in there to protect that fabric other than that it is exactly as i expected and very useful i especially like the large zippered pocket for small items like cell phones and keys i also like the more subdued color scheme of this bag for work purposes another great product from built ny
this is a great little bag for a laptop it is made of neoprene , which is waterproof and the inside is a bright blue the laptop pocket zips up and is lined with a very soft <unk> material the only thing that was a little disappointing is that you ca n't put much else in it besides a laptop and some flat papers or folders i still have to carry a rather purse to work along with the bag i would recommend this for anyone who does n't have a lot to carry besides a laptop
i ordered this bag for my # `` macbook pro this is perfect for me to take to school because there 's room for my laptop plus the books , etc that i need the only reason i did n't give this all five stars is because i wish the pocket made for the macbook had a little more padding
my only complaint is that i wish the middle , zipper pocket was slightly larger the quality of the bag is nice and it 's light-weight - perfect for travel or just to and from the office i am considering buying another one
i bought this for my lenovo yoga # it fits very well in the computer pocket with the lenovo slot in case -lrb- -lsb- ... -rsb- -rrb- on the laptop built case still has lots of room for power cord , files , etc . this built case is great for not adding much weight , even with two cases on the laptop i do sort of wish the computer pocket was detachable -lrb- it is sewn in on the sides but not sewn in on the bottom -rrb- i also wish there was another zipper closing the entire bag , especially for use in airports and other hands in your bag type places the computer pocket and small purse type pocket do have zippers i ca n't speak to how this bag will hold up yet i assume like all my other built products it will last and last and last
i was looking for a bag to tote my macbook pro with retina display while traveling i received it a day early and of course , tried it out immediately i am pleased to discover that not only does the macbook fit but it fits the bag even with a hard shell cover on it i would recommend this to anyone else looking for a less conspicuous bag for their macbooks
i love this bag - its the perfect size for my laptop , notebook and a few files it 's also really light weight on its own , which is key -lrb- laptops are heavy enough on their own ! -rrb- probably not ideal if you need to regularly carry a ton of files , but if your work is mostly online this bag is great
very happy with this tote fits my macbook perfectly there 's plenty of room for paperwork in the side sections great quality and extremely good value would highly recommend it for fellow apple users
this bag is a perfect fit for macpro # `` it 's durable and padded so your computer wo n't get banged around strap fits perfectly over the shoulder so you can distribute the weight better there is room on both sides of the zippered computer sleeve to put books , etc . it has one inside zippered small pocket for your keys and other small stuff i only wish it came in pink
a lot of the reviews basically cover how the back part of the bottom cracks easily well , i got mine already cracked the only thing good about this case is the looks and the fast shipping i originally <unk> to get a mcover case , but due to speck 's brand name , i thought i would go with this one the shipping was very fast , but are you kidding me first of all , the bottom part doesnt even fit if i want my front part to fit perfectly , the back wont clip on , and vice versa and it came with the back corner already cracked so just imagine how easily it will break after months of use i do n't know if i just got a defective case , but i do not recommend to anyone for this overpriced case that will crack easily
i am now on my second speck case i do n't abuse it at all in fact i am very careful with it and my computer both covers have broken at the corners after a short time do not buy looks good does n't last
i did n't have this case for even a month and it started cracking on the corners it looks great on my laptop , but i need something that protects my laptop and a cracked case does not protect it i am talking with speck right now about replacing it , so if they do , that will make me very happy -lrb- it does have a # year warranty -rrb- i did have a case just like this one except it was purple , and it lasted a year and a half before i had to replace it i 'm thinking this was just a lemon
i was really stoked to get this ; however , it turned out being a complete piece of junk it looks great and feels great . the problem is that the clips that hold the case on break off almost <unk> after putting it on not only this , but this causes other cracking throughout the rest of the case this was really disappointing . i have a macbook pro as well and bought the same case only the clips would n't even clip on to the macbook pro i love how speck products look , but i 'm going to have to stop buying them they 're <unk>
ok , i buy lots of macbooks all get speck covers so , my new mba got one too all the others have held up to whatever we dish out , but this one is n't doing so well as plenty of others have found ; , the back corners just crack off , and the case slides off the computer contacting speck , means that i can pay to ship it to them and they will send another defective one back to me no thanks ! speck needs to recall these , and offer a suitable replacement and amazon needs to consolidate their products , so that reviews that cover different colors of the same product show up together
it cracked within a week of me putting it on my macbook air i take my computer in and out of my computer bag at least twice a day - to work and back home i much prefer the rubberized cover from topcase because it is more flexible and less prone to cracking
for my last macbook pro , i had a speck case that worked perfectly i purchased this speck case for my new macbook pro my laptop slid off my bed -lrb- less than # feet -rrb- onto tile floor and the bottom of the case popped off and my computer dented on the corner the whole point of the case is for it to stay on and protect my computer the case felt pretty flimsy when i bought it compared to my last speck case of similar design -lrb- seethru satin -rrb- but i trusted in the product would only recommend this case for cosmetic purposes ; not for protection
speck see thru satin macbook air # `` cover - it fits well but came with scratched in # areas & a <unk> noticeable white spot right on top of the cover not very happy
love the color and it 's not bulky or heavy plus , it was cheaper on amazon than at the apple store both back corners started cracking as well as the little tab that holds the cover to the bottom left side of the computer the entire lower cover is nearly falling off and probably wo n't last another month i have other speck covers for my mbp and original macbook , but the quality definitely does n't match up it still protects the top and it does look nice , but it should cost $ # maximum
have only owned this case for # months the bottom case broke a couple months after receiving it the corners clips that hold it on to the laptop break off the bottom no longer stays securely on this is the second case i have tried by this company i wo n't buy them any more they do n't hold up despite normal use
