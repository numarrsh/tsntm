i absolutely love this bag great quality and very comfortable i 'm definitely satisfied and i hope it can last me for a very long time i love it and by far my favorite one
i love this bag i 've had it about a week now , and it is exactly what i expected it was a little smaller than i expected , but it did n't look at the dimensions very carefully it is strong and well craft and looks just like the picture a great deal for sure
i got this bag for a trip , turn out better then i hope i carry my camera and <unk> plus a bottle of water inside . it carry then with lots of room to spare the outside pockets are big , work great for cell phones and sun glass
i thought i got a bargain but it turned out the things in there are completely wrong except the keyboard shield the plastic case and screen protector are larger than # . # macbook pro in the way that the width fits but the length # inch longer so does the sleeve but you can still use the sleeve just fine anyway , it is not for macbook pro # . # do n't buy it
the hard case covers were about # inch too big for my mac book pro # . # & # # ; did n't they measure these things before they sent it out ? the clear lcd screen protector was too big as well but the rest of the contents of the box were good the keyboard protector fit perfectly and the soft cushion case was also good but be warned that there is no replacement option for this item i 'd like to keep the items that fit but there 's no option for <unk> , the only option is return for a refund but then in able to return , the packaging says in fine print that all items have to be unopened i might not return because of the hassle of having to return through ups -lrb- the only option was to return through ups -rrb-
i ordered all these items for a # inch macbook pro and all the items i received only fit on a # inch computer i was very disappointed to go through all the trouble to return it do n't use this persons products they suck ! !
i ordered the aqua blue case , and the first time i ordered it , they sent me the blue case i returned it , and today received my new case , and it 's the wrong color again this blue case perfectly matches the blue case picture , so i do n't think this is just somehow a distorted view of the aqua case i 'm truly <unk> they sent me the wrong color two times i do not trust this seller any more i 'm buying a case with someone else
not worth the money the screen cover does n't fit correctly , the soft case is very snug and hard to get the computer into , and the keyboard cover does not stay on right the hard case fit fine and is the only thing good out of all of it
did n't fit my macbook pro at all some other review indicate that it might be a problem only with the retina displays not sure , but buy at your own risk in all other regards , i 'd say it was a great price for what it was and i would have liked to have kept it
threading for the shell cover completely unraveled after pulling the laptop out the first time the laptop was left in the shell for approximately a day and it produced too much stress on a # inch portion of the threading all of the other plastic pieces are what i expected and are fine i must have just been the unlikely one that happened to receive one of the faulty products
this was a poor case i have purchased many hard shell cases just like this for my macbook so i am used to them breaking , but this one was broken only a week after i put in on my laptop i had not taken it anywhere , it just plain cracked , and i had to get another
the company shipped me the wrong size -lrb- for the wrong computer -rrb- and then refused to pay return shipping they were not professional and i lost time and money on this product the fabric case was a <unk> ugly color of pink , and the hard case did n't fit at all
if you noticed , almost everyone that wrote a bad review had the same complaint , it does not fit macbook sadly , i took a chance in hoping to get the one that would fit but did not . if you are willing to lose # bucks , then buyer beware
i ordered the aqua blue and received the royal blue they refunded my money but now i have to send this one back and am having a hard time finding the color i want -lrb- and ordered -rrb- it 's proving to be quite the hassle that i do n't have time for
worst product i could have bought i would have gave it zero stars if i could the case did not fit my mac book nothing fit it sucked and i 'm so busy i did n't return it on time waste of my money
the shell was far too large for my macbook extremely disappointing and not worth the cost of returning soft shell works to carry for protection , but definitely not what i expected
i just purchased the newest # . # & # # ; macbook pro i then ordered this case thinking it would be perfect as it even says for the # . # & # # ; macbook pro in the description the hard case that comes in this package does not fit not even close the color is pretty true to the picture , but the actual case is a little brighter in my opinion
i ordered the royal blue and got the sea foam blue tried contacting and got no response apparently they 're too busy to get back to people i would try someone else
i would not recommend this product to anyone first of all it says # & # # ; , this is more for # & # # ; the silicon key fits perfectly but is n't worth $ # shipping was fast
i just got a new macbook pro for christmas and wasted # dollars on this set the cover does not fit the computer , way too big such a waste of money
adorable color , extremely quick shipping , and yet it does n't fit my macbook pro like it is supposed to my computer is literally sliding around in the case i would love to get my money back but i would rather not waste my time and effort in shipping this piece of crap back to them literally , adorable , keyboard cove is cute , and soft holder case is lovely but the hard case is a piece of s *** i do n't know if they just stick a random size in the box and hope it works , but clearly they must have sent me the wrong one
it seems to me that this company is having an issue with sending customers the right product the case that i received was the wrong color from what i ordered i end up keeping the case because i did not want to go through the hassle of returning and waiting for the replacement it is disappointing to see a company so careless , i will not be buying from gmyle again i will stick to speck and incase as i have never had an issue with them
it said one dimension and it did not even fit my computer i am sure it is nice but the hard case did not fit <unk> had to buy another one
thought the case was perfect at first , but now -lrb- after only having the case a few weeks -rrb- the color has begun to wear off and the corners of the case are a dirty <unk> brown color now keep in mind that i am very careful with my laptop as <unk> i would not buy this product again as it has not even lasted # months
convenient that they changed the title of the item now i purchased this on # only to find out that it did not fit the macbook pro with retina display like i thought it would the lack of description at the time of purchase was unfortunate since it was given as a gift for a graduate the color was great though
i bought this case a few months ago and everything fit perfectly in terms of the case and the keyboard cover however , i just noticed that the bottom portion of this case cover cracked in my opinion , this is an ok product however , i do not think i will repurchase another case from this brand
the case was delivered with a hole overlooked it , as it was n't that big and otherwise cute only thing i wish i could change was that it did n't hand handles the shell is a <unk> , which i should have known given how cheap it is did n't fit well , and eventually chipped overall , was n't happy w / my purchase
the issue with this case is that it 's really rough around the edges - where your arms rest while working on the computer as it is on your lap after just a few days of use , my wrists are really scratched from rubbing against the sides of the case i find myself wishing i would have spent a little more on a better quality item
honestly , i 'm disappointed with the color it actually is it 's definitely not aqua what so ever it 's a royal blue good thing i like blue but i was really hoping for the aqua one i would n't recommend if your buying this for the color
it does n't met my expectations i like the case and the cover just the screen protected did n't fit and the key board always had hair and dust stuck to
the case is a darker blue than shown in the picture , the keyboard cover is extremely cheap and mine is damaged and torn up in spots the screen protector does not even fit very cheap quality
i read product descriptions very carefully to be sure the one i chose would fit my laptop the top cover is okay as it can stretch easily the bottom was <unk> , as it was hard plastic i ended up throwing the bottom part away
i have ordered this product twice and the color is wrong for the green # in # the soft sleeve and keyboard are a bright green as pictured , but the computer case is a sea foam green and does not match at all ! i am very disappointed that it is not as pictured
got the product and it was the wrong color i asked for aqua and i got regular blue was disappointed with this outcome the product came within # days which was ok i 'm just upset about the color
the outer neoprene protector is fine however , the hard shell did not fit the macbook i bought it for and was difficult to assemble i would not buy it again
had issues with product , but it was replaced the true problem and and let down with this order was the shipper failed to tell me the product was out of stock
i did not get the color i ordered i was sent a classic blue color instead of the aqua blue it was still a nice color but not what i wanted also , the material of the case is rubberized and gets dirty quickly other than that it arrived quickly and i had no other issues a great deal for the price
ive had it for a few weeks now and on one of the parts , it 's turning black which is not very pretty but for the price and the things that come with it , its a good price
amazing color but it gets dirty too easily and does not come off the second day i had it on my laptop it got stained and would n't come out no matter how hard i <unk> great deal , service , and quality ill buy again from
case had sturdy construction but the keyboard cover started to peel early on its use case was easy to clip on and color was accurately described but keyboard cover was not as flush in position as i would have expected and sort of a game changer with the whole product
the product is okay , but the colors are not identical i was under the <unk> that all # pieces would match and be the <unk> color , but that was n't the case
the products all fit perfectly , no complaints there however , the case , the keyboard cover , and the sleeve are three different colors the case is as pictured , but the keyboard cover is slightly darker the sleeve is a lighter , greyish robins egg blue that is not very pretty i ordered a different keyboard cover that is grey chevron because i find , personally , find the difference in colors very annoying
i bought one for myself and one for my wife within a week we started to notice the following things positive : many colors to choose from , great price and comes with lots of items cons : the bottom shell does n't seat well on the computer , but it does n't fall off the keyboard cover already has lost some color on the space bar the stitching for the protective pouch has started to come loose in three different places i have n't tried the screen protector it does n't seem necessary to me all i can say is you get what you pay for
so maybe this is better for the older macs and not the newer ones the <unk> does n't really fit the screen and the keyboard cover does n't line up with the keys on my mac the case itself is ok it looks nothing like the picture it 's a minty color but it 's really matte and neon like the outside cover is cool but be careful cause it gets dirty fast
the case is really cute and i love the color however , it always falls off because it doesnt quite snap on my macbook # & # # ; that well i guess since mine was only # . # i 'm not all that upset ; you get what you pay for
i 'm giving it three stars because , although the case and keyboard cover are good -lrb- i really like those -rrb- , the sleeve has already started ripping i have n't even had this for a week it 's kind of disappointing actually i love the colors of the case and keyboard cover though but for the sake of the sleeve , which i thought was essential , i have to give it a sleeve
this product is an excellent value my only complaint is that the pink cover was very light my wife was n't pleased otherwise , this was a great product and a great deal
the bottom does n't really fit but manages to stay in places all other pieces fit fine it 's a really great color , just wished all the pieces would fit properly -lrb- but hey , you get what you pay for
this case is definitely nice looking , the color is fairly similar to the model shown the case and the sleeve can be used together , but it is a tight fit i usually use both when i 'm going on trips and want to prevent my mac from shock over-all , the price suits the case well , if you are looking for everyday use protection i would suggest this case if you travel and set it down on various surfaces , spend the extra # bucks to get the apple case - soft <unk> edges fairly <unk> on <unk> shines through when mac is <unk> - does n't seem like a perfect fit , but still stays <unk> protector comes off easily , i do n't use <unk> protector is impossible to put on , i do n't use
i recently ordered this case as i am in college and laptop transportation is often and it is <unk> for me to keep my laptop safe in case of any accidents so after receiving this product i have a few <unk> first of all the laptop shell itself is extremely heavy , very <unk> for transportation uses secondly the shell does not fit very well , there is plenty excess room on the top portion and the bottom fits alright next , the keyboard cover is absolutely horrendous it fits terribly and the plastic is already beginning to stretch and <unk> and its only been # days of minimal use not worth my time to return the product , but i am extremely unsatisfied with the product
first of all , the product came a week and a half earlier than expected which was really cool it also was a beautiful colour and does the job on the other hand , there was no keyboard protector like the product description said there would be the sleeve is of really bad quality but i guess that part is all right if i keep the case on the computer i do n't think i would recommend this seller or product to anybody , but its not really bad , just super mediocre and i really wanted the silicone key board protector
i really loved the color of the hard case and of the keyboard protector , and the case fit perfectly cons : i have no idea how my hard case got dirty in less than a week on the rim , but no matter what i tried to clean it , it wo n't come off so now they are a nasty <unk> color , the screen protector was super cheap there was no way of putting it on with out having hundreds of air bubbles ended up just throwing it away , the sleeve fits the mac perfectly , but the color is different than the case does n't really match overall this was an ok buy i would recommend a darker color though so if yours gets dirty it wo n't be
i like it overall the problems are really easy to get it dirty and the keyboard cover does n't work at all it is so hard to use the keyboard while the cover on
the color of the keyboard cover and computer case are bright and pretty , as shown in the picture the sleeve , however , is a muted shade that 's closer to sea foam green than the blue color of the case and really does n't match at all it also fits awkwardly tightly , making for super inconvenient usage i most likely will not be using it at all the keyboard cover is awkward at first , but i think after some getting used to , it will provide a good level of protection the backlight does n't shine through for the letters have n't applied the computer screen cover yet
i received my order today it got here super fast and every thing fits very satisfied with my purchase the only thing i will say is that all the blues in my order do n't quite match they 're close in color i suppose , but all still different shades i was really hoping everything matched perfectly , however , i really do n't mind at the end of the day nothing to really fuss over as long as my laptop is protected
this case was a gift from someone they gave me the money and got to choose which one i wanted if i had to do it again , i would probably choose this case again the only problem is the screen protector when i put it on , there was a ton of bubbles under it i 've been trying to get them out for days but it 's impossible to get them all out so i just ended up throwing that part away i wish that they would have given me something to scrape them out with other than that , the case i ordered is pretty good
i really like this . the keyboard cover fits well , and i love the color the only problem is that the actual case that snaps on to the computer gets pretty dirty really easy and oils seem to stick to it and are hard to remove
i was overall thrilled with my purchase of this # in # purchase it was very cheap and much better than any price you 'll find at best buy or apple the color is a lovely blue that looks just like the picture i chose one day shipping and it came right on time the only thing is just that the keyboard case kind of makes it annoying to type , but according to the other reviews , i 'll get used to it i definitely recommend this to all macbook pro # & # # ; owners seeking a inexpensive case
love the case , love the screen protector , it 's what i expected i was being hesitant on buying it , because of certain reviews , but i still went for it and do n't regret it the only bad thing i would say is the keyboard thing is kind of annoying because it takes a while getting used to it
bought the turquoise one the apple logo looks grt thru the case also recieved a keyboard protector i find it difficult to type when its on grt product grt
this case is a gorgeous color and everything fit my macbook pro perfectly , however , i did n't realize that it is n't see through you can see the apple through the case when the computer is turned but the decal that i recently purchased to go under the case can not be seen at all had i known that i probably would n't have bought it , but i 'm going to keep it and get another one when this one does n't work anymore overall if you do n't mind not being able to see through the case , then this set would be awesome for you
i got this # in # deal from gmyle and i love it i got it much earlier than expected the color is so pretty and everything protects my laptop nicely my only complaint is with the laptop sleeve : the stitching started tearing the # rd day but other than that , i love the rest of the accessories
came and is a pretty color i think that it is nice and came with # parts might not be the top notch quality of an apple product , but working great for the price i would purchase another one several other teachers are ordering after seeing mine
i love this product ! this is perfect it fits my computer so well ! the quality is great it keeps my computer safe from scratches , and other little <unk> the color is great except the laptop case is not true to the color that the pictures , but that was n't really an issue for me
nice and easy to put on i actually think it helps keep it cool when on soft surfaces only reason it 's not a five is it is a kinda cheap plastic and when you grab it some of the outer areas tend to pop off a
it 's a pretty good quality case for what you pay for also the shipping was so fast the only thing about it that i did n't like is that it is n't as transparent as i <unk> it to be
looks really cool on my computer and makes it look amazing my grandma asked if i had gotten a new one i rated # stars because despite the cool keyboard cover and case the screen protector gets air bubbles underneath it no matter how well you stick it on also the mac fabric cover does not match the rubberized case i got <unk> egg blue just something to keep in mind overall a great deal
i ordered this product really just for the hard case but the keyboard and sleeve are great the keyboard is not perfect but it works well and does its job i have been using it for months now the sleeve fits a little snug with the case but fits the case is great and exactly what i was looking for i do n't use the screen protector because it has too much glare
the case seems to fit close enough , but not perfectly i 've noticed that it unclips itself on occasion i 'm happy with the color - it 's bright and the keyboard cover , laptop sleeve and screen protector were nice added <unk> to purchase this package i hope it lasts longer than the other case i ordered from a different company via amazon thank you for the quick delivery
i normally do n't rate or comment my purchases but i purchased this product from this seller a few months back and i love my bundle ! it comes with exactly what it states and it came earlier than expected i have a minor crack on the bottom cover because i 'm heavy with my backpack . but it is well worth the money and you 'll have people asking where did you get your decor for your mac
great purchase for <unk> you pay . the only down side is the key cover is not as high of quality as some others you buy it makes the keys a little more difficult to type , but you get used to it
i ordered this product and received it within # days the case and the screen protector fits perfectly on my macbook and the deep purple is really a magenta color , which is exactly what i wanted the only downside is the sleeve started ripping apart at the seams after # month overall a great buy , not sure if the sleeve was the right fit though
i really like the feel and color of the case , but wish it were a bit more opaque so i could n't see through it i 'm having a little difficulty sometimes with the key cover staying in place and typing with it , but it 's so fun i do n't mind at my work , a bunch of us have the same computer and travel from room to room with them now we each have our own color and can find our own computer quickly
pros and cons shipping was fast i absolutely love the cover for the top and bottom of the laptop , feels nice and you can see the apple light when the computer is on the bottom was a little difficult to snap on , but i got it and still love it i was surprised to actually like the keyboard cover , it not being my main focus when purchasing this product , although it does take a little bit of getting used too love the case for the laptop , its a good squeeze , which i wanted it for to know theres protection overall love this product and definitely recommend it i am glad i did n't put my money towards other stores definitely saved a lot of money here
everything you see here is what you 'll get ! ! the only downside is that you ca n't really see the keys with the cover on when you have the keyboard like on in the dark other than that , everything is very protective
this four in one package is well worth the money some other macbook cases cost $ # and that 's all you get this package comes with a macbook case , a neoprene carrying case , a screen protector , and a keyboard cover my item was delivered quickly and everything in the package was intact , no broken parts i was disappointed that the keyboard cover was wrinkled and it actually felt cheap however , i 'm able to type comfortably with it on my keyboard i would definitely recommend this product as it 's a great deal for the money
this product came in three days after i ordered it it was so perfect i got the purple one and it is exactly the color advertised yes , the key board color is a little different than the case cover but it does n't even matter to me because it is so cute i am in love and will probably keep buying different colors soon if with time it ends up being crappy and breaking and what not , i will post again ! but regardless it is better than $ # at the apple store so over priced
everything about this product package was great except the screen cover was not the highest quality thus it was very difficult to put on i would order from the seller again
the delivery was on time i ordered pink and the color is true to the picture it would of gotten # stars if the screen protector would go gone on perfectly it had air bubbles all around
the shell is great and the screen protector is great even though it was difficult to get on the keyboard cover does n't fit very well but i think that is because when it was shipped it was folded now where the fold was it pops up it did arrive within # days
i order this product about three days ago and i received it this morning , # days earlier than expected the color is exactly as pictured the keyboard cover fits perfectly and all of the keys match up the soft case is a bit snug and difficult to get the computer in at first but is definitely protective the hard case is easy to slip on and off without cracking overall very happy with this purchase the only down side i found is that , although it is light , the hard case made the computer a bit heavier i would recommend this product and seller
i just got my cover today and i love the color and the rubber part thats goes on the key board my only issue is that that bottom piece does not fit or either i have put it on wrong i do n't think that i will keep the rubber piece on the keyboard because it <unk> down my typing but other than that i do n't have any other complaints
great , except for a couple small melted looking spots on the keyboard cover , and the screen protector was very hard to put on other than that , the color is awesome and i 'm not so worried about scratching my computer now got to my house in like # days , which was awesome too
i was so happy with this purchase because my estimated day of arrival was # days after i ordered it , but it came # days , and that was very satisfying the case is pretty nice , although it took me a few tries to actually get it to snap on , and it sort of scratched my laptop during that process it has really nice texture and i love that i can see the glow of the apple i did n't bother putting on the screen protector because it is the most stressful thing to do , in my opinion the stretchy case is really nice too the only complaint i have about this product is that they keyboard cover looks like it was created by a # year old from a distance it looks awesome , but as i 'm typing this i notice little marks , or places that do n't have color , and some of the little slots do n't fit the keys the feeling of typing with it is awesome , but it is n't physically appealing
it was everything i expected took a little longest to get here than i had planned not a big fan of the letter cover tends to stick otherwise very pleased
satisfied with the purchase , fulfilled its need . the case fits well , the plastic is good , dropped it off the bed -lrb- wood floors -rrb- and did not crack did n't give it # stars , cause i seen better at much more expensive price . so , # stars cause i do like it foam cover , not too satisfied
this fit the device well it not only protects the device , but also gives it a cool look my teenage daughter really likes it the screen protector that was provided was not used , due to the fact that we were not able to get it attached without bubbles
this set is great and the price is right my only complaint it 's that the sleeve is very snug when the case is on the laptop but it fits other than that i love it and the colors are great ! !
pros : fits well , <unk> feel , easy to put on easy to type with keyboard <unk> : screen protector difficult to apply , teal blue color hard case is not the same as seafoam blue soft case that came with it overall i love it and think it will last me a long time
i think this was a great purchase the black cover fits well on the computer i gave four stars because there are several very minor things to consider when purchasing the keyboard cover does not fit quite right it does n't encase each key like other covers do but lays on top the screen cover is great , but very difficult to apply correctly the case that the computer slips in to is also quite nice , but when the black case is on the laptop , it is quite a snug fit and quite heavy however , i received this product quickly an i it protects the laptop from daily wear and tear very nice purchase
love the color , and the keyboard cover actually makes it easier for me to type it took one second to put the case on , another second for the keyboard cover but i am struggling with the screen protector there are lots of air bubbles <unk> underneath no matter how many times i try to put it on instructions would have been nice -lrb- am looking online for tips to avoid air bubbles when putting screen protector on . aside from that i am very happy with my purchase , and glad my computer has some protection
i got everything that i ordered and it was in great shape but one thing i did n't like was that all of the stuff was not the same color besides that everything was great
i ordered this item because i wanted the case and sleeve and it was a better deal that buying separately i was disappointed to find the <unk> cover does not let the backlighting show
i do really like the look of it i am not in love with the rubber coating because it my hands are even lightly greasy it leaves marks on the coating
well this is my first case for my macbook i like it , i mean its good quality , it shipped really fast i am trying to get used to the silicon keyboard case , but eventually i will i do n't like the screen protector , it is hard to put on , but if you do it right i 'm sure you can get it on without any air bubbles i like the additional case for it as well it 's a tight fit , not that much <unk> to it , but it will do for now
it is cute , cheap , and practical for the price it fit like a glove and the color is great the sleeve is much better than i expected -- it is a thick neoprene the plastic tabs that click on to the base of the computer make it a little sharp when your wrists bump into them when typing but this does n't happen too often i could n't get all of the bubbles off of the screen protector ... maybe if it came with some directions
received in a timely manner and so far i like what i have the only things i 'm just content with is the bottom portion of the cover it 's not a perfect fit but other than that , i 'm happy with it
i really liked that this product came fairly quickly it came within # days of placing my order the coloring is fantastic ! the softer case is not exactly the same color , but its alright the keyboard protector takes some getting used to , but it fits fine my only issue was the screen protector i usually am able to put on a screen protector with no problem , but this one was almost impossible i ended up having to just take it off and throw it out other than that , i am pretty satisfied with my purchase
came faster than estimated , amazing deal , fit perfect on my # in mac , everything came as described , great case color and the slip on case fit nicely although it got a bit heavier the only issue i had was the screen protector ... it came with a scratchy cloth that seemed to do more harm with <unk> more dust particles at that it did n't even come with a <unk> , i just ended up throwing it out ill just order a new one . so good luck if you can put a screen protector on without dust and air bubbles
i needed a new cover for my macbook because the one i had was flimsy the case snaps on with great ease and the sleeve is snug but it fits around the macbook very well the clear screen cover was difficult to put on so i trashed it cause i could n't get it on without all the bubbles i love it and for the price i could n't beat
