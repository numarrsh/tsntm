i like the style it is very pretty and it fits my windows rt , its charger , and my earphones well gives a nice cushion , protecting my items well i gave it four stars because when i received it and took it out of its packaging , there was this horrible smell of plastic-y i do n't know how to describe it was really horrible plus side is that i could tell that it is new because of the smell i did n't use it for maybe a month and a half to at least & # # ; air & # # ; it out the smell was still there but it is not as strong as it was before
corners are okay but would like a bit more padding on the corners it is pretty and well made has a rope like band on each side of the zipper that acts like corner padding on a drop price is great for what it gives you has enough room to put another sleeve inside for additional
i was looking for an inexpensive sleeve case and there were none i could find made specifically for this tablet the tablet plus keyboard measures # & # # ; x # . # & # # ; x # . # & # # ; i took a chance with this case and it paid off pros : great value , fits great -lrb- not too snug -rrb- , looks nice and colorful , interior is moderately padded with <unk> material cons : the only negative is that it has a fairly strong odor of neoprene that i hope dissipates with time since there is no neoprene material in this case , i 'm guessing that it must be from the water-proof treatment on the canvas exterior if not for this i would have rated five stars
it arrived a day late it fits my mac and provides sleeve covering i had hoped for more padding and protection , but it is functional and will prevent scratching while in back pack , etc . it 's fits but it is not snug so i may have some problem fitting it into my lap top bag other than that it 's pretty good value for $ # bucks
the bird design is super cute and the inside is a fuzzy plush it does have an odor at first , kind of a chemical smell it came sealed in a clear plastic bag so just a few days in the air and the odor was gone looks like it will be both protective and durable
fits to and protects my ipad air perfectly my only dislike is the burnt orange color interior , but that is only a very minor complaint otherwise great price great item
i ordered this for my kindle fire hd and it is perfect fits my kindle with the cover on it and my charger and still has room for some other stuff it is a nice pattern and it is made well
been having a hard time finding a case for my new dell venue # pro i # ; this one fits great - it 's not too snug or too loose it 's also a great material and comes with a screen cleaner , which is awesome i 'm anxious for <unk> cases to come out for venue # pro , but in the meantime , this sleeve is an excellent substitute
having purchased a <unk> bag -lrb- all black -rrb- to protect and transport a netbook computer a few years ago , seeing this one for my tablet computer seemed a good idea it turned out great the bag fits like a glove on my acer iconia tablet -lrb- # & # # ; -rrb- this bag is well-made with excellent stitching and zippers the lining is great for protection in that it is lint-free , soft , and appears to be quite durable the & # # ; durable & # # ; feature extends to the exterior that feels quite rugged yet pliable the zipper -lrb- s -rrb- are of the type that will not scratch the tablet and appear to be well sewn in and durable as well i am quite pleased with this bag and will get another as i obtain future tablets
this sleeve is so cute i bought it for my surface rt tablet , and it fits it perfectly i bought the # . # & # # ; one it is & # # ; rugged & # # ; on the outside -lrb- it has a lot of texture , not just smooth -rrb- , but still with a cute pattern and colors it has a soft , cushioned interior that i feel would protect my surface from general bumps and slight drops
i love this sleeve , it works very well for my macbook air ! its also really cute which is a plus if i could ask for any changes i 'd maybe ask for it to be a little more padded , it seems a little thin otherwise the design is beautiful and it seems to fit well and do the job . i 'd definitely recommend this to a friend :
finally , i got exactly what i needed santa brought me a sony <unk> z tablet and finding a case or sleeve has been near impossible i bought a whisper case which i love but the dust that would get on my tablet was miserable this sleeve is <unk> the tablet fits well the colors of the case are fun and as shown the zippers work effortlessly i just love it the price was more than fair i am a fan of your company
i bought this for a gift for my mother in law for her surface # seems to be good quality and hopefully it will hold up over time fits her surface # perfectly and keeps it secure she loves the color scheme on this item so it worked out great
i love the canvas fit of this case so much so , that i ordered it again in a different size i selected # & # # ; by accident , when i needed an # & # # ; i did n't even bother returning it , i will use it for my other computer now i will have # matching cases i really like it the only downside is the strange smell , like <unk> or rubber not sure why but it seems to fade a bit
it 's exactly what i was looking for not only is it adorable but everyone who see it is impressed with the quality the zipper sticks a little but i 'm hoping with time it will wear down
this is not genuine leather it is soft matt plastic it is basically a $ # binder , that is all it does fit the pro # ok -lrb- ish -rrb- and it does offer some protection when the vaio is being used out and about but why do they have to lie why not say matt plastic or faux leather i hate being ripped off
this provides great protection for the vaio # pro i toss it in my soft brief case , and it sadly , takes a beating no harm to my vaio though the only thing it is missing is a stylus holder loop , that would make it perfect
i took a risk on buying this based on the dimensions of other laptops it is made for works like a charm in all of the modes and configurations except tablet if you want to use tablet mode , it is easy enough to pull it out and fold it flat and insert it in again this cover is great especially for the price
i 'm not sure why other reviewers are saying this backpack is good quality , because it really is just typical <unk> material with numerous loose threads the leather part also feels like it would tear and wear out very easily i was expecting better because of the reviews , but if you 're looking for a sturdy backpack , look elsewhere
i love this backpack i get a lot of compliments on it it looks almost the same as a herschel backpack but for much cheaper i can fit a lot of stuff inside of it along with my laptop it arrived much faster than i was expecting which was great it 's good quality the only thing that i saw on mine was a loose string but you ca n't even notice it overall , i 'm really happy with this bag and it 's worth the buy
i bought this bag for school since i recently got a laptop and needed something to carry it in it 's a # & # # ; laptop and it fits in the sleeve perfectly the bag itself is bigger than i thought it would be and the shipping was super quick i was expecting to wait around a month for the bag , but it came in about # weeks
my granddaughter graduated high school this year and is off to college this fall she went on line and picked this as the present she wanted from me so i ordered it for her the back pack was well made and my granddaughter is very happy with our purchase
i ordered this backpack on , and it shipped in two days , which is awesome it was exactly what i was looking for and it 's a lot bigger and roomier than i thought ca n't wait to wear it when i go back to school in august !
i got the sapphire color for my daughter 's # year old birthday i thought it would take couple of weeks to arrive since it was shipped from china but we received it exactly the day of her birthday less than # weeks my daughter likes it very much it 's unique and adorable , lightweight and bigger than it looks there is no zipper under the lid cover but pulling the string tight it 's actually easy to her ready to go during the cycle of classes also there is a side zipper for easily access from the main compartment for small items , like water bottle or pencil box
i really thought that the bag would be somewhat close to the one shown in the image however , its really different the bag which i got has no visible blue color and the top color seems it has been used for a while i wouldnt recommend anyone at all to buy this
it looks nice , just a little small for my liking i have a # in macbook and i can fit it and a few <unk> in there ... does n't really seems like much else could comfortably fit in there the zipper does n't seal the bag completely , so i 'm afraid that small belongings may fall out if i bike with it or just go hard in the paint it would be nice for the outer pockets to have some more secure feature instead of relying on the leather flap but i knew that going into it so , good for those that do n't take everything with them everywhere they go
really good looking and functional bag it is quite small and will not fit larger laptops comfortably , although i was able to just barely squeeze in my large and bulky work laptop -lrb- i do not remember what size it was -rrb- leather definitely starts scuffing , but i like the look that that effect gives
got this bag a few weeks ago the color and looks reflect what is advertised good for a laptop and one notebook do not expect to carry much more than that if you carry lots of stuff , a backpack is probably better it has several interior pockets the two exterior pockets are good for keys , cellphones , etc . i am glad with the purchase
i think the think that would put this bag over the top is if it had just a little bit of structure to it . other wise i love the materials and look of it it would also be nice if i could get a matching sleeve for me macbook pro to provide some padding
i needed a replacement for my laptop bag for sometime now , and after getting to see this bag for myself i got to say it was worth the money very nice materials used , and it is good for carrying around my laptop anywhere i go be it school , work , or out of town the only downside is that the pocket space is not extremely big you may have enough room for a few notebooks or so other than that i am completely satisfied with this purchase
i have only used # x since receiving this bag so i am hesitant to say anything about durability for now , i can say this bag looks good i also like the way it folds to close i will circle back on this review in # months after my usual
great business bag with magnetic snaps that makes for easy access delivery was ahead of schedule which was appreciated just used for a few days , but getting compliments on it 's look and functionality
i like this bag , it works great as far as messenger bags go i 'm really happy with the price , it 's a good buy , and i like that it can be casual and still professional it would be better if the leather came already beat <unk> but it did n't take long to scuff it up and it 's looking much better now the two straps can be frustrating because they are n't actually heavy duty straps , they are just magnets it can be tricky to get them aligned to close just right and if you do n't get them closed and then pick up the bag , the front can spill open but overall , i 'm happy with the bag and the price i paid for it
it 's easy to carry , got lots of internal pouches and stuff feels like a quality bag only holds a couple big books , tho - but i 'm talking books that are # & # # ; thick , each makes carrying a lot of little things and a few big ones a breeze
i simply love it , the leather quality is great and i like how it feels the bag itself my # `` laptop fits perfectly alongside some notebooks and the inner divisions are quite handy to close the bag it has a nice zipper and magnetic buttons : -rrb- completely worth
i love this bag it 's very well made the leather has a great feel and the canvas is very sturdy since i 'm such a girl , it does n't hurt that it 's really pretty
the bag is exactly what the product description said very good quality and large enough for a lap top and more we are using it as a diaper bag for my boyfriend it fits his macbook , a couple diapers , bottles and wipes delivered on time
this bag has really exceeded my expectations it 's the perfect man bag , made with real leather -lrb- good quality might i add -rrb- and has held up great so far definitely worth it
the bag is a lot heavier than i thought it would be , in a good way it feels and looks well made the bag is about # inches wide and # inches tall , not including the handle you ca n't tell from the picture , but straps that close the bag are magnetic only thing i thought was weird is the zipper on the top does n't go all the way across i do n't know if that 's normal for these bags the inside of the bag is brown there 's one big space for a laptop , and a slightly smaller space for a tablet you could fit both of those in here there 's also a zipper compartment , # pen pockets , and # small pockets
i was looking for a leather bag to hold multiple notebooks and a few diapers and wipes without having to carry a gigantic diaper bag around this bag is roomy without being bulky and holds its shape great
taking anything into nyc for work everyday results in wear and tear , but this bag has held up beautifully so far it 's the perfect size for my laptop , books , and lunch there are a bunch of pockets for gum , keys , etc . looks good too
i bought this for my boyfriend as part of his college graduation gift and i love it it looks like something you would buy from urban <unk> , it is very roomy inside and arrived very quickly i was pleased that it arrived so quickly , i am very satisfied with this purchase
bag is a little smaller than i thought but works well for my laptop and books the compact size is great and it has several great pockets for easier organization the magnet closures are really strong , i thought they might be problematic but they work just fine the look is stylish and i have received many compliments
i love the look , feel , and quality of this satchel it is gorgeous and i get compliments on it all the time my only frustration is that it is a little on the small side , so make sure you pay attention to the size of your computer before ordering my macbook air just barely fits in the satchel itself but will not fit in the padded area it 's the perfect size for an ipad , though definitely worth the $ $
bag is big enough to fit my # & # # ; mac and another book or two and the front pockets are large awesome looking bag ; <unk> sophisticated . the more use the better it looks
in the picture it looks like a purple color , but it really is a hot pink , so if you wanted a purple color your not going to get it i was a bit disappointed
great price but the lower part of the shell does not fit well , it keeps falling out besides , the screen protector is not as clear as i expected next time i will invest a little more in order to get perfect fit and better quality do not recommend this product for macbook air # inches , model
i knew i was n't paying for quality of course due to the price of the product in all fairness i got more than what i paid for i suppose but this case does not fit the bottom half of the computer properly it leaves a gap which scrapes your skin and causes snagging in clothing the color is also closer to a hot pink as opposed to the dusty rose as shown in the photo
good deal for the price , but color was completely wrong the picture online looks like a <unk> in reality it is bright blue like primary blue color was not good
the color did not match the picture other than that it was great but i probably would n't have ordered it if the picture showed accurately what color it really was
i love the purple of the case and the set as a whole i 've gotten compliments on the color of the keyboard cover in particular my only complaint is that it 's really hard to apply the screen protector i ended up not using the screen protector because it was too difficult to put on and dust <unk> onto the screen too quickly
was delivered fairly quick the case , keyboard protector and screen cover are all fantastic but the case was stained , and <unk> wrinkled from the way it was packaged decided to just take that as a loss bc i do n't carry my laptop out of the house much anyways all in all , i would recommend this product , minus the cloth carrying case
snap on case fit perfectly . keyboard cover applies n fits good . case is lightweight n fits like a glove . no complaints . i ordered red n all items were true to color
i am <unk> to give you an honest opinion regarding this product as i recieved the cover for a different computer although the quality to me seems marginal in that it wouldnt last during the regular day to day usage one may see from a mobile laptop . hard to recommend just based of looks and feel
from the pic , i thought my black laptop would be purple - not so it is very translucent , gives a purplish sheen to the black computer case , but definitely not what i expected on a silver computer , i 'm sure it 'd be fine but not on the acer which comes in black i put a piece of <unk> paper under it and that does make it purple i 'll play with it as a project to customize , but <unk> , it wo n't give you a different color case
did n't fit , could have been my fault , did n't know there was <unk> chromebook sizes my problem is with the charges forthe return i had two items sent in one box and was <unk> for shipping , plus another $ # charge for <unk> the items were $ # . # <unk> . the returns were over $ # each there lightweight
this item fits great ; easy to snap on and off and offers nice protection i also have a carry case for it when going away for a weekend , but the hard shell case is exactly what i was looking for
it fit my computer perfectly i placed a piece of decorated paper under the cover for the purpose of bringing out the purple color since my computer is black it looks great
this came with a top and bottom piece the bottom piece did not fit i did n't want it anyways the leopard print is super cute however i went to take it off and it snapped in half because it 's so hard to get off it looked good , but now it 's in the trash
i got the <unk> green and it did n't look much like the picture the color was opaque and it 's more of a see through seafoam green i was a little disappointed overall , the case fits and i have no other complaints other than it 's not really the color i want
after receiving a damaged item , the replacement came and was good it takes quite some time to snap it on - it 's a bit too small i think - but it looks real good
this case is made of a lot sturdier plastic than i expected the first one i got was a bit snug and cracked at the corner but i got a replacement and that one fits better think the first one was just a fluke
my daughter ordered this and i was a little skeptical she took it out of the bag , snapped it on in seconds , and now has this spiffy computer
this case is actually better than i expected , the cover is thick and the print pops out so you can actually feel the cheetah print the bottom bits a little bit snug , i 'm hoping it does n't pop off , but this is nothing to deter anyone from buying it
looks good and fits good , only drawback is the paint chips easy on edges still looks great tho i also hate that this review is making my type a certain amount of words
the case fits very tightly and looks great i kept my expectations low when i ordered it but was pleasantly surprised when it arrived i 've gotten many compliments on it
i just got this in the mail yesterday , and i absolutely love it ! it fits like a glove , and it protects my computer well thanks ! ! i highly recommend it to anyone with a macbook pro : -rrb- i love the printing on it , and it feels good , it 's not bulky like some laptop <unk> are
this is the best price / value ratio you are going to find for a simple macbook air case it will protect your macbook from scratches and is extremely slim you may have issues applying the top part , here 's the trick the <unk> that secure this to the top of your laptop are spaced differently on either side one side has more space between the latches than the other the part with the widest spacing should be fastened to the bottom part of your screen , the part with the most narrow width should be fastened to the top first attach the bottom part , then fasten the top part by applying pressure until the lips click into place if you are pressing so hard that the screen is <unk> , you are pressing too hard
i 've had many cases in the past for my macbook pro , and this is by far the best the fit is perfect and i feel the protection is great too have gotten tons of compliments to only add to the wonderful case do n't hesitate to buy
i was not happy with this purchase and they gave me a hard time when i tried to return the bag it was not what i thought i was getting and now i am stuck with it the bag is marketed as a briefcase and that is what i thought i was getting it is not a briefcase - the name is very misleading <unk> , a very disappointed
i ordered this one because i was needing a briefcase for my office work way too small it is very cute on the picture but not alike in person ! now have to search again for another
it 's a relatively cute bag , but the pleather it 's made of has an oddly tacky and low density quality , and feels like it 'd break down quickly if it were used as an everyday bag
when the title said women messenger bag i thought it would be big this bag can only hold one thick book nothing else will fit in it it is very pretty i love the style i just wish i could put more things in it i ca n't carry it because i do n't want to carry more than one bag my wallet will not even fit in this bag with a book
i got this bag quickly its really cute i plan on using it for work -lrb- i work with kids -rrb- and school -lrb- college -rrb- its standing up well so far , but it seems like it will crease easily so i dont think ill be using it as a heavy duty book bag the material is a little more shiny than id like but i wasnt expecting genuine leather at this price overall , its cute ... and it holds stuff ... just what i wanted
this bag is adorable it 's definitely not too big or too small and it stays nicely near my waist when i bring it places with me i 've been needing a smaller bag for awhile and this works perfectly for what i had in mind
this bag is adorable i 've only had it a <unk> days but it seems really sturdy i love the small handle on top and the flat bottom i can set it down without worrying about it falling over it 's just the right size , too i would definitely recommend this bag
i love the look of this laptop sleeve it 's also sturdy the problem is this : it stinks it smells strongly of formaldehyde -lrb- or something -rrb- i 'm trying to air it out to see if i can get rid of the odor ; if i ca n't , i wo n't use it
first off , i am very pleased with the fast delivery my order was n't scheduled to arrive until march # th - today is february # th great case for my mack book pro with retina the only reason i gave # stars was because the color patterns are different then the displayed picture and the colors are n't as vibrant looks a bit worn and old other than that , good buy would recommend this bag to anyone looking for a durable , vintage looking laptop case
i am so happy with this purchase ! the material is very well-made the outside is sturdy yet soft and the inside seems very protective the pattern on mine was a little shifted upwards but its still the same style and patterns the zippers zips smoothly and seem to be very strong my asus # inch fits perfectly : -rrb- if you like the photo , you will most likely like the case
the <unk> used to make this case is durable and cute i love how it does n't look cheap like some leopard prints you see on similar products the only reason i 'm rating it a # is because the strap on the zipper broke # days after opening other than that , i still use it and it is so cute
the product is exactly how it is picture , nothing about it is flawed or damaged the flexible fabric allows for macs with <unk> and it matches my pink one perfectly it also is small enough to fit in my -lrb- large -rrb- purse
i gave the sleeve # stars because i think it will work when i get the next size bought an # . # dell and then the sleeve for the # . # would not quite fit so had to go through the process of returning this one and <unk> the # . # which i hope fits because i really like the sleeve also when returned the # . # because it did n't fit amazon charged me half of the cost for shipping it back assuming i made a mistake with the order so be very careful with the size
i love my case ! ! ! the quality is above my expectations it fit my macbook pro perfectly the zipper may be the only issue i have in the future with this , but lets cross our fingers and hope not the case is exactly as pictured i do hate that my charger can not fit in the case
i love , love love this bag though it does n't come with handles it is still very chic i receive lots of compliments i thought the quality of the bag was n't going to be the best but when i got it i found it is very durable
i am very picky when it comes to cases and i have been searching high and low for one like this not only was it inexpensive but the quality is great and it shipped extremely fast
note : made in <unk> case seems perfectly fine i 'm not a fan of shell cases for laptops but the pearly white chromebook was looking out of place in my apartment i take issue with the misleading description : & # # ; made of <unk> high-quality translucent <unk> polycarbonate material ... & # # ; the shell is made in china according the sticker on the actual product nothing wrong with chinese made products , i just feel like i was misled by the use of & # # ; made of <unk> high-quality ... & # # ; note : made in
this is a great cover for the chromebook the fit is very nice however , it comes off relatively easily the tabs are a nice addition though , so i ca n't complain overall , it 's a fantastic cover for the price
i bought this when i bought my hp # chromebook since the hp # chromebook has a rubberized cover , i thought it would be hard to keep it clean i bought the ipearl mcover hard shell case in black and it fits perfect the holes are perfectly cut out for the speakers and it even has a built-in prop up stand in the back -lrb- like a keyboard has -rrb- it keeps my chromebook protected and clean i would recommend this to anyone in any color
great case for the hp chromebook # protects while having the ports accessible and the fans breathable i bought the black one , and while it is somewhat <unk> , it is dark enough to <unk> the branding on the back of the monitor
i wanted a black chromebook , but the only color option was white , so i bought the black ipearl cover to solve the problem it is sturdy , lightweight , snaps in place quickly and easily , fits like a glove , and allows for plenty of ventilation good price , fast shipping
did the job covers top and bottom , clicks on easy the tiny kickstands on the bottom are a nice bonus the case was much more opaque than the product pictures -lrb- their pic faintly shows the hp logo behind the case i 'm looking at mine right now and i definitely ca n't see through it not a problem for me though
although the bottom of the shell fits properly , the top portion did not fit exactly even when all the clips were <unk> , the top of the shell would always pop off when opening the chromebook , and would often pop off when moving the chromebook it did look nice though when it stayed on , and i think it would have provided the added protection , again though , if the top of the shell stayed on basically , it was n't snug enough
the top pops off the minute i open it ... everything i gave it # stars instead of one because if it did fit , i think it would protect it i have the c # p and the other reviews wrote about the c # could this be the problem
i really like my chromebook , but the casing on the acer c # is a little shall we say & # # ; delicate & # # ; i have a few scuffs and scratches just from minimal impact so my case just arrived and it fits well and is easy to take off if you need to now my chromebook has the protection it needs as an added bonus feature , i like that the case has retractable feet in the back so i can now prop up my chromebook instead of having to sit it on a book my main problem is with the color this may sound finicky but you ca n't really tell how neon green this case is from the picture i do n't like the neon green so i 'll be doing a <unk> for a different color
originally i purchased this product and it did not fit my computer i wrote a review and the seller contacted me and replaced it the product is much better and would repurchase it fits like a charm the color is still less minty then pictured but the function is great
this case is not the same color as the picture , its a much <unk> color but if that was the only issue , i would n't mind right out of the box , the case is dirty , has strange creases in it , and smells awful also , it seems pretty thin so i 'm not sure how well it 's going to protect my laptop i wish i could return it , but i do n't want to have to pay the shipping fees this case might seem cheap , but it 's not even worth the $ #
item arrived with dents in the foam i imagine if you rested a power cord , or anything hard against this , as it would in a bag , it would be ruined quality is poor , and color is not as nice as the photo we returned for refund
the case itself seems nice - it 's sleek , but still cushy the zipper seems solid but , i got the wrong size -lrb- # & # # ; instead of # & # # ; -rrb- due to switching colors when ordering it 's my mistake , but i just want to point it out in case any of you might make the same mistake i was getting the case just in time for work travel , and now i do n't have a case for my trip
this is very light i think it would protect my laptop from scratches but not from occasional bumps that might happen as i carry it around in my bag luckily , i ordered the case star felt laptop sleeve at the same time and am very happy with the felt case
the case is exactly the color as described and arrived promptly it looks nice however it did not fit my lenovo # in ultrabook from reading the description i thought it would now i have a case that my computer wo n't even slide into i did n't order this for the cellphone bag , but it did not come with the case as described
