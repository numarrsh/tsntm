i like the two outside compartments for easy access , but this also has separate compartments <unk> sometimes travel and this is more convenient for travel on air than a backpack the inside is lined to prevent moisture getting to your laptop and note pad , this bag handles them both and seems to be nice and compact very glad i purchased
it fits my # . # & # # ; lenovo i recently purchased with extra room for battery and other small things you may want to carry comfortable enough and i think it looks nice it seems durable but i 've only had it for a month so really could n't say anything about that yet
this bag is very adequate for the person who does n't need one for every day , and i only take my computer with me once in a while the only problem i see is that the cushioning in the bottom , when it 's standing up does not adequately cushion the laptop , but i just put a strip of foam rubber in , and it works fine i would recommend it for <unk> use
i love all the pockets on this bag i have yet to use them all it is durable and cool it 's not the standard looking targus bag i got from work with my work laptop if i did n't have such a bulky day time planner , my laptop and everything would fit perfectly too bad it did n't have an expandable bottom or else i would have given it # stars other than that it fits my # `` and my # `` laptops without a problem i even put both in the bag at once
this bag fits my # . # & # # ; laptop great , it wo n't move when in the slot the only reason i have given it # stars is becuase the bottom needs to be <unk> to put more stuff in the bad
i 've used this bag once and will be using it again today for air travel i travel with my job about # % of the time and having a bag that is comfortable to carry and holds all of my work items is essential this bag has so many pockets of all sizes it 's great i can carry my travel folder in the front pocket so i know where i 'm going next it 's also made of nice material my last bag had some faux suede on the outside and it rubbed off on my clothes and ruined a pair of pants the bag is also very light , there is nothing worse than packing a bag that weighs a lot empty and then adding a laptop and supplies
perfect for games on the go ... has many compartments ... i give this bag a perfect # out of # ... i have now owned it for # months now and there is still not a scratch on it
this is a very nice and sturdy laptop bag with all sorts of compartments and very padded laptop space the straps are adjustable , but the shoulder pad is not , it is sewn into place the side strap attachments swivel at the bag clip , which helps keep the strap from getting all twisted and later looks a mess and is annoying the handle is also canvas , but the with a heavy duty , ergonomic plastic handle that makes a nice grip that wo n't cut into your fingers if the bag is heavy with stuff the bottom is a <unk> plastic material , heavy duty and nice and easy to keep clean , keeps the bottom waterproof , and can handle wear and tear probably more than the canvas i also really like the bright orange inside , it is a refreshing & # # ; <unk> & # # ; from the boring solid black bag , while still maintaining a very professional appearance besides , the price was great for the traveler , it has the velcro canvas strap to slide over the standard luggage pull bars on wheeled cases
very stylish and innovative design ; plenty of pockets and extra storage areas i really like the color and the texture of the material i was very surprised of the quality of the bag for the low price that i paid for it the only thing bad i can say about the bag is that although my dell # inspiron fits in the bag ; it is so tight that it does n't leave room for peripherals
i needed a big bag to carry my laptop , my tablet and a few other things so i picked up this <unk> bag i 've owned it for more than a month now , and i have to say i 'm impressed there are more than enough pockets and compartments for me to store all my stuff -lrb- including external <unk> , flash drives , mice , power adapter , etc -rrb- , and the bag seems very well made i use it for my asus g # <unk> # . # `` inch laptop -lrb- which is as big as a # `` laptop -rrb- , and my acer tablet everything fits fine and the bag does offer good protection big , with lots of pockets and compartments looks nice , made nice , feels nice none as far as i can tell
i just received the bag and i 'm extremely pleased with my purchase it holds my # . # & # # ; laptop perfectly , and has lots of great compartments to store everything i need when i 'm working out of the office the bag is very lightweight and slim for a bag that can hold so much i was half expecting to send it back upon receipt because i thought it might be too big and clunky of course that is n't the case and i look forward to many years of use
when i got the bag i was not sure but now that i am using it on a daily basis i like it better than the over the shoulder bag i also like the strap on the back that you can attach to your <unk> when you travel it will be much <unk> to take with when i go out of town
stylish design with ample room for accessories this bag is sturdy and does not suffer from poor design like another product i purchased for a smaller laptop computer see my review of that product this bag will provide you with a great place to store your laptop and appears to be built to last and the orange trim adds style to the design
i bought a # `` hp laptop and the previous bag i had for my last laptop was too small after a little bit of searching i stumbled upon this microsoft bag fits my laptop perfectly and has many spots to put cables and other random things it also has a nice style to it and really is not too flashy -lrb- even though it is quite a bright orange when you open it up it does the job and i felt the price was fair i would suggest this item to someone indeed
i 'm happy with the bag so far the construction seems solid my # `` dell xps fits in the bag , though it is just a bit tighter of a fit than i would have liked the choice of using as either a shoulder bag or backpack is great my only complaint is there is n't really a good place to store the rather large power supply i need for my # `` laptop the only place it fits is in the front pocket one tall pocket along the side of the bag would have allowed my to carry my power supply while maintaining the slim profile this bag has
i bought this bag when i got a # `` macbook pro from work i was looking for a <unk> , <unk> laptop bag because after a few weeks of lugging around a briefcase style shoulder bag , i was starting to lean to one side this bag is great at carrying the laptop <unk> on your back the shoulder straps are a great shape and are comfortable the only knock on this bag is the limited ease to `` store `` the shoulder straps if you choose to carry it <unk> by the handle in that situation , the shoulder straps buckles have to be <unk> ... it would have been better if there was an extra buckle but the great advantage of this bag is how it carries as a backpack , so for me to complain that the shoulder straps do n't store easily is a bit <unk> summary : excellent bag , very usable , and well made it is very much worth the price
bought this for my new # `` unibody macbook pro it was exactly what i was looking for to replace my tumi convertible that was too small to hold the unit pros : simple , lots of pockets , good protection not too big it seems tailored to fit the macbook pro cons : could be too small for carrying much more than just your laptop , and its supplies
got this bag base on an online review i found posted by a woman who seemed to love macs and to have a few of them the bag sounded like it was well configured , and it turns out indeed to be so , with plentiful pockets and three ways to carry it -lrb- shoulder strap , handle , backpack straps -rrb- i did email the manufacturer with a <unk> and got no response , however , so i do n't think much of their customer service
the bag is perfect except that the velcro straps that hold the laptop in place are torn and are unusable i really wish someone saw this before it was shipped out
the bag that i received was different that the picture shown in amazon i gave three stars -lrb- i was going to give one star -rrb- because the bag that i received is good -lrb- but not the one that i wanted ... -rrb-
this bag fits my vostro perfectly it allows me to carry other items like cords , mouse , and even has room for book or two professional looking , just wish it had room for a lunch for the day
this bag is excellent very nice bag for the price i have a dell vostro # and it fits really snug and tight perfect for light travel or just a way to carry your laptop i was very surprised by the quality for the price lots of pockets and organizing space in the front pockets as well
thank you , for sending the bag it is great i used for the # st time last week what a difference from my other bag it did not hurt my <unk> , it lightweight , felt like i had nothing on my shoulder should have go this bag a while ago
so the first thing i noticed was that the right shoulder strap 's clip had snapped so basically i could only carry the backpack with my left side spend some time putting superglue on the clip and taping it to keep it in place it kinda worked so i put the backpack on when to snap the chest harness in place ... and it snaps right off the backpack what a joke pieces just keep on falling off this was a gift and so far it 's crazy that this thing costs as much as it does has anyone else had the clips just snap on them
a little bit small than i expected i have a sony <unk> # , # mm , # mm g , <unk> # mm , <unk> # mm accessories including vertical grip handle , extra battery , tripod , extra filter lens , clean cloth ca n't put them in the bag as the pictures shows
everyone else has already written in length about why this pack is awesome , so i 'm going to keep this short and just mention the reasons i did n't give this pack five stars - the mesh pockets on the side are too tight anything more than a # oz water bottle wo n't fit without the risk of falling out or tearing the mesh - although there are a lot of dividers , they can not be arranged in any way you want because there are only certain points around the inside perimeter of the bag that are designed for the velcro to stick
this product is a quality backpack , typical from lowepro however , if you have more than # extra lenses to carry , and a flash , you may want to consider the # aw , since the # is a bit small inside
the bag is easily configurable to match your camera , lenses , flash units , etc . . but what makes this bag so ideal for me is the comfort while hiking the <unk> of hawaii when the straps are clipped and fastened as designed , this bag is incredibly comfortable even if you have a lot of weight by carrying a fast telephoto lens however , if you are the type of person to sling a bag over <unk> , this is not the bag for you over one shoulder is awkward to say the least this is meant to be fastened in place and to provide extreme comfort when used as designed
i finally decided on a new camera bag and chose this one it holds my d # canon with the battery pack installed the main longer compartment can hold the camera body with battery pack installed and either a shorter zoom or my canon l series # - # f # zoom with ease plenty of room for the three <unk> i currently use and all three of the lens hoods too , which are pretty good size and take up a lot of room the only thing that i do n't like is the pockets for holding filters are on the small size , will not hold # or # mm filters in the plastic boxes they came in neat rain / dust cover built in for use when needed also like the tripod holder i 'm a happy camper with this bag
this backpack was very nice and exactly what i had hoped it would be i had to return it but only because it was too small for me -lrb- i 'm # ' # `` and it fit me awkward -rrb- the return was an easy and painless <unk> if i was a few inches shorter i most definitely would have kept it i still gave # stars because its not the sellers or products fault that it was too small for me
this is a great pack strong , sturdy straps , lots of padding the only thing bad i have to say is that it falls over onto the laptop compartment other than that it has lots of room and pockets
i was hoping to find a sleeve that protected well without costing too much this seemed to be right , plus a great color unfortunately , it takes a while to get it on and off if you are using for transporting back and forth from the office , it would be great if you need to go through airport security , i would not recommend it unless you want to <unk> a few minutes just to get the computer out and then back into the sleeve
i like this product for my macbook because it fits really tight and snuggly it is pretty tight that the case is too small for it but it does the job it is definitely not big enough to fit a charger or anything else in the case , so i have a bigger case to put this case in with the laptop it is great if you 're like me and want to <unk> cases for extra protection oh and btw the color is really cute
i like this case - it is not bulky but still feels substantial enough to protect my computer it fits great on a # inch ibook the <unk> construction is <unk> and the seams for each side both look good i left a <unk> in the bottom of my backpack and it got <unk> on the case i just <unk> the case with water and the <unk> came out ; the case dried quickly i would like for the closure to seal more tightly i know the computer will not fall out under normal circumstances , but it is just not as sleek as it could be overall , i think it is a great case it is quite reasonably priced and has everything you need and nothing you do n't
i like this case because it is fairly inexpensive and does a good job it is reversible , different colors , there are many varieties of colors available , and it fits fine i use it with a # -inch macbook and it fits the flap does n't really lay flat when the laptop is in it , but it does cover the entire laptop the material is soft but thick i shut the laptop down every time i put it in the case , because once i just put it on `` sleep `` and it seemed to overheat
i bought this case because i am constantly bring my laptop to different rooms of the house and after i am finished , i never want to bring it back to my room with this case , i feel safe leaving it for the most part anywhere without fears of it getting scratched the second reason i bought the case was to reduce my laptop to about the size of a book in my backpack , which it does i debated between this case and the logitech case with the pocket in front -lrb- for my charger -rrb- , but i wanted the smallest case possible well worth the $ # or so
as <unk> ny built once again puts out a quality product if you have not gotten a ny built product i suggest you try them out i am very hard on my items and they wear well the charger bag was nice i got a nice clearance deal but would not have paid full price the pockets are very small but do the job for me if you have a surge protector and the power cord/pack there is not much room for anything else i bought them just to keep my things together when i travel i put everything in one bag overall a nice
the pockets on this thing were too small and i expected an open central space there was n't one ; instead there was lots of wasted fabric in the form of a weird wad of fabric used to make the central division in the bag instead of having , say , pockets created on the inside surface of the bag , a double layer of fabric was sewn into pockets i just picked out the stitching for the two end pockets and wound up with two nice large pockets ; perfect
i love the design , and have two other protector pieces from this line - but this one does n't fit the cords and adaptors that go with most of my electronics i would have found it more useful if they had n't sewn individual compartments - three on each side , and had just kept it simple
overall this is a nice accessory bag for my <unk> phone accessories it made travelling a whole lot easier as i was n't looking for cords and plugs , etc . the only downside is the compartments inside of the bag the bag is divided evenly ; it would be nicer if there were one or two compartments within the bag were slightly larger i would buy it again though
this handy laptop accessory bag is super for carrying my laptop peripherals it matches my striped built ny laptop sleeve as well it 's durable , yet expandable i put my laptop cord , wireless card , portable usb drive , and many other things in it it has a handle that makes it easy to carry and # usable compartments if you have the sleeve , you have to get this carrier as well
so i 'd read that the plastic closers on this bag were n't made well i like swissgear and could n't believe that was correct -lrb- i 've used their bags in the past -rrb- well i was mistaken they are extremely poor quality and wo n't stay closed if <unk> is put on them . which means that i can not tighten the adjustable straps on the bag they ca n't take the weight i 'm also unable to carry a laptop in the bag for the same reason do not buy this bag if you plan on putting anything of substance in it
really disappointing product both <unk> broke within two months of purchasing the product and the company made it nearly impossible to get it fixed the size of the <unk> are n't standard so it is hard to find replacements for them
this bag is small and poorly designed the only reason i bought it is its the only bag i could find to fit my dell studio # its ok quality ... the strap is suspect and it has limited pockets for electronics and accessories i would not recommend this unless you have a laptop that requires it
i bought this bag a couple years ago , and it has served its purpose , but not exceedingly well however , the shoulder strap never stays adjusted to the length you want it at ; it always slides down to the longest length the <unk> that adjusts the length of the strap fell apart one day because its <unk> is a little too long , and did n't stay <unk> around the buckle the guard that sits on your shoulder started to crack after not very long , but a couple <unk> of super glue fixed that , no problem the right fastener on the front flap has given up staying latched and finally , one end of the shoulder strap has begun pulling out of the side of the bag oh -- and one final downside : it 's so large and can hold so much that it tends to really weigh down on your shoulder , if you fill it more than halfway
we bought two of these bags while they have a lot of possibilities we were very disappointed when we opened them the very first time the clips on the bottom of the flap closure broke the clips are too thin very disappointing to have the bags break just opening them for the first time
<unk> of room for most laptops plus it has a separate compartments for paperwork good for occasional use cons - uses cheap plastic snaps that will break after a month of daily use the should strap is n't much better while the adjustment side -lrb- left hand side -rrb- has reinforced stitching the other side is single stitch and will also break under constant use forget about calling for a replacement these items are not covered in its warranty apparently this is considered normal wear
this fits my hp elitebook # w with no problems -lrb- # `` screen -rrb- built pretty solid , but i have a few gripes that really bother me about this bag -lrb- # -rrb- the shoulder strap does not have swivel attachments to the bag this means you have to <unk> unravel the strap before putting it on if you want to avoid a tangled strap -lrb- # -rrb- you can not really carry the bag by the handle unless the two buckles on the outer flap are closed since the handle is attached to the outer flap -lrb- # -rrb- the two buckles on the outer flap are a little small and require exact alignment to buckle shut they 're difficult to work with if you 're trying to do it quickly i would 've liked to have seen the larger ones that <unk> so i do n't have to use two hands to close a single buckle
i wanted a very durable soft case which would have many pockets and have added protection for a laptop i use one of the inside pockets to carry a laptop and the two outside pockets to carry either an ipad or small book the outside pocket on the flap is designed to hold small accessories but be careful to zip it closed before you flip open the flap or you will loose the contents overall , a good purchase
overall , this is a stylish and sturdy bag that looks brand new after # months of daily use the plastic <unk> that hold the flap closed no longer consistently stay closed i do n't feel the bag is less secure - the main compartment zips closed - and i think for a few bucks i could get the clips replaced i 'm not sure if i will bother if there is one thing they could improve about the bag the clips are a no brainer , but other than that i would be hard pressed to find fault with this bag
the bag was a very <unk> bag for the past three years it started to fall apart after a co-worker stepped on the clasps and broke them if it was n't for that , i probably would not be looking for a new one it has enough room for all of my extra cables it has a <unk> compartment and laptop compartment that you can add a <unk> to and keep secure separate from your laptop over-all , very reliable p.s . = i bought this at staples back in # it was not shipped from j & r . ; i hear bad things about them
it 's a great bag and i 'm happy to have it the laptop does fit only into one specific pocket , but that 's fine by me i adore having all the extra compartments to store cords in my only complaint is that i underestimated how heavy and bulky the shoulder bag would be with the laptop inside of it the quality of this bag is <unk> , but it 's simply too heavy for me to carry all the way to school i 'll get a backpack or something with wheels next time
i love this bag it 's a little stiff right now because it 's so new but i expect this to change with a few weeks of use the great thing here is that there are so many pockets that it 's very easy to organize several things my last messenger bag basically had to distinct areas to store things omg there are soooo many i do n't know what to do with them all
i purchased this messenger bag after returning two <unk> laptop backpack bags -lrb- quality has gone way down in their bags since i was a kid -rrb- i used to own a wenger patriot -lrb- rolling computer case with seperate laptop case -rrb- but found it too big for my needs however , i always remembered how durable it was , which lead me to look for a wenger product this messenger bag has quality stitching , a reinforced handle , solid construction , and it is very stylish i most definitely recommend it for anyone looking for a lightweight laptop case , as it does fit the newer # -inch screen sizes it has a <unk> file compartment behind the laptop compartment and extra storage in the front area for accessories and supplies it also has a pocket in the back for <unk> items , as well as a small pocket in the front , enough to hold your keys , ipod and whatever else you can fit into it simply # -stars across the board
this is one heavy-duty bag it has a wide , padded strap that takes the pressure off my shoulder it holds my # inch laptop with space to spare -- i actually can use it as carry-on and pack a weekend 's worth of clothing and all of my other electronics in it
i have used this bag for the last year as my everyday office <unk> to bring the computer and what i need through the day the build quality is extremely good and the compartments are well thought out it holds easily an apple macbook pro # `` which was essential for me like all other swissgear equipment the build quality is absolutely at top i even stepped on one of the buckles with my entire weight and though it made an <unk> sound it did n't break , something i think most other bags would have done if i were to improve on it , it would be nice with a few more compartments so i could better save charger and stuff , but in general i am very happy with this bag
i have had similar bad luck with a wenger case -lrb- not exactly this one , ca n't find the exact model -rrb- however , the pull handle was wobbly right from day one and refused to retract on multiple occasions within the first year also , after roughly one year of use the wheels started falling to pieces no way to repair them in a luggage shop -lrb- the mounting system was hidden inside on my model the <unk> is held in place with # <unk> that are impossible to get off -rrb- so i dragged it along making a huge <unk> for approx . another year , then gave up now i have to carry it in my hand thin imitation leather -lrb- on top of some kind of cardboard i guess -rrb- is all <unk> now it looked nice -lrb- and sturdy -rrb- when i bought it , but sadly , not the case -lrb- no pun intended -rrb-
i purchased this rolling case as a gift for my husband , who is a teacher he carries an ipad , iphone , ipod , and mini-laptop to campus # times a week , as well as files , legal pads , and textbooks i considered several similar products from other manufacturers , but settled on the potomac mainly because it seemed that it had the capacity to carry the most i had read complaints from other reviewers about the telescope handle mechanism , but thought i 'd take a chance anyway the case arrived yesterday and i will be returning it the handle was incredibly wobbly right out of the box and it got stuck when i tried to collapse it for a new case , designed to carry so much bulk , i did not trust that it would hold up - even for a short time i did not see any screws that could have been tightened to make it less shaky i 've ordered a different case from mcklein a bit more expensive , but i 've read they are more sturdy and dependable than wenger
stitching was exposed and ready to rip i returned bag at conveniently located ups in my <unk> i 've had several of these bags and know from experience that the wheels are the first to go , otherwise it is an excellent bag i paid amazon $ # . # whereas staples wants $ # . # plus tax so i feel i got a good deal i 've heard sam 's sells this bag for $ #
telescopic handle looks fragile not worth paying the # $ and i am afraid to put too much load as it is wobbly at best while pulling called jr the vendor and they said you have to have all the packaging material even the papers that are inside the pouches to ship it back absolutely ridiculous policy i will not buy from jr <unk> on amazon again
this case is very sturdy and well-built it has heavy-duty zippers -lrb- the point of failure on my latest bag -rrb- the extending handle is heavy duty -lrb- heavier than any bag i 've had before -rrb- it has lots of pockets and room to hold just about anything needed i was completely satisfied with it until i realized it did not have a shoulder strap i usually pull my computer case on its rollers , but there are situations when i need to carry it , which makes a shoulder strap very desirable
good in looks and functionality one drawback is that there is no shoulder strap for the whole case , so you can only roll it also since you are probably taking this to stuff up with office paperwork and overnight stuff - it looks big and bulky it seems to be a durable product though
i bought this one to replace my old one has been around world several times and holds up like a champ i throw out the inside case best rollie ever
i 've already commented on the awesome service from this seller ... now the product this is a really nice rolling case it is lightweight and has ample compartments to take a laptop and lots of materials it rolls nicely and fits in the overhead storage on the plane which was an original concern because of the size highly recommend it ! !
after one month of normal use the handle pulled off this bag it was glued on and appears to have little reinforcement the bag will be going back i would not recommend this item
let me start by saying that this bag is extremely attractive it is also very large and heavy , which i would n't mind if it was functional unfortunately , the bag has serious design flaws that really limit how much stuff you can put in it the leather on this bag is extremely stiff -- no give at all -- and the opening is too narrow even when i pull the opening apart as far as it will go , i have to squeeze my hand down into it my laptop fits , but just barely and i ca n't carry anything else at the same time without the laptop , i can carry one file folder about half full the front pocket has the same problem -- it does n't open wide enough to be useful if you are wondering , i am a <unk> woman with very slim hands , so the problem is n't me -- it is the bag i am returning this item because i ca n't justify carrying such a big , heavy bag if it does n't function the way i need it to
this bag is very attractive but <unk> <unk> , is it tight it takes both hands to open wide enough to put something in or take something out it 's leather , so perhaps over time it will soften and become more pliable but it just did n't work for me
i would like to warn all potential purchasers about this product it looks very nice and professional it is heavy , but the quality of leather is good , should lasts for a long time but the front lock fall off in one week -lrb- -lrb- -lrb- -lrb- -lrb- it is still functional , but you expect more for money you got paid
i should have listened to the other reviewers before purchasing this item while it is a very nice bag , there is just not enough room to accommodate my laptop , charger , papers , shoes , and possibly lunch this bag only has room for a <unk> laptop and a notepad ... maybe a charger i 'm disappointed to return it because it looks so good
i really liked this briefcase overall but it was way too large , made me feel insecure carrying it it is definitely larger than the picture and larger than most large purses get out that tape measure before you purchase also , the leather was n't great quality , it was n't bad but looked kind of cheap in person not what i hoped for considering the price
i really thought this laptop case was pretty and rich looking but it did n't fit my # . # & # # ; samsung laptop even when i took the sleeve out of the case i could n't get it in there and the hassle factor was too high for keeping the bag so i sent it back there is no wiggle room it should be sold as # & # # ; bag but , yes , it is pretty !
i gave it # stars , because although my daughter loved <unk> smell is still there weeks later we tried airing it out , using <unk> and if you leave it in your <unk> a day the smell is still there
for the money , i would 've expected just a <unk> more ... the leather is on the very stiff side , and the pocket does n't open quite far enough to be readily accessible workmanship is very good , color is true ... decided to keep it , but would n't do it again
it 's heavier than a normal laptop bag and the leather seems more like a stiff coated plastic - it 's just so stiff there is n't hardly room for anything beyond the laptop and some papers it has a nice look to it but it does n't really look like leather i would hold out and keep looking for something with nicer leather
very nice looking bag , but leather is a bit stiff and hard i returned it because of that reason i gave it # stars because it was a beautiful looking bag , just did n't work for me
i like the bag but it does n't really look like a $ # + bag in person it is a lot shinier than it appears online it is also hard to get the bag to spread open to fit items inside i would give it # stars if it was a $ # bag
is a nice bag for the price , but i 'm not sure i would recommend it the leather is very , very stiff it is also heavy and not flexible at all i love the color i use it for my macbook # & # # ; and it <unk> nicely , but hard to fit mouse , power cords and other connectors , like hdmi
mcklein <unk> looks well made and nice , except that it is huge it is also very heavy if one needs a bag that just fits a laptop , some papers , and a few small things , then there is no need for a bag of this size maybe it works for taller women -lrb- i 'm # . # -rrb- , but i returned mine , and instead got a jack <unk> laptop tote
looks very professional and made well however , it is heavy with a <unk> leather exterior and a tight squeeze for personal items i can barely get my hand in the front pocket
i purchased this bag for my daughter who is studying to be a doctor she used it to carry her laptop and medical instruments she uses for <unk> the bag is beautiful but the little turn latch on the outer compartment broke off we tried to have it repaired but it could not be repaired i bought her another model to replace this one it is a mcklein too , hope it holds up
a beautiful color , great material , very nice hardware and larger than i suspected the only issue i have is that it 's so stiff -- the leather is not giving at all but i <unk> that up to it being new ; i have faith that it will wear in once i use it a few months
love this bag ! i have gotten complements on how it looks not a lot of room after my laptop is in <unk> it holds everything i need easy to get thelaptop in and out of bag with the <unk>
yes , i read the reviews that said it was heavy this is actually quite a heavy bag it looks very good for interviews , but there is not much space in it , and it weighs quite a bit i will still use it to go to interviews , but i wish it were a bit lighter i would like the center pocket to be removable , but it is not
it 's a nice case but does n't have a lot of give and it 's on the heavy side esp once you put your computer in wish came with a wider leather strap for cushion on your shoulder did to the weight
i found the case to be very heavy and the straps too short to comfortably fit on my shoulder when i chose the black case i did not look at the large photo and missed that it was not all black , but black and with red accents the shipping was very fast the case appeared to be of very good quality , it was just way too heavy when empty
this is my second mcklein usa bag and i am pleased once again it 's a beautiful bag and i get compliments about once a week the quality is top-notch and not only is it attractive but also very durable i generally carry it over my shoulder and the handle is plenty long enough to be comfortable for my # ' # frame the front pocket has a nice organizer my only complaint is that it could be a little bit deeper in order to accomodate more easily my medium sized water bottle this bag is more of a streamline breifcase so if you plan on lugging a bunch of stuff around , this is not the bag for you it 's also a made of a thick leather and is definitely not the lightest bag available for the price , an excellent bag
this is a very nice brief well made , lots of room and looks lovely i like having a briefcase i use for spring and summer and another for fall and winter and this was my fall/winter brief the only reason i gave it only # starts is because it is very heavy you start filling up with your bare essentials , ipad , phone , pens , lipstick and recharging cables , with a few files to work on at home and i felt like it needed wheels i walk to work and home and it 's just too much to lug even a few blocks so i may need to give it as a gift to someone with a bit more upper body strength too bad , i really like it
great looking bag love the color & finish my # `` laptop is a snug fit directly into the bag can not use the padded sleeve provided for my laptop -lrb- could be useful for smaller laptops -rrb- the only reason i gave it # stars is because i could use a little more room in the bag for other stuff right now i can fit my laptop w/charger & wireless mouse , ereader w/charger , iphone w/charger and my long large wallet , if i organize it well small , thin makeup case may also fit in for your travels
a co worker had one in atlanta , loved it then i was happy to find that when i received mine that the quality and value were better than she had stated love it !
the blue was so bright it looks retro i should have gone with the black . . but i was looking for <unk> at first it was really stiff . . but now it has set in and is a great bag
i 've had this bag for # full years now -lrb- i got the cream one , but it seems to be gone now -rrb- i 'm a <unk> student who also teaches full time , and this bag is basically the best purchase i 've made for work/school even my <unk> compliment me on this it 's sharp , it 's roomy , it 's sturdy as hell i 've lugged books to and from the library and all over campus with this thing it 's great * i went back through # 's order history to find this item for my colleague , that 's how seriously i recommend it
i love this briefcase i needed something that looked more professional and this worked out perfectly it is fairly slim , so i can not stuff a million things in it however , i am the type of person who will stuff a million things in my bag and make it too heavy to carry , so this helps me minimize what i carry on a daily basis the leather is very stiff , and i 'm hoping that it will loosen up a bit after using it more , but otherwise i have no complaints i do not bother using the laptop sleeve
i would like to sincerely express my excitement at the quality of this product definitly value for money as i live in another country it is a risk however i have no <unk> in telling other people how wonderful your product is thank you very much
i received this brief case a few weeks ago and am delighted with it the leather quality is smooth and <unk> seams are well matched and finished it is a little heavy when my laptop is in it , but good quality durable leather should be a little on the heavy side
if you are looking for a bag that both durable and stylish , then i think this briefcase fits the bill it 's a great bag for anything professional and as a carry on it 's usefulness rivals that of <unk> klein nancy laptop bag i highly recommend getting this bag
i purchased this for my daughter for her business trips , and received it yesterday it is so beautiful , that i am thinking about keeping it for myself i do agree with the other reviewers that it is stiff , but it is such fine leather , that i believe that in time it will be better i purchased the red color , and it is a very nice dark <unk> of red i would not recommend if you carry a lot of folders , but for a lap top , purse items , and papers , it is perfect
this bag is perfect for the middle <unk> who wants a bag that 's not too big that you carry too much on your shoulder i am a college professor and necessarily cart all kinds of books and files around campus , and this suits my needs perfectly and foe prices me to keep it tidy and protect my back . : -- rrb- very happy with the purchase and speed of delivery too
nice sized , plenty of space and i love the removable laptop sleeve will fit a # inch laptop with no problem i think it will take time for the leather to become flexible , though i absolutely love the pink color
the purse looked great great buy for the price i bought it as a present for my cousin after searching through countless stores and different purses , this one had the right amount of chic and professionalism i was looking for i did not get to use it , so i ca n't comment on its practicality but it looked high quality and durable
what a beautiful and functional bag enough room for laptop and tablet handy front pockets for easy access to phone , cords , incidentals leather is beautiful metal feet on bottom will save the bag from scratching love that the top closes it looks very professional and sleek
