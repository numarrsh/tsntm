this case cover was broken , but i did n't find any piece in the bag the bag is good , so the case cover had already broken before they put it in the bag
this case was not designed correctly and does not allow the monitor to open past # degrees before hitting the plastic case covering the bottom part of the keyboard my macbook air is a # . # ghz i # , # in mid # , a # i have installed the case correctly it does fit snuggly , but it now wo n't open past # degrees , which is bad
the last reviewer was right - the picture is misleading and there 's a circular cut-out around the apple logo on the back the problem is , if anything presses against the back of the case , there 's uneven pressure against the lcd panel a friend had one of these and her display cracked because of the uneven pressure caused by the cutout
i was so excited to get this for my mac air , but sadly as i try to put it on the right side will not clip on the way the left side did and it is very frustrating i had others attempt and we have had not luck just be mindful of that
for $ # , i suppose you get what you pay for the case was okay for a while , but then it started to discolor an ugly yellow color , and just from normal wear and tear , the sides of the case literally broke off they cracked at first and after a while just completely fell off i would recommend saving up a few extra bucks and buying a higher quality case
it was very pretty , color matches just perfect the lower tabs in the corner broke in about # weeks , you get what you pay for shipping was very fast though
the product itself is very nice , but i noticed too late that the back corners on the cover for the base of the computer are not shaped very well -lrb- have partially broken off -rrb- it 's not super noticeable , but does not look very good hard to do anything months later when purchased online otherwise the color is great and the gloss of the product is nice
it never fit properly to begin with and the case started cracking almost immediately i honestly have no idea how that even happened because i barely even use my computer it 's eventually totally fallen apart after the few times i 've taken my laptop to work hope they can correct the defect because it is at a great price point
description says it will fit a # macbook air , but that is misleading this case snapped on very easily and quickly it looks great the top piece is solid and fits smoothly the bottom piece fits well too , but the case covers the # nd microphone i guess it 's going back . too bad , because i love the purple color and it looks so nice
it was arrived on time , and it was fit for my new macbook air # `` , # i bought the color pink it was way different than in the picture ! it was visible -lrb- way visible than in the picture -rrb- , and pink is ugly ... do n't believe picture
the product fits well on my macbook air but the product quality is not as good as i imagined , has small patches in some areas the case has white pads that look ugly i take them off to use the case
do not get this case if you have the updated # air the reason being is because the new air has dual mics , and this cover will cover one of those mics i had not realized this case had covered the mic till i got frustrated when i was video chatting with friends and family , and they had a very hard time hearing me , even with earphones on this case is amazing and keeps your air well protected but another con is that is extremely difficult to take off guess you ca n't have great protection without the case having to latch on well to your laptop
now my apple is a golden delicious : -rrb- it fits well , but it does show scratches quickly still , i 'd rather know that the scratches are on the plastic rather than the aluminium
by itself , it fits fine by the way it 's a really nice topcase , it looks great however , i got it so that i could create my own topcase background and put it beneath the topcase , but with this picture on it does n't fit quite right without it , though , it fits just fine -- almost too fine , really , since i nearly pulled apart my computer to take it off it stays on though , and i 've had it for about a month already with no scratches or anything , so it 's a good buy
not as pleased , however i purchased this mainly to give protection and add some color to my mac air the bottom case is too big and does not properly attach
topcase is a really simple and sleek way to protect your macbook air , because it is thin and light , yet it provides strength and scratch protection for this super thin and lightweight computer it , also , looks really good my cover is smooth i read another review that stated that the cover was not smooth , but the one i received was smooth and really nice i recommend this product and am happy with my purchase
i got what i wanted and it looks really good im actually thinking about getting another : -rcb- definitely worth every penny if you get the clear case like i did , you still get to have the apple logo visible and also a cool looking sticker if you have one on your
i have the model a # / # macbbook air # in . and this is one of the first cases to fit all the way around my laptop i wish the color was a little darker , but i can settle for the light green color very snug fit , so you put it on , do n't plan on taking it off often
based on the reviews i read on this product , i am disappointed the laptop compartment closure is velcro , which is much less functional than the more modern magnetized closures often used the pockets on the inside make no sense pens/pencils slip out of the elastic pen holders on the inside , and a simple pocket would be more useful the clear pocket is an odd size and does n't hold much the hook for keys is too <unk> to maneuver -lrb- clip open -rrb- and a simple ring would be more functional i do like the pocket that opens to slide over a rolling suitcase the other outside pocket is nice , too good bag , it just needs better pockets on the inside to be more functional
gift for my daughter she had requested it only concern was , if it is thick enough to protect her computer she decided it is good for to and from work and when flying
shoulder straps are very comfortable great quality fabric nice assortment of pockets and a place to hang your keys wish it could expand a little more so i could fit the computer and a # & # # ; binder would give it a # if it was a little bigger so i would n't have to decide what to take out when i go to <unk> places
if you are looking for something that is not your typical black and boring laptop case , this is perfect enough room for all the power cords etc . i especially like the back pocket which slides over my suitcase handle for travelling
i am not a purse person , and i always try to carry as little as possible however , i needed something sturdy to carry my work computer as well as cords , hot spot , and all my other personal stuff this bag works great there is lots of storage and zippers and pockets to separate things to help you find them easily i also like the length of the straps because they are not too long , and not too short i have had many compliments on it
not only is this bag very cute , but it 's functional as well it has a nice padding for my small laptop has plenty of room to carry my wireless keyboard as well or my ipad holds plenty , yet does n't look too big i also like the fact that you can zip a flap in the back to slip over the handle of your pull luggage
the laptop slot has no padding on the bottom to protect it the straps are thin i did not like this item targus makes some much better backpacks for a little more than this one this one is not worth it
takes a while to get used to shoulder straps are scratchy and a bit uncomfortable on first few uses very little padding at the bottom so even though the laptop compartment does n't reach the bottom of the bag and therefore protects it , everything else sags and makes the bag more uncomfortable to carry if you arrange your stuff well inside the main compartment though , it props up well on its own top part of the bag does n't have extra <unk> either , so i have yet to find out how it will hold up when it rains that said , quality and capacity is great
you get good quality at a good price with this one my only issue was it is n't as spacious as i had hoped maybe a tad too small for an overnight bag but does well as a laptop bag my other main issue with is is the absence of side pockets which leaves me with less compartments than i am used to
the bag is cheap but it is not of good quality . i used it moderately for a month and then it was broken i would spend more money on a more durable backpack
this is a great value backpack especially because unlike other targus models , it is very discrete , not looking like a notebook bag the only thing i 'm not very fond of is the fact that it does not have many internal divisions inside like the higher <unk> ones besides that fact , it is a very good quality bag , totally worthy
i bought this backpack # months ago and i think it 's a good one pros : - very useful <unk> - <unk> : - it 's not waterproof so , you have to be carefull if it 's
needed to replace my old <unk> , and did quite a bit of shopping for a new one price was good , positive reviews , so i sprung for it glad i did ... appears very well made , very good utility with padded laptop pocket and plenty of space with multiple pockets very pleased so far
i love the cloth and the color of the backpack it is great for the price it has great space and i can fill stuff more now from my previous backpack
caught this on a lightning deal for $ # to replace a similar bag i had and i like it so far , probably because it is nearly identical in design of my old bag i just got it so i ca n't speak on it 's durability , but it feels that it will be reasonably durable i expect at least a year out of it fits my # & # # ; macbook pro just fine as well as my ipad air and cords , chargers , flash drives , externals this is basically my gadget bag that i can fit my laptop in there is a mesh slot for the laptop as well as a strap to latch it in
pretty good backpack - it has held up well to wear and tear and still looks sturdy after a few months of frequent use with heavy contents i like the pockets and organization , although i still have n't figured out what to put in the front pocket - the vertical zipper in the middle of the pocket is a bit strange and out of place the backpack itself is very thin , so you wo n't be able to fit too much in it the laptop sleeve is helpful , but not incredibly thick , so it will not protect the laptop very much , but every bit helps so i like it i usually keep my laptop in its own sleeve , and then put it in the backpack so it is twice protected
this bag is nice , compact and comfy ample amount of compartments nice space for carrying water bottles , the straps are a bit small if you are a tall guy . above #
arrived the other day in an proper shipping box , undamaged and in new condition though not one of targus ' better higher end bags , is an pretty good deal , though if outdoors a lot apply an coat or # of <unk> <unk> water repellant
i use this backpack for my laptop - a # & # # ; macbook pro , it do the job and i still have plenty of space to put my books and other stuff in
i have been using this back pack for over # . # years and has been my daily company to office and few short trips still looks new spacious enough to hold # days of clothing
good size , i use a # & # # ; laptop and it fits with out a problem -lrb- i could fit another with out a problem very simple , does n't have a lot of complicated pockets that is good for me
i like everything about the bag plenty of pockets , useful storage , and i feel safe keeping my laptop within it the only downside is that it <unk> forward when loaded it 's <unk> , but once you learn to adjust for this it 's perfect again
i bought it for everyday use i am currently in college and need to haul my heavy books and mac around it is great bought it mad cheap and still fine will def buy again if it ever need it
this backpack has a thin compartment with padding on one side , and mesh with a velcro strip on top to secure your laptop towards the back of the backback i was worried about the mesh at first thinking at some point it might tear or catch on things , but it has been great the laptop inches provided are accurate my laptop is a # inch so i got the # inch backpack to allow a little extra room the main pocket leaves plenty of room for cords , notebooks , etc . i 've easily held the entire contents of a purse , a laptop , cord , binder , and textbook the backpack has also held up to # days a week use and several flights the straps are thick and well padded so they do n't dig even when the bag is fully and heavy a good purchase
affordable and convenient for college my # in laptop fit perfectly in the laptop sleeve , though it would be prefer that there was padding on the bottom so it takes not impact when you set it down the backpack has the right amount of pockets , especially the one on the front for pencils or note cards
she 'd been using a backpack from her last <unk> into school # years ago i thought she could use something a little updated since she always hauled her heavy books in it along with her laptop the laptop pocket padding is a little on the thin side but does its job well enough
the top part of the folio caused my macbook 's screen to bend back additionally , it was a bit thicker than i anticipated not really big deals , but it just was n't what i was hoping for
this computer case looks fantastic very professional -- when closed heaven forbid i open it the stitching around the edges is terrible ; the case has been on all of ten minutes and it 's already starting to fray and come loose it was a pain to get the mba in it and quite frankly , i may have to cut it out going to try to return it ... absolutely horrible so sad that this one did n't work out
i was skeptical given the price , but decided it was worth a try i like it have had it for a couple of months it fits my macair nicely and to the casual glance does not look like a $ # computer worth stealing all of the ports are accessible i would have liked a lining which was not bright red , but it barely shows
this was exactly what i was looking for to protect my air i would recommend this to everyone in any business or line of work i have received compliments on this case and have enjoyed it very much
purchased for use with my ms surface pro everything i need fits well in the compartments i 'd suggest getting the smaller # w power supply though for the surface product seems to be sturdy , will know more over time
awesome bag ! fits my laptop -lrb- # & # # ; lenovo thinkpad -rrb- perfectly nice padding and features love that i can charge it while the laptop is in the bag due to the orientation love the roomy pocket in the front for my charger , etc .
i have used several computer bags this is the best for me it is light weight , easy to slip over the shoulder and having a hand hold right on top is essential this bag does not hold a lot of other stuff but the slim line vertical design makes it fantastic for moving through busy areas , like airports it seems very well made and feel confident i will be using this bag for many years
it 's perfect for carrying just my laptop and basic cables they came out with a newer model which holds a bit more , but this is my preferred option as it is slimmer
i bought the product for an # . # asus vivobook and the fit is perfect however , the string came off almost immediately after opening the package and there is a horrendous smell to it that , after having it one week , still lingers customer service was responsive and helpful when i requested a return - hence the three stars not a bad idea , just not a great product in particular
this sleeve is very soft -lrb- foam inside -rrb- yet protective it keeps the device from being scratched and provides a waterproof barrier around your surface the sleeve looks like a leather inter-office envelope if you are a traveler and often take your surface with you , or if you are hard on your device , you may want to invest in a case instead of a sleeve
it is so difficult to find a sleeve for anything # . # & # # ; other than the airbook this sleeve indicates that is # . # & # # ; , however a # . # & # # ; laptop would probably not fit -lrb- so maybe this just indicates the sleeve 's dimensions -rrb- my # . # & # # ; laptop is a bit of a squeeze , however i happy with this product my laptop is probably just a bit thicker than an airbook , so i 'd expect those to fit well also the color is nice , though the material has a bit of a <unk> smell the lining is soft and good for protecting your laptop i might buy again , unless i had more options
i bought this when i bought a leather <unk> that included a keyboard because it was cheap and boy am i pleased it far exceeded my expectation and is a very nice way to carry my slate gets as many comments as my windows tablet
i purchased this item for my macbook air # `` , shipping was fine , but the fit i would not recommend this item , it looks very sloppy too big and bulky to slide into my purse i 've thought about putting it through the sewing machine , but it 'll look even worse the built in external pocket is a nice idea and useful
decided to get this because it was a cheaper alternative compared to other laptop cases online but i recommend to stay clear from this product due to the little to no padding it offers to protect your laptop not only that , but the zipper was extremely cheap and one of them broke the first week of use but the other still worked so i continued using it i 'm writing this review a month later after purchase because my other zipper came off of the track and now the case is completely useless do n't buy this product especially if you have a macbook pro # in , the case was extremely snug to the point where i could n't even close the zipper save your money and invest in a better case !
did n't fit the # th at all it was way too small and hard to get on i would say this would be for a mac air not a pro which is
description said # & # # ; mac book this is exactly what we are trying to fit into the case but cant get the zipper to close upon forcing the zipper to close , it broke we have not used product for # minutes and already it is broken we have given product as a gift in the philippines so how do we replace i demand a refund on my credit card very unhappy with product
the # -inch ipearl sleeve in pink was too small for my # -inch macbook the zipper would not even close the price of the item is pretty cheap to pay to send it back i guess i will use it with ipad or something the build , color and the quality of the sleeve is good
the zipper is really cheaply made the first time i used it , it was difficult zipper track felt rough and hard to get zipped close the second time i used it , the zipper stopped zipping all together the third time i used it the zipper came off its track completely on one side the rest of the product is great , color especially , but i ca n't use it any more because it does n't zip at all . :
as i dont hate it , i dont want to go through the trouble of returning , i will keep it it is made out of flimsy , cheap material it has a funky smell to it , like a bad new car scent almost i would n't recommend it the color is nice though
the case itself is fine , however , it smells weird it s the right size and shape , but the smell kills it would only recommend if you can take the smell
i like the case , but it does not fit my lenovo yoga pro - # . # inch measurements are similar to the lenovo yoga # and i thought this would fit company needs to have measurements of the size of the device that will fit in the sleeve like many other companies have i 'll try another brand instead
it 's a good sleeve for the price , however the zipper on mine is broke one does n't move , not a big deal since there 's two it will suffice just to store my macbook
it 's very sung however so snug the zipper rips and you have to be careful with it i threw away the receipt because it looks cool so i am stuck with it but it 's not good enough
this case looks good until you fit a power cord or mouse in with the laptop , and then it becomes permanently marked and stretched it 's ok for the price and if you wo n't be using it a whole lot otherwise , purchase a sturdier sleeve
i have had this product for nearly a year the color pink is as pictured and is not the salmon color that i hate it is a pretty pink and very functional there is a pocket where you can store your power cord , or anything else , like pens or paper my laptop fit in the sleeve as well as my power cord and i could get a folder in too if i wanted the zippers have not broke on me or anything it has done its job and is a good <unk> i buy a pink product and its not pictured , or is an ugly salmon color
this is a good product it is not as padded as i had hoped i bought it to fit my macbook air with its case on it is a little difficult to zip around the corners of my laptop but not impossible it was a great price compared to other sleeves available on the market today
like what many others said , the case is a little on the big side i wish it fit more snug on my samsung series # laptop and the fabric was thicker , but i 'm not tossing or dropping it , so it is more for cosmetic protection i love the extra zippered slot , perfect for carrying the charger , etc . and you really ca n't beat the price
i bought this sleeve for my # in macbook pro and i really like it my laptop fits perfectly as do my charger and mouse but they do make a big lump on top i bought this to keep my mac from getting scratched in my backpack and it 's perfect the inside padding is fairly thick and soft and has flaps around the zipper to keep from scratching the sleeve definitely will not protect my mac if i drop it but that 's not why i bought it so that 's fine the external pocket is very large and fits my charger and mouse with room to spare the price is great for the product and i 'm happy with my purchase the only thing is that it has a very strong plastic smell that still has n't gone away after being left in the sun for # days , which is why i give it four stars instead of five other than that it is a great product and i would recommend it to anyone who is looking for protection from scratches
they were and looks great , excellent price , fit in the others brand computers , package came complete as per required , was perfect for my purpose , i recommend them to all customers
this was the second sleeve i tried for my lenovo yoga # when i looked at the inside dimension i thought it would be a little bigger than the computer it turns out the size is just right i like the handles they are a good size the downside of the handles are they are attached on the inside and have snaps to snap the two sides together i will have to be careful sliding the computer in and out so it does n't scratch if you are using the handles you can only zip to each side of the handle everything still seems secure it does smell of chemicals
my laptop fits perfectly his only outer compartment is more than enough it inserts cables , etc . . it is firm but padded , allowing computer protection good design and seems well made & # # ; & # # ; for its good durability
so i accidentally spilled my conditioner all inside my backpack , including my laptop luckily my macbook air was secured away in my sleeve case and when i opened it up instead of finding a damaged laptop i noticed it was absolutely fine the inside was completely dry ... this sleeve definitely saved my laptop
the item itself is in really good shape it 's a pretty blue and does n't look that much different from the picture , -lrb- save for the factory smell -rrb- however , within one day , the zipper immediately broke it does n't work anymore i would n't recommend buying this
within # uses , one of the two zippers for the main section of the sleeve went off track and can not be put back into alignment within only a few more uses , the zipper for the front pouch wo n't zip closed completely the stitches for the fabric are too close to the zipper teeth and keep catching in the zipper pull since the item is only a stretchy pocket with zippers , the only way it could fail more is if the seams came undone , too
i bought it because it had a low price i got what i paid for this zipper is torn after hardly any use i would not recommend this item to another shopper
this basically fits like a wetsuit that is too big the material is the same - and the thickness is similar to a summer wetsuit here in los angeles since its too big , it does n't fit snugly and just feels terrible would not recommend
this case is exactly what you 're paying for i had it for maybe a month or two when the zipper started getting caught and not working i still use it , since i keep it in a larger bag and am less concerned about water protection , but i would n't recommend this case for someone wanting substantial protection for their computer
the sleeve itself seems to be ok , the problem is the zipper it has not functioned from the day i got it i was able to close once but since then i have been unsuccessful in getting either zipper to work so basically the case works sort of like a padded envelope , but i can not close and safely secure my laptop i will try and return for a refund and purchase another sleeve that functions properly too bad because it does look nice
within less than a month of my using this sleeve , the upper zipper broke -lrb- missing teeth , zipper wo n't zip . the use was less than moderate : my laptop is generally on my desk - only very occasionally do i put it in my briefcase i am very disappointed i still use the sleeve , but it really is like a sleeve -lrb- on a shirt -rrb- -- with an open hole that does n't shut i 'm sure there 's a better product out there
i had the impression it should fit my ultrabook but it does n't close around the corners otherwise it is as advertised , protection from minor dings , scratches and dust but that 's about it
it 's a nice case the material is good but it 's bigger than # inch my # & # # ; macbook does n't slide in so nicely and has plenty of room to wiggle around
the case is very soft , almost flimsy and thinner than i expected it fits the mac with a hardcase on great i do recommend an additional hard shell with this
i read a lot of cases about the zippers breaking i have had it for a month so far and everything is okay just do n't go crazy on the zipper i have only had this product for a month though . who knows what will happen
after having for a year , it has not held up to the everyday wear i needed the zipper of the smaller pocket rubbed though the material and has scratched my laptop also the larger zipper stopped working about a month ago the zipper teeth were a cheap plastic that did not last a good product if you normally leave your laptop on a desk and need a case sparingly , however if you are zipping and unzipping it multiple times a day , i would avoid this product
bought this for a macbook air # `` the cover is not as snug as i had hoped , material is thinner than expected , and the zippers catch a lot also it took almost a month before the chemical smell of the sleeve left the outside pocket is very helpful wo n't buy again that said , i bought this from amazon directly and the product shipped ahead of time , which i liked
only strange feature is that it has a carrying handle but it it sewn from the inside so it prevents you from closing the zipper if you want to use the handle
pretty darn thin but it was really cheap the lenovo yoga # pro sort of fits in it the zipper will just barely get around the corners , however , it fits in it awkwardly and slightly <unk> sometimes i have trouble with the zippers , i think it is mostly because of the fitment issue but ca n't be sure i 've certainly had better and more padded sleeves but this is ok for the price probably would not recommend
the material and color are good the case is really quite snug for the macbook air and it needs a little stretching to get the zip closed after about a week , the zipper pull came out i managed to put one of the pulls back , but the other one is impossible to fix so the case can only be opened from one end now
the case protects my macbook pro very well the zipper and materials are all of very good quality and the pocket is absolutely perfect i keep a folder of documents in it to separate them from the rest of the junk in my work bag i 'm not a huge fan of the little handle that comes inside the case as the snaps ended up <unk> the edges of my macbook but it was easy enough to cut out with a pair of scissors
nice case and fits my brand new -lrb- summer # -rrb- macair snugly it you plan to use an accessory like a case on your macair then it 's a little too sung
a nice sleeve at a decent price it just the job it does smell very <unk> if that makes any sense but all in all , it 's not a bad sleeve
this case is very nice i received this as a gift it is padded pretty good i adore the front pocket that is something that i missed on my previous sleeve , as i did n't want to scratch my macbook by carrying my charger or anything else in the same compartment the only reason i give this product a # -star instead of a # -star rating is that the case is n't exactly snug it has a little extra room for the computer to move around , but i guess i could use the space to tote paperwork and such
it 's a little roomier for my # & # # ; air than i had hoped , but i also have an ipearl mcover on it , so i do n't worry about it too much nice to have the outside pocket for cable , flash drives , a pen -lrb- yep , i still use a pen sometimes -rrb-
i have bought this sleeve but have rarely used since i also got a hard shell for my dell xps and have been using the shell with a small portable bag i am using the sleeve for travel only as it can not fit the battery charger inside
the case is exactly what i needed for my new laptop the storage compartment is ideal and the color is just as it is pictured , which is sometimes an issue
this is great for putting in your carryon luggage for travel at the airport , i just unzip and slip it out for the security routine , then just slip it back in the side pocket is especially nice i use mine for an e-reader , mp # player , and flash drive solid , good protection , nicely designed
