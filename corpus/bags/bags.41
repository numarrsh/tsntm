i bought this bag based on previous experience with swissgear the last swiss bag i owned lasted over # years of hard use and abuse this bag seems to be not as rigid you can stuff it and it conforms to the shape of what 's inside , which some may see as a good thing , but not me it may just be me , but i also find it less easy to keep things organized - there are fewer small pockets , and the pockets on this bag are not engineered very well comfort of the shoulder straps is the same quality as always lastly , the quality of the zippers appears to have gone down since the last bag i owned i will not buy another swiss gear bag unless i can physically inspect it first
it was time for me to get a new swiss gear backpack i loved my other one that lasted for years got a great deal during the holidays on this one not as nice as my first bag and had a bunch of broken zipper latches it still opens and closes but i wonder about long term use i get the impression that i got such a good deal because it had flaws
good backpack with good pockets i am not rough on my things and seams are splitting on one pocket and i did not overstuff it did great through security and i did not have to take laptop out of the bag , just unzipped and done i paid $ # ish and it should sell for $ # disappointed in swiss gear overall one trip from nc to la as a carryon and i see seams tearing on one pocket ... unacceptable i wo n't return it , but i expected more
aside from the strap , i really like this backpack although the moment i got it , i was a bit disappointed with its built quality because i thought it really looks like a <unk> bag i 've been using it for a month now and it seems good and <unk> the first days i wear it though caused me shoulder pains because of the strap it was n't like my nike bags with foamy strap eventually , i got used to it now
the backpack has shoulder straps but no waist straps or chest straps , so it is not <unk> sound outside pockets for water bottles are just a little shallow for taller bottles it is well padded for a laptop but also makes it a litter heavier to carry around
i bought this for my <unk> for a # . # laptop . the bag looked awesome , but was a little disappointed with the padding and quality . it works ok - but do n't count completely on the protection it offers you still have to be a little careful one thing i liked about it was `` scansmart `` . some claimed that tsa did not accept it - i had no problem with the security while travelling abroad so - i am good there other thing i liked was there are lots of compartments a little bizarre to see that it is designed better for left handed ppl and found it a little hard to get used to that
i am a student and as you can imagine i need to carry a lot of books the bad is comfortable , and has a special compartment for your computer it also has an <unk> key ring , which i have found useful as i often loose my keys only caveat it the zip in one of the pockets that travels around the bag broke in the first week of use , so that i can not use # % of the bag i suggest you use it for a few weeks before going to school so it can be returned if necessary
this is a quality product but does n't fit a # . # `` laptop as advertised i have an asus g # vw which i 'm unable to fit in either the laptop compartment or the main compartment it can probably fit in # `` size to the max
the zippers unzip in the middle and the backpack is not full a few rubber bands for storage on outside ripped off and they were never used the pockets for storage inside the sections lacks security bands and zippers for safe packing for swiss gear i am disappointed for a $ # . # backpack it does have ample room for # inch laptop
pros : quality of bag is too good quite comfortable for daily use cons : one compartment is exclusively meant for scan smart and that might not be useful always for daily use wide opening of this compartment makes us to keep limited things with extra care
if i were to rate this a week ago i would have given it high marks but after less than two months use , a small tear has developed along one of the seams i have searched the amazon site -lrb- sold by amazon -rrb- and ca n't find any way to resolve this problem as the return window closed two weeks ago aside from the tear i was really enjoying this purchase i have left my laptop in the bag at several airports and have not had any problems getting through security if it were not for this tear i 'd have probably given it # stars i would appreciate suggestions is this something i can somehow return as defective
compared with its price at $ # , i 'm satisfied with it it has many small pockets and i love that it is very well organized i would not pay more than $ # for it
not even close to fitting my # & # # ; asus gaming laptop i give credit for the nice design and quality though i understand it says fits most # & # # ; laptops but there was an easy # / # inches not even close to squeezing into the zipper
took this bad with us to hawaii , did lots of hiking and this was great the only complaint i have is that there could be less pockets right now , it seems like there are lots of shallow pockets that might be better served combining into a few larger pockets overall , very durable and easy to wear i would have liked a waist strap for the hiking my husband uses this as a work bag daily and loves it
had another swissgear backpack that the zipper kept coming off the track as i had an extended batter on my # inch laptop so it was a tight fit this backup is designed differently so i do n't run into the same issue however , there were more pockets/compartments on my other backpack that this one did n't have
i always liked swissgear items and this one is no different although it does n't have as much capacity or as many pockets , it is good for those quick trips in which you do n't carry a lot the zippers are fine for me and i have n't seen any defects it is very light and i like the <unk> finish plenty of padding for my # & # # ; widescreen laptop again , i would n't recommend this if you plan on filling it to the max every trip
i have owned this model for years now it is starting to rip on the seams close to the handle what i can <unk> is , if you leave your zippers open and get use to lifting it from one shoulder strap for long periods of time , the stress wears at the seams as i go shopping for a new backpack , i 'm now looking at how the design <unk> with the handle , since i know there are times when you pick it up that way with tsa precheck available , the see through pocket is not needed
i was looking for a backpack to use on a weekend trip to dc in an effort to avoid using my rolling suitcase my daughter has a swissgear backpack she 's been using for years and it still looks new , so i decided to try and either find the one she has , or one close to it in the same brand i found this one while i was n't going to bring my laptop , it does have a nicely padded section for one i only had two `` issues `` with this on my trip : # i think i overstuffed it and so one pocket 's zipper kept coming apart -lrb- nothing unzipping and <unk> it back up did n't fix -rrb- and # oh my god so many pockets which turned out to be a pain to open them all when my back was searched at the american history <unk> other than that , this backpack was very comfortable to wear , even with the ton of walking i did it was sturdy , handy , and it fit in the overhead bins on the plane with only a minimal effort of shoving : -rrb- -lrb- next time i really will pack less . i 'd definitely recommend this backpack
i got this backpack to basically carry a book or two and my laptop around campus i used this for about # years and it seemed to hold up flawlessly i have a # inch laptop that fits nicely into the compartment provided for your laptop there is plenty of room for a book and some note books there is also spots on the sides to hold # drinks it also seemed to distribute weight nicely , taken you put things in correctly , and never had a problem walking the mile or two from my car to class i never had a problem with the # years i used this backpack for college if you are looking for a backpack for school to carry around a laptop then this one is perfect
just writing the review upon receiving bag is nice , spacious , comfort while handling and wearing on the back . seems like water proof though i did not test it fits # inch laptop , also fits # pairs of dresses in the first compartment zips are a bit loose and not rigid but not saying that they might be broken had all the compartments as shown in the pic can be used while travelling for for trips which can carry all the daily
it is nice and very usefull i prefer that brand because it satisfy my expectation could be more innner pocket or easy out side pocket with velcro to put small devices would be perfect fast delivery was a
purchased as a replacement for a previous backpack of the same model the zipper broke on the old one , but this was caused largely by user error -lrb- <unk> , me -rrb- this is a very durable backpack that is perfect for me as a college student never realized how convenient it is to have a separate section for my laptop until i got this high-quality product with a pretty great discount price , too -lrb- $ # as of writing this -rrb-
- i went through airport security with it several times , and they are very happy to pass it through screening without taking the computer out - the backpack feels good and easy to carry even when it 's packed full - it has several inner pockets that ca n't be closed up -lrb- no zipper or velcro -rrb- , so everything i put in there finds itself tossed inside the bag in no particular order other than that , great backpack
this backpack is of a good quality if you 're looking for something with lots of pockets then this is the one for you i 've had this for over a year and it 's still great my only complaint is that it ca n't sit upright i have a much cheaper backpack that can
this bag fits my hp # `` nicely it is very well built and has lots of pockets the bottom of the bag has very good support the straps are well design so that its very comfortable to carry
great bag for hiking in yosemite or business trips it has two slots for a laptop , but it only needs one one is for quick access which is great , the other is for <unk> opening the <unk> for airport security so the laptop can stay in bag and not be put into airport tray either slot is great , just dont really need both built in anyway , great bag
i am very happy with the product i purchased it 's fits my needs perfectly and i fully recommend it to people who are transporting their laptops daily in their backpack
some people are complaining about the zippers on this swiss gear backpack but i 've never really had an issue with them i mean i 've used several types of backpacks throughout my life and the zippers suddenly falling apart and not working correctly is a popular problem of mine , but not in this particular case the actual compartments are just the right size , though perhaps a little more room would n't have hurt you can never have enough space overall , it works so i wo n't complain about these minor issues
this bag is comfortable to wear , and it holds quite a bit i practically live out of it on work days the laptop seems well protected , while i can still organize books and papers in other compartments i wo n't attest -lrb- yet -rrb- to the durability , since i 've only had it a few months , but it seems to be put together very well
i bought this for my husband as a christmas gift this is a well made and well thought out bag he seems to like it it 's not too bulky , yet holds his laptop and papers neatly i think he will really enjoy it more when he travels by plane for a business trip next month makes airport security so much easier
this unit was adequate , but i had purchased one previously for my # `` laptop by the same maker and the construction was much better i like it and it will serve the purpose
so far has seemed to be pretty tough , with a lot of decent room in the pockets holds my laptop securely as well as most of my other work essentials only complaint involves a couple of the zippers , which close as they should but need sometimes a little extra pull to do so
the zippers are so strong , the material is tough and stiff layers of <unk> just make it so easy to secure things in the right place the laptop compartment is the one which i love . # % recommended
fits my # in <unk> beautifully looks nice you would n't even know it 's a laptop case if you do n't look closely would be # stars but could use more compartment space for accessories if i could give it # . # stars i
it is a very good back pack for laptop it is convinient on shoulder but is a little bit heavy it has many useful compartments i desire inner pocket with zipper to keep my purse in the next version
i 'm having trouble finding a backpack that i can use to carry my wacom pro large drawing tablet this one has a nice pocket for it , but it sticks out about four inches above the backpack the features are fantastic , the pockets many and good solid zippers i just need it a bit longer
it was a good purchase not as good as my last swissgear backpack -lrb- that was stolen -rrb- , but it met my expectations update : # months of use and the rope broke apart
this backpack is great for travel it contains multiple compartments allowing easy access to all things packed the scansmart feature is most convenient i would highly recommend this sturdily constructed backpack
bought this for my husband the <unk> backpack he had last # years after reading all the negative reviews , i was a bit not so sure about the quality since his was broken and he needs one shortly , i still ordered it at a good price thinking if it goes wrong , i wo n't loose too much money the package arrived fast and the it is totally worth of the price it is hard material and lot of separated storage place the design is also nice my husband is over # cm , it is the right size we have not checked on the laptop size as his is only # inches and fits well
this is a great backpack i only rated it # stars because the padding for the back stays stiff for a while but it is a great backpack , it even has a key holder on the inside
this product is really great i love the space and the compartments the backpack is sturdy and comfortable the straps are easily adjustable and comfortable -lrb- although they do strain on shoulders a little bit , but that is probably because i fill it with my computer and lots of textbook ! a great buy
my # `` dell laptop only just barely fits into the zippered pocket several other reviewers had said it would fit with ease , but i would not go that far it fits , but you need to tug the zipper carefully to get it closed however , the backpack is very comfortable and looks sturdy shipping was very fast
this bag is really very good it has got lot of space and lot of pockets also the chain quality is also very good the only drawback of this is its handles they are not very cushioned so it hurts the shoulder when weight increases apart from that this bag is awesome
great to travel , with lots of separate compartments , as well as the scan smart addition only thing missing is a small zipped <unk> section for coins as in the targus backpack
i just received the backpack from amazon i love the fabric quality , and the straps are very sturdy in addition , the backpack is more spacious that it appears to be i have an ultrabook so the laptop compartment is a bit too spacious , but the padding helps prevent the shock i just wish it had some other small compartments inside the main compartment , but that is n't a big issue
this is the second bag i have of this model had my first one for a year , then my wife decided to take it , so i got this one still love it
this is a must have product if you fly a lot this case allows you to unzip and lay it flat , so that you can go through airport security much quicker i would recommend this to anyone
i am using this back pack for work and college and is doing great ! not even a single hole on it and i really am no carefull at all with
i bought this pack by mistake , but it is a very useful pack and i will be keeping it it is well-made , very functional and it appears that a lot of thought went into the design
i got my bag in the mail this morning , and after playing around with it a little bit , i think its pretty awesome i 'm a busy college student and i have found it to be able to fit my laptop , books , ipod and monster energy drink all at once it also has a tablet pouch i have n't been able to use because i do n't own one , but it definitely looks like i have room to fit it there is also a cool clip on the inside that attaches to my keys and i can easily detach them with one button and reattach them back to the interior of my bag so i dont lose them i 'd say buy this bag if you want a good one it also comes with a tag for a # year warranty , so i should be good until i finish college
holds my work laptop -lrb- # `` -rrb- with no issue my wives studio # is a little tight on the zipper plenty of pockets and room to throw a change of clothes for an overnight trip it 's not to big or too small i am a traveling consultant and get pretty picky about what i want to drag around

i have always had cheap backpacks my whole life , and i finally decided to actually spend the money to get a nice one best decision ever i absolutely love this backpack it is well constructed , has pockets for everything i need , and more the only thing i sort of wish it had would be a pocket for a cell phone on the strap , but that is just a minor detail overall , awesome purchase , and totally worth the money

i truly enjoy this back pack i have n't purchased one in many years saw the reviews , and thought i 'd give it a go have a # inch laptop which will fit snugly inside the area for it what caught me off guard was the protection strap that 'll keep it in place what did that was the fact that is is adjustable i did n't expect for it to be fully removable , but being that it is , is a useful feature constructed out of good material , plenty of space to put all of my things and looks great too
i bought this bag a few months ago , and am very happy with it it is well made , and fits my laptop and accessories well i have traveled with it several times , and the scansmart construction has been great for quickly <unk> airport security there are plenty of special pockets for electronics , water bottles , sunglasses , etc . i highly recommend this bag for students or travelers i purchased mine at sam 's club for $ #

after spending years using cheap -lrb- and often free -rrb- backpacks , i decided to actually put a little money down and get a backpack that could do it all this pack holds my laptop -lrb- a thick gaming laptop -rrb- , my books for school , and all the accessories that go with i 've taken it camping i 've taken it on airplanes -lrb- and the little clear window that shows the laptop is a great addition , the tsa guy even said so -rrb- i 've taken it to school on a daily basis i 've yet to find a single fraying stitch , or damaged zipper or worn piece of fabric bottom line , if you 're looking for a jack of all <unk> back pack , this may be what you need

i bought this backpack for my daughter in high school the backpacks that are marketed to school aged kids tend to be smaller and less durable in my experience i have rarely seen those type backpacks last beyond a single school year this is a backpack that she loves she has had it just over # months . it still looks like new and she still loves it she does not use it to transport a laptop , so i can not speak to that functionality , but i can tell you that she is hard on it and everything is holding up well so far it has held up so well that i ordered one for my son also

i had an older targus laptop backpack that was finally falling apart after years of abuse they no longer make that model , and besides i wanted a bag that was more airport friendly after a lot of comparison shopping , i decided to give this bag a try when i first received it i was disappointed that some of the features i enjoyed with my old bag were not included but after actually loading the bag up and taking it on a few trips , it 's actually better for my needs than my old bag and it fits better under the airline seat , an important feature since i almost exclusively fly in the smaller regional jets i even got nice comments from tsa agents at two separate airports and as a extra bonus the bag easily swallows my fully loaded cocoon <unk> ipad bag

i love the pack , it 's a really good size has plenty of pockets , which sometimes i forget which pocket i put things in the only problem is the edging started coming off one of the straps within # months of having it the stitching was n't perfect so it came loose i need the bag for school or else i 'd have sent it back to have it replaced i 'll definitely be buying another swiss guard when i need a new one , this time though i 'll make sure to check the stitching extra carefully

i have been very pleased with this backpack it has a great deal of room , lots of compartments to separate items , and the laptop compartment is great for easy access when going through airport security i also used the smaller , front pocket for my quart bag of liquids that have to be placed separately in a bin through security as with any bag the more i put in the heavier it became , but the staps have a good amount of padding which made carrying the weight easier i use the bag daily now for work and it works very well for carrying my laptop , files , planner , purse , etc . i would definitely recommend this bag
