i 'm not exactly tough on my backpacks -lrb- especially those that store my expensive apple laptop -rrb- , but everything appears to be of quality material and craftsmanship after a year and more than # vacation trips , there are no lose threads , broken zippers , or anything else broken or about to break i love the look , as it 's not your typical bulky book bag it does n't have as much storage space as your typical high school book bag , but i do n't need to carry that much anymore
who ever thought that the best backpack brand is made next door to you ? ? it 's a great backpack , the best , n & <unk> ; <unk> <unk> i have tried them all , everki , thule , swiss army , <unk> , north face , in case , ogio , sierra ... by far this one is my favorite brand and backpack . <unk> you guys , no really thank you ... when i spend a good amount of money and the product it 's worth every penny , it makes me happy . amazon , as always thank you for a great service
i 've bought two of these because i lost the first one the first one i would have given # stars because i love the pattern , it seemed to provide good protection , and it fit my asus eee pc perfectly i give the second one # star because they 've reduced the size -lrb- without changing the description , as far as i can tell -rrb- and i ca n't zip it with the eee pc in it i am terribly disappointed and will be returning it
i both this to further protect my ipad the only issue that i have is that it is a very <unk> fit for my ipad and <unk> case for ipad i know that without the case there would be no issue but the purpose of the sleeve was to protect the ipad with case when it is packed in a bag it serves its purpose but would have liked an extra # inch or so
i got this case for my ipad it fits the ipad itself but wo n't fit if you have a protective case on your ipad i got this to take my ipad with me when i travel but to use it i have to take it out of the case that protects it wish it was just a tad bigger it works great for the kindle even when the kindle is in its protective case
not a big fan of the neoprene material , but it seems that is about all that 's available anymore the colors are very bright and vibrant , and it fits my ipad # very well not snug , still room to spare
i have the ipad # with the logistics magnetic keyboard cover they work great together but i wanted a cover to fit both to keep them from getting banged around in my purse this works perfectly they both fit great and it 's all the protection needed
i like my case very much it fits my ipad and love the colors as well , i do n't like the softness as it does not protect the ipad from receiving damage they shall make it more durable to protect our <unk>
i love my red flower sleeve the tablet sleeve is well crafted the colors is bold and pretty i can slip this in my purse <unk> not have to worry about it
this sleeve is well made , it is not too thick and the size is good for my ipad the only negative is that i can not fit the charger along with the ipad in this sleeve
i bought this backpack because of all the good reviews it receive this month is one year since i bought this backpack and it has already broken . the handle on the top started to tear around # months ago now inbetween the # and # zipper there is a hole from another tear right in the middle of the pocket i am quite surprised that it can even tear like that at least the handle i can understand back in college i spent $ # on one backpack and it literally lasted me # years till the last month when the zipper gave out this backpack cost me $ # and it only last for one year
i had about $ # worth of amazon credit which is why i was willing to pay so much for this backpack in less than # months , its beginning to fall apart the zippers start catching the fabric underneath as well
oh bag makers you <unk> over nice details like ipad pockets , you add velcro in all the right places , you <unk> over how the straps adjust yet consistently , in pack after pack , you overlook the most basic and important area of protection for the most expensive item the bag is intended to carry : the bottom of the laptop ! do they actually test these bag with real laptops it 's <unk> the mind to think they would n't be <unk> at an <unk> <unk> when thinly protected macbook aluminum meets hard pavement all it would take would be # cents of padding sewn into the bottom of the bag , and yet , they ca n't seem to make that effort two stars subtracted from an otherwise great bag for this glaring error
lots of pockets , which is great , but fitting my laptop , <unk> and lunch into is a bit of a stretch it is very durable , which is nice considering how much it cost next time i probably wo n't buy online i 'll take all of my & # # ; stuff & # # ; with me to make sure it all fits with a little room to spare
so far , after # month of use , i like it it is n't exactly what i wanted but it works well for now the material and the zippers seem like they are made out of a low quality material i do like the amount of room in the laptop area -lrb- not using it with a # `` laptop -rrb- the pockets are ok , i wish there was more area for pens , but i 'm kinda a pen freak over all good not great update after # . # years of daily use still not great , just ok , have had it fixed once for zipper coming un-sewn i would definitly buy my next backpack with a tablet pocket , this one works great all the other comments i made previously still apply
this is a mostly solid bag i use it with my # inch mbp well protected on the sides and back my only gripe is that there is very little bottom protection -- the most vulnerable place not sure what they were thinking with this design
i bought this backpack hoping that it would fix my asus g # s -lrb- many reviews said it does -rrb- when i received the item it looked pretty nice and durable however once i tried to put my laptop in there was no room for anything else and it did n't zip up i ca n't say anything else about it because i returned it right away but if you have a bulkier laptop like me this probably is n't the backpack to get
kind of small and does not hold much stuff not recommended for school when you also have to include textbooks and notebooks only purchase if you are planning to carry a laptop along with # books
after wearing out numerous backpacks from targus and one very expensive back pack from booq , i gave this pack a try the overall quality appears to be superior to targus packs at the same price point yet , the design with the & # # ; wings & # # ; is less functional moreover , as a <unk> # & # # ; inch laptop bag , the largest compartment is smaller than on targus <unk> booq # & # # ; bags , which are a bit more upscale , can be even flatter than this one where this <unk> a problem is using the bag to haul large items or groceries all this being said , case logic has fallen into the trap many other bag makers have -- too many pockets , zippers , <unk> at the expense of large central compartment
based on the dimensions i was expecting a bag that was around # in # the only info on the net are the dimensions - # . # x # . # x # . # the card attached to the bag when i received it had the exact info : # . # in # - more than # % smaller than expected i was looking for a computer bag that i could also put clothes in for a weekend airline trip this one is not quite big enough my old bag holds a weekends worth of clothes but almost does n't close with a # . # inch notebook inside so , if you 're looking for a weekend bag that fits a computer , this is n't it :
good for carrying my laptop and everything however , the right side strap adjuster plastic where you can adjust the length of the straps broke and i had to tape it up not great , but it fits my purpose
after almost a year of buying this backpack i 'm happy to say i am still using this item on a daily basis i will recommend case logic products to anyone for its quality and pricing
it 's exactly what i was looking for roomy , big enough for the # . # laptop i have , and lots of pockets for stowing stuff away i especially like the <unk> on the side that you can stick a rolled up jacket into very nice for traveling the most important thing that helped me choose this bag was all the pictures <unk> all the different features it had somewhere around a dozen , while others just had a couple that quickly made this product the <unk> to compare to , and i probably ended up buying it because of it
the room for the laptop is plenty , the remaining space is not big though i liked the material i tried it also at low raining weather and was ok i did not like the fact that is kind of big without offering a lot of space for other things , but i would definitely buy it again
the built quality and design details are great overall wish for more compartments for small items though it needed more padding at base of laptop compartment but it is easy to put in some bubble <unk> there
this bag protects my laptop well except on the bottom no padding on the bottom and thats the only downfall of this bag all the compartments and <unk> make it perfect for carrying around campus and having everything i need right there in one bag but beware of the lack of padding on the bottom of the bag
this backpack has been really great it has plenty of room and i like that it has a lot of different pockets i had a problem with the stitching coming apart about a week after i got it , but amazon replaced it very quickly and the new one has worked flawlessly
pack works great has plenty of room can store all my stuff with ease still have not found a use for the holding flaps on the sides made of good materials it seems
let 's face it , if you bought a # `` laptop you were n't exactly <unk> on minimizing size , and the case logic # . # `` laptop backpack is no exception to that rule excellent build quality , many compartments for storage and all your accessories , lots of thick padding -lrb- although strangely not on the bottom of the laptop compartment -rrb- but in many airplanes , i have found this too big to fit under your seat , although the size of the laptop itself is always a challenge with that anyway i 've gone through a series of backpacks , of varying quality and the caselogic definitely <unk> near the top in terms of build quality i would consider it equal to my trusty <unk> , at a fraction of the cost
i have a number of laptop backpacks and most are very good my favorite backpack is a # . # inch swissgear bag which cost about # more than this one it has a lot of space , many pockets , a strap system that reduces wear on the back and an incredible build quality this bag , made by case logic , is also very good , has lots of pockets , is comfortable to wear but lacks some key features i need i suffer from a bad back and this case simply does have any special system that protects my back , it is a straightforward backpack with normal straps it does have padding , but the straps are just normal without the padding as per the swissgear bag it has a number of pockets and the build quality is good , it just does not compare to the swissgear in terms of quality and strap system this is a good backpack , but swissgear makes a better laptop backpack i would recommend this because it is quite inexpensive and good quality , but its not the best bag out there
- lots of room for a variety of peripherals - comfortable - plenty of padding - decent pricecons - barely fits my # . # `` asus rog laptop ; better now that i 've had a chance to stretch it out a bit -lrb- you 've really got to be careful buying <unk> for gaming laptops online . # . # `` definitely does n't mean _ all _ # . # `` laptops . - tablet pocket in same pouch as laptop ; tight squeeze for thousands of dollars of electronics if you have both - not sure what they were thinking with the chest strap ; seems useless , but can be removed
i have a # & # # ; macbook pro for work and needed a new backpack i wanted something professional and more for business use than for hiking this bag looks great and the quality appears top-notch ... comparable to many of the more expensive backpacks holding a notepad , ms surface tablet , and macbook pro # & # # ; - this thing distributes the weight and is very comfortable in transport the velcro <unk> on the adjustable straps are a nice touch to keep everything tucked in and clean i was slightly disappointed at the arrangement of the organizers in the smaller pocket the places for pens and accessories is a little tight and leaves a little room for improvement overall this bag has been working well and holds everything i 've thrown at it
robust and very well made , wish one of the side ` pockets ' are more opened -lrb- mesh -rrb- for a wet umbrella instead of <unk> pocket which allows water to pool the way it was designed with <unk> is really nice , they secure the dry umbrella or water bottle much better than just mesh pockets alone i would give it # . # stars with this little exception have not tried to test it 's ` water resistance ' capabilities yet but the material looks heavy-duty enough to repel water will update if this is a problem
this is a really nice , light weight bag pack , i am a graduate student and wanted to use it for school but it 's not made to fit books and note books in it it is however great for traveling because you can stuff a lot of clothing in it
great thing about this bag , is that it rides flat when you use just one shoulder i often carry my stuff and do n't go in full backpack mode this bag is comfortable , lots of places for stuff , fits my large laptop and i 'd give it a good all round review
this is a great backpack very comfortable when loaded up that pads in all of the contact points , make this a great option for caring your notebook , and accessories it has strong zippers well located i really love the secured storage under the lower back pad the only reason that i would not give this # stars is because of the lack of padding on the bottom if you were to plop this backpack with your note book down , i could see that damage could result of course no one plans to just drop your bag with their notebook in it , but you know things happen i simply rolled a face towel up and placed it on the inside bottom for added security , and now it is a # star i would buy this again , and would recommend this to others .
this is a great backpack i bought it to replace an older backpack i loved this one is way better and it holds my # `` laptop with extract room it has lots of packets and it is well organized the one thing i do not like is the zipper for the laptop it is a one size zipper , so you can not use a lock to keep your laptop safe
this is a very good backpack , and the description in the site was exactly what i got i bought it to replace an older case logic backpack i had -lrb- can not remember the model number -rrb- that served me very well for many years it is well built , with nice features like a chest strap , and it is not excessively large , like other backpacks that try to fit even # `` models my mac book pro # `` fits nicely and it feels secure my only reason not to give it five stars is that the notebook compartiment could be better padded at the bottom in my previous one , the notebook fitted in a large padded pouch in the compartiment , so it would not touch the bottom of the backpack itself besides that , the bottom was also padded with this one , when i put it on the floor the first few times i felt that the notebook was not been as isolated from the impact as i expected i ended up fitting a piece of packaging foam to the bottom of the compartment , and that solved the problem if that was included in the design , i 'd give it five stars , no doubt
i like the design very much so many pockets and it helps organizing things a lot i can put my ipad perfectly in the designed pocket and other big things in another pocket while small things go to the front pocket the reason i only give it four star is because my husband complained that it does n't match his back very well , not very comfortable
this product is very high quality , it expands nicely when needed but also is not too bulky if there are only a few items in it the extra padding in areas makes for a great fit the chest strap could be useful to some , but not for our need this was a great product at a great price ... very happy with our purchase
has a laptop sleeve i use the back pack for school it 's got great padding and a decent amount of pockets everything is zippered it 's perfect size can easily fit a # . # inch screened laptop it 's also not too big it 's of great quality and is a great looking pack
this backpack is fabulous ! ! it easily fits my # inch macbook pro along with the power cord in the laptop compartment and it fits my two college textbooks and # notebooks it is very comfortable
have only had the bag for a week yet it is a very strong design with many pockets and the # . # laptop it was purchases for fits perfectly it is not a flashy bag and it does not appear bulky yet it has plenty of storage space
this backpack is perfect for my son ... a college student he is able to fit his large laptop and all the materials needed for multiple classes it is very comfortable for him to wear as well it is also very easily expandable and then <unk> out as needed
i got this to replace my aging swiss gear backpack it is also water resistant -lrb- it really is ! -rrb- which was another reason why i got it case logic make good quality products i have a laptop messenger bag from them that works really well the backpack was made to be water resistant and is well padded for comfort i comfortably fits my asus laptop and has room for a tablet if you need it a great backpack and it was a great buy !
i love this backpack it holds everything i need it too a daily load for me is my macbook pro # inch and its charger , # college textbooks , planner , one notebook , sunglasses , water bottle , beats by <unk> <unk> studio , and all my other cables i have had this backpack for # - # months and i have put this backpack through a lot and i have yet to see any wear or tearing on this backpack i love this backpack mostly because of the compression straps it can be a small or big backpack when needed i also use the compression straps to hold my umbrella or a pair of gym shorts i also use this backpack for vacation or just to hold something so if your in need of a backpack look no further
i needed a back pack that was big enough for a # & # # ; lap top but that could also fit my books this has great padding and the straps are shaped so that it makes it easy carry
is the perfect choice when you travel , you have alot of space and you can organize easily with the bags and pockets also is very confortable when you carried
we just returned from a three week trip through <unk> europe this backpack functioned as my carry-on it 's very well made , very light , sturdy , well-organized , and , it 's like the <unk> - it seems bigger on the inside than it is on the outside it 's not flashy , which i like for travel i mostly had it tightened down to the smallest dimensions and it still looked good it was good travel `` insurance `` to know that i could have fit lots more into it if i needed the space
i was finding a backpack to replace my good old samsonite this one fits all my needs the size is perfect i love those pockets for everything : phone , tablet , laptop , water bottle the only thing i do n't like is the strap around the chest which i find useless , and there is no easy way to get rid of it but i think that 's minor
i just ordered a dell # . # & # # ; laptop and needed a bag it will fit in and yet have plenty of room for additional items when i travel love this backpack the padding makes it very comfortable to wear and the different sized compartments are all various sizes and perfect for different things the tablet pocket and sunglasses holder are great i can highly recommend this item
first , before i talk about the positives , i 'll mention the one potential negative space , this backpack is made for hauling a laptop along with a few other <unk> if you are looking for a backpack that can carry much more than that , then look for the larger size case logic now the positives i purchased this backpack because the one i had was too big and had superfluous straps and buckles with the case logic <unk> # . # -inch backpack , i can carry my macbook pro , ipad , headphones , and multiple <unk> and be able to store them away in a compact space i think it is ideal for travel as it easily fits in storage areas for <unk> the design is simple and functional , without any excessive padding or straps the padding it has is enough to keep your devices safe while also not becoming bulky
i 've been doing a lot of traveling by train lately and i can fit just about all i need in this roomy backpack it seems much more sturdy than my previous backpack that was another brand and lasted only two years
holds a lot without the bulk i was using the swiss synergy back pack before i got this one and i realized synergy was way too bulky in fact , i could barely fit into a bathroom <unk> at school with it on i did n't even put much in it just # binders yet it was heavy n felt like a tank on my back i am # ' # `` girl so i thought this case logic back pack was perfect i could put the same stuff in it from my old synergy backpack and it was lighter and not bulky i no longer felt like a i was wearing a tank on my back very happy with purchase
case logic seemed a little generic , but this model has outlasted several others that cost considerably more i carry laptop , tablet , and a bunch of <unk> tools -lrb- <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> cables , flash drives , and an external hdd -rrb- in mine , and it gets the job done i have had this for over # months , and it is as good as new
this is wonderful it 's also one of the few bookbags that can actually hold my # . # inch laptop and have room for more and there are so many pockets , it 's incredible . very sturdy , too besides having a ton of pockets , this bookbag makes a great pillow i do n't know how many times this semester i 've fallen asleep with my laptop in front of me and the padding of the bookbag under my head that 's how much padding there is
this bookbag has been with me for over a year now and there is no sign of any wear or tear the bookbag itself has enough space to fit whatever i need throughout the day while still being comfortable on my back also has options to slim down when traveling light , and is overall the best backpack i have ever owned
i have a # & # # ; macbook pro and it hugs it perfectly there are plenty of compartments for peripherals , ipad , accessories , college school books , and anything else you can fit in there the only down side is that there is no cushion at the bottom of the bag i super glued some foam to the bottom so that was an easy fix it 's tough , rugged , and definitely worth the estimate
i 'm pleased with my purchase and i think i <unk> upon a good backpack my laptop fits well inside it and the bag is not as bulky as others that i 've seen from stores there 's a belt to compress the bag and another belt that run across the chest that can be adjusted up or down to make carrying more convenient
i love the backpack - great construction , comfortable and wears well i would buy this items again i switched from using a briefcase style computer case this is convenient and allows my hands to be free to carry other things
a million pockets and compartment , really light i used it on my vacation i fit in it # beach towels , <unk> , extra swimming suits , # books , snacks , wallet , cellphone , sunglasses case and the list goes on really comfortable on the back and the shoulders it was kind of <unk> but definitely but you definitely get your money 's worth just watch this video review , that 's what made me buy this bag -lsb- ... -rsb- i intent to be using it for my laptop as well as a plane carry on bag
i 've been using this bag for about a year now and it <unk> looks brand new it has plenty of pockets , but no so many that you 'll loose stuff in it the build quality is great and the <unk> is strong it fits my # & # # ; alienware easily plus a tablet , binder , mouse , gaming controller , headset , glasses , phone , various cables , camera , lunch , and more
i love this thing it was a little larger than i was expecting which is ok since i carry my laptop , ipad , ipod , amd various tools being a it support guy and traveling from office to office all day long i needed to make sure i had something sturdy and this seems to fit the bill there are so many pockets i sometimes forget where i put things love it and highly recommend this purchase
i recently bought a # `` xps laptop from dell despite the size and thickness -lrb- # in -rrb- of the laptop , it fit comfortably into the case logic backpack the backpack is well designed and manufactured with sturdy materials it has an elegant design and is not bulky what i like best about the backpack is that it keeps the laptop from moving around as you walk it does n't swing against your back with every step
i found this to be amazing , holds my gs # 's , my lp # headphones , xbox controllers and <unk> # with no issues and room to spare feels incredibly sturdy and very adjustable , time will tell if it holds up but for now consider me impressed compared to # $ + backpacks this honestly feels like the better choice both in quality and design huge kudos to case logic
functional and comfortable i use it as a to and from work bag plenty of room for a large toshiba # `` widescreen laptop and other items i need for work great bag for the price
it fits everything and it looks amazing and simple . i can fit in two bottle <unk> , a laptop , a tablet and the best part if lots of pockets . its amazing makes everything organized
i bought this laptop backpack for my boyfriend as a gift he uses it on a daily basis to carry his laptop and school books and it 's still holding up well the padding is sufficient to protect a laptop
my brother loved this laptop backpack he says , & # # ; it holds all my stuff ; cords , small dvd player , laptop and even dvd 's and more junk ! & # # ; shipping was on time and easy transaction
exactly what i was looking for big enough for my computer or ipad and still enough room for clothes , paperwork etc . pockets and pouches on backpack are easy to get to and should make my first flight with the backback convenient thru gates so far i 'm very pleased with my purchase
it arrived before the promised date and was perfect in every way i only paid a third of what the exact same item costs in stores or on line <unk> from the logic company ... in short , it was outstanding ! !
after # years on the road , i wore out my last backpack and the zipper failed i was looking for a rugged and professional looking item which would not look inappropriate to bring into a business meeting this product fits the bill perfectly it appears to be made for the long haul , has lots of convenient compartments and pockets , and is comfortable to wear it fit my # . # & # # ; laptop perfectly , with plenty of capacity for my ipad , various cables and power supplies , and other miscellany if this fits your needs , go for it
i love this backpack great pockets , thick computer protection roomy yet organized <unk> awsome pockets love the front vertical zipper for easy access and the top phone pocket is really nice this is my favorite back pack im in medical school with tons of books and in class all day so i need room for lunches as well as books strong material and professional looking
at first i was skeptical that it would fit my msi gs # . # laptop and my # . # asus transformer prime tablet when the backpack came , not only was i able to fit both my gs # laptop and tablet but i was able to put my wife 's # inch laptop in there too the quality of the logic <unk> # is as comparable to a swissgear backpack i do not work for either company , i 'm just a happy , satisfied consumer i would recommend this backpack to all
over the years i have bought many different backpacks the last one i bought only lasted me a year so i decided to buy this one even thou it was a little more than what i would normally pay for a backpack but when i got in the mail it was awesome it is one of those things were you know your you got what you paid for the backpack is very well padded for your one 's computer , the extra pocket for my ipad is also awesome i use to worry about damaging my ipad every time i set my backpack down , but with this one it has a nice pocket that is lifted from the bottom of the backpack i would <unk> recommend this backpack to just about everyone it is made of good material and is very roomy best backpack i ever bought ! !
lots of padding on the sides would be careful about dropping it with a laptop inside as the bottom lacks sufficient padding , but not a deal breaker all in all a very good deal for the price
i 'm a big fan of case logic i 've owned a couple of their bags in the past for my slr and i think they work hard to `` get `` how people actually use bags and backpacks before releasing them this one is top-notch i can basically fit a # `` macbook pro , the charger , an ipad # , a smaller macbook air , and a bunch of other support items to go with it , all quite comfortably in this backpack plenty of pockets , zippers , space , etc . the fit and finish on case logic bags is always excellent the material they use use is water resistant , i never really worry about running through rain to get somewhere with this bag -lrb- or any of the others i 've owned from them -rrb- another great case from case logic , you ca n't really go wrong with any of their cases
i have a dell xps # l # x laptop it is fairly bulky compared to most modern laptops and has a # cell extended battery with a large foot protruding from the bottom it fits in the backpack just fine , so i really have no idea what some others are using when they say # . # & # # ; does n't fit backpack seems stylish and sturdy enough for me used it today and it is noticeable <unk> to carry around than my old backpack that i 've been using for the last # years this one also has a lot of padding for the back , which i 'm more likely to care about when i use my backpack to take a nap at school plenty of storage space , for typical <unk> things do n't expect to go backpacking around europe with this or anything i 'll update if the thing falls apart or something , but right now it 's exactly what i was expecting . and maybe a bit more
i love this backpack it fits my macbook pro perfectly as a young female working in manhattan , it 's moderately stylish and unassuming as well the padding is stellar , and the number of pockets is perfect
i bought this bag for my hp g # . # inch laptop , to carry with around # books and # folders every day for classes the bag has plenty of space for my needs , and i could easily double what i carry and still be comfortable due to the bag 's design the laptop compartment is the key reason why i purchased this bag , and it is everything i had hoped for my laptop fits in the compartment very well , leaving space for my cables , there was room for a bigger laptop if you have above a # . # inch , so this is still a good investment the bag has pockets everywhere , convenient for storing pens and notes i especially like the secret pocket hidden in the lower back side of the bag , i can store my wallet or keys and conveniently get to them if i need them
this pack is being used in the elements with many electronics and tools it is comfortable and water resistant we live in oregon and it rains , a lot , for a long time my husband and i are <unk> pleased with the price , quality and support this case logic pack provides him in his travels thanks a bunch !
good quality with lots of room for all your electronic gadgets and a pocket for cards bought it as a gift and the recipient was using it the next day he seems very happy with it and says it 's more comfortable than the one he was using i had not seen a bag made for apple products elsewhere and when i read the specs , i knew this was the one
excellent backpack ! my labtop , ipad , iphone , all inside ! very very very good ; - -rrb- i 've got others backpack , but these it 's the one , simply the one backpack , all things are perfectly safe
great to use it i want to write the review after i use it properly so here i am i use this bag for # months from now i used it in snow , rain , hot sun and the colour did not fade initially i was worried about the bottom bad thing , but it works perfectly fine i would recommend this product to any of my friend now that the price is also decreased , it is worth buying it
we bought this as a gift for our <unk> , <unk> son-in-law in california the bag easily & safely holds his laptop and several files when he heads out to a meeting he will either sling it over his shoulder and drop it into the car or hook it on his back when he <unk> to work and he looks cool when he uses it !
this backpack is great i live in seattle and i 'm in grad school , so i could n't have asked for a better backpack to fit my # `` laptop in while i bike to class in the rain also , there is so <unk> room in this bag and the zippers are high quality ; you can pack it so full without wondering if the zipper will burst it 's a good looking backpack that makes it good for school and <unk> too i 'd recommend to everyone
very solid design barely fit my asus laptop , but that is because those rog laptops are shaped differently than other laptops of the same size has a great number of pockets and the zippers have a solid feel to them
i was looking for laptop backpack for my dell # . # laptop i was knowing only one option of swiss gear i am a female so was not very interested to purchase that as the weight is almost # pounds mean time i bought samsonite from ebags and it was not at all good after # months search , got to know about this model after looking at it , i was very sure that it is suitable for me this bag is amazing ... nice padding for laptop and require room for ur clothes , books etc . good to carry this for weekend trips i am very happy on my purchase and recommend it for others too
i absolutely love this laptop/tablet backpack i have traveled all over europe with this backpack carry a large # & # # ; laptop and an ipad , clothing and misc stuff provides great protection for laptop and ipad backpack has <unk> very well no sign of wear hidden pocket great for passports , cash , etc . can hold water bottles in the side pockets easy to put on , easy access the various compartments handle on top very useful would definitely purchase again
this backpack is great it is made extremely well the stitching makes it durable it holds my # . # `` lt plus ipad it has a pocket dedicated to tablets it also has a few more that could # x or # x our tablet <unk> area i havent found any faults with this backpack
just buy this backpack it 's very good quality of zippers & materials plenty of pockets everywhere - excellent design i can insert my large laptop no problem - including my full size ipad i have plenty of extra room for paperwork , etc . looks very durable and will certainly help me boarding airplanes / fitting under seats , etc . i am very pleased with this product - highly recommended
we took this to vegas with us , and it was more than capable of hauling all of my computer stuff -lrb- cooler , laptop , mouse , games -rrb- in a neatly packed and safe <unk> it also seems to be very well built , and the straps and zippers work well
i bought this as a birthday present for my husband he 's a designer , and often carrying his mac book pro # & # # ; all over the city he loved the bag -- it 's sleek , not bulky looking , and clearly well made fits a lot more than just a laptop
not functional for the purpose i bought it for , the straps holding the flap closed slip out of the plastic tabs and allow contents to spill out i purchased bag for weekender for work , laptop and clothes for # days . not everything fits the bag is large enough to contain the contents if the layout was better
i like the bag because it hold my large laptop , however i am a short girl , very short like # short it is very large and will look a bit funny but it works well
this backpack works out perfectly for my boyfriends # . # in laptop and all his school books it is very durable and has <unk> of space for anything kinda reminds me of a mini hiking bag
been looking for a bag for my asus laptop for months now every bag that i tried may of just barely fit the laptop in it with room for nothing else but this page is plenty big enough for my laptop and plenty of other items
a good idea , but poorly made the quality of the bag is cheap my straps began to tear after just one month and i am in the process of trying to return it with no luck thus
the zipper on mine broke within a month first one side and then the other just broke while zipping this really sucks because i have now purchased four different items from <unk> , only to have them all break within a month this bag is pretty alright otherwise
this is a nice backpack very big , with lots of space i 've had no problems with the zippers so far could have more internal pockets nice padding but some sewing of the internal <unk> are off , no big deal , but could be better great buy for the price
