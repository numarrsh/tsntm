i was surprised to get a good quality , stylish case like this for a reasonable price , but this delivered i love the way it looks -lrb- could function as so many things - professional , <unk> , <unk> - ha -rrb- , and it works well
<unk> color ! fits the macbook pro # -lrb- non <unk> -rrb- perfectly . it does n't come out of the straps when i move my screen . it is a great case for men and women i was so excited when i got it in the mail was exactly what i wanted ! so much better than a plastic cover
really like this cover i feel that it does a very good job of protecting my macbook air & it looks good better than the clear case i had on it it not a book book , but it looks & works great for the price
this is a very <unk> -lsb- product for your mac book pro saves it from scratches but after like a month , some dust particles started to hold into it . overall a good product and
this is a great case very well made i was concerned because ive been getting lots of scratches and previous cases trapped the dirt in between - no such problems with this
i choose five stars because i truly love it my package came on time , it was package right and did n't have any damages it fits perfectly and i use it on a daily basis i 've gotten alot of compliments surprisingly so i 'm looking to purchase the black one now that i have brown i thought it would be a cheap looking replica of leather , but it looks very sturdy and tough so , we will see i have nothing negative to say , i will be purchasing my next case very soon yes , i recommend this case
i have the newest macbook pro # & # # ; and this case is perfect it looks great and does the job , i have owned it a few weeks and have not had any problems fits perfect , access to usb ports and such on the sides , and durable if i ever get a new laptop , i would buy this case again , or another case from this seller
this was n't very expensive but it looks more expensive than it is it 's professional looking and very suitable for the office environment protects the outside of the computer but does n't have any protection <unk> the wrist area still , i really like it takes a few months to start zipping it up more comfortably feels like a bit of a tight squeeze at the beginning but it works just fine
premium looking case without the premium price , i was quite shocked at how great this case looked when i received it , holding up fine after one month , let 's see
this case is just like how i like my -lrb- insert preference here : snug fit , classy on the outside , soft on the inside i like that it 's not only practical but stylish too
this is a very good case it keeps my laptop safe and it has a nice smooth feel to it its not real leather but sure feels like it and at a great price
the hardshell case was way too small for my macbook pro # & # # ; i am not satisfied at all everything else is fine minus the screen protector and the hard case which was the main reason i bought this
everything fit except the case cover ordered it in october but did not put it on computer just tried it out this month and now ca n't return it partially my <unk> because i ordered it on line and should of tried it out . $ # . # down the drain make sure you put it on your computer as soon as you get it
this was awful , it did n't fit my computer and it was so expensive such a waste of money for the case , & the sceen protector was to big how dose it make sense for the case not to fit but the sceen protector to big awful i do n't recommend at
i ordered this package simply because it was a great deal but i was extremely disappointed i finally got the package and was excited to protect my new mac so after ripping the package open i immediately tried to put it on the mac , only to find that it was about an inch too small
i wanted this for my new laptop and i am extremely disappointed some people are complaining that the case does n't fit right , but mine fits fine , but it is made cheaply and it had flaws in the plastic -lrb- also something that looks like dirt ? -rrb- the keyboard did not fit properly and would not lay flat it is extremely thin , crinkly , and very bad quality i am looking for a better product and hope to return it
case and cover are very pretty , gave my macbook a nice look the mouse has n't worked more than # minutes each time i 've tried it no matter was brand batteries i try do n't work long like there is some moisture or <unk> inside the mouse is very flimsy
i bought the # piece set i recommend buying a case from here or somewhere else the screen protector is a <unk> the nylon pouch is pointless and they did n't send the usb adapter that makes the mouse wireless high <unk> is simply by a case for however much you would spend on this package cause you 'll b buying it all over again anyways
the keyboard cover has pink paint on the border due to improper storage i reported it to customer service , but my request has not been honored if amazon decides to fix this problem , then my rating will be five stars please fix my keyboard asap
pro 's : the top and bottom cover fit great and the key board cover fits and stays in place well con 's : the bottom cover was cracked when i received it on the side were the vents the screen protector was not even close to the correct size the neoprene jacket has a funny smell that does n't seem to go away and i have not used the mouse yet but it is very thin and light weight
i like the colors , but not sure this is going to provide a lot of protection the case is very thin ; the keyboard just lays on the keys and you can accidentally move it without realizing it the mouse is a piece of junk the mouse board is a piece of junk on a positive note , it 's a nice color did i say you can pick from a bunch of different colors yep - that 's the only pro
the case and screen protector work great the sleeve is very cheap and has a very sloppy fit what i thought was a matching mouse protective cover was actually an extremely cheap and useless replacement mouse why would i want an extremely cheap mouse , when i just paid $ # for an official apple wireless mouse very misleading ! and the black keyboard cover is useless it does n't allow for the light <unk> from the keys themselves to show through the cover so it 's just like the lighted keys are n't lighted anymore due to the poor quality of the cover however , i would recommend the clear keyboard cover , because it fits the keys well and would allow novice <unk> to see the lighted keys in the dark
the pink color on the laptop case itself is more of a washed up salmon than bright pink the bright pink on the key cover is great but not happy with the pink on the actual hard case
works very well the only problem i had with it is the keyboard cover does n't does n't really show the light from the keyboard as well mouse is a little cheap and when clicking it gets stuck bought it mostly for the case though so worth the price i guess
it 's a good case for the price and what it came with , but the keyboard cover that came in the mail had a very cheap paint job the laptop case had a very weird smell that was extremely nauseating the bottom part of the laptop cover is very loose as well but for the price , it 's worth it
i was very upset when i got this and realized it did not fit the model number is mixed in with many other numbers and i had to pay an extra $ # <unk> of the price to send it back ! ! ! ! it should be more clearly marked they handled the return well but i was disappointed to have to spend even more money to send it back for the product , it was great but for the display of information , i think it needs improving
the case fits my macbook pro retina a # perfectly fine and i really love the color however , the keyboard cover is a little bit hard to type and the laptop sleeve is dirty when it arrived in the mail i am slightly disappointed by the sleeve and the smell was really strong at first overall , i am satisfied with this purchase . =
this fit my macbook pro perfectly color is just like the picture bottom part of the case was damaged in shipping , contacted and they shipped out a new piece the keyboard cover lettering was not printed properly therefore it looks blurry when the keyboard lights are one , but they shipped me a new clear cover
great stuffs ! it exactly fits my laptop as i ordered by checking my model number the shipping is extremely quick even if u select the standard shipping method the only thing that i disliked was that the mouse requires batteries overall great ! !
love this set it personalized my computer and it is such a great deal i only do n't love the keyboard cover because because it does n't actually match the original and you can see through when the keyboard light comes on the wireless mouse is decent but not the best but really the bundle is such a great deal
this is a very good deal for the price i really enjoy the mouse and the screen protectors having the key board cover is nice too so your keys do n't get sticky the only thing i would change is the colors all being exactly the same rather than the different shades
i was a bit worried that the mouse would n't work after reading the reviews but everything works great it 's a little hard to type with the cover on the keyboard but i have tried <unk> other <unk> board covers so i ca n't complain but it 's easy to take on and off so it 's no hassle i was worries that the sticker that i had in the front would n't show -lrb- its all black -rrb- but it shows quite nicely and does n't <unk> in any way with the cover
it arrived on time size was exact match , but you have to make sure that you check you macbook pro model , because it fits exactly the model of macbook pro the package was good deal and personalized my sons computer nicely
i originally bought the red and royal blue set as a gift for someone the person loved the red one but did n't care for the royal blue i contacted the seller and told them my situation they did not hesitate at all to send me a turquoise i would definitely recommend this seller for many reasons the products are great and the sellers really care about the satisfaction of their customers
this package is great . the hard case and the sleeve are in great quality and the mouse and keyboard work great this is the exact color i wanted and the price is super reasonable i would definitely recommend this to all macbook pro # & # # ; retina display owners
crazy good deal for the price color was <unk> mouse pad is their logo and does n't match , but no biggie i do n't use <unk> mouse is a little darker and it 's a little flimsy i could n't get the battery part of it opened , but did n't bother me to try too hard , because i did n't really plan on using it
fit on my computer perfectly , both the outer shell and the keyboard cover have n't used the mouse and it seems really cheap , but i did n't purchase this set for the mouse
like the whole package , everything fit very nicely on my new mac mouse is n't of the highest quality but still very worth the price came in the mail very quickly and did not disappoint
i bought the bundle and after waiting around # month and half i recived the wrong product , the problem is that to send it back its costing me more than to buy it again it just doesnt make <unk> this is the reason why i never buy online i lost my money but they lost one customer the products looks good , but i just cant use them
this has been a great case so far fit is great and the cover for the keys fits great , unlike other reviews i have the new mac book pro retina display # . # & # # ; and the cover fits great it is a bit more difficult to type , but i have used covers before and that is normal if you do n't like the feel , do n't use it , but i was happy to have it today when a <unk> dropped a glass of water on our table i moved the laptop quickly , but it was a relief to know i had some protection i only gave it # stars since i have not figured out how to pair the mouse , but ii that works well , i would change it to a #
i am happy with this purchase and the company was really great to work with , after a problem with the original order they made it right and shipped the correct items at no extra charge
ca n't beat the price helps protect the mac and the mouse has a sleek look also good sleeve have n't used the screen protector personally i do n't want to bother with putting it on
this bag stated it could hold an apple macbook pro # inch laptop it just barely fits it is so tight from corner to corner that it is very difficult to zip i can get it to fit , but it really is a bit ridiculous so , with that i am not happy with my purchase but because i can get it to fit , i 've kept it to avoid the hassle i hope this helps someone else in their decision to purchase it for their macbook
this item fell apart , and continues to fall apart with every use it can only hold my laptop and the charging cables and absolutely nothing else i should have returned it within the allotted return time , but i just missed it ! horrible , horrible product do n't waste your money ! !
when i saw the description , it made the bag sound much more durable than the actual product in reality , the outside of the bag is not hard but a soft squishy faux-leather material and does n't seem `` reinforced ' or `` tactical . sure , it 's fashionable and probably more protective than carrying around your laptop without a case , but it does n't seem protective enough for what i was looking for i do n't think i 'll be trusting my computer in this product
bought it as a gift for a business woman it suits the need ; low profile but holds everything she needs and it is attractive great for attending business meetings or giving remote presentations while traveling light no real cons for the scope of use
the material itself provides some cushion for my laptop but the zipper can be a pain in the butt to zip or unzip most times and it 's not because it 's too tight i actually have plenty of room inspite of my laptop being # inches if they can improve the zipper , i 'll give it another star
i was looking for a relatively inexpensive case that would fit my laptop without being too bulky this is light and seems durable -lrb- i 've only had it a week though -rrb- note : you may want to get the size bigger than your laptop size i have a # . # inch , and the # is just about the right size
i had it for a while it has been a great cover i 've had it on my backpack on rainy days everything in my backpack gets wet except laptop . great product : -rrb-
it fits my # . # inch laptop and my charger great ! the color is nice and the sleeve has a little bit of padding it 's worth the price . do n't buy a cheap $ # laptop sleeve because it breaks after # week
this neoprene sleeve is exactly what i wanted and needed for my new # . # laptop -lrb- standard model with cd/dvd bay and battery -rrb- it 's not terribly snug ; laptop & cord fit perfectly inside and still remained relatively slim interior of sleeve is slightly padded , not bulky , two zippers i could see this taking a little weather , but i would n't leave it out in the rain - incidental <unk> <unk> to the car would be fine very very pleased arrived very quickly only wished they had other colors and designs available got the # in because i 've read several reviews on those supposedly designed to fit a # - # . # and people be disappointed with the fit
this laptop sleeve is great i have a # . # hp pavilion and it fits perfectly , along with a notebook and thin textbook the purple is a lot more purple than the picture indicates , but it looks great very satisfied , and it delivered on time
big space for my laptop and main pocket will hold plenty of paperwork only criticism is that the side pockets are not big enough to hold my laptop charger
just received this and it looks rugged and functional , and almost elegant , as i expected the material is a little more `` <unk> `` than i expected as compared to the photo . i was hoping for a truly muted look , but i can live with it i appreciate the multiple pockets , dedicated ipad holder , and `` tech vault `` i will likely throw sunglasses in that part my only durability concern is the mesh side pockets . . usually this material takes a beating and shreds pretty quickly we shall see
i am a # year old insurance agent and this is my briefcase i checked and i have # previous briefcases in my back room all of which did not do the whole job this new bag has space for both my laptop and ipad as well as all the other junk i take along when i travel i expect i will get a chance to actually wear out a bag with this one and with ogio that could take a while i really like this one
i wanted a large pack with plenty of pockets , padding for my devices , comfort for my aching back , and at least a bit of style i 've used this three months so far , every day , and i 'm extremely happy with it i would say it meets all of my expectations and exceeds some of them the number of pockets is unbelievable , and even though it 's a very large pack it still looks balanced and relatively sleek it 's very comfortable to carry , because even fully <unk> the weight is distributed really well the padding is truly excellent , too , both for your laptop and in the hard compartment for your sunglasses or other delicate items which is on top of the bag plus , i do n't think it 's noticeably heavier than other large packs i 've tried out or owned
i was in need for a backpack to start school . knowing i would need to carry a laptop , books , and binders around , i thought this backpack would be enough for what i needed ive been using it for # months now i love it it has its own carrying slot for my laptop , and its nicely padded every zipper has its own purpose and is big enough to carry anything you can think of would highly recommend it to anyone
love the bag with plenty of room and pockets my laptop and pad folio go in the back compartment along with a few file folders notebooks and ipad in the net pocket room for calculator , pens , memory cards in front # pockets plenty of pockets on the side for easy to reach stuff really was the pack that i was looking for to replace my kitchen sink needed something other than a big sack with no pockets
this bag is amazing i am always hesitant to purchase a product that protects my electronics , but i am so glad i bought this the craftsmanship that went into this bag is stellar there is literally a spot for everything
i got this for my fiancee for christmas and he loved it it looks great , and all the different pockets hold everything we need when we travel he especially liked the fact that there was a separate tablet sleeve as well as the laptop sleeve the pack was a little hard for me to wear , the shoulder straps are definitely configured for a larger frame than my # ' # , but the straps are super padded and comfy for him i would definitely <unk> this pack for someone with decent shoulders , but maybe not for a smaller build woman
this is a great pack i went through # others packs to get to this one , and i 'm very happy with the <unk> i would definitely buy it again i will say i 'm not sure who measured the computer compartment -lrb- its . does not fit a # -rrb- , but there 's so much room it does n't matter
i have had the <unk> for two weeks and have feel in love with it it has a lot of pockets and zippers that last definitely would recommend this one ! !
using this backpack for travel and work over # weeks a year and so far it has handled every task perfectly the outer pockets serve as functional organizers for different items the multitude of storage areas inside allow you to customize the pack for your specific needs after reviewing samsonite , targus and a number of others i can say with confidence this is the best laptop pack for organizing gear and not a bunch of papers the sunglasses vault in the top is a big bonus , you can throw them in there without the case and never worry the zippers are heavy duty and the design of the bag keeps all of the pockets accessible even when it is fully packed buy it , you 'll like it
has ample space for all of my belongings individual areas for all of the electronics -lrb- laptop , tablet , etc -rrb- has a & # # ; tech vault & # # ; which is a hard , & # # ; crush proof & # # ; case incorporated into the backpack i wear <unk> <unk> and this is a perfect for storing them while not in use all in all it 's a great backpack only negative i have to say is the bag is fairly heavy when empty so it 's gets more and more heavy with every item that is added
this does not fit it looked absolutely perfect but was a huge struggle to get on and once it was on the sides connecting the top to the bottom is made of <unk> & # # ; it ripped immediately very upset with this and returning it asap what an annoying thing to deal with & # # ; the search for a great protective case for my macbook pro continues & # # ; = / ... annoying
i bought my newest macbook pro retina # -inch and this case did not fit at all i tried to stick it in but it seemed like this case was for the macbook air when i finally had it in all the way through , the palm rest area was way above from where it should be rested i am returning this item and hope they make one that actually can fit my rmbp
i was so excited about this purchase but i had to return it it looked nice closed but fell off when the laptop was opened and the inside cover bulged around the keyboard
the product idea is fascinating . however , i just opened it . . only to see that when i place my laptop into it the material around the mouse pad the entire square around my mouse lifts up it is pretty annoying and i might return the product . =
this is nice - it is soft so i can grip it and it has a nice leather notebook appearance fits well , stays on nicely , closes well - all around very good and , it makes the laptop less interesting to thieves by covering the lit & # # ; high value & # # ; logo
just put the case on my mbp and it fit perfectly although it looks like the bands holding the case to the screen are going to slip off , they seem to hold even when opened all the way the case looks good and will definitely protect my mac from scratches i already received numerous compliments from coworkers so far i like it
i 've been waiting for a rmbp case similar to the casecrown book cover case for macbook air this case is basically the same except for the logo , which is very subtle i have n't noticed any heat issues ; however , i do not game you ca n't beat this case for the money
after # + months of airing it out , it still has that <unk> <unk> smell i 've had baking soda in it , <unk> laundry <unk> in it i even left it outside in the garage fully open for a month or more , and still it smells the design of the case is n't the best , as it will completely open up like a binder it 's meant to be opened up on a flat surface , not on the go while you 're still carrying it - otherwise the contents spill out i really wanted to like this case , but i ended up going to best buy and buying a case that did n't open all the way -lrb- so it would n't spill everything out -rrb- also it 's not really a hard shell case like your old samsonite luggage , it 's more like a not fabric soft case you can easily press into it and it will collapse on the large sides if it were a true hard shell case , all you could do is barely <unk> it -lrb- like my samsonite hard side luggage does and other hard shell cases -rrb-
great bag for a macbook air , ipad and external keyboard my only issue is that the internal divisions ripped off within a month of use it does not impact the functionality of the bag itself , but it could have been made a bit stronger
there is a terrible chemical odor that <unk> the room when you pull it out of the box it was so strong it <unk> my dog and i <unk> her around the house with it that smell dissipates after about a week , though and everything else about the bag is perfect definitely would recommend it
i bought this caddy for my # & # # ; mac air it is fabulous this caddy does exactly what it says the straps are long enough to be able to throw over your back like a # <unk> bookbag , the inside has plenty of compartments to carry notebooks , pens , cell phones , etc . i just wish it came in more colors
took the computers to sweden and this is where my daughter stored her mac on the trip it was easy to carry and really looked cute the only thing missing was a strap to strap it to the luggage since its only an # ' mac , it was no problem though it gave me peace of mind with all the <unk> and walking and traveling we did
i love the way my samsung chromebook fits in this case with a little room to spare , but not too much extra room great balance between versatility , size and weight
very stylish , versatile and roomy for the size i can put my chromebook , cellphone , two chargers , wallet , pens , paper notebook and reading glasses in the case with room left over
if only it was not too big for my retina macbook pro # at first i thought i got a sleeve for # & # # ; version , but it 's a # & # # ; one although i do n't have any major issues with it as i always keep the sleeve inside another bag , i ca n't recommend it for macbook pro # & # # ; with retina
the price is great , but be warned that this sleeve offers virtually no protection on impacts or drops from the felt alone i would <unk> it as more a laptop accessory for fashion , which is does a good job at for the
i like this case quite a bit -- the style is slick and the felt feels good not sure how it will hold up to an eventual washing , since i bet the yellow band will show some <unk> after a year or so one minor point on the design -- i wish they 'd made the flap a bit narrower , so it would lay flat under the band you can make it do it with some tugging at the corners , but it naturally wants to bow and flex because there 's just a tad too much material anyhow , i 'm satisfied , especially for the price
it 'll fit a # . # inch laptop very nicely and not too snug as some others do my only gripe is the lack of any pockets , other than that it 's ok
this is so much nicer looking than # % of the other ugly cases out there it is maybe slightly larger than it needs to be but not too roomy that the laptop is loose inside seems really durable i actually with there was slightly more padding -lrb- e.g . it was a little thicker -rrb- but only because when it 's in my courier bag and i 'm riding , the hard laptop hurts against my spine my old laptop case was ~ # mm of memory foam type material but if it was n't for cycling regularly with the laptop in the bag it would n't bother me so i do n't think this is the fault of the case
the first negative is how the product smells it is a horrible strong plastic-y smell i put it outside for days b/c i could n't stand the smell in the house secondly , the long handle for carrying over your shoulder is not usable now b/c the places where you clip it on literally came out of the product i guess i could sew them back in but why did they come out in the # st place i do n't need to be repairing a brand new product that i did n't even hardly use it does provide decent cushioning for the computer so we still use it and carry it by the short handle or put it in a bigger bag
it simply is not large enough to accommodate my macbook air when it has the thin plastic cover on it ! ! ! when i took the cover off it still had to be shoved is so tightly that i could n't zip it up i want to return it for a refund , but i ca n't find out how to do this on your website ! when i took it to my <unk> , they told me it would cost $ # to ship to china , which i should n't have to pay please send me information on how to return it for a refund it is a pretty little bag , and had it been a couple inches larger , i 'm sure i would have kept it
the bag is cool , because it holds other stuff besides my mac it was a good price , and i really like the print it is a very light print i would buy it again if i need another
i really like this bag it does not scream i am a laptop bag the color is great i really like the carry handle , the shoulder strap and especially the side zipper pocket the pocket works great to hold the cords and other stuff that needs to go with me it also would work great at a sleeve to put in a backpack , just remove the shoulder straps this is the second bag i bought the other one did not have the zipper pocket i realized i needed that
great size for just the essentials , but the fabric strap has rough edges and it will pill your clothing i was thinking about trying to find a replacement strap , but it just did n't seem worth it - it went back
i got this today for the dell xps ultrabook # that i recently purchased the computer fits nicely and the pockets on it seem adequate to the task for all the room that is available , it would have been nice if the pockets include little pouches for thumb drives , pens , stylus , etc . as it is , these things will end up collecting in the bottom of the pockets which is always a pain also , the case does n't have a carry handle , only a shoulder strap ... and the bag hangs like a purse and not a case ; that 's a bit annoying the # -stars are because the case is ok and will get the job done , but does n't seem to be any special if i change my opinion after using it for awhile i 'll update this review
i like it , but its a little bulky to be considered a sleeve , but a little minimal to be a bag if it just had a top handle for picking up , it would be
bought this case for my wife 's new dell laptop and it fits well i read the other reviews before i purchased it for the price it works the only recommendations i could make is instead of a shoulder strap i would have like to seen a hand handle
i purchased this for my new dell xps # . # & # # ; xps as the laptop did not come with a protective sleeve as did my old one i replaced this does the job nicely i travel often and take my laptop with me to the hotel at night from work this bag has a sturdy strap that makes it easy to carry the bag has # zip pockets and a open slotted pocket so there is enough room for the charger and accessories a well thought out design
i have a dell xps # and the case fits perfectly it 's great because i 's as skinny as a sleeve , but if i need to bring my charger or other accessories i can fit it in i 'm still in school so being able to take the strap off so i can fit the case in my bag with ease is really nice too but then i have a strap for my case when i do n't need my whole backpack
i love it it 's small enough to fit in my school bag when i need to carry many items it 's pockets and shoulder strap make it perfect to take with me outside of school life -lrb- i hear that type of life exists ? -rrb- without feeling like i need another bag to protect it it fits my dell xps perfectly
i needed a case for my computer i travel a lot in the car this case is a beautiful vibrant green and i have received several compliments on it it is durable it is designed very simply and has made grabbing my computer in the car very quick yet it protects my computer perfectly i do recommend this product
small . . light . . good for everyday carry of a small laptop . ipad pocket is good , but , small for an ipad with a cover . extra pockets good for charger and phone this is pretty much what you can put in there . . greatest benefit - - it is light ****** updated review ****** down to # star from # a bit over a month of light use , the zippers on the backpack failed signs of problem started when zippers would not close well twice this past week zippers opened up while on my back ... nothing came out , but , can not risk a laptop falling out ... this backpack is now retired
very compact and fits my macbook pro retina # `` perfectly very comfortable and with just the appropriate number of pockets and features professional and minimalistic look update january # : downgraded the star rating for this backpack because the zippers broke after # months of usage the zipper lining started to come off at the corners of the backpack eventually the the whole zipper stitching came off i still like the stylish and compact design of the backpack , but the quality does not live up to the what i expected i have backpacks that have lasted me for years without an issue had to buy a new backpack when the zipper came off while on a business trip
i bought this backpack for travel it is a great design with pockets for my kindle , cell phone , and the few other items i travel with however , the zippers -lrb- especially on the main compartment -rrb- are a very weak link it broke before i arrived at the airport with a very light load in the backpack -lrb- less than # full -rrb- by the time my travel was over the main compartment zipper was useless , and the smaller compartment zipper was failing i recommend shopping for a more durable product
this backpack is just ok it 's a backpack not super comfortable the excess of padding and little provision for air flow make it very hot on a warm day the water bottle older net is just a joke you could hold a test tube full of water a bike sized water bottle is n't even close to fitting if you consider water a fashion statement and do n't ever plan to actually drink it , this could work for you this seems designed on paper more than by practical testing for the $ it ought to be better
i measured my laptop with and without its case and it should have fit in this backpack according to its description , but it did not i still use it , i just ca n't zip it up all the way on the plus side , the quality is amazing and i love its sleek styling
