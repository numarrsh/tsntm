smells very strongly of chemicals i even aired it out by propping it open overnight on the porch , but it still smells like plastics and it only barely fits my macbook air -- i always struggle with the zipper
i thought from the write-up that it was specifically for my laptop , so was a bit disapointed in the excess room in the case that said , it does the job of protecting my laptop , and there is room for the power cord which is a plus as others commented , there is a strong odor with it and i put it out in the sun for a week to <unk> it it 's fine now
i bought this to protect my new intuos tablet it 's not too bulky and work 's great for what i need especially since i did n't want to spend a bunch of money for just a simple sleeve
picked this up with the idea that it might work for a samsung chromebook # inch laptop well it does fit , but not very well you have to tug the zipper around the corners of the chromebook but it is a very nice case update : purchased the `` amcase # . # -inch sleeve/case `` here on amazon and it fits the laptop much better
works well , however if you have a docking station attachment the laptop does n't quite fit all the way i have to leave part of it unzipped i did n't think about that when purchasing
this sleeve case holds my # . # inch laptop perfectly it 's a snug fit , but the zipper still opens and closes easily exactly what i was looking for i spilled some water on the sleeve and the inside lining remained dry i 'm very happy with this purchase and i love the color
i love the color -- everyone made the smell a bid deal , but it lasted maybe a day or two and now it 's fine it fits my macbook air pro very snugly so there 's no room for anything else , but it keeps my laptop clean and safe
i have an # . # & # # ; hp # & it takes a good tug to get the zipper around works for its purpose to give a little protection , but it is not something you would want to use if you plan on taking in in and out several times a day i am keeping it because it was priced right & serves its function
it is not what i was expecting when i received it the tailoring is not up to the expectation moreover , it can not close properly better to look for other bags
pros : can hold # inch laptops , lots of pockets cons : the main strap is a bit small for the bag and it tends to bend near the hinge when walking around for a relatively small period of time
case is exactly what i wanted this is a first time use of a lap top computer case has a place for every thing lap top is well protected price is right and the case is stylish i am very happy <unk>
great carrying case for a new # & # # ; lenovo that my work supplied to me it comes with a removable zipper pouch that completely <unk> your laptop very good amount of padding the inside zipper compartment is lined with soft cloth and perfect to put a surface , kindle , or ipad in great assortment of smaller compartments for accessories
this bag is unique the bag can handle a good # & # # ; laptop and books to boot while in tow around the college campus . very durable and hasnt been a nuisance i approve big time
i bought it several years ago and it still works well it has been at least # years and i still use it the only issue is that after a while -lrb- a long while -rrb- the zippers loosened and wont say closed -lrb- safety pins handled that -rrb-
had high hopes for this cover for the new t # the cover does not close completely there 's a slight , nearly <unk> space when closed this means the t # does not go to & # # ; sleep & # # ; but stays in <unk> mode this , of course , means the battery runs down constantly unless you power down the unit i 'm returning it for a full refund will seek a neoprene case that fits
this is a clunky cover which is smooth plastic so it does n't add any grip to hold your device also , it does not allow the device to open to its full capacity and the handle holders scratch the surface you are working on better off with a neoprene cove
it was a waste of time , i was so excited about these case and the bottom part did not fit i told amazon the problem i hope everything was taking care of there are some <unk> to be made on the case anyone buying this item should check with amazon first the problem was the bottom piece , do n't matter what you do , does not fit the keyboard
the best case for this tablet i tried some <unk> ones , which actually damage the hinge joint i also tried some sticker covers and some neoprene cases none help with the dual nature that makes this tablet pc a hit this plus a screen protector is perfect , lightweight , and adds a carrying handle also , will not break the bank this is a must-buy with the t # note the handle is removable
i decided not to purchase this item afterall when i saw that shipping was # . # i can buy a bag locally for as much as i would pay for this one including shipping cost
i have had this bag for about two months overall the bag seems <unk> and well made , except the most important part of a bag , the zippers they constantly jam and jump off track i have made several trips using this bag , and have had problems every single time a huge pain when going through airport screening i bought this bag above <unk> simply because i thought the samsonite brand would guarantee some measure of quality , but , like many companies , i see they too have chosen quick <unk> over a good reputation avoid this bag at all costs
it is elegant , executive , and sophisticated i will recommend to everyone who is involved in lot of business travelling it is neither too small , nor too big it is what exactly i was looking for now , i dont have to think about packing unpacking and can travel within short period of time . it has a perfect space for ur clothes , laptop , all office accessories and still doesnt look huge
i purchased this business case for a two day travel that required me to hit the ground running with a group of men i was a little concerned about space for clothes and personal items , but it worked out well i was able to get two outfits , under garment , pj 's and travel size personal hygiene items , shower shoes , laptop , and a folder into bag women ... it was hard , but i managed to survive without certain <unk> of comfort items for two days
i really love the bag it 's great for carrying my laptop as well as for a nice carry-on when i 'm traveling without the laptop i would ask that the only change to be made -- a thicker , more padded handle at the top for when you are not using it as a backpack
i ordered this after returning the <unk> pack because its padded computer compartment is way too small for my new apple ibook <unk> , the computer compartment that comes with this huge back office bag does n't fit it either however , i 'll keep it and put the computer in the bag behind the compartment hopefully amazon will take the ibook into consideration and adjust the computer compartment -lrb- make it expandable ?
i 've been using this backpack almost every day since # when i was working at the <unk> # distribution center for amazon and managed to buy the last one of these the company had in the system i wish they 'd bring it back after this many years of use some of the rubber grips on the zippers have broken , but it was n't until very recently that i started having troubles with any of the zippers themselves as heavily as i 've used it this has been well worth the expense
i do n't use it any more since my electronics have <unk> greatly i no longer carry a power brick , pda , and separate cell phone as my <unk> wifi hotspot now fits in my pocket durable : none of the stiching frayed in # years of use , i ca n't say that about any other backpacks i 've purchased since then if i were to start carrying around my <unk> laptops along with my main laptop , i 'd use this bag the internal laptop sleeve is a bit bulky , but that 's because it is well-padded i wish the inside sleeve had a zipper around the top , for extra protection against falling out there is even room for a pair of jeans <unk> the laptop sleeve there is room for a <unk> laptop , up to one inch thick the upper compartment holds several wall <unk> and laptop power adapter -lrb- even the <unk> dell models -rrb-
this really is a <unk> product , and here 's why - it has no fastener to close the wallet , and it wo n't really lay flat unless you remove the accessory cover - it is not padded enough to protect a pda from anything other than scratches from carrying it in a briefcase ... drop your jornada in this and you 're going to have to buy a new one - you have to remove the jornada from the wallet before it can fit in a cradle , and the velcro keeps the it from fitting in the cradle firmly - there is only one small pocket in the front cover of the wallet for <unk> this product is for cosmetics , only if you want to replace your accessory cover , i suggest getting one of the new color accessory covers from <unk> , or the leather <unk> case -lrb- at <unk> it snaps shut -rrb-
why would i want to stick <unk> strips on my nice jornada # the case does n't even stay closed i took one look at it and returned it
not roomy enough i expected to be able to use my jornada with ease and have room for other papers , etc . it is too expensive , and does nothing to make my # more useful
i 've been using solo bags for years this new model 's zippers are much smaller and flimsier than previous models after only # months of normal use , the zippers started having issues ; and one broke off entirely this morning -- not the tab , the actual zipper clasp on the outer pocket broke the older solo portfolios were much heavier duty , and i highly recommend them on the positive side , all the other materials and construction are of the highest quality
i have the exact same model number briefcase which is why i ordered this one the problem is that solo has <unk> several pockets within the briefcase sections so it is no longer the same even with the exact model number as my previous one had i known that it would be different i would not have ordered it
i bought this case to carry a # `` laptop it 's working out great seems to be a good quality leather case lots of compartments small pockets for cd 's , ink pens , ect came with a shoulder strap i like it one month old i carry it to work almost every day
purchased laptop bag for our son who began a new job a while back he is well pleased with case other than the zipper did not hold up well having to use it without a zipper
this product works very well for me and is quite durable i have found it handles my daily <unk> well including laptop and accessories the only drawback i see is the overall bulk which i guess goes with the concept of carrying your office in a bag
better than i expected ! no more cramming the laptop in , slides in and out with lots of room to spare great item at a great price from a great seller !
the identical bag under the brand `` us luggage `` i had for the past # years is finally worn out after much heavy daily use the well-made leather bag is the most user friendly of all bags i own and <unk> if you are used to simultaneously carrying to work everything from laptop to lunch and anything else in between after an extensive search for a new one , i was pleasantly surprised that the same bag could still be found in amazon -lrb- now branded `` solo `` -rrb- ! i just purchased one which is still well-made and look forward to using it for a long time again i highly recommend this bag
this bag is perfect for my needs as a professor the leather body is durable and flexible it provides ample room for my textbooks , laptop , papers , and accessories at the same time it is n't too big that it is unwieldy the size is just perfect for every-day use if you are looking for a lap-top bag with ample room to spare , than this is an excellent product bonus ; it also attaches to the extended handles on rolling bags , which makes it an ideal piece for travel i highly recommend it
the only good thing about this bag is the size it is able to hold a large laptop and a few text books plus a few other little things what is a turn down is the lack of water resistance in one single down poor , water leaked into the bag and caused damage to the contents one test book is completely water logged and the others have large amounts of damage the customer service stinks when i filled out their little <unk> form online , a <unk> said a reply would be sent within # days it took them # it 's been # days since i have responded to the reply , which did n't address my issue , and i have n't heard word from them once i return the bag to the store , i will look to buy from another company with a similar size of bag
pro ` sit 's really roomy ... ample room for my old brick of a computer dell # `` inspiron # and my tiny hp nc # good sized for overnight con ` <unk> compression straps when you have a smaller load to carry i ended up ripping the nylon on the bag accidently as it got hooked on the side of a gym locker . not as good as ripstop nylon the zipper `` <unk> `` are n't <unk> enough ... the bag would separate at the zippers numerous times eventually , the zippers all broke loose in one night , even the separate zipper for the laptop
good things about this backpack plenty of pockets # . laptop protection is excellent as far as any drops or pressure there are problems , though # . not awkward , standard feeling backpack not at all waterproof i ca n't emphasize this enough , it does n't keep water out at all many of the pockets are weirdly sized , shaped and useless main pocket has a strange cheap inner flap and i ca n't figure out the purpose of it this backpack is worth # or # dollars maybe
the color is very off , looks like it has white on it , does not and the grey looks green very frustrated with it but space is good in it just was really looking forward to white on it
the mesh ripped in the first week of using this bag it 's really large , but i needed a large bag to carry gym clothes , gym shoes , <unk> , books , and laptop it definitely holds all of this stuff but i hate the quality of the mesh
this is my second targus bag the first one -lrb- same model -rrb- lasted almost a decade this one lasted about # years before the seams and zippers started ripping , carrying the same typical load i love how big it is and all the different storage areas make it easy to organize all my gear it 's too bad the quality of construction seems to have declined over the years
it <unk> what it used to be the product is still good and meets my expectations the people at targus could have made it a little bit bigger to make the bag & # # ; terrific & # # ; im still happy with the bag . great product with neat compartments and comfort
it 's a good size backpack i used it for carrying # . # & # # ; laptops with no problem fitting them in i 'm a little disappointed that the side pockets are too small to practically put anything there i also had <unk> that to be able to place a little water bottle - this is too much for it the handle to carry the backpack seems a little too gentle to carry the weight i do n't know how it will <unk> after a long use i 'm just too <unk> to lift the backpack by the handle just in case it rips i 've seen other backpacks where they have a metal string it 's also a little pricey i 'm not sure it worth the $ #
i have been using this bag for a few years now while going to school i carry a dell inspiron # laptop in it and it fits fine one of the main pocket zippers separates sometimes -lrb- happened about # times in two years -rrb- would be nice if there was a pocket to carry a water bottle
this bag is huge ! it is a great bag when you are travelling and do n't like handling a bag stuffed to the brim at the airport line but , it is too big for daily use no complaints about the quality of the bag it is a really good bag
very good bag for being on the road with your notebook or even just for <unk> would have been nicer if the front compartment could totally detach though - actually thought it did also very good for students in high school or the university <unk> your notebook and school books all at once , with your mp # player has nice exit for headphones whilst player can stay in the bag front pouch
this is the only backpack from the targus extensive product list that i found worthy as a <unk> to my previous targus <unk> # backpack probably due to the lighting , this product does n't look very black as pictured , but it really is fairly dark , a definite plus in my books there 's ample room for my widescreen # `` macbook pro the flaws are minor : # -rrb- the zipper of the <unk> compartment has a habit of coming apart , so do n't put anything you do n't want to lose in there imo , the zipper needs not to be all around , just having it on the top should be fine # -rrb- the plastic bits on one of the <unk> cords disintegrated within a week , so i had to tie the cord itself into a knot
bought it with the hp <unk> # series has plenty of storage for pretty much everything the only negative thing i can say about the pack is that with a # . # `` laptop it is a very tight fit the velcro closure strap securing the laptop in place should be about an inch longer for better fitment otherwise it rests nice on your back and its very adjustable
great bag , i use it on my trips and works great fits my laptop , a book , cables and mouse and # days clothes and still there 's more space available it needs a bottle bag i 'm a # ' # `` guy # # and it looks good size for me
this backpack has served all the purposes i 've hoped for it 's large enough to carry all of my law books as well as my # . # -inch computer i 'm a little worried about it 's lack of waterproofing because of the rain , but otherwise , a great backpack
i go to school part time and i bought this to carry books and laptop when i go to school this bag has a lot of room so far it is holding the weight well i only use it once a week i use a different carrying case for daily use since i do n't have to carry so much of stuff this is a nice travel bag i will not like to use it daily unless i have so much stuff to carry every day
targus laptop backpack is of excellent quality it fits my hp # . # inch wide screen laptop perfectly well there are plenty of pockets in the first and the second section overall a good value buy
this is an extremely value for money laptop back pack it has lots of space and very sturdy construction a lot of pockets to fit in extra stuff it is far better than those traditional laptop bags and those expensive back packs
great <unk> <unk> small <unk> divider may add the backpack <unk> a bottle <unk> little cd backpack has only one connector in front it should has two <unk> is a good backpack this backpack can hold my two textbooks with # + pages each also , i carry my notebook around it perfectly fits with dell inspiron # the only disadvantage that i found is that there is no bottle pocket you can only hold a can but not a bottle
i 've had this backpack for going on # years now , and it is still in excellent condition the straps show no sign of tearing and there is only the very lightest fraying on some of the edges it has also proven to be remarkably water resistant ; good for rainy treks across campus i could n't be more pleased with the quality , and will buy from targus again it has lots of good pockets for students , without being overly complicated or cumbersome over my school career , this is my favorite bag
i use this backpack to carry my laptop , books , shoes , lunch , gym clothes , etc . to work and school every day i was in a <unk> accident where i rolled five or six times , and the backpack held up i used it for another year and a half afterwards it finally gave up the ghost because a zipper that had taken damage in the accident finally broke i promptly bought another one quick tip : for use with a motorcycle jacket , put the jacket arms through the backpack shoulder straps first , then put both on at once
this backpack bag is very well made and has many interior compartments it is ergonomic and thus , gives a feel of even distribution of weight overall , its a good buy
like the title says , i 've had this for # years and it 's been through # countries -lrb- checked in , not carried on -rrb- since it 's old , i 've been particularly abusive with it and it 's still good as new i 'm amazed that it 's lasted this long when other laptop backpacks have fallen apart within a year or two as much as i 'd like an excuse to get another laptop bag , this thing will not break
i have had the bag for over a year now and take i with me on the weekends the bag will pack a weekend worth of cloths , the computer and my other gadgets the bag has been holding up great i would buy again
the design is very well done , the number of divisions help to maintain the stuff a bit more organized it is light and comfortable , the external small pockets are a good addition it is the best backpack i have had
i bought this bag to carry my laptop overseas and hopefully still have room for a few other things so i wouldnt have to use check in 's . and its a great bag ! hold all my gear i work over seas on a drilling rig and keep most of my clothes on the rig so this lil beauty works great for transporting all of my things in one
i 've owned this item for almost a full year and i am extremely pleased with it it 's so nice being able to carry around my laptop and my books in the same bag the side pockets are kind of useless for them being so small , but i guess i 'll be able to find a purpose for them
purchase bag for both laptop and books this bag has more compartments that you will probably every use or need but that is great it big , spacious , light and stylish it 's the perfect bag
i was just checking out previous purchases in my account , and saw this ... from approximately ten years ago it made me realize that i am still using this backpack , it is still in decent shape , and i 've taken it all over the world with me the zippers have never once gotten jammed or broken , and although it 's frayed a bit in certain parts , i plan to use this backpack for years to come very much worth it
my dad bought me this backpack when i was a junior in high school i graduated in # and i 'm still using it there has been no issues with tears or fraying , it is in the exact same condition it was when he bought it i used it all through high school and am using it for college it has had # + lbs of textbooks , notebooks , laptop , etc . and still looks brand new the straps and back are padded just enough to give relief , but not be bulky i 've also used it when i travel it looks about the size of a regular backpack but it can expand to fit just about anything you want to put in it the price seems expensive , but it 's worth it it 's a high quality product that i would recommend to anyone who is in school , weather they have a laptop or not
one of the best purchases i 've ever made i bought this bag back in february # and i still use it it has many compartment to hold all sorts of things it fits my big computer , in fact it can hold # computers at a time my boyfriend has used it to go backpacking through asia a couple times all the zippers still work i would not recommend this as a backpacking bag because it does n't have a very good distribution of weight or waist straps as a real backpacking backpack would in other words , you can make this bag very heavy and then it would be uncomfortable to carry for long periods of time but it is perfect as a computer bag / book bag
i 've had one of these for several years , and we just bought a second one it is very durable and the layout is very convenient there are lots of compartments and pockets for easy organization
i bought this exact bag around # years ago i use it daily for work it is still in excellent shape no problems with the zippers the only spot that shows any wear is a small spot on the bottom and this is just from being slid around on the floor i just purchased a second bag to use specifically for travel
the extended handle of my `` targus <unk> # side access notebook roller `` was broken in my first trip the handle bars were stuck inside the bag and now could be extended only by # of its full length once it was stuck inside , it was impossible to fix or even just check out i got really disappointed and want to warn anybody considering to buy it
the handle was poorly built and when you pull it up or down it tends to get stuck and eventually <unk> your finger when i returned it the seller ended up not <unk> the full amount and charging me for shipping for a defective item
i bought this from america , and sent it to china by post , then i found that it 's made in china it 's not the same as the <unk> , the front part is not the same , and there 's only one bag inside , where is the other one
the picture makes this rolling laptop case look like a rolling briefcase , but it is really almost as deep as it is wide this is a rolling overnight bag if that is what you want , then it is probably fine i 'm wanting something that will easily fit under an airplane seat to carry in addition to my larger carry-on bag , so will be returning this
excellent for the price it would have been nice if it had few additional small pockets within one of the mail partitions also the front partition not very user friendly - not easy to access
i 've had this bag for # months now it is a nice looking bag , and also has a nice light and small design it fits my notebook , power chords , and <unk> just fine without looking stuffed or too thick in fact , i really liked this bag until one day it was a rainy day i packed my notebook as usual , stepped outside assuming all would be protected and safe however , if you look carefully , the flap that swings over the top is not made to wrap around the edges there is an angled gap of roughly half an inch on both sides of the flap , that provides direct access to the notebook luckily for me , it was a short walk to the car in very heavy rain . when i opened my notebook bag , i discovered water on the edges of my notebook and now , i have to always remember to stuff paper towels on the edges just in case it rains
i need to be able to put my laptop in the bag and take out easily , as i do it many times a day this bag , while reasonable , does n't <unk> this quality : you need to open and close too much i ended up not using it
i specifically wanted a vertical laptop bag with fewer pockets and lightweight carry this bag fits the need perfectly and has a fine shoulder pad overall design is simple and utilitarian the sections & pockets are fewer but very large and can carry almost anything a negative is that after # months of daily use , the inside laptop section divider fabric stitching has started to break and separate through normal use this also <unk> the thin <unk> construction of the internal divider at best , this is okay and a compromise for weight and cost , but given all the other design & assembly compromises , i wonder if this will last a year or # without becoming an annoyance
i bought this bag about the time the line was released at least # years ago and it 's held up wonderfully i 've paid much more for other brands only to have them fall apart in under a year , but this was one is durable and holds my macbook air , ipad , iphone and accessories without a problem it 's annoying that i have to pull up the flap to access my electronics , but that extra # seconds means i can feel comfortable knowing my stuff wo n't fall out if the bag gets <unk> i highly recommend this bag
i got this bag to replace my backpack -lrb- like others have said -rrb- and have been very much glad i got this bag seems high quality con : this bag -lrb- for a macbook pro -rrb- is a little lumpy to carry a charging <unk> - i ended up leaving the mouse at home
i bought this after borrowing a friend of mines stm bag i like his more because it has more pockets , but his was bought in <unk> several years ago alas , this bag is still the best laptop bag i have seen since quality construction and great price point make this bag a winner
bought this for my new hp laptop i tad bigger than i would like i wish there was a size to best fit my # in laptop good room for peripherals and files
love the look and all , however i did not expect it to be that long and heavy i 'm used to my notebook size bag however it protect my system perfectly and does not draw too much attention as a laptop
i saw the picture of the bag and liked it instantly it is exactly what it is described to be and the size is excellent for a # `` computer a bigger computer would leave little room for any other accessories -lrb- power cables etc -rrb- has enough pockets for necessities like pen drives , notebook - small folders - all you need to get you off on a work trip the colour and fabric is excellent , but not water proof highly recommend it for frequent travellers
this is a great bag it easily fits my # `` laptop and has enough room for me to carry a few textbooks and notebooks without feeling too bulky it is very comfortable
this company seems to have thought of everything i really like the top load idea first and <unk> but , there are other <unk> qualities to this bag : the outside zipper compartment , the padded shoulder strap , the inside storage areas i 'll be able to have a place for my wireless mouse , my phone , my cables , pens - everything i 'm going to recommend this to anyone looking for a great carrying case for their laptop
bought the twelve south # inch macbook cover and it fit with # inch room at the top and minimal space at the sides the small bag would have not fit the laptop case at all a very sturdy and sleek bag received on time and without issue
after much research , i purchased this bag for a # . # inch laptop the selection criteria included size -lrb- not too bulky -rrb- , weight , functionality , sufficient pockets for accessories this bag fits the requirements perfectly it is well made , appears durable , has just the right size protective area for the laptop and just enough pockets for the usual accessories this bag is not for the individual who needs to carry lots of books in addition to a laptop
i 've worked in the field as a photographer for over four <unk> this bag is great for carrying my samsung slate tablet -lrb- bigger than an ipad -rrb- , my ipad # , wireless keyboard & mouse plus the chargers and minimal accessories i 've added some additional <unk> foam to the bottom and interior of the case for additional protection and it works great being a vertical bag it dose n't get in the way of the rest of my other camera cases and bodies or hang up on every thing i walk by -lrb- like people in crowds and glass displays . i coated mine with some waterproofing spray which helps significantly in a light downfall -lrb- carry large <unk> bags to save your equipment as they take up very little space . the case is rugged enough for my daily use the folks at the local microsoft store were so impressed by the case when i showed it to them , they wanted all the info to refer to their buyers who were buying the larger sized tablets the cell phone case on the strap is very handy indeed , especially in a noisy environment i 'm ordering several more for my <unk>
i purchased this bag about a year ago and within # months the vertical zipper on the front pocket broke i contacted stm and even though i no longer had the receipt , agreed to replace the bag i have had the new bag for about # months and the vertical zipper on this bag has broken as well it is a pretty great bag overall , but when one of the major storage compartments is no longer usable , the bag itself is pretty much a waste
bought this and never used it it looks really unattractive in real life and is unnecessarily bulky for a small laptop bag it is also awkward to carry on the shoulder because the bag is vertical rather than horizontal it ends up dangling strangely
<unk> , the velcro on my stm alley gave out fairly early on , and more than a few times , my `` slippery `` aluminum macbook would just get dumped out this usually happens when the bag is on a seat in my car , in the trunk , or even when the bag tips over at the bookstore , letting the macbook go <unk> across the <unk> floor and there are of course the couple of times i took it outside and was caught off guard by a light rain -- the water goes straight down into the laptop compartment all that said , i did like the bag 's design and overall <unk> and would likely buy another stm bag in the future -- just a different design -lrb- <unk> preferred -rrb- and hopefully , they will be using stronger velcro on their current and future models
for the price this bag is excellent and i would highly recommend it as has been noted the bag is actually darker in color than appears in the picture which makes the bag look a bit more professional for such a trim bag it holds suprisingly a large amount of side items such as power cords , ipod , etc . i use my bag for my # white macbook at school and it works great i 'd recommend it to anyone looking for a good , practical bag for a reasonable price
- looks nice - shoulder strap can stay on or be removed depending on how you want to carry it - lots of compartments there 's room for a laptop # `` and smaller laptop as well as room for a tablet such as an ipad - there are small openings on the side so if it rains water could get inside so watch out for that - while the cell phone pouch attached to the shoulder strap is a good idea it is way too small my iphone fits but the top of the phone sticks out on the side and again , if it rains water can get in many people have smart phones these days such as the iphone and samsung galaxy so in my opinion it would be nice to have a deeper pouch so the phone can be put all the way in overall it is a nice bag . # . # stars
i love this bag very easy to use and carry around you can hold it or carry it around your shoulder you can also put some of your notebooks , pens , and other items you can also put your cell phone on the side the only downside is that it is not good with rain so you have to extra protect your laptop when it rains overall , great product
this case is nice , has a good quality material and easy to carry on the only thing i dont like is that it doesnt have enough space to carry a book or some papers i wanted a case small for my # `` macbook , but spacious to carry along some papers that is why i give a # star rate if you are looking for a case that is small and easy to carry , this is the case -lrb- again , this is only if you dont need to carry an amount of things and papers with you
pros : slim , many containers , handy , good design and build quality cons : eventhough it is water-proof , under normal raining condition , water still can run in this bag because of the flip on top did not cover your bag totally furthermore , i thought it would be nice to have # more small container at the bottom instead of just one other thought : with this bag , you can only carry # laptop , # or # small books , an iphone and the laptop charger anything more than that , consider getting a bigger bag -lrb- # `` or # ``
the pouch for holding a computer does n't seal so it 's possible for others to see that there 's a laptop inside -lrb- <unk> -rrb- and for rain to get in otherwise i like it
just got this bag and overall , the quality seems impressive the velcro areas even have an `` x `` stitched through them to keep them from being pulled off the fabric seems like high quality and very durable i got the stm small alley for a # inch netbook with the hope of someday switching to a # size and continuing to use the same case ample space for power brick , cables and other assorted laptop accessories i really only see two negatives with this case : the foam in the bottom -lrb- ground side -rrb- could be a little thicker to absorb the regular shock of sitting the bag on the ground my bigger gripe is the small zippers used on the bag going a size or two bigger in the zippers would give the bag a much longer life for anyone who zips and unzips a few times per day
a # macbook pro fits easily in the large slot , and a # . # acer fits in the smaller slot with room to spare - nice extra when we both travel what it not evident in the photos is the <unk> of the flaps - not quite wide enough to cover the laptop slots entirely well padded , very nice handle and shoulder strap with sturdy fasteners bonus point : <unk> daughter said `` cool bag
