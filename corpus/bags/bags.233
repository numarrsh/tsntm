i bought this product for myself and loved it so much that i bought a second one as a gift for my boyfriend -lrb- i had to because he was jealous when he saw mine -rrb- it is perfect and has so many pockets
i bought this bag for school last year unfortunately , the school did not allow me to actually place my laptop in the bag for insurance reasons anyhow , it 's a very nice messenger bag , stylish , but uncomfortable without a decent pad for the strap it 's good for both <unk> , however , it is a bit larger than what i expected when i bought it nevertheless , i use it regularly still , after having it for a year and two months however , i just wanted to say , if you find yourself carrying over # lbs . each day from home , the strap itself will not offer enough support to make it at all comfortable at the end of the review is the shoulder pad that i believe would offer the best solution for this dilemma manhattan <unk> mini shoulder <unk> / / <unk> # <unk> # <unk> # ? <unk> # & s ; <unk> & qid ; = # & sr ; =
it took me a while to find a new bag this is one could be slightly smaller but i like everything else about it plenty of pockets on the front , sides and even the cover with a few inside the main compartment there is one large zippered compartment on the outside back the inside is divided one side for your computer and the other with pockets and extra large space for larger things or smaller bags has a shoulder strap and a handle to quickly grab it the only problem i had were the metal buckles if you quickly flip the flap over they can make a loud noise if on a hard table or desk i covered them -lrb- with bike inner tube -rrb- to soften the blow i used to have a leather bag but even though this is cloth it still has a nice business look to it
i 've been searching high and low for the perfect computer bag and i finally found it here it 's professional looking in a casual way , which i like plus , it has all kinds of pockets and room to fit so many items i recommend this to anyone
great value for the money ! i purchase a great looking top designer bag for almost four times the price and ended up sending it back because the quality of construction and leather were not as good as this bag love all of the pockets and padded area for laptop it is small it you have a large laptop though my only complaint is the weight it is quite <unk> once you load it with your laptop , some papers and a wallet your shoulder gets sore if you carry it for any length of time other than that it 's great do n't forget to treat it with a leather protectant
my friend had this bag and she loved it -lrb- i did too -rrb- so i decided to get it online the version i received had much cheaper lining than hers and it has started to unravel and fray i still use the bag because the leather is soft and it 's a good size , but i was disappointed in the durability of the interior
this bag is very beautiful - the leather seems like it 's great quality , and it looks really classy unfortunately , the straps are roll straps and when the bag is loaded -lrb- with a computer , etc -rrb- , the straps dig into my shoulder - this would be impossible to carry for any distance also , there are n't any pockets on the outside , so it 's not ideal for commuting , but i could have lived with that if it had been comfortable to carry
i had been carrying around a heavy boring nylon computer bag for a couple of years and while it served me well while traveling for work , it was not very attractive while searching for a replacement , i found the solo vintage leather carryall for laptops and love it it 's stylish , it 's a great color , and it 's of good quality the only thing i wish was different -lrb- and the reason i did n't give it # stars -rrb- is that there could be more to the inside compartments i frequently take my laptop to meetings and there simply are n't enough organizational spaces it could use a couple more pockets
bought this as a birthday present the leather is nice and soft but i worry it will show wear and scratches with use lots of room for other stuff , so it 's more handbag than computer carrier
i thought this would be a pretty nice bag based on the reviews but i have to say , i am very pleased the leather is thick and hearty , but has a luxurious texture i wish it come in fun colors but the brown is classic and understated i find the bag easy to carry and do not mind the round straps one other reviewer complained about the only thing i would change would be to make the liner nice cloth , but the nylon is easy to clean if i needed to do so very happy with this purchase
i have been very pleased with this purchase it is a high quality bag and quite sturdy the inside pockets are roomy and it is easy to keep well organized i recently traveled with the bag and it fit over my rollerboard handle very well it was great to not have the bag over my shoulder throughout the airport it looks very sharp as well the mocha brown is dark enough to go well with black , but looks great with brown and <unk> as well
very nice looking bag , definitely looks as noce as it dose in the pic strong lining , nice pockets i could with that the straps were a <unk> thicker , especially when i have the laptop and a bunch of papers in there , but it does stay on the shoulder quite well and not slip off my friend has a bag with wider straps , but they are starting to look worn , so maybe the sewn round straps on my bag look better because they are not wide and flat .
appearance is professional and love the leather , soft yet sturdy the only reason i did n't give this bag the full # stars is the velcro strap designed to help hold your laptop in place does not tighten enough to securely hold my laptop as snug as i 'd like there is however , ample room in the larger interior section to hold notepad , calendar , binders and smaller pockets that hold cords , a mouse , pen and cell phone the small exterior pocket is handy spot for keys , id badge , or cell but does not have a zipper to secure items inside there is another zippered compartment inside the bag which is handy for other items to be stored i 've only had the bag about two weeks so ca n't comment on durability yet so <unk> , i do like the style , feel and wonderful leather smell
i really like the bag - it beats carrying around the standard laptop bag that looks like a mans gym bag it 's stylish and somewhat feminine it 's nice quality for the price i would recommend this product
got this bag to carry my # `` macbook pro because i needed to <unk> for a few weeks my mac fit with room to spare and this bag holds quite a bit more it looks great and is not an obvious computer bag it does get heavy the more you put in it , but has a handy <unk> pocket on the side that slides over a rolling bag handle for easy toting i use it as a purse as well , especially when my macbook does n't need to come along
case is a little heavy when loaded up but leather is always going to be heavy i have only had it a few weeks but i believe it will hold up
as a business professional going to school and work at the same time , this is the perfect bag not only does it holds my books and ipad but if i need to take my laptop , i can still fit my books in with it the color is perfect , not a light brown yet not black , it goes with practically everything i love the inside blue color because it makes it very easy to find my keys or flash drives the three pockets inside are perfect for my cellphone , wallet and pens -lrb- i can ditch my purse on school nights -rrb- i am very happy with this purchase
perfect for my needs i 'm a home birth <unk> this bag is excellent for carrying charts and laptop professional looking , just the right size my daughter was envious i got her one for her birthday excellent product , excellent price ... much less expensive than the one i originally saw at my local office supply store
great bag for someone with a lap top - sent if for christmas gift , my daughter said she loves it thinking of getting one for myself after hearing how much she is enjoying her gift
i bought this as a gift for my girlfriend who was starting a new job she loves it , i love it i am now a <unk> but the bag itself is definitely well worth the cost it is well constructed , and pleasing to the eye
the leather is high quality and the size is great it does n't have a lot of small specialized pockets , just three larger pockets inside plus a large zip compartment i like this because i carry a small wristlet purse and do n't need things like pen and credit card slots straps are long enough to put over my shoulder even wearing winter coat it holds my # inch macbook , my ipad in its otterbox , all plugs and wires , my purse and numerous other things with room to spare very happy with this
the perfect travel bag for laptop and everything else i love this bag it slips on the handle of my carryon to schlep through the airport and i can use it as a oversized purse when i do n't need my laptop it does n't even bother my shoulders and that 's with the computer in it the interior pockets are just perfect for keeping things organized and it fits under the airplane seat in front of me like i said , the perfect travel bag now i use it as my daily briefcase -- so stylish
this has been great it looks good and suits me i 'm a lawyer and can carry a file and my ipad easily i especially like the fact that you can unzip the bottom of the external pocket and it fits over a roller suitcase handle
this bag is a beautiful <unk> colour i have used it every single day for almost a year and it still looks as good as new it fits my laptop and whatever else i need for the day
this is a great bag it 's got a great capacity to it and it looks great with just about any style it 's also goes with other bags such <unk> klein nancy laptop bag all and all , it 's a terrific bag to have
perfect for work very classy and holds a lot of materials without looking bulky i like the variety of pockets inside i tied a bright silk <unk> on one side to add a little <unk> very lightweight too
i had this in my cart for months before i decided to purchase it i am so glad i did i have had it going on two years and it still looks great i tend to fill it to the max but the handles still look great -lrb- no fraying at all -rrb- also i love that it stands on its own , and the outer pocket unzips at the bottom so it is great for slipping a rolling case handle through it for travel
i was looking for a classy bag i could carry my work home in everything i came across was either extra large in size or made out of a sub-par material this bag is put together very well , beautiful leather and just the right size
it 's a great laptop bag if you want a professional image , this is the bag to get . if you have to walk more than # mins , know it can get a bit heavy filled with a laptop and other documents
lovely streamlined design and comfortable to carry love the zipper & # # ; pocket & # # ; on the back that transforms into a loop to go over your suitcase handle has room for several files and accessories to be carried as well
i bought this two years ago and it is still going strong it stands up to travel very well if this one ever goes and it 's still available , i 'll buy another
the bag has a professional look , it is made of good leather the handles are comfortable the bag is roomy , i can easily fit a book , wallet , a pencil case , sunglasses , etc . , all the essentials i am a <unk> woman -lrb- # ' # -rrb- and the bag does not look too big on me i ca n't say anything about its durability yet
i thought i had reviewed this a while back when i purchased # years ago this is a great bag for your laptop . its great to use in travel and the straps are nice and long it has some very convenient compartments that comes in useful for organizing small stuff this was a great find
i love this bag - it is very attractive and durable as i travel a lot , this is the perfect size to carry my laptop , my ipad and files on the plane
perfect bag for work and school not too big but not too small plenty of room for # & # # ; computer , ipad , a few folders , keys , wallet , all your needs for the day good quality too
i would definitely recommend this bag plenty of room to put my # -inch laptop , and everything else i need for work every day worth the investment really like the leather , really like the look and the size is perfect very satisfied with this purchase
i used this bag all the time and it had been for half a year still like new but the inside pockets doesnt work any more still i love it .
i love this bag the compartment is the perfect size for carrying my little laptop -lrb- although it could hold a much larger one -rrb- , as well as my kindle fire with room for a couple of fire folders as well the bag also has # small pockets perfect for carrying stylus 's , a bottle of aspirin , etc . as well as a larger zipper pocket in addition to the larger main compartment the bag is large enough to carry everything i need for work and school with room to spare for an entire day , no more carrying a tote and a purse in addition to my lunch it also has # small feet so that you can set it down without it flopping over this is a great bag and i 'm thrilled with my purchase i would n't hesitate to buy a solo product again this was worth every penny i paid for it and i anticipate using it for a very long time
my wife absolutely loves this bag she carries it to work everyday and it is perfect for her laptop as well as all of the materials she needs for her meetings the solo vintage bag has quality leather , and it 's not gaudy or overbearing it 's perfect
i use this every day to carry my laptop and books to and from campus i 've used it for one academic year and wish i bought it sooner i am very pleased with this purchase
this leather bag is lovely the overall design and appearance is very sophisticated , sleek and professional lots of room for my laptop and everything else i need to carry the leather is supple i love it and i am glad i bought it
i bought this for my wife as our anniversary gift it was our # rd anniversary and we wanted to do the traditional leather gifts unfortunately we could n't afford the trip to <unk> , italy like we thought we would by now to buy some leather jackets i did find this bag very convenient as her laptop was messed up and i fixed it and needed a new bag to put it in it is a nice looking bag and surprisingly inexpensive for what it is makes me hate how expensive other bags are just bc of a name anyway , i like the inside lining color and so does she it fit her # & # # ; laptop great with other stuff inside it 's only been # months and it looks brand new still hopefully it holds up long enough to make it worth it
case is nice , but this bag is brown , not tan as show in the picture it 's nice , but if you were looking for the saddle color tan like i was , you will be disappointed
this bag is good to hold in hand and well padded inside for laptop protection . i like one more zipper in the first pocket best purchase , i am happy with it thanks amazon for nice deal
this is a terrific laptop case i only wish it were actually the color in the ad it is much darker than the picture it is definitely brown , not tan
great bag for the price unlike many of the other reviewers who purchased this , the bag i received was indeed tan as represented in the picture -lrb- perhaps they upgraded based on feedback ? -rrb- additionally , the bag came way before the delivery estimate very soft leather and seems to be fairly sturdy lots of compartments , including padded section for the laptop could n't be happier with this
this bag is darker than the picture , but it 's a great color the laptop area is padded nicely there is enough room in the other pockets for all the odds and ends a student or professional will need on day to day basis solo will be my first stop when it comes time to replace this bag
i could hardly believe that they were selling this bag for this price -lrb- # . # when i brought it # / # -rrb- it looks really stylish and the shoulder strap is quite comfortable i have a dell studio # with the extended battery that fits great in it i really like the accessory pocket for pens etc and the back section for papers this is a recommended buy
while the concept is great , the execution leaves much to be desired sure it is oversize , but the form makes it bulky and unwieldy to hold the bag i had to return the bag
bag well constructed , but a little more bulky than what i expected would have liked it in a more <unk> down version will definitely protect your pc it will accomodate a # inch laptop good for carrying extras along as well
i was looking for a good laptop bag <unk> hold both my laptop and my supplies for my college classes as i was looking through my options many offered the function i had wanted but not the <unk> that i normally like to sport and then as you already know i came across these <unk> bags . their vintage style is both beautiful and unique and the option i thought was quite nice was it had many different sizes to accomidate you laptop if you stuff the bag the flap obviously doesnt lay flat but if you keep it organized its a great laptop bag
it 's too big to be considered `` cute `` ... i am not sure that the `` coolness `` factor is there , even with the maroon <unk> back and shoulder pad the lady 's head on the side of the bag is nearly as large as my own i almost feel like i am toting her around it 's more like a small suitcase ... perfect to stuff for a vegas weekend getaway , though so , take heed to the dimensions of # . # x # . # x # . # inches and yes , it is heavy at # pounds a petite woman under # ' # `` might think twice before buying it
i love this bag i find it is better than imagined the bag is so well made , sturdy , reinforced and really cute i get many compliments i 've had it for # mo plus and still have no complaints i 'm glad i found this bag if it ever wears out i will definitely buy another one it is quite large so keep that in mind if you want something for a small laptop that is the only thing i can think of ; in the future , i might have a smaller computer and therefore will hope to find this same bag in a smaller size
i love this bag ! ! got a brand new sony vaio to stick in it too . this bag was <unk> better than i imagined it to be beautiful item , so well made i live in the uk and ordered from the states because i wanted one so much ! very protective , and lots of space for my notebooks , pens and whatever else i fancy no doubt this is a gorgeous bag stand out from the crowd
i have wanted this bag for a while and bought a google chrome book and decided to buy this bag even though the chrome book is small for this bag i love this bag ! its super cute and has a laptop sleeve included , has room for computer accessories or a small notebook and is lightweight enough to tote around town i may buy another for my full size laptop
best laptop backpack for the buck there are other hard-shelled packs out there , but <unk> expensive the hard <unk> provides great protection the position of the straps and overall balance of the <unk> wonderfully ergonomic quick access pouches are convenient and well-designed the <unk> of the laptop pocket <unk> any worries to rest regarding protection one of the best packs out there with only <unk> , the zippers the manner in which they are attached to the <unk> flimsy if logitech was to seriously reinforce the <unk> the zippers to the material of the pack , i would give this pack # stars all the way around
the look , feel and size are perfect my only disappointment is that the black shell is a soft plastic -- that looks a feels great , but it 's fragile and scratches quite easily
other than the bag being a tad bigger than i originally thought , this thing is the best since i live in dc , commuter town of the us , this bag has proven it 's just not for the laptop <unk> i also use it to cram all those <unk> groceries , milk , <unk> , wine , etc . and it balances on my back no matter what 's in it i also have gotten random people and my coworkers that have come up and asked where i got it because they really like it my only complaint is with myself that i did n't buy two ... cuz when this one dies , i 'm gon na be lost i recommend this bag to any commuter or anyone that wants to carry most of their daily needs on their back and still have room and comfort to carry more
the backpack is overall very good but it do have few minor issues ... e.g . , the bag is not waterproof that made my documents wet when it rained while i was walking back home another thing to notice is that the compartments do not have enough space to accomodate laptop and cord at same place one has to open two compartments separately and fully to access laptop and cord a small side pocket within laptop compartment would have been more convenient the outer hard shell provides good protection but it can be easily scratched
i am thoroughly pleased with this back pack it fits well on the shoulders plenty of compartments big enough to easily hold # laptops with room to spare love the sleek design and functionality for electronics * see my <unk> <unk> about keeping the shell scratch free
i have this bags for almost # months now and it had been a really great bag i was looking for a job and travelled all around the country with all kind of stuff loaded into this bag i have been asked by atleast # <unk> about this bag it looks really professional at the same time its a back pack there have been issues with the front being scratched but considering what it has been through in this short time , most bags would have given away i also got it in an awesome deal for only $ # , so it was way worth it
i got it at an amazing price but it is not that easy for me to use this fresh , green bag with my clothes of dark style plus , do n't put too much stuff in it because there is a big <unk> on the face of the bag
this is a great bag for a <unk> low price well made and i 'm sure it will last a lifetime i have a dell studio # and it fits with a little room left for accessories and some files , yay ! ! the best feature : handles
this is a really cute bag , it looks like it costs more than it does it 's well made and i like the fact that it has a handle unlike many sleeves i recommend it to someone wanting a smaller bag it does n't hold a ton of stuff besides a computer , i do n't use this bag for air travel , i use it locally and i love it my # `` macbook pro fits in it perfectly
i just started using this bag for my hp # . # `` laptop and what a find finding a bag to fit a # . # `` is hard to come by , and everything i 'd found was either , plain black , bulky , pink and girlie , or outrageously priced although it is not intended for this size , and the laptop fits -lrb- only in the main compartment , not the intended interior sleeve -rrb- , it is well padded and feels protected i can still fit my power cables and mouse , with a little space left over i like the carry handles , although it could do with a longer , shoulder strap i am very pleased with the style of it - looks like many of the products that sell for several times the price for under fifteen bucks , well worth it
i was surprised to get a completely different bag than the one pictured that 's because targus has completely redesigned the bag , i owned the original cuct # b , which now has the <unk> cuct # <unk> # i loved my bag , but it was damaged with salt water , and so i had to replace it the picture here is not what you get very frustrating and confusing to sellers as well , i 'm sure
i have owned this backpack for # years and have used it only a <unk> of times for travelling the backpack itself has a nice design , with plenty of storage and pockets the reason i decided to write a review is that the seams on the shoulder straps are ripping apart this is either poor workmanship or poor design either way not happy my previous backpack that i gave to my college son # years ago still looks and works great i would not buy a targus backpack again because of this
the bag is very similar to what i need but i really needed it to have the same red targus emblem on the top it shows it in the picture but it is not on the bag the one i recieved is black and <unk>
there are some really nice features in this bag it appears to be sturdy and well made the pockets are adequate for several files and office essentials , my quart bag of <unk> products , and my jacket i probably would have kept the bag except that the material was so rough that it irritated the back of my arms and neck i 'm a smallish woman , so a larger person may not have the issues with rubbing i returned the bag and purchased the case logic check-point friendly bag which i like very well
this is the # nd targus backpack i have bought for my husband i did a lot of research on various brands he loves this one and it 's reasonably priced the style is simple but very functional very good quality and great for a lap top i 'd reccomend this to anyone in the middle age group as the style is subtle but yet handsome
had backpack for month ; several domestic and one major international trip zip-thru work well in us checkpoints but not at international airports -lrb- london , amsterdam , <unk> and <unk> ; must pull laptop -rrb- not as many compartments as other backpacks , but looks more professional when attending business meetings -lrb- all black , minimal zippers -rrb- getting files in and out is a little more difficult than typical laptop briefcase also note that when packed will not fit under some international coach seats -lrb- due to entertainment systems controls -rrb- or regional jets seas fits easily into the overhead easy to carry on your back and also on rollaway suitcase overall , very good product ; would recommend to others who travel or like a backpack vs. briefcase style
i 've used this for almost a year to carry my laptop to and from work i 've also taken it on multiple business trips it 's still in perfect condition and has worked very well the checkpoint-friendly feature is great as i 've never had to take my laptop out for security it 's plain black and <unk> , but that 's what i want for business
i travel monday through thursday every week , and going through security and protecting my back are both concerns this backpack has been perfect for keeping me comfortable , organized , and <unk> through security , since i just unzip the middle and send it on through the only annoying thing is that just because i 'm ready to go through does n't mean the people struggling in front of me in line are
i love this backpack i use it mainly for airline travel it is so easy and convenient to simply unzip the middle zipper , lay the pack on the belt and fly through security the straps are padded and comfortable the middle `` handle `` between the two straps sometimes rubs the back of my neck , but it is not intolerable i am able to fit a ton of stuff into this pack : my laptop , cords , hotspot , purse , book , shoes , etc . it 's a great carry-on
the laptop back pack is much bigger than i thought you can easily take all your gear and a full weekend worth of clothes and the laptop protection was better than i thought way to go
i travel a great deal for work i have had many different bags -lrb- some on the cheap side and some , like my tumi i still have today -rrb- i was looking for a backpack that would be tsa friendly and not have & # # ; # & # # ; different compartments -lrb- why so many zippers -rrb- this bag was perfect the price was good , quality has been great -lrb- remember i travel and this bag takes some punishment -rrb- and i love the fold out when going through the airport security it also has a very professional -lrb- business -rrb- appeal , which is a plus going into meetings i would recommend this bag to anyone , even non travelers
i 've had this backpack for over a year ; i fly twice a month , and carry it # days a week i love that it 's expandable , and the tsa feature is great - i have never been questioned about sending my laptop through without removing it the backpack has plenty of space , and once through security i usually stuff my north face jacket in the flip open tsa section to keep it stored during flights there are lots of small compartments and dividers to hold chargers , first aid supplies , batteries , kindle fire and my cordless mouse
i bought this for my wife to use with her macbook pro , and she was immediately disappointed with its lack of functionality , ie , lack of storage pockets , and ease of access to your notebook is non-existant she also thought that while it was trendy , it was a bit bulky for a # `` laptop she found a more functional but still `` cute `` looking one at target for about the same price
i do love the fact that this item is study and light weight i was not able to use with my favorite laptop because the sleeve with a computer is a little tighter than expected i can still you the bag but the sleeve had to be tossed i would purchase this again if it were just a little bigger
as all built products , this laptop case is made of superior materials my only comment is that due to the case 's shape it does <unk> a ladies bag -lrb- my wife loves it -rrb-
this product is great the only problem is that my # `` widescreen laptop does n't fit into the removable sleeve i therefore use the sleeve for paper and just put my laptop next to the sleeve
love this bag it is nice because it is not too big and boxy like regular laptop bags it is nice and light , the strap is sturdy prevent swinging back and forth the little pocket is nice as you can remove it and use it separately
looks great , even works great for a while however on my first trip where i actually packed it close to full the laptop compartment zipper failed . the failure resulted in my laptop crashing to the floor while going through customs , . it survived but is badly dented i would not recommend this to anyone who wants to take laptop and camera in one backpack . find another make
i 've used this bag as my primary laptop case for quite a while it is a good size , the compartments for gear and laptop are well padded , and it 's lightweight compared to some other photo backpacks it 's almost the perfect laptop bag however , the weatherproof zipper on the laptop compartment is hard to use and splits open easily -lrb- but is at least <unk> if your fingers are strong enough to move the zipper -rrb- it has gotten worse over time and i 've had to order another brand to replace it the other zippers are lightweight as well i wish they made this same bag with heavy duty zippers
the laptop compartment is nice and well padded , but the shoulder straps are not the zipper gets hung up very easily on the laptop compartment the camera compartment is very nice , easily adjustable and well padded there is adequate room for a large dslr and additional <unk> the top compartment is about the same size ... not very big , can fit a jacket maybe some cables and a few more accessories , but thats about it i feel like as a combo -lrb- camera/laptop -rrb- pack it does the job very well , but separately as a backpack or camera bag its not very useful it severely lacks additional pockets and quality zippers also a tripod holder would have been nice summary : it definitely does its job as advertised , but not the best solution i think it is a bit pricey at $ #
i bought this backpack to carry a nikon d # and an extra lens , and wanted the ability to carry a laptop if i wanted the bag works well for that much gear , and has room in the camera section for extra batteries , memory cards , etc . the backpack section is small with this type of arrangement , but it will hold enough items for a day trip , including lunch i like the ability to carry this much without needing a separate computer bag , or carrying a bag that obviously contains a computer or camera equipment the bag is sturdy , and protects your gear note that all the protection built into this bag means it is not easily compressed to fit tight overhead bins -lrb- like on a bus -rrb- , but that means your stuff is n't getting compressed either good size for carrying around for the day just do n't expect it to be your only luggage
by far this is the best tamrac made -lrb- for me -rrb- previously , i had a tamrac <unk> shoulder bag if you 've ever had to carry a full on shoulder bag you know it can be a pain for your shoulder the best is still a backpack that distributes the weight over both shoulders the <unk> # is the perfect fit for my laptop and my dslr + a lens and a flash
i needed something that would hold two camera bodies and a few extra lenses and a laptop this bag is perfect for that i love the amount of space it has , it holds everything i need it to hold if i get more equipment though , i 'll need more room the only thing i 've noticed that i do n't like is the zipper on the laptop compartment it 's so tough to open i like my zippers smooth overall this is a great buy it 's very sturdy and feels like it 's protecting my equipment
this backpack is great for the combination of carrying a laptop computer , your camera gear and a small day pack area for other items this is good for one camera , lens , and flash with room for a few more accessories the price is right
the backpack was heavier than expected due to the quality the computer will be well protected as the cushion is firm i love the camera compartment flexibility with the velcro bits that you can rearrange the size of each compartment is generous for the size of the pack i wish it had a <unk> strap , but so far that is the only drawback i have found
great backpack & camera bag i just used this while hiking and sightseeing in hawaii and had no problem carrying a cannon # d i used the top area for personal items -lrb- jacket , <unk> snacks -rrb- , the elastic side mesh area for water bottles and the other compartment for my # inch laptop and kindle the weight in the bag was distributed comfortably and it never felt heavy
bought one of these new about a year ago , put it to almost daily -lrb- but gentle -rrb- use and the zipper of the laptop compartment gave up the ghost a week ago i expected better from lowepro without that i would give this pack # stars but <unk> is n't all it takes to satisfy the customer longevity is definitely an issue with an item at this price level
i like this bag it is solidly made , has good padding , especially for the computer section it fits my nikon d # s with a # f/ # . # lens attached , which many bags can not handle the size is big but manageable but i can only give it # stars because of the lack of pockets/compartments to stow small items perhaps i am spoiled by my old <unk> bag , which had abundant pockets , compartments on # sides , and a rain cover this bag also lacks an easy way to attach a tripod or monopod overall , this bag is ok for carrying teh basics with a big lens , but do n't look for it to do more than that
this bag has -lrb- almost -rrb- everything you need the design of this bag is thoughtful there are places for filters , memory cards , remotes , nice separators for lenses it opens from the side for easy access a place for your lunch and some water it even has a rain cover except there is no place for a tripod that 's a deal breaker , and kind of silly when you consider how easy it would be to add and they did add it on the # aw -- get that one instead
the only thing from this backpack missing is one of the most obvious - a sternum strap to keep the straps from slipping off of your shoulders this would be a perfect backpack if not for that feature - or lack <unk>
enough room for a # inch macbook and an ipad i could probably fit a # inch macbook and a macbook air if needed only concern is that it feels a little like the camera could slide out when the flap is opened on a table fit all of my things inside very good zippers , great straps lots of pockets for pens , cables , batteries , chargers , small flashlight and anything else i want to store
it 's a great product it meets my overall needs the only little surprise i had was that the upper chamber for miscellaneous items is a little too small but i do n't blame anybody , as the bag is designed to be so if there is a convenient way to tie the tripod to the bag , that would be great overall , i am happy with my purchase
camera . . extra lens . . and much more fit in this pak lots of room for everything camera related & then some removable sections are great its a little bulky but it does fit under the airline seat even when loaded to the max
this bag is built to last my problem is that i quickly out grew it however not before it traveled to ireland , <unk> , and many places in the usa never had a problem with this bag fitting in the overheads of the airlines now i 'm looking for a bigger model lowepro
nice backpack , good working space , well built , comfortable to wear i used it locally but have yet to take it on an extended <unk> product was as advertised and i like it
