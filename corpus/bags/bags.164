i have a dell inspiron # z and it fits perfectly in the sleeve with a little bit of extra space that is enough to fit the charger too , that i keep in a <unk> bag it did n't have a strong smell and the design is adorable very good sleeve indeed . :
i bought this product and very disapointed of it slow . even to switch between internet sites in takes about # seconds <unk> to get there i am thinking if upgrading memory will solve it from # m to # m or # mb . is it possible
i got my inspiron # just a few hours ago , but i 'm already returning it the first and most important problem is that the two touchpad mouse buttons do n't work on mine i think it 's just defective , but that is a pretty major defect despite that though , it is a flawed system with horrible performance nobody expects to run <unk> or the latest games on these devices , but an internet <unk> window on a normal site should n't result in a crash , nor should dell 's support software this device holds a lot of promise , but simply does n't live up to it i normally love dell -- i am typing this review on one now however , the inspiron mini simply is n't up to their prior standards
it 's a netbook , so know what you are buying if you purchase one netbook does not mean small laptop folks the reviews where people complain it is slow are usually because they do n't understand what a netbook is only complaints really were the description on amazon was not # % accurate regarding the os and display resolution also , if you have a nice wireless router , and have your `` n `` network running on # ghz only , this wo n't pick it up i do n't believe the built in wireless n card does n't seem to be able to see the # ghz range
i bought it almost a year ago , and when it was new , battery life was awsome , it lasted for more than # hours , now has it has decreased a bit other than that the screen , keyboard and light weighted is a plus very good notebook
i recommend this netbook to everyone , in spite of being mini , the keyboard is very comfortable to work and it has the perfect size to carry it on however i did not enjoy so much the windows # starter version , it 's very slow , but you can always get another version , so it 's not really a problem very satisfied with my purchase . # % recommended
purchase of the notebook style computer has added mobility , convenience and fun to our computing needs we are impressed wit the features and performance of this notebook computer the window # and office starter software very adequately handle our computing and internet access tasks
i had expected to use it for travel only , but this is my ` go to ' computer for all uses agree with the ` less than stellar ' performance of other reviews initially , now exceptional upgrades including tune up utilities -lrb- removes all the things the computer thinks it should be doing instead of what you want it to do -rrb- , # gb memory and ssd # gb it is as quick as full powered laptop i think the best performance upgrade is the tune up utilities - free trial download
better price here than buying on d * ll good running little netbook - wireless reception could be a little stronger but over all this is a nice machine if you like dell products then this is another winner
i received this little computer new in the box it had never been opened and was just exactly what i was looking for the price was perfect and the computer works great it arrived so quickly that i was surprised when it arrived
this macbeth laptop sleeve -lrb- <unk> <unk> design -rrb- does n't look as nice as pictured i was very disappointed , as the green is actually this neon yellow-green and it looks terrible with the white there is also no light blue on it as pictured the sleeve decently protects my laptop , but the design looks very cheap because of the coloring i would not have purchased it if the product pictures were actually accurate
design is super cute i wish there were more padding and that it was a tighter fit i feel like my laptop slides around in the sleeve and that it is n't protected well enough good for the price
i have a asus vivobook , it 's # & # # ; screen which means the laptop is # . # & # # ; the fit was pretty tight at first , a struggle to get the zipper shut over the corners but that has improved a little with use though i do tend to find myself leaving it unzippered
i 'm disappointed because there is a flaw in the fabric the pink has <unk> across the cover it looks cheap and horrible it would have been fine had there been some quality control in not selling defective cases
the measurements are more like around # by # inches a little too big for my # . # dell laptop but the pattern is really cute , i got the leopard and pink one
bought this thinking it would be little more heavy , but it still protects my laptop i would n't use this if i transported my laptop a lot there 's no place to keep the power charger
my # . # inch lenovo yoga notebook would not fit in this case plus , the padding is really light , which means that you ca n't carry put it in your backpack without the possibility of the laptop getting banged up by other books and day to day travel otherwise , the colors were nice and vibrant , and for someone who travels with a laptop <unk> or does not carry much stuff , this would be a good case
i ordered this sleeve for my work laptop this sleeve is way bigger than expected i can put my # & # # ; laptop in it and there is still room i would recommend getting something smaller if you have a # & # # ; laptop i gave it three stars because it is cute
i love colour , its fun to own one , but i accidentally bought the sleeve i was planning to buy a laptop acer , but put the sleeve on my wishlist so now i owned a nice sleeve without laptop the next step a laptop but it fun to look at it
i like this little bag if you will , idk what to call it , not really a carrying case but a nice little zip up storage to protect my laptop . perhaps a jacket ? and its very cute
brightly colored and affordable , this is a nice little case it has a decent zipper and fits my laptop well as advertised the padding is a bit thin so i left the styrofoam that shipped with the laptop inside the case
i bought this for my gateway laptop , which though it is a # . # inch , is really longer than a usual # . # this sleeve fits my laptop perfectly and thus far has prevented damage very well i 've used it in backpacks and duffle bags without issue the quality is the same as when i bought it , except from where a friends cat took an interest
its a little bit too big for my macbook pro # & # # ; , just for anyone who reads reviews about the product before they buy them i allows room for you to carry some things with it a couple of junk drives , cds , or dvd 's , even a notebook or calendar the product looks exactly like the picture not too thick , but enough , especially if you are going to carry it within another bag , like a book bag
very fair price for what you get i wish the fabric was thicker so it 'd protect more , but its still good and does it 's job good quality , all the stitching seems really strong the colours are a little more <unk> and <unk> as opposed to shades of brown , but i like it that way good piece , would be hard to find a better deal
this is a nice cover for my daughter 's lap top she needed something to protect her laptop while <unk> it in her backpack for college it fits the bill and is also fashionable
i bought this for my toshiba # . # & # # ; laptop and it fits perfectly i 'm not sure if there is enough space to hold all the cords , but it can at least hold a mouse and mouse pad i love the pattern , it is super bright and fun it had a weird <unk> smell when i first got it , but it faded after a few days i would recommend this case for anyone who has a widescreen laptop
i purchased this sleeve for my hp laptop -lrb- knowing that it was a bit larger than i needed -rrb- , but it matched the sleeve that i have for my ipad # so it worked the description reads `` <unk> <unk> `` by the product i received was of the `` macbeth collection `` ; which , again , did n't bother me since i have the macbeth collection for my ipad # overall , i would recommend this product for its style and lightness given the opportunity , i can say with <unk> that i would once again purchase this <unk> just wish that the description would have been correct from the <unk> so i could have purchased it sooner
i got this today and i love it fits my # . # inch hp perfectly the only thing is that it looks more blue and green on the screen , but it 's more blue and yellow-green in person
i am highly satisfied with this product it works perfect for a # . # `` computer , it still have a little more room so your computer is not squished in it also it is a bright color and i love it :
perfect fit to my laptop and the feature picture matches the actual design cushion is of a good thickness , however , there is little structure to the sleeve if that 's what you are looking for i am very pleased with it and think it is perfect if you plan to place it in another carrier for transport due to the extra protection additional structure would provide no room for any wires or accessories if that 's what you also expect i am very pleased all around - my expectation of a stylish sleeve with decent cushioning was met
decent case for the price it 's a little brighter than it looks in the picture , but it looks good the neoprene is nice and think and will definitely keep a laptop dry if you spill on it or something in a bag zipper is also fairly substantial i 've been using this for about a month and i 'm really happy with it ... especially for the price
love the <unk> print , which has caught some attention around the office would be good if it fit my # . # inch dell a little tighter but seems a good sturdy item which should offer some extra protection for my laptop while it travels around inside my shoulder bag and backpack
this case looks awesome , but it 's super thin and doesnt actually provide much padding it 's fine for just basically <unk> your computer from getting dusty but it certainly wouldnt be travel worthy if you just want a fun funky case this is very nice looking , but dont buy this for <unk>
this is a cute way to carry my lenovo laptop it 's a simple yet functional design i recommend this product the only things i would improve would be if the zipper was a little larger - the teeth are fairly small and i am concerned about their wearing out over time it would be nice if this had a small outside pocket , but that is n't a standard feature on a sleeve
fit my laptop very well is very cute and protects my computer from getting scratched in my backpack i wish there was a little more padding on the case
this sleeve is exactly what i was looking for the colors are true to the picture shown it is not really padded , so it definitely will not protect from a serious fall but if your like me and just needed some light protection to slip into my backpack for college , it 's perfect it fits my hp <unk> # . # inch well there is no extra room for a charger , just my laptop it does stretch some overall , just what i wanted for a much cheaper price
this is a really cute case fits my # inch laptop perfectly with a little room to spare , but not too much keeps my laptop protected i have had to run out to my car from class several times in the pouring rain and it never got wet ! ! ! great case , highly reccommend
i just love the color , the length is perfect for my laptop , it came in timely manner and i just really like the selections they carry i would recommend this product if you want to spice up your armor for your electronic products
looked better than pictured in the image , and i was pleased at the quality of the laptop sleeve i 'm very happy with it the # . # inch fits the macbook perfectly and will even fit if you have additional rubber casing around your laptop
item arrived fast and is nice quality for the money i am buying a second one as a gift it keeps my lap top safe when i travel or just for storage
this is the prettiest laptop sleeve there is it is a little small , so i only recommend it if you have a skinny laptop i have a samsung series # and the sleeve fits beautifully i love the material , which seems to be protecting my laptop really well , the zippers work perfectly , and the design is exactly as the picture i highly recommend it
i needed a simple sleeve , with just a little color to it , for my laptop this one delivered it 's made very well , the padding is plush enough that i feel secure having my laptop inside , and it 's gorgeous i 've gotten lots of compliments on it and i highly recommend it
i brought this item for college to put my dell inspiron # in it i was of course unsure of it fitting but it is the perfect size and do gorgeous and vivid the picture does it no justice i love it
love this case , bought it for my # `` # inch compaq presario cq # laptop , its just a little lose but not a big deal and it looks just like the
the laptop sleeve is not only stylish but protects my laptop from getting scratched it 's even got a cleaning cloth <unk> which is pretty handy if wanting to clean you screen
this macbeth collection laptop sleeve was exactly what i was looking for it was the perfect size to fit my laptop and such a great price for the nice design it was
i like it it definitely keeps my laptop dry when it rains and in my backpack i like leopard prints and a hot pink that looks purple to me . purple is my fave color so this is ideal for me in terms of style and print as well as protecting my laptop from getting wet it is a good way for me to protect and <unk> my laptop in style good price for i received i would recommend it i only have had it in my possession for a month and i used it once to head outdoors with laptop so far
i was definitely looking for a sleeve that was pretty and durable and i think this means my requirements and can fit my macbook with the case protector in it
this sleeve is great if you do n't need a strong case for complete protection i bought this for extra cushion in my book bag i just needed to protect from scuffs and shuffling it around in my bag , not to protect from drops or dings the macbeth sleeve is perfect for what i need , and the colors are vibrant and stylish also , the neoprene is cushion enough for my needs it came with a <unk> piece inside the sleeve for shipping , i kept this inside to provide extra cushion
this sleeve is both cute and fashionable it is a perfect fit for my moms hp laptop i got her for christmas she loves it it protects her laptop from getting marks from scratches and dings
i love love love this ! i decided to buy # and the colors and materials are so beautiful ... just great ... the leopard design brings a tiny little fabric -lrb- i do n't know the real name -rrb- for cleaning your laptop
so soft and pretty ! : -rrb- i bought this sleeve to fit my # . # `` dell laptop , and it fits perfectly it does n't provide extra padding , but it 'll help prevent scratches for sure so i recommend using this along with a padded laptop <unk>
either i did not study the description well enough or was not clearly depicted no way this will accommodate more than # external drives , and be prepared to have to pick up one of the drives cause i don ' t see how the straps are going to hold them securely maybe for flash drives , big deal , they fit in your pocket . # drives , big deal do n't waste your money , keep looking
i bought this thinking it would be great to keep in my backpack to keep things organized do n't bother the items slip out of the grid it had good reviews , but i do n't agree
when you see the pictures , this looks like a great organizer however , in reality , it is not nearly as useful i could not fit in anywhere near the number of things that are shown in the picture as it were , it took up more room than if i put everything in a soft sided organizer use for socks
with all the elastic , the board has to be sturdy enough to remain flat i 'd hoped to spread all my accessories across a new , thin profile laptop bag this device is so thick it did n't fit once the a/c block was attached
be aware : this thing is thick and heavy i fly # + times per year and needed to <unk> and free up space in my laptop bag i had high hopes for this product but it takes up more space than it frees up it is almost # `` thick , and weighs as much as about a hardcover book i am sorely disappointed
well the idea sounds great and looks good in the pictures but in practice it is small and i could not get much stuff on it and the stuff fell out when i put this in my backpack
i really liked the looks of this organizer case and finally ordered one that was # & # # ; i <unk> with it before a recent trip abroad and finally decided to leave it at home when my electronics were secured to the grid , they took up a lot more room than when i nestled them in a soft-sided jewelry bag i could not fit all the adapters onto the rather small grid i had ordered for me the <unk> jewelry bag works better it could be the grid -lrb- and probably one of the larger sizes -rrb- would be better to slide in & out of a briefcase or purse for local travel
i had hoped that this device would bring <unk> order to my messy man-purse the proportions were just right for the bag however , the grid-it is fairly thick , and i underestimated the extent to which this would add weight to the bag and simply take up <unk> space i had hoped that the organization would make it possible for me to fit more in the bag , but in fact i was able to store less i would recommend that the grid-it be used with bigger bags than the size of the organizer , or in situations where organization is more important to you than the capacity of your bag
i expected this to hold more wires and more importantly to hold them in place it 's good for headphones and small cell phone charging wires but my pocket size external hard drive never stays in place and my laptops power supply is a lost
this is a decent tool i have not been overly impressed for the price depending on your needs , you may be better off going for something like the <unk> universal electronics accessories travel organizer i have both and have been using the <unk> organizer far more often than the grid-it !
while the grid it is great at organizing computer travel accessories , i found this one too small for my needs i carry cord for lap top , ipad , travel <unk> , i-phone etc i would recommend getting the larger
the item description did not say size and i thought it would be about # & # # ; x # & # # ; which is the same as one i purchased earlier for the same price this item as # & # # ; by # & # # ; it was a gift and i felt it was less than i had anticipated giving
it does not have the zipper pocket for extra storage as posted on the site i kind of wish i had bought the bigger one but was not sure if it would have been too big i did try and put objects in the straps and it worked wonderfully ! ! i do like that part of the product can not wait to use it on my next trip it is a good deal for the price
i wanted something to keep my cords and chargers -lrb- ipad , iphone , camera , etc . -rrb- i ca n't seem to fit everything as compact as shown in the product <unk> i have tried multiple times and different <unk> probably a pouch with some velcro ties could work just as well as this item
it 's a great idea i ended up finding that i just threw my stuff in my back and taking this out to organize everything was just more work that it was worth
i ordered two of these , the one shown and a smaller one in gray it will hold all the small items that i hate digging for in my purse but there is not a zippered pocket as described i really needed one for receipts the smaller gray one does have a zipper pocket
it is smaller than you would expect it is sturdy and holds great would be great if the back side had a clip for the ipad mini -lrb- makes the perfect organizer if it did !
i feel like i spend more time trying to figure out how to organize dumb little things in this thing rather than just putting it in the pockets of my briefcase with all your & # # ; items & # # ; attached to the cocoon it makes the overall item kind of large one thing it has been useful for is my camera bag with things like wires , remotes , etc . if you dont have pockets in your bag for some odd reason then this would work for you
ca n't use it as supposed too thick to put in small bag and no reason to use in big bag i guess bigger size is more reasonable to be used as organizer
not what i expected , but a good organizer for travel or home and office it is a firm backing with <unk> bands that will hold any number of items in one place
its a great way to organize your chargers , cables , pens anything you are taking on a trip , after a little use some of the straps loose there <unk> but not to
works as described but thinking about <unk> one size bigger fits snug into my notebook case and really got all my cables and accesories organized i have a # & # # ; notebook and would recommed the # & # # ; version
when i first saw the grid-it online , i thought it was really messy looking and not worth it after seeing it in person and in practical use , i was turned around after trying to buy other organizers for my electronics , i decided that the versatility of the grid-it cant be beat it is true you will sometimes wish you had one more certain size elastic band here or there but it still does better than some other organizers out there i did also purchase the amazonbasics <unk> travel case as well which i love but does n't always hold everything i need the way i like it one negative thing about this is that since there are so many elastic bands , the rubber is exposed and you can really smell that in the product if you like being somewhat organized at least , and too lazy to make your own custom organizer , this product is for you
this is a good idea , but i 'll caution you to not expect to easily hold larger items i use this to carry cords and chargers , and for larger chargers , they can slip out reasonably easily not all the time , but it 's not a great fit for slimmer items , cords , flash drives and the like , it works great could be an issue with the smaller size of this case , but i do n't think so if the straps were just a bit stickier , i think that would help a great deal
omg this is so great wish i had thought of it i used it for the first time traveling for two weeks it was so great to keep all my cords together and always know where they were in my luggage
this holds a lot of kit better than any bag i use it in for all my laptop accessories it makes it very easy to find the item you want
organizer case -lrb- <unk> # bk -rrb- this is a great idea , but it is larger than i really need for my purse if it were # & # # ; x # & # # ; smaller and double sided , it would be
use these in my briefcase to hold all the little stuff and cords i carry around with me i actually use two of them of the smaller ones in my briefcase just what i needed
i bought this as an add-on to help organize my purse i 've seen other comments on weight and thickness , and do want to address them specifically it 's as thick as the description said - . # inches , almost a half inch i think it will be a lot thicker when i add things to it , but that 's ok it does weigh more than i thought it would this version does n't have a zipper sleeve in the back , and does have a hanging hook those little <unk> lines those are rubber <unk> to hang onto your stuff those <unk> are why i decided to buy this instead of making it - and i 'm glad i made that choice i 'll update if there end up being problems , but i think i 'm going to be happy with this , once i slot everything in to where i want it to be
a pretty simple idea and product but it works i have tried just about everything to organize the mess of cables , chargers and such in my brief case and carry on bag and this works better than most
i got tired of digging to the bottom of my bag for & # # ; things & # # ; grid-it solved that infinitely & # # ; customizable & # # ; , the stretchy straps feel very durable and seem <unk> to lose their hold anytime soon now , everything is in it 's place and easy to grab
these are much more useful than they might at first appear and you do pay for their uniqueness but , having the price behind me now , i really like it and always use it for little pieces of tech when traveling
my girlfriend got this for me to help organize all of my <unk> it works pretty well it is n't the best for my mpb charger , but definitely is a better option for all of my chargers than throwing them in to a bag and spending # minutes <unk> the <unk> of cords i would suggest this product
robust and reliable what more can you ask for sometimes i wish i had bought a larger one but then i realize that i would need a bigger bag than i already have i suggest that you consider cutting out a piece of cardboard the same size and fitting it into your bag before deciding on which of the many grid-it sizes you wish to buy do n't forget to take into account the thickness of your items you want to strap in i do get a few looks from co-workers that wish they had one at times i do n't regret getting it i only wish that the straps were <unk> sometimes but i think i am wishing for too much
this is a great organizer keeps everything secure and at your fingertips i love to use the grid-it when i travel , keeps all my chargers , lip gloss , pens , etc . together and not lost at the bottom of my bag
i bought this primarily for a case that my tablet goes in ... perfect size this is such an <unk> idea , love it i am able to add a lot of small items & not have them become lost my one drawback is the black color one is about $ # less than the red or blue , come on now , the color should n't add anything to the price
i use this on my video shoots to hold my batteries , cf cards , audio recorder and chargers these items used to be <unk> in my camera bag , and always made finding them a chore i love how flexible this cocoon is , and it has helped me clean up my life : -rrb- a great price , and a product that is worth it i ca n't even <unk> how many hours it 's probably saved me , not having to look for things
this is the perfect size for my carry on luggage keeps everything sung , while easy to access very sturdy straps and board , which exceed my expectations the straps have a bit of rubber dots on them which helps the grips factor this works so well , i will be purchasing the smaller one for my briefcase if you line up your cables and plug in a usb hub , the is no need to remove anything , just leave the charging cord extended travel made easier
should have went a size up i did n't count for the fact that putting items on would narrow down which bands were available i will order a size up next time great & easy way to keep <unk> organized light weight and easy i travel a lot & this makes hunting for cords when flying or getting settled into a rental super easy
i love this product i am so add and i have a terrible time keeping up with plugs , adapters , thumb drives , <unk> and all the other electronic accessories for my ipad and iphone this is just perfect i can just put it in my purse and i have everything i need i will be ordering more of these in the future for other items i need to organize
if you have lots of cables in your bag , then this is a must buy this model is just a little smaller than a sheet of paper it holds all the cables that carry around my bag i does n't just hold cables i also have many other little things that i carry around this is one of the most useful accessories i have bought in many years
wonderful way to pack small items that would be harder to gather up if they were loose in my bag now i know exactly where they all are - in the same place on my cocoon have started making really nice laptop bags that all come with one of these
i 'm pleasantly surprised that this product exceeded my expections i am not good at keeping all my different charger cords , attachment cords , cleaning cloths etc . organized this fits perfectly in my ipad travel case -lrb- almost exactly the same dimensions as the ipad air -rrb- the back works as a mouse pad if you need it very , very happy with this product
i carry a bunch of stuff with me every day , money stuff , medicine , writing implement , <unk> meter , <unk> , <unk> , knife , tissues my ` murse ' became like grandma 's pocketbook -lrb- minus the ancient <unk> -rrb- , containing everything , but none of it where i could find it i tried bags with a lot of pockets , organizer inserts , etc with no success the grid-it allows me to arrange my stuff as i want -lrb- with the many elastics -rrb- and best of all to see it without <unk> i feel like i 've gotten an hour a day back that i used to spend looking for things it does take up most of the space in my bag so i ca n't add a lot , but that 's not such a bad thing
the product is fantastic , the & # # ; stitching & # # ; on the bands is not stitching at all but instead little rubber grippy thingies that really hold your stuff down it 's a well constructed piece of kit and it has a permanent place in my bag going to need a couple more for my desk drawers one note , the product description said it had a zipper pouch this is not true
this has been a great organizer for keeping all my stuff from <unk> into the <unk> of my work bag i love that this one is just the right size to use in both my weekday work tote and a <unk> purse i just yank it out of one and throw it into the other whenever i need to switch bags the elastic bands are sturdy and keep stuff in place really well though grid-it does n't describe it as having a zipper on their site , this listing does there 's no zipper pouch , but that does n't really matter since the bands are what you 're really buying this for
pros : i love that all my electronic odds and ends are easily accessible and have they 're own place cons : deciding what goes where this is not really an issue though , just me being obsessed with <unk> bottom line : i would buy another one in a heartbeat this has definitely helped organize my
simple little thing , saves me so much hassle searching for cords in pockets all over my bag if you think you might like it , get one if you are curious about it , get one trust me , in less than a week you will want another one
