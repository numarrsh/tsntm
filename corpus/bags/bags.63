i needed a medium-sized bag for everyday work and light travel this bag fits both nicely it is a very roomy bag , with many compartments in fact , it is roomy enough to fit one set of clothing in addition to everyday office gear also , the bag is durable as with all of samsonite 's products

bought it for my wife because she has goals of competing and eating right as a nurse she finds it hard to pack and store the kinds of <unk> she needs to eat to obtain her goals this has made it easier and she loves it she wants to buy me one but i keep telling her i am okay with being a fat old guy and my goals of <unk> eating are different than hers however , continually putting my lunch in a small refrigerator where i store chemicals and other science supplies is starting to get old , and the <unk> <unk> are starting to smell
this is a terrific product excellent quality , modern design , everything just as described and even more lots of space for pc and papers , books and all my stuff wonderful <unk> relation i feel # % satisfied
great product , lightweight well constructed and plenty of room for accessories i looked at a lot of bags for my new laptop and this one has everything i need at a great price one of the best features is you can slip it over the handle of your carry-on bag , this is really convenient if you do a lot of travelling
i purchased the bag a month ago and have loved it - no problems with it at all the bag is a great size and holds its shape well for the price , i could n't ask for anything more i highly recommend this bag
great quality product for a low price i 've been using mine for about # months now and nothing has broken yet ca n't complain perfect fit for my ginormous # inch hp laptop as well which is hard to come by these days
i love the flip out of this bag lots of compartments and pockets lightweight and sturdy , this bag has been possibly the best purchase i 've made in the new year
has room for laptop computer , zip binder , and pockets for other stuff ; while being relatively small on the outside nice handles and over the shoulder carrying strap seems to be rugged
this was exactly what i needed plenty of pockets , fits my # & # # ; laptop , keyboard , mouse , power cords etc and still has room to spare seems to be good quality too
perfect size , construction , and design the only proviso for me is , i would have liked a ring or clip inside for putting keys or <unk> or similar things you 'd like to attach in easy reach without floating loose inside
very well made , heavy duty was bought for my son to fly back and forth from college with his laptop he likes all the storage compartments and heavy duty zippers has lots of carrying space very well padded area for the laptop to fit in
i got this to replace a travel case i had used for about # years this is much lighter and has the nice pocket that slides over the handle of my pull suitcase plenty of storage space for both my laptop and ipad
absolutely exactly what i was looking for computer compartment fits my # & # # ; perfectly with room for cord mouse and several files or book fit comfortably in the other compartment . # outside pockets give plenty of space for small but important <unk> that you need easy access to over the shoulder strap has metal clip that clips into metal - no plastic to break
this bag replaces a bag that my husband has had for years and is perfect for his use with the right pouches and zippered pockets he does n't use it to carry a lap top , but carries files in it , so i ca n't speak to how well it works for that use
i am on <unk> # and needed something to carry my charger and spare batteries when i have to take my portable to long <unk> visits i use this to carry my spare batteries , charger and tablet since it fits on the handle of my portable <unk> dolly i have no trouble carrying it around
i had been looking for a bag to carry my laptop in when on vacation this bag met all expectation for the price the quality and standards are way more than what i thought i would get
arrived on time as usual has many uses for me the quality and reputation of samsonite prompted this purchase great service from amazon do not hesitate to purchase one for yourself
great bad , it is what it was advertised love the pockets for the computer itself and it 's accessories and another pockets for papers and files and also more pockets for pens , calculators , etc .
this is a great laptop case i 'm using it for a dell inspiron # r and it fits perfectly there is plenty of storage room for the <unk> , the wireless mouse , and a bunch of other gear one thing i really liked is that the zipper pulls are metal i have <unk> more than a couple plastic zipper pulls it was built to take some abuse
i ordered this for two laptops that are for work on a <unk> so far the guys that use them really like them , there is plenty of room for everything and protects it well with ease of carry
my # `` toshiba fits perfect , nice sturdy velcro strap keeps it in place inside the case plenty of room for battery pack and other items plenty of folders for files and documents though i do n't think you could fit a large book in it the should strap functions well as do the handles ability to slip it over a retractable luggage handle is a nice feature though i have n't used it yet good overall construction and stitching from what i can tell zippers work well i am not disappointed at all
pros : simple and durable and excellent for travel or daily use padded sections protect the laptop well from the inevitable drops a surprising amount of space for the power adapter , tablet , phone , extra chargers , papers or notepads a number of smaller compartments and pockets for organizing miscellaneous items the rear <unk> attachment fits over standard carryon handles cons : a bit too large
i was looking for a bag for my father for his business trips he likes it a lot , and i personally find it to be good looking it was a very sturdy construction and lots of space -lrb- my father brings along his laptop , kindle , smartphone , and the usual odds and ends like pencils and still has room -rrb- whether it 'll hold up or not will be determined , but it looks and feels tough enough to last for years
i did a lot of research to find this bag other bags had good ratings but they all had the same one star complaints , the straps broke and their computer crashed to the ground i got this bag because there were no strap breaking complaints the strap hooks are metal instead plastic and the attachments to the bag appear very strong my # inch laptop fits easily into the computer sleeve which is padded on all four sides and the bottom there 's also a lot of compartments with a lot of room for just about everything including a few thin school books there 's even a place for pens and pencils and other small stuff i have to say i 'm impressed with this bag and i 'm not easily impressed on top of that it only cost $ #
it is made well , as you would expect from samsonite my # inch dell inspiron # series laptop fits inside very well -lrb- my laptop measures # -rrb- it has everything the description says it has i can fit my laptop , one textbook , a spiral notebook , and everything else i need for school inside it has # pockets in the laptop area for chargers , mouse , etc .
do n't know how i got by without some sort of business case when i grabbed a shopping bag to bring items to a meeting , that was the sign that i needed to start looking around for a good case i carry # drawings occasionally this is a tight fit , but it works metal pieces look very sturdy samsonite could 've come up with a better handle system the two handles flop down as opposed to the photo where they look like they are held together this is a very small complaint
just a quick review here to confirm this product is tops i am an it pro with over # years of experience , much of it road heavy around town this case has great design with its multiple compartments which are very well designed perfect for daily use hardware is top quality latest piece i use this with is a # `` pavillion , which is relatively very heavy compared to many that i use it has held up to daily use for me for years -lrb- i belive around # years now ... -rrb- and not shown the slightest failure on any hardware or material at this rate , this case will survive several more laptops plenty of space for papers , chargers , <unk> cords , and even lunch if for any reason i lost this case , i would immediately replace it with an exact copy
the bag looks true enough to the picture - beautiful bright pattern , no handle , some padding however , the material is cheap and not exactly pleasant to touch , the stitching is rough and somewhat inaccurate , the velcro on the closures is of weird configuration there is no padding on the top of the bag i decided to keep the bag , but i would not recommend it , and i definitely would not have bought it if i saw it at a store
a little disappointed with the <unk> of the design looks a lot cheaper up close than in the pictures the bag quality itself seems decent this was to be a gift , but now i 'm not so sure i want to give it
this bag is very spacious i can fit my laptop , three notebooks , and even my science textbook in there however , i 'm not too thrilled with the drawstring close at the top since i do n't use it , it mainly gets in the way also , with all that stuff in it , it makes it extremely bulky but the strap has never been uncomfortable on my shoulder overall , this was a great bag for a college student
i like this bag i think the size is fine , the color is just like it is in the picture it 's well made and there are no other problems with it except for the `` new made `` smell at first good for a student , as well i use it for my books as well as my lap top
was n't thrilled with the way it ended up closing and found it to lack what i needed i would n't say this is a bad computer bag it just was n't what worked for me i passed it on to my niece and she uses it for her overnight bag when she <unk> over with friends the shipment arrived on time and would buy from the seller again
i bought it because i fly a lot and wanted a bag that would hold all my electronics , chargers , etc . plus books and magazines this is it for sure , and it 's very attractive -lrb- for a female -rrb- ; i get lots of compliments only downside is that it is a bit bulky and , since i put a lot of weight in it , my arm and shoulder do get uncomfortable after dragging it through multiple airline <unk> i ; m now thinking it might have been better to get something small on wheels
fits my laptop perfectly only reason i did n't give it # stars was because it does n't have proper adjustable straps -lrb- the velcro straps are not much my taste -rrb- has enough space that i can also store books , cd , and other essentials i may need for work or just for my laptop the design is <unk> and i believe that 's what drew me to choosing this bag for purchase
i bought this bag because i was taking evening courses at university twice a week i love the design and appearance of the bag , the protective layers inside for both the front and back of the laptop i also appreciate the # small front pockets the bag really fits a # . # in laptop , i have a toshiba # . # in which fits but it 's tight the only thing that would make it a # -star is if it had an adjustable shoulder strap and a hand strap excellent value for the price
i like this laptop bag , but my laptop does n't completely fit in the laptop slip part my laptop is like # `` in width , so it 's a tight fit it 's a cute bag , but i wish it was a bit wider
the messenger bag is # . roomy # . cute # . <unk> am the type of girl that carries a lot and this bag makes it easier to do so i would probably would have preferred a darker color but i am content
i really enjoy how cute and unique this bag looks it has been very sturdy through moderate use and is n't showing any signs of wear after having it for over # months did n't give it # stars because even though it fit my laptop , there is n't a whole lot of room for anything but the computer in the other compartments once you load in your laptop
the most thing i like about this bag is design on it . it is like a piece of art not just a bag . the only thing i hate about it is the fabric it does not feel right . that is why # instead of # stars
this bag will last you for a long time however , unlike in the picture the base color is an extremely light <unk> gray but other than that it has plenty of space for other belongings as
this bag was very handy and well worth the price it gently cradles my macbook , while allowing me to take around the books that i need for class furthermore , it looks good a great purchase overall
i love the color and design it has lots of padding , and it 's very light there is a separate compartment for my files , and # zippered pockets for my pens , mouse , wallet , keys , etc . the flap covers everything , and the strap does not slide off my shoulder i also wanted the matching # `` laptop sleeve in this same print , only based on the given dimensions , my laptop would not have fit in it if they ever come out with a # `` one , i would definitely get one
i am really happy , just got the bag and it is lovely i love the strap material because it does not slide off shoulder . . love how everything fits . this is the best messenger laptop bag i have ever had would have liked an outside pocket for cell phone
this laptop case is great it can hold two laptops when we travel it is n't too bulky , but protects the laptops just fine after looking at a bunch of cases i am glad i got this one
i ordered this messenger bag some time ago , and i love it had n't had time to write about it yet but it traveled with me everywhere i like the image on the bag with `` cafe the paris `` , makes me think of europe again the outside of the bag is quite nice ; made of a silver gray material the compartments inside are good and fitting it fits my laptop to a `` t `` , and i like the extra plus of having a cord inside to close just that compartment otherwise , plenty of room for just about everything : cords , charger , books , magazines , papers , pens , etc . my nintendo also found a spot inside in all ... it 's perfect and i love it
this case is great it makes me wish i were in paris it holds my # . # inch laptop , cords , accessories plus , i carry my nook color , cord , wifi accessory , and all <unk> i feel stylish , have all my <unk> , and get smiles from <unk> the strap is comfortable oh , yes , the inside has a draw string to help contain the items overall , i love it ! !
i was a little skeptical of the quality of this bag , given the price , but i was very nicely surprised this seems to be a very good quality bag , with good padding in the laptop compartment the two zipper pouches on the front are very nice for holding accessories like a mouse , flash drive , etc . they were n't kidding when they said that the bag fits a # . # `` laptop , because if it was a half-inch wider , it would n't fit just make sure your laptop is n't any bigger than that before ordering this is a nice lightweight , functional carrier that is n't too bulky it may sound silly , but one of my favorite things about this bag is the shoulder strap i always have trouble with purses and other bags falling off of my shoulder all the time ; such a nuisance this bag has some sort of material on the inside of the shoulder strap that actually grabs on to whatever it touches even when i 'm wearing a nylon jacket , this bag does n't slip off my shoulder
i love my new laptop bag and i have got so many compliments about it already it is very durable , as well as very practical and i 'm looking to order a few more just for presents : -rrb- my experience was amazing ordering this bag , no hassle , <unk> delivery -lrb- even i had selected standard shipping -rrb- and just a very prompt and courteous experience i would highly recommend it thank you so much i look forward to doing business again ... very soon
arrived on time it is sturdy and stylish i also like the grey colours , and black font it is sophisticated , and i can not imagine seeing a laptop bag like this in any other store thank you . =
the bag fits my laptop great it 's nice and cushy and i feel like it 's definitely protective it has lots of pockets for holding stuff the strap is wide which makes it easier to tote around i love it
i really just wanted a functional bag and i am pleased with this one the bag looks just like the picture the flap has a layer of gray corduroy lining it there are # zipper pockets , one of them is divided into compartments i think the bag can hold several things in addition to a computer and that is what i was looking for the strap seems sturdy and is adjustable not sure why someone thought it would be white because it looks like the picture - <unk> if you want something to carry just your laptop , this may be bulky , but it is functional if you want to carry your <unk> etc . along with your computer
first off , i recieved the bag in a record time i ordered it and next thing i knew it was being delivered i got a laptop for my birthday , so of course i needed a fashionable <unk> bag to go with it my laptop fits like a glove in it i do recommend measuring your laptop before purchasing cause it just fits the bag is roomy , i am able to hold notebooks , pens and other office supplies i hope to enjoy my bag for a long while
not only is this laptop case pretty , it is functional too there is a padded section for the laptop it 's self , plus there is plenty of room for the mouse and the charger cords there is also plenty of room to carry the my daughter 's kindle , # mp # players plus headphones , and the cell phone with the charger cords for it , and there is still some room to spare i would highly recommend this product
not only is this computer case comfortable to carry and well designed to hold everything you need , it is also very cool to look at -- has attracted a number of positive comments from friends and casual <unk>
i replaced my # -inch macbook with a # -inch macbook pro , so my old laptop case would not work for the new computer i wanted something different - one that did not look like every other black case the gray case with a picture of paris certainly was distinctive i was not sure how well a messenger bag would hold the computer , but there is a velcro strap that holds the computer in place a separate section works well for paper , even a thin notebook i use one of the zipper pockets for pens and things and the other for cords the strap is padded at the top i am well satisfied with it and expect it to last as long as the computer
i love my new laptop bag ... it arrived quickly and was exactly what i wanted the bag is very spacious i am very happy with my purchase and would buy from this seller again
i just got it today , but , as i said , so far , so good i shopped around a lot for a bag that i liked there were n't many , and for the price everyone seems to be charging , i did n't want to settle on one i liked this design the best , and the price was incredible from what i can tell , it 's well-made the strap is lined with some kind of soft <unk> rubbery type stuff -lrb- i do n't know my fabrics very well -rrb- , and is adjustable the inside of the flap is lined with a soft , gray corduroy the main pocket has a padded space for the laptop , and has a little extra space with padding to protect your precious if you should want to put anything else in there this all may be very typical for laptop bags -lrb- this is my first -rrb- , but i was very impressed
this bag came right on time and i use it all the time i really love how much room there is in it i can fit a ton of stuff in it along with my laptop
this bag is everything that it described i have a <unk> for my laptop and my textbooks it 's got that special pocket that hold my accessories to my laptop it is absolutely beautiful i am so happy i bought this
the fabric , the zippers , everything falls apart very fast , how fast ? gentle cycle on cold , just one wash and it 's as if you <unk> it in <unk> , parts of the fabric literally
the only things in the bag were laptop and accessories , just past the date of return and the handle <unk> as i as picking up the bag major design issue or just a bad product i would not recommend this backpack
initially , the bag seemed ok but after a few weeks of casual and easy use , things started fraying and within # weeks the strap tore off from where it attaches to bag now it 's useless to me but it is past the return window live and learn
i was looking for a lightweight compact bag for my mac zip wore off after # months of use and can not return it without paying for return shipping and only partial refund not worth it
it 's beautiful and modern , but the hold of this product damaged in # days without using it i have had a swiss gear bagpack for # years and it 's simply perfect until today finally , i bought a swiss gear bag pack
when i received it , i was soo excited because it sounded perfect for what i want to put it i opened the package and proceed to put in my mac pro # i thought ok , let 's try my dell xps - fail i had to try to stuff it in which <unk> up the backpack and left room for nothing else and it looked like it was <unk> from the seams there was no way i could even consider putting my school book in there the depth had to be about only # inches max including the padding inside it is a nice looking backpack but not for practical everyday use i had to send it back it is good if you have the ultrathin <unk> and have time between classes to switch hauling books
good quality and nice compact size i wish it had a strap for the inner pocket there is not much padding between the bottom of the laptop sleeve and the exterior so if you drop it i do not believe it will have much edge protection
overall , i like the quality of the backpack itself the zippers all feel very sturdy and the padding for the laptop seems solid all around this was a backpack that met most of my requirements my only gripe was that the backpack i clearly ordered as new was used when i first opened up package , i found two quarters in the side pocket , and there was a gum wrapper and a <unk> in the front pocket it does n't take a genius to figure out that the backpack <unk> to a previous owner i even purchased this from amazon itself and not some other retailer however , since i have n't found any cosmetic damage of any kind , i have decided to just keep it i 'm a bit disappointed with amazon for making such a mistake and hope it wo n't happen again in the future
i purchased this during a daily deal with amazon prime the bag seemed to have good quality but i wish it was a bit smaller i bought it on an <unk> on the styling of this bag but somehow it is & # # ; flatter & # # ; than i expected it is something okay to keep
if your planning to use this backpack as both book and laptop bag , this is not the backpack for you - attractive looking <unk> <unk> <unk> padding for your <unk> - the straps fall off my shoulders very easily , i 'm not sure if its because of my <unk> or the straps are n't well constructed - very little space provided to fit books and what not i think this is one heck of a backpack for the price and for the looks ; although their are minor <unk> on the way the straps were designed i think this is a great laptop travel bag
this backpack is perfect in every way except for size i can fit # book a notebook and a laptop or # books and # notebook but no more i need at least two books and my laptop at anytime so this really is a big disappointment
this pack is smaller than most if you need to carry much more than the laptop , charger and some small accessories you may find this does n't have the space to meet your needs perfect for a daily commuter or those trips to your local coffee shop to surf the internet overall it & # # ; s cool i would recommend it to those that don & # # ; t have to carry a lot of things in it
this is a good choice for a small backpack if you need to carry much more than the laptop , charger and some small accessories you may find this does n't have the space to meet you needs quality is what i expect for case logic , very good for the price no issues with zippers or seams , even after heavy use another nice feature is the textured mesh on the underside of the shoulder strap that helps keep it from slipping off your shoulder the one and only downside is the lack of padding on the bottom of the pack leaving an unprotected edge for the laptop , which i discovered when the pack slipped out of my hand and landed with a thump , resulting in a dent on the corner of my laptop
the quality is superb for the price but , it is just too small for a college student there is no space for books like other people are saying the straps are too big it is uncomfortable to carry
used this bag for business and work-related travel for six months the size and comfort were good for my purposes , but i hang the bag on a hook each night by the small top strap i do not <unk> the bag , but after a few months of hanging it in this way , the top strap ripped off from one side , rendering it useless on to a new bag
the bag itself is pretty nice , but it 's smaller then it looks also , i 'm a college student and i commute , so i have alot of books and other things to take along to school everyday , this bag is ` nt the best if you are a student commuting
i mainly use this backpack just for macbook pro and documents i had it for couple week and the handle strap started to loosen up i carry around # lbs and this handle can not even able last would recommended this pack for its stylist and design but if you planning on carry heavier load , probably have to try different pack
# -rrb- great price # -rrb- looks good # -rrb- the grey one is sexy # -rrb- has essential pockets for sunglasses , pens , flash drives , books , charger , portable hard drive etc . # -rrb- no proper padding at all , the part against the back , <unk> the straps # -rrb- inside is a light grey which can easily get dirty # -rrb- that innovative strap holder is a warning , it can bruise your hands
it does n't offer lot of room as i thought it protects my macbook pro very well i would n't recommend this bag to you if you are on road most of the time
it 's an alright backpack , but as a college student it looked ridiculous on me it could barely fit anything in it and is probably geared to more of a middle school crowd
backpack fits my # & # # ; laptop but the straps tend to fall off my shoulders all the time and i have wide shoulders # & # # ; so i know it 's not my body size
nice price for the quality , hold my # & # # ; macbook pro quite comfortably as well as an ipad # dont know how strong the should strap stitching is , but its holding up so far
great bag , but could be a bit bigger had plenty of room for laptop and cords , but not enough to fit a few extra accessories other than that does it 's job
really like this backpack small and compact is easy to haul to and from the classroom love all the little compartments , including the one that is soft for my <unk> only reason it 's not # star , i was disappointed that the section for the labtop was n't fully foam packed on the bottom -lrb- where most impact takes place -rrb- however , otherwise perfect love the straps , they are # book friendly
perfect ... except why does n't anyone make a water proof or resistant backpack considering it 's made to carry around a macbook pro this backpack is lightweight , sturdy and holds a lot of stuff
it is slim , sophisticated looking i hate backpacks that make you look like a turtle this one is absolutely not that type it is perfect for urban living , school , and day trips i wished it were made of a bit more refined materials though i do n't mind paying more money for such a backpack overall all , the design of this backpack is perfect
this bag material is good , but it is a little small i buy it for my girlfriend and she told me that it is a little small i think that it is more suitable for my
i was looking for a light backpack that would carry my ipad and several papers that i need to carry in to work , and so i bought the case logic backpack i found it perfect for my needs , it is really light , nice looking and has enough compartments so that i can keep all my stuff organized the only drawback is that it is narrower than other backpacks its size , but on the whole very convenient and handy , i would definitely recommend it
i have an asus # . # & # # ; vivobook , and this backpack is too big for that it moves around too much a macbook air would <unk> around in this thing like loose change , but still it is much smaller than what i had before and it looks great
the bag is pretty versatile and my # in laptop fits well it has pretty good storage space for accessories with a large front and small side pockets the large pocket also has small interior holders that work for pencils , headphones and other small objects but the tabs attached to the zippers began to fray almost immediately -lrb- not just one but a few of them -rrb-
this is a great bag for carrying around netbooks but not very comfortable there is n't alot of padding on the back so when you put it on , it feels like you have some really hard books against your back not alot of space in the bag but enough to carry your laptop and some other small items and tablet too
i have <unk> shoulders , about # inches across , and this backpack wants to slide off most of the time its like the backpack straps want to fan out to # + inches and for students , this will only hold one # inch hard back and a # . # inch binder other than that , this is a great backpack for tech , and sometimes books
