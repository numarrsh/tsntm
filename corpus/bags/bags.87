the stitching and materials feel cheap , especially <unk> to a retina macbook pro it fits the macbook pro # & # # ; , but its not a tight fit if you just need a basic case at a reasonable value , its probably fine
i used this for my lenovo yoga # and it works great i especially like the extra pocket for storing the battery not a huge fan of the colors , which is the only reason for # stars
it fits my macbook great , and i feel a lot safer carrying it around in my bag the only downside is that the pocket on the top does n't fit the charger inside , but otherwise it 's
inside is very nice and soft to ensure against scratches outside is rugged and hardy fits in my backback great and provides good protection for my macbook only downside is the external pocket is just slightly to small for a good fit for the charger
this is a really nice case the front pocket is n't quite big enough for my charger but i can make it work it looks good and it nicely padded i 've gotten some nice compliments on it i would highly suggest this to anyone that has a mac
i just got my case last week it 's awesome the # . # macbook pro fits like a <unk> the zippers seem good quality and the pocket upfront can hold your chargers and mouse for the price i recommend it would definitely buy one again
is just as described fits my # `` macbook pro very well , is n't too bulky , and the top pocket is great for headphones and the power block , or pens and a small notepad would definitely recommend
now i do n't have to carry a huge laptop bag around this thing is perfect and light weight and the pocket on the side is just right for a charger and a magic mouse
i got this for ten cents n after using it i <unk> payed # bucks easy the zipper folds over so you do n't scratch your laptop it protects it from any dings and it securely holds my macbook and the pocket on the side is great for my external hd and a # foot display cord with room to spare
i love this product i have a macbook pro and it fits great in the case color is just as you see in the picture love the fact that it has a pocket
wife recently purchased a # & # # ; macbook and the case is tailor made for it fits nicely , unobtrusive , easy to carry , looks good , and fits inside a small backpack or large purse without difficulty small storage compartment is handy in short , a well made product that appears , at least at this point , to do the job more than adequately do n't know about durability yet as i 've only had the <unk> for a few weeks thus far she loves it and highly recommends it as a case option for one 's macbook
for it 's price , it exceeds the expectation as stated in the description the color is bit different but it houses my macbook pro perfectly the additional <unk> inside this sleeve makes it perfect the additional pouch at the front can house the charger i would rate it as a good deal
seriously for how inexpensive this case was i bought it to replace my incase $ # case , and it 's perfect because it has a cushion and a spot for the charger
i almost got the amazon basics sleeve four my # `` macbook pro w / retina display , but i 'm glad i got this instead it holds my power adapter which is a huge plus or , as i just discovered this morning , it fits my kindle paperwhite
i was having a hard time finding a case for my yoga # pro ... this one is perfect it 's really like it was made for it it 's a snug fit but not too tight , and the front pocket is the exactly perfect size for the power supply love it ! !
bought this for a gateway lt # u netbook with a # cell battery the case fits well and holds the netbook , battery , and an assortment of chords -lrb- power , usb , etc . . . -rrb- very satisfied with purchase - good case for a netbook with either a # cell or # cell battery
i love this case . it is not bulky and my laptop feels very protective the color is very cute and the outside pocket holds my necessities like pens and a small notebook
i am very pleased with this sleeve it looks exactly like the picture my macbook air -lrb- with a hardshell -rrb- fits perfectly i also like that it has an outer pocket to hold a thumb drive or any other connections for my air i am super happy and for the price i feel this is a steal
love this case came just as described snugly holds my mac air and i love the extra pocket i went through a couple other cases before trying this one would definitely recommend
i was looking for a reasonably priced sleeve for my # & # # ; macbook pro , this case is perfect it 's well padded and i love the <unk> interior the accessory pocket is a nice touch too color is more purple than pink
i was worried based on other reviews that this would not be a good case for my new # -inch macbook pro w/retina display it is true that the case does not fit the laptop & # # ; like a glove & # # ; but it is a better fit than i expected i am very happy with the case so far it protects the laptop well and looks sharp it is a little thicker than i would prefer , but that is mainly due to the extra pocket on the side , which i probably will take advantage of at some point unless somebody makes a sleeve that is designed only for the retina version , i ca n't think of a better sleeve currently than this one
i absolutely love this case its heavy duty and a perfect fit for my macbook pro with retina display . the first case that arrived has a defect when i contacted the seller they treated me so nice and had already shipped me a brand new one as we were going over the details they even told me to keep the old one and my new one is on the way ! ! the second case i received was flawless and worked like a champ ! ! good quality zipper and a nice sized pocket for a external hard drive i would recommend it to
it 's very strong and durable case definitely will protect my macbook pro when carrying around or put in my backpack , when traveling the outside pocket is big enough to store the charger overall , good case for your computer
for being such a low price , the quality of this sleeve is pretty great i really was searching for a sleeve with a pocket to put my external hard drive in it fits great my # inch macbook air fits wonderfully this is a great product
i 'm very happy with this purchase my # `` macbook air fits perfectly in this case with just enough padding to be protective but not too much to feel bulky the zipper pouch just barley fits the power adapter without room for much else but it suits my needs just fine
this is an absolutely amazing case for my mid- # macbook pro i purchased it even though it said it was for the retina display and it fits perfectly for $ # plus $ # s & h , this may very well be the best purchase i have ever made
this case is perfect for my macbook pro like other people said , it is tight at first but it does loosen up the pocket is great , it does fit what i need i would recommend it to anyone
i use this case for my # inch mac book pro its a perfect fit with a very soft micro fleece inside which protects the mac book aluminium from scratches it has good padding and the front pouch is ideal for memory cards ear buds paper etc . <unk> was very fast and the item was amazing value i would buy again no issues
this case fits my # . # macbook pro perfectly it has lots of padding and looks like it will offer it good protection the shipment came on time and fortunately this case looks like it costs wary more than it does
this case is perfect it has thick padding which protects my mac and looks great the outside pocket fits the charger but it then becomes rather bulky other than that , i love
i ordered the wrong case and kuzy would n't accept any <unk> horrible customer service then when i received the right case , it came cracked in two places do n't buy unless your willing to & # # ; protect & # # ; your laptop with cheap plastic that comes cracked and is n't
have had this case for a few months my laptop has never been dropped or abused in any fashion just wanted something pretty to cover my new mac with , but the case has now cracked in multiple places and pieces are breaking off
i was expecting the case to be more like rubber but its pretty hard and seems like you can crack it if you hit it hard enough or if it flexes it should n't flex once installed but again if your looking for <unk> rubber this is not
key note here though is that even though it shows the keyboard cover , no keyboard cover arrived simply the laptop case only love the color though and fit perfectly on my laptop
this case is just eh the top fits perfect but the bottom slides off a lot very susceptible to finger prints and smudging it 's a low cost so i guess you get what you pay for
i bought this because i thought it was pretty my computer is # in and this cover was too small i still have the keyboard cover , but gave the cover away
i ordered this case in black it 's great ! i was concerned with the keyboard cover not fitting well but it is awesome as well my new laptop is safe and sound :
case fits my retina very well , and has never popped off in my # + months of using it i love the feel of the rubberized plastic , but it does tend to show grease marks from your fingers fairly easily the glue to hold the rubber feet to the case will fail after a few months easily fixed with some better glue
although the keyboard cover is fairly useless at <unk> to me the hardcover from kuzy is phenomenal and works as expected it has a tight fit and is easy to put on your retina macbook pro the glowing apple logo is only slightly muted and it protects your macbook from scratches i am very pleased
four stars because i love the keyboard cover , but the case should get # - they serve their purpose but the case wo n't stay on the bottom of my computer it is the quality you expect at the price
it is not the best case you can get for the retina macbook pro but it is a great deal and you ca n't get any better for the money my keyboard cover had a tear on the top right but besides that it fits perfect case fits snug and i have had no problems with it it was shipped <unk> and arrived on time
the color is very vivid and i love how it is rubberized so it wont slip around . however the base pads fell off the second day when i put this on
i like the rubberized feel it has sturdy rubbery feet and i like that you really ca n't see fingerprints on it a few issues - the keyboard cover comes up just a little bit in the middle it 's not a huge problem , but the keyboard gets a little <unk> and then you <unk> to straighten it out also , the edges of hte cover were really sharp so sharp , i could n't rest my forearms on it i had to use a nail file to file down all the edges on the bottom and top of cover , and then i was able to use it but i think most laptop covers are a little sharp , so you 'll have to do that to most of them
love this case sent me one that was crack , so they replaced it right away , which is awesome , good customer service only thing is that the white circle grips on the bottom keeps coming out i might just have to glue it with a strong glue maybe they should make it black instead of white i 'm happy with my purchase
i purchased this case for my # `` macbook pro with retina display , and i am quite pleased it looks great the translucent black case lets the apply emblem shine through and it fits so well that people often think the computer itself is black i also like the smooth , rubbery , matte texture on the case i think it adds to the look however , fingerprints can be seen on it -lrb- but not too badly -rrb- , and the edge -lrb- where your arms rest while typing -rrb- is a little sharp i need to adjust my arms every so often i do love that it comes with the keyboard guard , which fits very nicely it was such a great deal pros : fits very well , looks wonderful , great <unk> : the sharp edge under your arms while you
the case works as advertised and looks great also , customer service at kuzy is top notch when my package did n't arrive in time despite ordering expedited shipment , they promptly refunded me the difference between the # day and # day shipping i would order without reservation as there are no other cases currently available for the rmbp and this one gets the job done
i had ordered this case for my brand new laptop i knew that the cases sold in the apple store were $ # + and this case is cheaper and just about the same thing , with a better color selection i had gotten the aqua blue case and just love it ! the case is very protective and has a very nice rubberized feel to it the only thing is that the bottom part does not <unk> around the back corners , but thats not that big of a deal the keyboard cover is great , fits the keys perfectly ! it feels so nice to type with and i love that i will not have shiny keys after using it for a while , plus they are a pretty blue ! ! defiantly worth the money you wont regret it ! ! !
i have been using this protective casing from kuzy on my retina display macbook pro everyday for the past several weeks no problems yet the four feet have remained in place so far i like the black velvet look and feel to it , but it does show up the oil and dirt from the fingers easily i use glass plus and a microfiber auto cloth to keep it clean i would definitely recommend this item as inexpensive insurance for your pricey retina display mac
i really like the feel of this case , it 's not slick plastic the texture is nice and helps when handling the laptop , and it has also lasted through a few drops so you know it 's sturdy
wonderful product that protects the computer investment . inconspicuous , yet doing the work it was designed to do . allows full access to all the peripheral attachments such as usb ports and charging
love this case it fits my new # `` mbp retina like a glove the finish and feel is similar to the incase and speck products - a very subtle , clean , ` soft rubber ' feel that does display fingerprints well worth the price
love the color and ease of putting on computer even the <unk> at the apple store during my on to one session commented on how & # # ; cool & # # ; it was great product and arrived quickly
it has a nice snug fit it snaps right on the color is nice and it feels nice and smooth the apple logo shines right through the case and looks great the only problem i would say is that the edges where you put <unk> are kind of uncomfortable you can just smooth them out with some sand paper other than that it 's a great case
case fits tight and extremely functional those who had problems with the edges being to & # # ; sharp & # # ; need to <unk> ; its not a big deal great case and even better price nice way to keep yo <unk> protected
i was not sure if this would fit and did n't want to waste time on something that did n't work , but it is great for the macbook pro it does n't <unk> any ports it fits great looks good and protects the macbook well i 'm happy with this purchase
amazing , how it protects the machine and the keyboard protection fit well i took a month using the retina # & # # ; to understand the rubber <unk> is not of apple keyboard , it is a protector from kuzy
i bought this case for my # `` retina macbook pro as it was the first case available for it on previous versions of the macbook pros i had always used incase cases this case is every bit as good as an incase or speck there are no logos anywhere and the fit is perfect the side vents line up perfectly with the case the rubberized finish is nice and feels like an incase product i 'm glad i took the chance buying this case before reviews came out and could n't be happier with my purchase
when you 're buying a protective case for your macbook pro , be sure to pay close attention to the size i made the mistake of buying the wrong model at first these cases by kuzy are excellent they slide right on and snap into place if you 're confused about how to place them on , you can go to youtube to see how other people have applied them based upon the model of macbook pro you have i love mine it does a great job of keeping your computer clean
just recently bought myself the macbook # `` retina and got the teal case for it so cute and works like a charm came nice and clean and not one thing wrong people say its sharp i have n't had that issue i get so many compliments love that you can see the apple shine threw the case , cute thanks so much will be ordering more colors from here
i got this case in black and it is true that it makes external smudges very visible ; it 's not a big deal though , just a minor nuisance the case came packaged very well , without flaws the case fits perfectly and it 's sleek and slim i like that it has vents on the bottom piece the little pads on the bottom really help in keeping it in place on surfaces the keyboard cover does have the kuzy logo and it does block the backlight of the keyboard , but it is great to keep the keys clean from residue overall , a worthy investment
too big for new mac book # & # # ; . it 's stylish though , and i needed something to protect my laptop -- so i kept it just wish it was a little better fit a handle would be nice too
the product was very cute and convenient it is very durable with quilted padding and rubber edges on the corners of the sleeve i also got it for a reasonable price
i was looking for a laptop cover/sleeve with some `` grown up `` personality , but no obnoxious colors and butterflies etc . you can certainly find cheaper sleeves , but i was willing to pay the extra for what i wanted i love the print , colors and i have no complaints as of yet for the quality of the item
i have a hp envy dv # it fits perfectly and has an expandable pocket that fit my power cord or a notebook easily the material is more of a nice soft vinyl but not cheap looking at all in fact , it looks better in person than in the picture i actually like the material better than a vera because it think it will hold up better against staining and fading i was really impressed and love it it is a great laptop bag you wo n't regret buying it
i love this laptop sleeve i purchased it for my new laptop the print is really attractive and it zips easily the only thing that might make it better is if it had a strap i still love it , though
it was a perfect fit for my new laptop it really helps keep dust and any other debris from affecting my laptop , and helps keep my laptop clean i like to use the side pocket to keep the laptop charger ; it 's very convenient to keep them together i did n't have to wait long for the delivery either
it 's exactly as i pictured it i was worried that my laptop would n't fit in but it was true to size so i had no problem with it my laptop fit in perfectly
it 's bigger than i expected and the color is n't my favorite but the bag is very comfortable and useful protects the laptop very well and there 's plenty of room for my other binders and things a great bag
the laptop part fits snugly otherwise the bag is a little too big for my liking i was expecting a bag that fits just he laptop , its charger and then just a little more space of course as it is a little too big , you can keep all your stuff and organize them neatly not quite the bag for someone who commutes by train daily and so just # stars
bag works well and seems well constructed max size is really # inches as it states a # . # inch is really pushing it -lrb- such as a t # -rrb- thankfully , my work laptop is only # inches
<unk> well made , the best bag i ever had the padding on the computer section is great good divider inside for all your stuff + ipad or reader two water bottle holders it 's comfortable to carry lots of space and pockets i could not expect less for this brand ! ! ! excellent brand , excellent bag i 'm really happy with it
this is a well designed and well made bag it 's nice to find any consumer product that fits that description these days initially the fit for my lenovo w # , because of its protruding battery , was a tight fit , but it 's fine now getting used to the side entry compartment for the laptop took just a couple of days the side pockets are especially nice to carry power adapters and other bulky items ; their design keeps them tucked to the side and not jumbled up with everything else like my old bag
the bag itself looks great and well thought out i ordered a medium based on the information here that it would take laptop dimensions of # . # & # # ; x # . # & # # ; my laptop measures at # . # got the bag and tried it would n't come close to fitting i checked the timbuk # web site and for the medium bag they list the laptop dimensions as # x # . # & # # ; . misleading and irritating bag will be returned
the timbuk # website has a great tool - locate a bag that your model laptop fits into except it is n't accurate i ordered the large sized command bag specifically for my # `` macbook pro i 'm a big fan of the gear bags - own # of them already unfortunately , the zippered compartment the laptop goes in has an opening that is smaller than the rest of the compartment i 've had to wrestle my macbook in and out of the padded compartment do n't make the mistake of leaving a mouse dongle in the usb port - you 'll either rip it out or never get the laptop in the rest of the bag is fine , but it 's primary job is to hold the laptop which is a real pain to make happen
this bag is a good bag , lots of compartments , an ok amount of storage , but not really a great bag first of the tsa compliant compartment it is good for going through airport security , but if the main compartment is stuffed full , <unk> the laptop side is a task the main compartment is also just ok it is not really that big i had # soft cover books and # small zippered accessory bags , and it bulged at the side one of the things i thought was going to be really great was the power brick compartment ; once again , if the main compartment is full , it is very difficult to fit anything into the power brick pocket over all it is not a bad bag , but it is definitely not a bag for travelers
needed a bag for a # day trip to europe for # different conferences the bag is well designed , has great pockets and served me well the only thing is that my # & # # ; inch laptop w the built in <unk> pad is a very tight fit both in and out
if you are looking for a high quality messenger bag for your expensive laptop and gear , this one certainly delivers the stitching is top notch and all materials are of good quality the design was thoughtful and effective i did remove one star for the laptop compartments padding it was n't really thick enough for me to feel comfortable with actually placing a laptop inside it without having it in a neoprene sleeve or other protective pad
i 've tried many bags including other timbuk # bags and this is by far the best i really like all the storage compartments and the medium size bag is not too big and not too small the fact that there is a special pocket for my ipad is pretty cool too the only thing i do n't like is the closure design they do stay closed for the most part i just prefer the tried and true standard messenger bag male and female clips other than that , love the bag and would recommend it to anyone looking for a bag for work or travel
i purchased the medium at first and found the laptop compartment to be a tight fit for my # . # screen so i upgraded to the large and never looked back solid construction and a ton of space it get 's a little bulky the more things you stuff into it -lrb- obviously -rrb- but it 's very secure all the same , great for travel
i bought this to replace a larger timbuk # laptop messenger i bought the t # <unk> smaller messenger at the same time as this <unk> the <unk> is fantastic but just a tad small for the ipad the <unk> is perfect in just about every way i am a big timbuk # fan and this bag has exceeded my expectations it is a bit pricey so i will give it # as opposed to #
this is a great bag in most regards i bought the olive green one and it looks better in person than in the pictures i especially like the computer and tablet sleeves , which are of a very nice material that is protective but not bulky , and allow you to very quickly stow your computer my only complaint is that the aluminum hooks that close the main flap require two hands to close i usually have to lay the bag flat on a surface , and occasionally have to lift the edges of the <unk> straps that receive the hooks in order to get the hooks started i realize timbuk # were <unk> for a more finished look than fast clips , but these are pretty awkward perhaps as the loops wear in and stretch a bit it may be easier to start the hooks , but for now it 's pretty cumbersome i think they should develop some other type of clasp for this bag , which is otherwise excellent
almost perfect bag spending # night / yr on the road , i can do some damage to bags , been going thru a bag / yr , one month in this bag seems to be good quality this bag feels great , just the right size for my # `` mbp while still small enough to keep me strategic in what i take with me -lrb- i have the medium sized bag -rrb- one complaint , half the time i get stopped by tsa as they scan the bag because the ipad sleeve in the laptop approved compartment still can not figure out if i am supposed to be able to keep my ipad in the sleeve while i go thru airport security half the time they make me <unk> and take out ipad , not sure what the rules are on this one and the tsa agents have been zero help other than that i really like this bag , especially the shoulder strap makes it convenient to throw over the shoulder or over the head for longer walks thru the airport or to the office
works well on the t -lrb- boston -rrb- compact enough that i can carry easily on the train and not knock people down big enough that it holds my macbook pro # & # # ; and lunch box without making it bulky as others have mentioned , the & # # ; cup holder & # # ; could be larger , but that does not matter to me since i do n't really use it all in all i like it and would definitely purchase it again
this bag is really a great bag works great going through airport security and does a great job of expanding to handle whatever i need to carry the only reason i 'm not giving it five stars is because when i use the clips to secure the bag they tear at the reflective plastic the tear is stopped by some heavy stitching about # to # of an inch down , so it wo n't cause any real problems just a bit of a sharp edge on the tear
the messenger bag fits my needs quite well i was looking for a messenger bag that had enough space to lug around my laptop and then have a bit extra room to fit all the other essentials -lrb- mouse , power brick , etc . -rrb- no problem with the space and the fabric seems to deter light rain although i have not spilled anything on it to more thoroughly test the tpu liner but i would imagine it would function as it should my only gripe is that the bag does not seem to clean up as easy as it gets dirty other than that the metal fasteners take a little bit of getting used to but they do keep the front flap nice and secure i think if this bag holds up more than a couple years it would be worth <unk> my review to # stars in spite of the minor issues i mentioned
the compartment for the laptop is the only area that is a little snug my laptop just barely fits in <unk> causes a little pressure on the zipper to get down inside the compartment once laptop is inside compartment , it fits beautiful the next size up would have fit my laptop better
great bag except for the hook clasps and the bulky strap control mechanism roomy , excellent compartments and durable the clasp hooks are not easily manageable and the enormous plastic strap control is both ugly and difficult to manage on the go
love the look of this bag i like the separate laptop compartment and the clips on the front i wish the side & # # ; water bottle & # # ; pouch was bigger but the bag holds a lot and you do n't really feel the weight thanks to the shoulder strap totally worth the money overall
this bag is great it fits my # inch laptop and has a ton of room to spare i have not used it at the airport yet the only problem i is the part of the strap that has a buckle type fixture to shorten and lengthen it it is plastic and i think it will break easy it hasnt yet but ive heard from others that they have problems with it other than that the bag was a great buy still not sure why the black is # dollars while the red is #
the proof is in the reception and our grandson was flying high after receiving his timbuk # messenger bag just what the <unk> ordered , with a name that is full of reputation and expectations this is going to be an everyday companion at college this fall score ! !
this is an awesome bag for everyday commuting and over night travel the design is sturdy and the bag holds a lot stuff without making it hard to carry the best feature on this bag is the laptop compartment that is tsa compliant
my daughter travels quite a bit for work after much research , this was added to her xmas wish list it did not disappoint she loves not having to remove her laptop at airport security the outside pockets are very handy she keeps a travel umbrella in one ... an item she would always forget to pack the shoulder strap is very comfortable
fits my husbands # & # # ; laptop ... which is a feat in itself and has lots of storage storage good - loosing his thumb drive for the # rd time because he ca n't remember which pocket he put it in bad but overall great
this bag seems pretty rugged and looks professional enough to take to work my main purpose for purchasing this bag was to avoid checking luggage and to avoid having to <unk> a bag on the small regional jets my small & # # ; carry on & # # ; sized pull suitcase would always get <unk> for <unk> beneath the plane at the gate so i looked for something a bit more compact this slides into the overhead compartment perfectly on embraer and <unk> regional jets i did a lot of research and this was a perfect match
great bag for school ! ! i was debating which bag to get for college and timbuk # command looked like it had everything i <unk> medium is the best size if you are going to use it for school -lrb- large might be way too big . it looks professional but also stylish i which there was an easier way to close bag with hooks and keep it secured - love the compartments and easy access of the napoleon and back pockets - great to just carry by handle or to put over shoulder this versatile feature is very important for a commuter on the go
got to say , i love this case it tightly holds my # & # # ; macbook pro along with my # & # # ; tablet putting the computer / tablet in is extremely easy and logical there are a lot of pockets and space to store accessories , cords , papers , etc . even some of the quirky things are very nice -- the place to hold a bottle of water / can , the napoleon pocket , the strap it 's obvious that this company has taken the time to listen to their customers and fixed and upgraded their bag over the years my only minor wish would be that it looked a little more & # # ; professional & # # ; my boss told me that the bag looks like something that a <unk> would use - probably true it 's less of an & # # ; executive & # # ; bag , but i love it nonetheless i look forward to being able to travel with it and not have to take my computer out of the bag
bought the timbuk # bag for business and it has been a great product so far it offers plenty of room for all of my needs update # / # - i have to follow up to say that i am still using this bag and like it worth the money
i use this messenger bag each and every day for university quality is amazing , it feels very robust and tough , i can easily rely on this bag in any condition must-have for gadget owners
high quality , very comfortable to wear bag i have n't had any problems of the front clasps not staying hooked holds all of the things i need it to with room to spare and does n't feel bulky
needed a bag that could hold by # & # # ; laptop and camera equipment i liked the layout of the pockets and how well it worked for my travels i would definitely recommend this bag to any of my friends the build is strong and the closure hooks are innovative for ease of use
