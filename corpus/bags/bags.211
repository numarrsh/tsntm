the unit i receive have manufacturing defects inside that is visible outside , the upper case is thicker than bottom case this case makes rmbp look cheap & unappealing i do n't know how this case pass apple standards by the way i bought the clear version , that 's why i can see defects inside when installed on rmbp
beware of this one , folks it 's flimsy , does n't fit the laptop well , and the little # rubber things on the bottom come off very easily do yourself a favor , and actually buy a real one at the apple store or even on here that is properly fitted for the mac
product has rough cut edges which are n't sharp but has strings of excessive leftover plastic the inside of the case has scratches and this really weird <unk> feel the inside has these tiny dots all over that feel a little bit like sand also , it 's not premium plastic at all , it has a very cheap plastic feel to it the perforations on the bottom are ugly and are unnecessary since there are no air vents there the air vents are near the side moshi on the other hand has extremely good quality plastic and with careful handling the corners wo n't crack
this case is poorly made within a week the tabs that click onto the laptop ensuring the case stays on fell off a few days later , the two of the rubber feet were missing now , there are cracks all over the case i 'll have to replace with a higher quality case
i ordered the keyboard cover from this company and thought i should order my computer case from the same company clearly it was n't the best decision i recieved the case ahead of the scheduled time but the case was too big for my # inch macbook
i am very disappointed in this product i was expecting something a little more & # # ; rubber & # # ; and much less plastic for all <unk> and purposes , this is a plastic case which will crack if dropped and will not offer any protection at all to my computer the company says the exterior paint is rubberized this item needs to be described differently in the headline description for accuracy i did return the item and was eventually refunded the cost of the product , but i got stuck paying the $ # return shipping costs , which also reflects very poor customer service furthermore , whoever the person was who responded to my -lrb- polite -rrb- email was really rather rude this was altogether not a positive experience
the under part of the case is suitable for my new <unk> the upper part does <unk> have try several times , but it still does n't work at all ! ! i just waste # +
today is <unk> # , # i ordered this case on november # th , # and it arrived on december # rd i just noticed a crack on the case near the headphone jack it 's been barely half a year and it 's broken already like any case , it 's bulky of course , and i accept that but broken in less than a year i 've never once dropped , nor have i done any heavy duty on it just put it on my bag to and from school i wasted $ # for this
the case was broken when i received it it was also different from what was advertised my case had an additional circle thing on the bottom , and one was missing the rubber to it makes my mac wobble when i type very dissatisfied with the <unk> packaging , and making of the product only return process is to send it back in i need a case now for my mac do n't want to go without a case , so must purchase another one then wait very poor customer service compared to other companies
it looked fine , but would not fit on my computer i ordered it because it was cheaper than the speck ones , but it worthless if it does n't fit i am returning it
at first i loved it because of the color ... but upon the first week i had it the rubber things on the bottom all came off and it broke and chipped it was never dropped just moved from a desk to a backpack
i bought this item on may # nd the return policy has passed and i ca n't return it which is fine that is on me this product description is a lie i am going to have to go to best buy to buy a <unk> shell . it is about half inch to big all the way around if you reach out to me i can send you a picture if you do n't believe me save your self the trouble i have a # . # mac pro retina display less than a year old -lrb- they only be in production about # years if that -rrb-
the rubberized bottoms have come out in # weeks after mild use and few <unk> a <unk> the rubbers in the bottom of the <unk> have started coming out the glue is not strong enough to keep them in their place my bad luck :
my second case from kuzy they made some changes but the major problem is not enough ventilation at the bottom any more i wish i could get the original kuzy cover with enough ventilation
i was super excited to get this case however , when i tried to put it on , it was clear that the case i received was not the right size if you have money to waste , then i 'd recommend buying this case if you 're a broke college student like me , i would not recommend buying this case
i had to return this cover i bought it because it was much cheaper than speck and other brands here on amazon but i am not happy with this purchase as the bottom piece came broken and had to return
i like that it stays on when you put it on and protects my computer from every day wear and tare i wish that it was more transparent with no added logos and nearly weightless i recommend this product if you do n't mind a little bit of a bulkier feel to you laptop , or if your into <unk> your
it was the <unk> thing , the top of the case -lrb- where the apple logo should be -rrb- fit , but the bottom piece did n't it literally look . # inches short i think there was some sort of mix up with this case , but i found one cheaper in the right size & same color
had it for # weeks and then # of the little rubber feet on the bottom of the case fell off just outside my # day amazon return window i like the soft rubber feel of the case but it accumulates tons of fingerprints and overall is a cheaply made case , consider something more resilient even if the price is higher
the lid fits well , but the bottom portion slips around i 'm sure if you have a # rmbp , it 'd be a nice fit , but that . # & # # ; difference makes it not fit
i was excited to receive this case in the mail when i put it on , i was sorely disappointed the case itself does n't feel like it is completely on the computer -lrb- the little clips do n't even clip on the edges -rrb- also , i ordered the clear case and it has a pink hue to it overall , it looks and feels cheap i should have went with ipearl again and if you want to return it , it does n't give you the option total waste of money avoid purchasing this case
the overall construction is good - the rubber coating feels nice and the fit is generally ok -lrb- i 'm using this on a late # model -rrb- what falls apart is the <unk> of the rubber feet whoever put those on did a messy job as i can see glue marks all over the place and they even extend to the middle of the case most of these are on the inside of the case and it took me a lot of elbow grease to clean them out with rubbing alcohol one of the feet also does n't line up properly another problem is that the upper half is extremely difficult to remove once it 's clicked on so do n't plan to regularly removing it to clean the inside
this product had awesome delivery time however it did n't fit my laptop and is very cheap quality i recommend spending # bucks more and going to best buy and getting a good quality case
i placed the order after seeing the product images and number of positive reviews the case itself looks and feels good but upon closer inspection , it is obvious that it was poorly made the case i received had scratches and scuffs on the sides the top has a subtle scratch , and the base of the case were <unk> put together i 've only had it for an hour and it feels like it has deteriorated already i will try to add photos in this review for the quality of the case , i can not recommend at the price , even if heavily discounted edit : i have n't found a way to add the pictures i took
i had a hard time getting this device off and on the laptop this is good because once you get the thing on , it will likely not come off easy this is bad because if a spec of dust were to get between the laptop and case , you 'd get scratches on the laptop
it started by being a nice case but in a few months it revealed its true colors the product is not of the best material and it started cracking on the sides by itself my biggest problem is with the seller though the seller could not be contacted after several attempts will not buy kuzy ever again i do not recommend this case
this product arrived with yellow stains on the corners as if it had been left out in the sun within a couple of months , the corners began to crumble and fall off other than the stains , the color looks beautiful and the case fits perfectly i just wish it was more durable
this is a great cover and i especially like the <unk> pads on the bottom however , the all begin to fall off about # months after i bought it and are now all gone once the pads have fallen off it slips and slides all over the place on a hard surface
i did n't like the fit and finish the quality was great except for it not feeling snug and secure i also wished i had gotten the darker black version , though that was my fault i returned and got a different brand
it makes my macbook pro retina feel heavy and cheap i decided to take it off after # days of usage i do not recommend it to anyone who 's looking for a slim case
ordered this in late december and # months later it is already falling apart the rubber pads that protect the bottom have all fallen off with light use ca n't recommend this product
i like this cover and it does look nice but mine has already started to crack in the corners the top is fine but the bottom is cracking apart i 'm thinking about spending the extra money but i 'll keep looking elsewhere i 'm glad it worked for others , just did n't work for me
the case over all fit my # inch retina macbook pro perfect the only downside is that the corners of the bottom were cracked this is the second time i had a problem with this
the case finish itself is gorgeous , bottom case fits perfectly on my new mac retina but the top cover is another history i tried to set it # times and always one side of de screen lacks to properly secure the cover i mean when you saw the screen from perspective , there ` s one side elevated because the corner is too small to fit my screen it seems the size of the cover i got was manufactured # mm smaller that it should be -lrb- and i try very carefully to make it fit , but i couldnt -rrb- also like other reviews says , is really hard to remove , no matter if i use the & # # ; trick & # # ; told by other customers pulling back the top right a bonus : there are two rubber buttons were poorly glued i believe i ` ve bad luck with this batch , i ` m # % sure that i got a bad one , what a shame
for those thinking about buying this product , i would look at other brands when i first ordered this product , they sent me a case that did not fit on my laptop due to error when manufacturing the product i returned it and luckily got a full refund i reordered it again , at first the case was great except it was extremely difficult to put on the case about a week later , the case started to fall at part one by one , the little rubber stoppers on the bottom of the case feel off this is because they are placed on the case with something similar to double sided tape now , the matted coating is rubbing off , which is causing a mess everywhere i suggest if you really want a cheap product go for this , if not it is worth it to spend the money and buy one for better quality
i was excited to buy this cover for my new macbook pro after a month it was broken on one side then got a few cracks on other places the one on the edge is always disturbing while typing we always handle it gently inspite of that there are cracks on the cover i will definitely not buy it again or recommend it for anyone except for the colors i do n't see anything good in this
it wo n't last , even with careful use after a few weeks the case began to chip away , one chip at a time along the edges i keep it in a padded zippered sleeve , protected again by a computer bag , but still the case is not <unk> gentle use it 's now # months old and i 'm looking for a replacement
i bought this item # months ago and loved the looks and the fit the plastic though is very brittle and started to break down last month it has completely cracked up now and i have replaced it with another cover by another company be very wary of this
its a decent case and all , but i receive the order broken i received it in a box , which tells me its unlikely that it was broken while being shipped so they just were n't paying attention to the product they shipped out the case still works and all so its not quite worth my time to go through the returning hassle
the rubberized matte texture is nice , and the apple logo is visible through the plastic those are the only positive attributes of this case i was quite disappointed , especially after reading all of the positive reviews for this case online the rubber pads on the bottom were already peeling when i took it out of the packaging and shed plastic all over the place additionally , the top component did not fit my macbook perfectly ; it is a tad bit too small one side completely covers the aluminum lip , while the other is exposed
the looks great i originally loved the color and how it felt after a week of using it i noticed how dirty it can get -lrb- i even carry it in a sleeve and still manages to get dirty -rrb- the case also does n't fit the laptop perfectly , especially the top cover part overall i would say it 's a decent product aesthetically but do n't expect any great protection i 'm debating getting a speck case because this one keeps popping off i just think as a college student we try to find ways to save money and find great products but that is not the case in this situation i saved money but got a mediocre product
i like the product so far . it protects my laptop from scratches it was easy to install the apple logo in the back looks blurry but it does n't bother me only thing that i did n't like about the case is that the bottom rubber thingies look cheap . i barely set my laptop down and it starts peeling off , as if it is layered other than that . good case for the price . next time ill probably choose another color instead of black
after owning this case for several months , the case has many cracks in it i have been very carful with my case , and have not dropped it three out of the four black & # # ; feet & # # ; on the bottom of the case have come off . i am disappointed that i now have to purchase a new case i will try a different brand
the case is a good fit , and looks and feels nice on the computer <unk> the case arrived with a corner chipped and broken if the shipping and handling had been better and it not arrived damaged this would have been great
after about # weeks of having the product the outer shelling has started to peel even though i hardly use my computer the bottom slightly snaps out of place occasionally but i like the look and feel if the case just upset it 's
i purchased this in february # and it is now august # and the case is starting to break apart first was the corner by the monitor and then by the headphone jack area ... wished it would hold better as it is a great color and feel thinking of going back to speck since the only draw back to that is they dont have a lot of color choices for the retina # & # # ; macbook pro ... will be a hard decision
the case fits perfectly but packaging was very inexpensive looking and my cover has many weird marks it gets dirty kind of quickly besides that , it fits the laptop very well the color is very pretty it does the job
i chose this rating because it doesnt fit the top of my macbook pro with retina display fits everywhere else but the top its like an <unk> or two short on one side when i snap it on i might be returning this product because of that only reason otherwise its really nice
first i have to note it 's amazing that i paid $ # for two pieces of plastic & # # ; i guess us american 's are n't that smart and i 'm one of them about the product , it 's ok does the job ... but is definitely over priced
it does not snap on quite tightly enough , and the black color shows smudges -lrb- which i had hoped it would not -rrb- ** i 'm updating this review # months after purchase - a side piece has broken and is hanging loose it is just a matter of time until it snaps completely off i am not rough with my computer , so it is somewhat disappointing that the case is already showing that sign of wear
the case as a whole is awesome . nice finish however the bottom of the case has these raised rubber pieces that lift the laptop off of a table unfortunately one of these has already fallen off
i ordered # of these for my office , # in turquoise and one orange the orange is designed differently than the turquoise for some reason the orange does n't have rear corner protection as shown in the picture - a key area of <unk> it fits the laptop a little loosely and the clamps on the front edge where you rest your arms keep slipping on and off the edge they are also rough in some places
have been using this product since january , and has done its job of protecting my mac main con about this case is the # rubber bottom plugs have all fell off one by one they fell off with # months , glued them back on , but eventually lost them all over the months i got the black color which looked good , however does need to be cleaned regularly due to hand marks <unk>
i thought it would be a bit more protective of the computer - it does n't provide a lot of protection , but it does provide some , what i expected the reason i 'm not that into it - it smudges something <unk> it 's hard to keep the black one clean kind of tired of cleaning it only after a couple weeks
i purchased this for my daughter to protect her new macbook it was a perfect fit i have the black case on my mbp the only negative is the rubber feet eventually always come off of this case but it is still usable and protects the laptop
i initially thought i 'd hit the <unk> with this case looked just like the photo , felt sturdy enough to protect my macbook retina , and the vents underneath and feet on the bottom kept the machine cool but after a couple months of basic use , the front clips that hold the bottom part of the case on have started to slip off it 's right where my hands need to be to type , so there is a constant clicking on and off of the case as my wrists move i have n't figured out a way to make it fit on tighter / correctly again bummer , i 'm gon na have to start the hunt again for the case . $ # was a steep price to pay for # months worth of a case
this cover is durable , it does it 's job to protect the macbook but i do n't like how hard it is to put it in and take it off another downside about this product is how its very susceptible with fingerprints and how hard it is to clean overall , decent product but needs to be improved
i had to order this twice as the original order was sent to the wrong address i had read a few reviews saying that they received their cases with cracks in them but figured i 'd go for it anyway when mine finally arrived -lrb- i had to order it twice as the first was sent to the wrong address -rrb- sure enough the top case had a crack running along the bottom edge if it was n't for that i would rate this higher as i do like the look and feel of it and it does a good job of protecting # % of my new macbook pro the back section where the ports is is a little more open than i would like but that due to the new macbook design
i was very excited when i first received the kuzy case it 's colorful and snapped on nicely sadly , it 's began deteriorating after seven weeks it started with the thin pieces of plastic near the ports they started to break apart at the small connections protecting the vents slowly cracks have appeared at several joints around the case the case does n't experience any excessive wear and tear i have a home office , so my macbook basically goes from one surface to another every other day i did n't expect it to last forever , although the one for my old macbook lasted for # years , but i do expect it to last more than # weeks before it starts to break
top of case cracked when i tried to remove from my macbook pro retina display this has been the best quality item that i have been able to find on the market and i have tried several different brands
the case has a great feel to it and installation is easy the case also looks better in person than it looks in the picture my only complaint : the rubber feet they 're not adhered very well and you 'll probably have to use super glue to attach them properly
the cover is easy to slip on your macbook retina and fits it like a glove without <unk> its dimensions by much your macbook wo n't obviously look as sleek as it is without the cover but it is worth putting the case as it would protect and shield it from scratches and minor damage the finish is matte and looks classy , not like the cheap glossy ones the only reason i am giving it # stars is because it was very difficult to take off the case once i put it on i almost lost # nails in the process kuzy needs to make it easier for us to remove the case else it might just get impossible to remove it without breaking the case or damaging your macbook
fits well , looks good and all but the button rubber stoppers look like they were glued on by a # year old they are gon na fall off in less than a month
the little feet on the bottom of the machine came off about # days after it arrived otherwise its a great case next time i 'll probably get something from incase to ensure i get something that lasts a little
i do n't think the case fits my mac pro perfectly when i first put it on , i had to really pull it from one corner to another i also tried <unk> angles with the idea that i might have put it the wrong direction so basically this case does n't really snap right away when i email the company , they got back to me right away but did n't bother to allow me to change for a new one so i gave up ! ! !
i was looking for a slim , inconspicuous case for my macbook , and this kuzy case is exactly that it fits very well on my laptop however , after about a year of use , the bottom case has started cracking on headphone input side not a huge deal - i 'm still using the same case - just wish it had n't cracked overall a decent case at a reasonable price
ordered this for a new macbook pro i recently purchased i really like the frosted case look and the soft <unk> texture is great -lrb- i 'm bad about walking around at work carrying my laptop with one hand -rrb- and provides a good grip my gripe with this case is that within the first week of installing it , the lower shell developed a crack in the back right corner i had n't dropped it or banged it into anything , it just developed a crack a little over an inch long still works fine , it just bugs me that it has already developed a crack so i 'm not sure as to the long term durability of this product could be i just had a bad one
the fit is a little tight on the monitor portion , and over time the plastic has developed a hue to it my biggest complaint is that , like other people , i have lost some of the rubber feet this causes the laptop to sit awkwardly on the desk and it is a lot less slip resistant
i do n't like the rubber stands on the bottom side the make is not good the rubbers are not centered in their hole as they supposed to be the rest of them is okay to me the surface is smooth and easy to grab color is also <unk> to the image
i like this cover , but the corners are breaking off while this is expected with plastic hard shell covers , i just thought it 'd take longer since a cover should be able to take a beating these covers are nice , but i think they could be more durable also , my brother has covers that are almost identical , but they are made by another brand and they are nicer and not breaking i 'd suggest searching for covers from a better brand
i have n't had this case very long and half of the rubber anti-slip pieces have already fallen off which is very upsetting since i do n't really know where to buy the exact pieces that would fit this case besides that , the color is cute but does get greasy looking easily , i just wipe it down the apple logo shines through and there 's a kuzy symbol on the bottom left of the case as well in case you 're looking for a simply plain pink hard case i 'm sort of disappointed since the case was $ # and the bottom pieces already fell off but it 's okay
i 've only used the black rubber case for five days and already it has accumulated a lot of finger print marks i typically move from one desk to the other or sometimes put it on my lap when i 'm on the couch no one else touches my laptop even with my minimal interaction with the case , it seems like the kuzy case keeps a history of where i have touched my macbook based on other reviews , i was hoping that the marks would be easily removed by a cloth or the micro fabric that came with the rmbp i 'm sad to say that because fingers are naturally oily , a wet cloth of water does n't do the job as oil is <unk> i have not tried using windex or any form of soap , but i do n't want to have to clean the outside of my case every # days just so i can maintain its sleek black look other than that , the case is quite solid and does its job i like how the apple logo is see through but it is <unk> given the dark color of the case installation was easy and removing it was painless as well . it functions well , but its form can be improved
the case itself came in chipped , but it was n't worth it sending it back in to get another one i figured a # chipped case is better than no case at all other than that . . it 's just ok
the macbook retina display looks really nice with this case but after i received it , one corner crack fortunately i was able to fix it by myself so it 's nice , but you can probably find something better
i was thinking it was going to be bright turquoise and it was kinda dark also , it came broken which really put a <unk> taste in my mouth but it was really simple to return it and get my money back which is why i did n't <unk> this seller
the case is a little loose when you rest your hand to type the edges move but it 's not a big issue the real problem with this case is that the rubber feet are slipping and falling off one has already fallen off - so now when it sits on a flat surface it rocks a little when i type
i have a different type of macbook i guess and it doesnt fit so i wasted my money but it feels good and looks good , just wish i had
ordered the neon yellow one the color was spot on biggest complaint is that the rubber feet were not even glued on properly two of them came glued out of place overall i would give a # will update in a few months to comment on the longevity of the product edit -- # / # all the rubber feet came off
i can not speak on how this item fits older macbook pro <unk> , but it certainly does n't fit the new macbook pro retina -lrb- october # -rrb- that well the top cover for the screen fits nice and snug -lrb- no complaints there -rrb- , but the lower cover for the body fits very loosely and is removed easily
just received this case and without even opening the plastic packaging i can see it is missing two of the black rubber feet on the bottom part i opened it to be sure they were n't inside somewhere , and they were n't i find the flimsy plastic case rather disappointing quality and the color is pretty but darker than what the website shows time to keep shopping
this item fits my macbook pro wonderfully the only problem is that it started to chip and break within # days of having it i keep my laptop in my bag most of the day and only remove to use on flat surfaces i have no idea why it has started to break next time i will definitely spring for a <unk> quality item
i simply wanted a cover that looked good and protected my mbp and this case works very well it 's not flashy or slick looking but not ugly either does it 's job well and at a fair price
overall the case is nice it does show <unk> , but i expected that and clean it off regularly - the case is not heavy , and wraps around the screen and bottom of the computer like a sort of bumper still managed to show off the pretty aluminum , though - the lid portion of the case is very tight , a tad difficult to get off the bottom portion of the case feels lose and is easily removable , but does n't fall off - the case feet on the bottom originally looked as though they were covered with some sort of plastic , but that has worn off with use and they now look mostly black they do n't exactly feel secure , and are not flush in their little anchor points - the edges on the bottom portion of the case -lrb- near the hooks -rrb- look slightly scratched , almost like they were part of a mold and then <unk> off not obvious , but still detracts a bit
i was hoping for a hi gloss finish but it is actually more of a flat finish with a slight rubbery texture it fits and works great just not the finish i thought it was
generally , it matches the new macbook pro with retina display well . and it can give good protection . the black color i chose is great as well <unk> , it to some extent ca n't fit it perfectly , as it is a little bit smaller than the # `` mac 's actual size also , its production is kind of <unk> and rough overall , it is a good case for protection of the mac book pro with retina display
had a very similar case made by spec the price of the speck version was $ # and the corners broke off so i returned to spec for a replacement this happened a second time so when the replacement arrived from the company i returned it for a credit at the apple store where i purchased it i found this kuzy case which is virtually the same case as the spec i managed to get this case for only $ # instead of $ # if the corners break off again and the company <unk> replacement then i am only out $ # instead of $ # hopefully it will hold up
just received my kuzy hard case for my early # retina macbook pro i looked around for a day or so before deciding on the kuzy i read the reviews about the other brands and decided that for the price , this was the best bet i ordered one for me and one for my wifes brand new late # retina macbook pro the hard cases fit both the macbooks pretty well on mine the cover for the lid has a space between the cover and the mac lid and when the apple logo lights up it looks weird if i push the cover agains the lid it looks much better but i 'm not going to worry about it too much the one for my wifes fits much better so it looks like it 's hit or miss on that overall for the price i 'm happy with them the colors match and they feel very nice and do n't add any bulk to the laptop
i 've always had the speck cases for my laptops but could n't find an orange one for my new retina so i tried this i must say that i am very pleased with it , it has the matte finish that feels smooth and helps protect my machine from dings and scratches the rubber feet were n't totally in the right spot and will probably fall off soon but i do n't really care about that the biggest dislike for me is that my previous speck case snapped onto the body of the laptop rather snuggly , this does n't do that at all not that it is any easier to pop on or off overall i 'd buy this again - worth the money
it 's a smooth finish , covers the macbook perfectly , easily snaps into place and adds a nice black coat to a product that needs protection from scratches it 'd be # stars if it did n't have the small kuzy branding in the bottom left corner on the back of the display i 'd prefer it to be completely flush , no branding at all if i can find something else without this for a similar price i might change it
this case fits perfectly my husband remarked that he could n't see it ... and so , you get extra protection without sacrificing the beauty of the apple snaps right into place could n't be happier
this product is mediocre , at best the case did not appear to be in mint condition upon its arrival when i unwrapped it , it was scratched and smudged and appeared as though it may have been used before on the bright side , this product is true to color , cheap , and will certainly protect the outer surface of my macbook from cosmetic damage i 'm satisfied with the quality , and the product was still presentable and usable , so i will not be returning it - true to <unk> to snap <unk> <unk> - mediocre quality - not in mint condition upon delivery
i keep mine in a neoprene case when it is not in use . had it for about # months on my laptop and have no problems i havent ever dropped my laptop though so i presume dropping it would damage the case somewhat , pretty solid case thought and provides enough space under the laptop to keep it cool
this case color was just like it was depicted which is a plus i could n't give it # stars because it <unk> the range of motion for the lid a bit overall it is a good product it seems to provide good ventilation
this is a great cover compared to one 's twice the price the fit was pristine , my only complaint is similar to those of others ; the cover tends to pick up oily fingerprints maybe it 's just the black and as a side not i have n't attempted to clean with a solution or vinegar yet , but i would n't doubt that would restore it back to original appearance highly recommend if looking for a durable and stylish cover to protect your macbook
i have been using the hard case for about two weeks now it has a pretty decent fit , although on corner of the screen could have a bit snugger fit this computer travels to and from school daily and is exposed to the <unk> environment known , toddlers , both at school and at home there are no cracks or warping that has occurred just like the description it does have a different feel than i expected , i expected a rubber tire like feel instead it feels to me almost velvety smooth my favorite feature is how the cutouts for the vents and peripherals perfectly match my computer if this cover were to develop an issue i would replace it immediately for the money this is a great product and you wo n't be disappointed
the red is not a solid red and apple logo shines through pink because of that . the cover does protect the macbook well and is stable all i can do now is wait until my coworkers run out of joke for me
the case did n't snap on as well as i though it would but it protects well and no one can notice the fit is n't a problem but a slight disappointment not returning because it does exactly what i thought it would
it is a nice product that will protect your lovely macbook pro for years the feeling of the material is excellent , and very easy to install it is not hard case protective product , -lrb- in my case -rrb- after # months of use going around work and school , one corner of the case is crack however , that means that protect my computer of a potential damaged i will give # / # stars if that will possible i recommend the product ! ! !
the cover fits very well and adds little bulk to the mbp made of a matted plastic , this cover is not susceptible to fingerprints or other smudges i would recommend this cover to anyone looking to maintain a scratch-free mbp while not sacrificing the products size and portability
i really like this case overall it fits well but is a little snug around the front bottom corners , just not enough to warrant returning it i 'd rather have it a little snug than loose
