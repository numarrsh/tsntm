i liked the construction of this bag -lrb- it 's well-made -rrb- , but was n't anticipating the pearly sheen on the leather -- i 'm not a big fan of how shiny it looks otherwise , it 's a nice bag -- lots of pockets and places to stash you stuff , it 's a good size -lrb- especially for laptops -rrb- , and it is well-made
this is a pretty bag and i get the most compliments on it it is built tough and very stiff it took me a while to get used to the stiffness
i get stopped all the top for compliments on this very <unk> made upscale bag i would hav given it # stars except that the bag is very heavy once filled with all it will carry the color is beautiful
i do n't normally write reviews but feel compelled to for this bag -lrb- purchased in orange -rrb- everywhere i go people stop me and ask me where i purchased my bag , i could have sold it many many times over i live in <unk> - from time of ordering to delivery was # days - great bag and great service the bag is very vibrant and has a `` glow `` or shine that does n't really show up in the photos
i love this bag ! it fits two laptops and my ipad ! and i was able to store my wallet i am a true geek and this bag is stylish yet can hold the items you need i received alot of compliments on this bag and so will you !
lots of room for all of your special gadgets and gear my son loves that it looks like his bag is from the military being made out of canvas makes it more durable then regular school bags he wears it over one shoulder so the weight is n't all on his back the straps are adjustable to suit your needs the inside has plenty of pockets for pens , pencils and stuff you could also put your laptop in the main compartment . this bag would be great for travel will easily fit under your seat in airplane or over head great bag for the money
the bag is nicely made all the things i need can fit in the bag laptop , power cable , a few books , compartments for your pens and your swiss army knife -lrb- which i still need to get -rrb- overall for me its the perfect size for what i
this bag was perfect for me , it was a good price and light weight , has plenty of pockets for my things the only thing was , i wish it has magnet snaps for the front flap
my old canvas bag was beginning to wear out but i dreaded replacing it because i liked the light weight of it i liked the looks of this bag and despite my <unk> that it would add to the weight on my shoulder carrying my laptop around , i ordered it very happy so far with the purchase nice looking , seems well constructed , and very little additional weight this bag also has some nice padding which my other bag did not the only thing i 'm having a hard time getting used to is having to buckle the front flap before carrying - the bag does n't really hang straight when <unk> just different from my top zippered old bag
i bought this bag for my husband to carry his new ipad it 's a great bag it is masculine enough for him and nice enough for me when i need to borrow it
i could n't have picked a better case my notebook fits snuggly it even holds my cooling pad which is about an inch thick there are enough extra pockets and compartments for me to carry my ipod , headphones , a sketchbook ... random trinkets and what have you the side pockets are <unk> as they allow me to carry my wireless mouse i am totally in love with this bag
i got this for my husband a few days ago the design is beautiful and the briefcase has many compartments it was also well packaged and arrived on time overall i think this operation was a good buy
i was looking for a messenger bag style computer case that would hold my laptop and another item near the same size , but a little thicker this bag works perfectly it is well designed and very well made nice padding , nice layout , and nice price
i bought this bag because i trusted swiss gear and it was a really good bargain ; i figured if i did n't like it i had n't lost much i absolutely love it ! ! it 's made of very sturdy canvas material and will hold about anything that a person would want to carry around with a laptop i routinely throw my cooling pad , cords & mouse in and there is still plenty of available space the construction is very good ; it feels as though it will last a very long time been using it about a year now and see no signs of wear just purchased on for my daughter 's birthday because she likes mine so much she 's a medical school student so it will get a lot of use and will not likely be treated gently i have complete confidence that it will handle anything she can throw at it
very handy in carrying books , laptop and documents without looking too formal it fits my ipad , # & # # ; laptop , # page book and plenty of notes and documents shoulder strap is sturdy and well padded
prior to purchasing this swiss gear computer notebook briefcase through amazon , i did a lot of research on the net it seemed that the biggest review complaints about computer cases , had to deal with to tight a fit for the computer , and not enough storage space for the power cord , mouse , and office supplies this swiss gear canvas briefcase , has no such problems my laptop computer is # . # `` , and the fit is perfect and there is plenty of space for all my extras the swiss gear is very well made for the money , and i like the `` military look `` that it has i am # % satisfied with both my new swiss gear notebook briefcase , as well as the purchasing <unk> through amazon i would definitely buy a swiss gear product in the future
swissgear has always been my favorite and when i decided to downsize my backpack to a smaller bag , i came across this one and it is great easy to use , good pockets , compact and <unk>
i needed a replacement work satchel and did n't want to spend $ $ $ on a new one a buddy has one of these so i got a good look at it before purchasing one myself it 's pretty durable ; not as thick as a heavier laptop bag , but not thin either it has three main pockets , one has a velcro strap to close the rear pocket with i 'd buy another one if i lost mine
got this bag today and it 's everything i hoped it would be , , , just the right size , even big enough to pack for a weekend trip but not too big to get in the way quality appears to be excellent and i 'm glad the front flap closes with straps instead of those annoying magnetic buttons that keep popping open at all the wrong times my only regret that it was not made in the us the bag is made in ... guess
it holds what i need it to hold but i hate the clasp it 's difficult to close and if you pick up the bag by the handle without latching it there is a high risk of dumping your camera right out of the bag
perfectly sized for taking a large collection of equipment out for a shoot can easily take three lenses -lrb- including one large telephoto -rrb- , good size dslr , and accessories construction and materials used are very high quality , and good a good job of shedding water and dirt internal padding is sufficient , and has a nice pad on the strap i also have the <unk> # when i do n't need to take all the extras along for a shoot , but the # gets the most use one of my favorite things about the tamrac design is that you can leave the flap open for quick access to your camera , and feel confident that your gear is still very secure
i love this bag easy room for # bodies a couple lenses chargers and a net book also does scream camera bag very ruggedly made would definitely recommend this bag
i use this bag to hold my gf # with # mm and a canon # mm lens as well as my ipad on trips the size of the bag i think is perfect , not too big , provides good padded protection for the camera and ipad shoulder pad is wide and nicely padded as well and comfortable while carrying all day on trips and family vacations
my family goes camping about # weekends a year this bag has been perfect for protecting my canon rebel t # i , an extra lens and my ipad # , plus all the cables and accessories while we are on our travels the mesh pockets on the outside perfectly hold water bottles when we go on a hike i have been extremely happy with this bag
i have been looking for what i labeled the perfect camera/laptop bag although not perfect , this bag fits my need well holds my canon rebel with an extra lens and my ipad the front pocket could be a little larger , but it is ample enough to carry extra batteries usb cables and the like with room to spare very good quality and well designed
it exactly fits the purpose i bought it for a couple of design flaws , one of them being that one needs to use both hands to close and buckle the bag -lrb- easily <unk>
watch where you order your vera bradley from i would strongly suggest you ordered from the vera bradley site my granddaughters ripped on the <unk> after # months and they would n't replace it had i ordered from vera bradley they would have more than likely replaced it not at all happy about this back pack that is <unk> now
i loved this bag for the longest time , i have used the bag since the beginning of last school year -lrb- <unk> # -rrb- after about # months of almost daily use the straps began to tear and fray , now the bottom is ripping the coloring on the top and sides has faded so much that it looks like i have had this bag for # + years i would not reccommend getting this bag if you are looking to find something that will last more than # <unk> # year also , this bag does not hold very much a laptop , # `` binder , and a notebook are about all it can hold without straining on the zippers
i bought this style of backpack for my daughter she is in high school at first she liked the backpack very well , then after she had more homework and bring more books home she realized that it did n't have enough space for much and it was very stiff she said when she had it on it felt like she could barley move around i would suggest not getting this backpack it 's so expensive and you might not even like it if you still think you might want one it might be a good idea to find one somewhere less expensive
te product is fine , but the price i could 've bought one at the actual store for the same price after all was said and done love this bag to pieces though nothing wrong with the product it fits everything i needed
my daughter loves this laptop bookbag the material is soft like vera 's purses and totes , so i hope it last under the weight of all of the books i thought it would be made using a stronger fabric like the luggage is made love that her laptop fits so she can take it with her anywhere
this is a very well made quality backpack used by a high school girl the only problem is her laptop required by the school is a # & # # ; and it is a little large for the allotted section she has to put it in the main compartment which is larger she loves the backpack and it is very pretty with bright colors the fabric is thick quilted and sewn together tightly so it can carry heavy loads and hold up
i love this bag and it is super practical i am a college student and all my books fit in it , my laptop , everything it 's really roomy and does not sag it also does n't get really heavy which is super for my back problems
i love my backpack it is just the thing for me and will carry my ipad or kindle protected in an extra pouch it is the old design which i like better than the new one , so i bought several , so i can have them for a few years
i wanted an inexpensive bag to cover my laptop when moving just wanted to be able to locate it and keep track of it so i got the red the fit is really tight for my # . # the cords fit in a zippered bag on the outside of the bag and the storage is rather bulky there is not much room for many accessories if i were using the bag on a regular basis to transport my laptop , i would want something a bit larger with more room for storing accessories
the bag fit my fujitsu # . # & # # ; laptop computer snugly the pocket flap is a nuisance and should not be a flap the material eventually tore at the flap clasp i did get some heavy use out of the bag during # weeks of travel the price was right it is a so-so bag for use in and out of a backpack while travelling
this bag is perfect for something that is n't too bulky and the price is right the laptop fit is a bit tight though which is why i rated it at # stars it is an acer v # g- # . # & # # ; laptop
things fall out of it i was so excited when i first got this , because the idea of organization and <unk> was just exciting i put my two phones , some pens , lip <unk> on the grid , then put some money inside the zipper -lrb- on the back of the grid -rrb- first day of use , all things fell out of the grid when they were in my purse , standing vertically it was nice a giant purse , so it 's not like things were sloshing around in there they just fell fail # # . within # weeks of use , the back area where i had some cash ripped open due to a busted seem from the edges fail # # . i took pictures of this and contacted the grid-it makers -lrb- not the seller here -rrb- customer service person actually contacted me back and stated that they 'd send me a new one well ... . . ... nope , they never did
it is what 's advertised but truly not all that functional certainly would n't recommend it does hold cords but not all the tight and nothing to hold plug-in a bit bulkier items
i loved the idea of having an organizer to keep the loose things in my bag in one place however , i do n't like the trade-off of adding additional weight this organizer feels like it weighs as much as a small paperback book also , you 're going to need fingernails to use this
organizing cords , cables , dongles , <unk> and gadgets in a backpack or briefcase is challenging this makes it <unk> and more of a game i love the grid-it system and find myself playing <unk> with my gear to get things to fit i bought two different sizes and this one for the color and both have been put to good use i have no complaints yet , but imagine the elastic straps will eventually fail like a <unk> 's underwear , life <unk> <unk> with what you are strapping down
this a great product but , its is not what i was waiting , it is alittle bigger of what i was expecting anyways , it is great to keep all cables organize , and avoid damages or lost cables such as charging devices , head phones , ect .
if you have a lot of little cables and things , this is great this version is just a bit too big for my bag , unless you really need the extra space , consider the size smaller i 've got that one as well and think that practically it holds just as much
i use the grid it every day to hold cables and tiny gadgets in my messenger bag the grid it was a live saver during my last business trip , i reach into my bag and pull out one thing with all my stuff already attached nothing is ever crammed into a pile at the bottom of the bag , and no cables ever get tangled i use it to hold a battery , bluetooth receiver , mini usb hub , pen , and various charging cables the grid is made up of small and large bands allowing for various sized bits to be held however this also limits exactly where on the grid you can put any sized device for example the middle of my grid is the only spot that can hold the usb battery pack i use this ends up covering the medium size band which could hold my phone while charging this leads to some bands being stretched more then they should , or two gadgets crammed under the same band your results will vary
this is one of those products that you look at and say `` why did n't i think of that ? this is one of the best ideas i 've seen in some time it really works and comes in several sizes to meet just about every need well designed and quality construction you decide what goes , where lets you change your mind any time you wish will fit in your suitcase or briefcase and puts all those gadgets at you finger tips i know i 'm going to buy several more
i really like this organizer it could be a little bigger for my needs , but that 's not the fault of the item i used it on vacation it worked great i just took it out of my computer bag with all my items attached , and put it in a bin it kept all my items together throughout the whole trip i 'll continue to use it at home for my cords and adapters
it holds items with different shapes really well i have several different cords for chargers and ear phones they stay in place while traveling and are just a grab and use when arriving at the hotel i purchased the larger one and could have gotten by on the next size down it holds a lot of
i used to have a lot of <unk> in my bag , which would inevitably end up <unk> <unk> at the bottom of the back at the end of the day no matter how well i organize the items in my bag , there is no comparison to how well grid-it * keeps * everything organized the way i originally left it
<unk> , cutters , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , pencils - who knew you needed soo much junk to smoke a <unk> , comfortably and when you are comfortable , who needs to get up to search for the needed tool i keep all my <unk> tools on a grid-it next to me and i only have to get up for more scotch the grid-it holds the small tools securely so i am not dropping things all the time it keeps the tools separated so they do n't get banged up if you keep them in a pouch or your pockets i would recommend the grid-it for any & # # ; small tool & # # ; application
this thing is great i love it , its helped to clean up my laptop bag so i can actually find stuff in there i wish i had bought it earlier i liked it so much , i bought two more for the rest of my electronic clutter
i use this in my laptop bag for all my random cords it works great i can just pull it out and grab the cord i need make sure you measure you bag , though i just guessed and i could have gotten a bigger one , which would have been that much better
i am a geek have one of these for my self , and my son wanted one both work well easy to organize cords and chargers and other items pick the size you want and go ft it !
this organizer has saved me tons of aggravation in finding the random bits and bobs in my purse where i used to stress out as i dug through my purse looking for my wallet or id badge for work , i now am able to reach into my purse and pull out exactly what i need this fits perfectly in most of my full sized handbags and has been an <unk> for my organization
very handy for organizing all my cords , earphones , chargers , etc . even bought one as a gift for a friend just wish i 'd bought a larger one for myself
this is my second <unk> grid-it organizer happy with it as it provides me many ways to carry my stuffs and yet save space also the other benefit is that i can see all my stuffs at one glance
this backpack looks awesome and is very functional quite a bit of space despite it 's fairly small size however there is a major issue with the bag - the side zipper is made of cheap plastic , and has become useless after only three months of use i am not sure i 'd recommend this bag to anyone who <unk> out punishment to their equipment - it wo n't be able to stand up otherwise i was very happy - just not sure i want to pay $ # every three months
it 's a high quality backpack , with all the pockets you might need and more - however , once your laptop and other items are in , there is n't much room for books or anything else i can only carry my laptop , a folder , and one text book <unk> two small books i have to carry my lunch separately which is kind of a bummer
i wanted to give this backpack # stars but i did n't because , even though the description said it would accommodate a # `` laptop my dell inspiron # r did n't even come close to fitting i was disappointed that it did n't fit because laptop the compartment is very nice , but it did fit in the other large top loading compartment there is plenty of room for my ipad , camera , cords & adapters i 'm a senior who uses this backpack when i travel , so i love the fact that it is lightweight & does n't have a lot of outside compartments
ive been using this bag for over a month now and have had no problems with it i use it for college and have been really impressed with it the laptop pocket is perfect to protect it and makes it easy to get to i also really like the straps on it , really comfortable as for the zippers i have n't had any problems yet and ca n't really see breaking them all that easily , they seem plenty durable thus far all in all it 's a great bag
i loved this pack when i first got it it looks great , and the side entry laptop is very handy , and works awesome in airport security that being said , the quality is lacking i use my pack daily , and it is not as durable as it should be the zippers are cheap , and many of my seams are ripping one year into use i 've had quality ogio packs in the <unk> past , and bought this one based on positive past experiences i wo n't be doing that again my less expensive swiss gear pack held up for # + years of solid use had i not <unk> slammed a buckle in a car door , i would still be using it now this ogio pack simply ca n't <unk> with that
item shipped and received fast bag in brand new condition pocket functionality not that great there are lots of pockets for storage but they all fill inside so if you have the inside full you can not fill the other pockets could just be me but one strap always slide down my are unless buckled in even though it has air system i still get hot standing inline its a bad on your back its gon na <unk> you the side computer pocket is great , i 've carried my mab pro on numerous flights and have no damage the padding is excellent
i bought this for my # year-old son , and the zipper broke the first time he put his laptop in it next time , i 'll spend more to get a better quality case
when i first got this bag , i thought it was perfect however , within a week of use , the zipper broke and since it only has one zipper , it leaves it virtually useless
this laptop case would be perfect -- lightweight , smooth , nice handle strap -- but it comes filled with tiny plastic sand that gets everywhere it 's already killed one key on my laptop before i thought to dump and scrape it out ironic that i thought it would be protective
i 'll make due but this product was a little big i suppose this my fault for not measuring other than that , the product seems to be okay this is just n average review
if you are looking for a functional , inexpensive laptop sleeve , this one will do the job -- provided it fits it 's cheap , i like the retractable handle , and the bottom corners of the laptop are reinforced with a slightly thicker canvas material -lrb- two corners on the shorter edge if you are placing the laptop in a backpack i have a # . # inch acer and unfortunately that computer does n't fit inside the sleeve without the zipper scratching the case i was also disappointed that the trim is a different shade of blue than pictured -lrb- instead of like an <unk> blue , it comes across more like a <unk> blue - not bad , but not what i expected from the picture -rrb- at the end of the day , i would have kept this sleeve if it was slightly bigger , but given the fit issues i 'll be returning the item
very pleased with this case so far , but have not had a chance to travel with my laptop in it feels nicely padded , soft inside the front extra pocket is zippered which makes me more inclined to use it for flash drives or cords the handle is great the zipper only goes along one of the short ends , but it is enough to easily get the laptop inside tight fit for my # . # inch hp pavilion
this is a nice case for the money , fits my # & # # ; laptop nice and snug only thing is that i wish one side of the case was hard plastic so i could set my computer on it and not worry about it <unk>
after reading all reviews i decided to buy this item and i 'm glad i did i own an hp <unk> # / # inch it fits great ! - i love the color , material and price word of <unk> ' t expect to fit a laptop over # / # inch in this case
my laptop fits well inside this it is a # . # & # # ; dell laptop i am sure the fit <unk> , but it just fits inside if it were any bigger it might not work i think it should be marketed for laptops under # & # # ; if your laptop fits this is a great sleeve the inside is soft and cushioned nicely so it wo n't scratch the finish of your laptop my laptop case is plastic and this was exactly what i needed to keep it from getting scratched up when i am taking it with me
despite some negative reviews on durability , i purchased this sleeve the only thing i found to be faulty were the dimensions quoted the sleeve with a # . # inch screen laptop just -lrb- and i mean `` just `` -rrb- fit . the sleeve actually measures # inches by # . # inches by # inches i leave my very small usb dongle for the wireless mouse on , and i had to stretch the zipper slightly to close it but for that , it would have been an exact fit i only plan on using this inside the house to lug my laptop around from room to room i have another sturdier bag for when i actually travel one feature i actually liked was the small handle that did not protrude much i would not recommend this for your full time laptop case , but for my use at home it was perfect
it does fit my new hp laptop very well it looks beautiful & compact having the outside pocket is easy to keep the computer charger the price was great as well the top handle , makes it so easy & handy to carry it where ever you go .
my # . # & # # ; laptop fits just barely it is # / # & # # ; long x # / # & # # ; wide anything longer and you would probably have scraped corners from the zipper the case itself protects very nicely , and the handle folds away compactly
i recently purchased an hp notebook -lrb- pavilion g # t # . # `` -rrb- in <unk> blue for mobile computing i wanted a sleeve right away so i first shopped the various retail stores in my area but could n't find one that i liked then i shopped amazon.com and found this great hp sleeve that fits my notebook perfectly , has the functionality i need , and is even color-coordinated for a totally sharp looking solution the handle is a great design and lays flat if you just want to tuck the sleeve under your arm getting in and out of the car the hidden zipper and sleeve opening design works well to protect the notebook from being scratched when inserting or removing it from the sleeve this is an awesome sleeve and the best value i found for looks , functionality and cost also , if you need a small companion accessory case -lrb- to tote the power cord , wireless mouse , speakers , etc . . microsoft makes one that is # x # in a matching black/blue design and has both a shoulder strap and handles
this case is very good quality it is very durable the handle on the top is very strong it is the perfect fit for my laptop the outside pocket is perfect for the charger or other accessories
just got this from the mail , poor quality and it looks like very cheap quality made from china , not worth the price , would not recommend to anyone
total piece of crap item looks <unk> made , and mine has minor defects straight out of the box i am really unhappy save your money and get a brenthaven product instead -lrb- google it -rrb- they 're more expensive but worth it can not believe i purchased this sleeve it is awful and very <unk> even case logic does it better
this would have had # stars but within a day one of the zipper pulls came off i will use pliers to secure it but would have thought that would have been part of the quality control other than that i love it great memory foam layer
so , i am happy with this product , but just like the <unk> review mentioned , you never know which end is up i think a simple patch or some fabric pens could make quick work of this
this case is great the soft material inside cushions my macbook quite nicely it is the perfect size , and it fits my macbook snugly even when i have a speck case on it my only gripe is that the little lining sometimes gets caught on the zipper , and it makes it a big harder to zip otherwise , this case is awesome and i definitely recommend it i 'm glad i made the investment
very nice , inexpensive sleeve that offers great protection . the memory foam is dense enough to seem like it would provide substantial protection , unlike some of the other sleeves that have minimal padding it is very well constructed , has a scratch guard that runs the full length of the zipper and is not too bulky the fit is excellent - it is just big enough to fit a # `` mbp without any excess slack , yet it is easy to get the mbp in and out of the sleeve ca n't imagine how this could be improved and it is fairly cheap compared to the usual <unk>
most of the images are for a different case this case does not have any of the features shown -lrb- wide case with two zippered areas on top , rubber trim along sides -rrb- clearly a different case is being shown in all but the bottom picture this may work and it is n't worth my time to ship it back , but i would n't have paid more than $ # for this case if it had been advertised correctly
it was missing the ring on one side of the bag to attach the shoulder strap very <unk> , if it was n't for the missing ring this would be # stars
this is just a sleeve not a case as shown in the descriptive pictures e-bags returned a five dollar and change refund to get <unk> keep it still not happy with it as it is not the case shown e-bags representative claimed amazon must have put the <unk> in the ad still no one has offered to send me what i thought was ordered according to the descriptive pictures at <unk> charges to compensate for my time and trouble bad deal folks
was not impressed with this computer carrying case very thin ! ! does not offer much protection next time , i would definately spend a little more money and get a better quality case
i returned this bag as soon as i unpacked it it is not a computer bag , but rather a computer sleeve there is thin padding on the sides and there is no padding whatsoever around the perimeter that 's where you need it , should you ever drop the bag the bag consists of a single compartment and outside zipped pockets cut in the shell of that same compartment it seems that the pockets will handle only <unk> objects in have not tested it , so i might be wrong on the pockets
i thought this bag would survive my graduate school life , but i was wrong after # months of owning it the bag is falling apart if you want this bag for a trip or something , great if , however , you expect it to survive carrying a laptop and a few books insides on a daily basis , not a chance a few weeks ago a notices fraying in a few areas , the bottom of the bag and around the straps , then huge holes formed if the bag survives the rest of the week i will be shocked
i thought i was buying a bigger bag . this bag is very slim and probably ca n't even hold a mouse or the power cord comfortably i would not recommend this unless you have a computer that does n't need a power cord -lrb- which i think is no one -rrb- the pockets are very tight and i would only imagine putting just paper in there i am only keeping it because it is the only thing i have right now and other bags are so expensive i <unk> want to return this item i guess a few positives is that it seems like a sturdy bag i like the shoulder strap i will probably just use it as a laptop carrying case
not much more than a basic laptop bag ... bought for the brand , does n't quite meet samsonite quality , but what does one expect when buying a $ # bag at least it matches the rest of our luggage
one of the pictures showed this bag as having # main zipper compartments and # inches thick the bag i received has one main large compartment and is one inch thick
i like it but i think more space would have been better right now i really have to squeeze my laptop & charger in this bag the build quality is nice and the bag itself is elegant recommended for those who only like to carry the <unk> in their bag if you want to put some files and documents in your bag too , then seek something else
the case is great professional and stylish this was a gift , so i do not know how it will last , but looks like it is made very well
i bought this bag a few weeks ago along with my macbook pro retina , # inch i 'm a highschool student , so i wanted to carry my macbook to school with me , which led me into looking for a laptop bag i just wanted a simple , sturdy bag that would let me carry my laptop to school without being it too much of a burden , and this bag does the job it 's thin , yet feels durable it looks sleek and simplistic , which i love i 've been using for about two months , and it 's protecting my macbook very well there are extra pockets for chargers , earphones , and other small things , but if you want a bag to carry your books or anything major , this is n't the bag for you i 'd recommend this case to anyone that wants a stylish , thin , simple and durable laptop bag
needed something to carry my papers , when i go to various meeting and functions i wanted something smaller than a standard hard-sided briefcase if i ever get out of the stone age and get a laptop this will be a very good solution for carrying that also
good materials and construction plenty of padding i can carry my # inches dell latitude , a notepad and a few folders i 'd like it better if it had an internal divider to separate the pc from the folders , and also a strap in the back to slide it over the handle of my rolling carry-on case however , i can use one of the handles and/or the shoulder strap for that purpose and it works well enough
in general , i liked the bag the only problem is the side handles after certain duration of usage , a plastic strip tends to come out of inside of & # # ; rounded holding part of & # # ; side handles i pushed it back inside but handles need to be improved slightly this is not a serious problem though shoulder strap is ok zippers are ok
i only wish there was more reinforced padding on the corners and edges to protect my laptop , but unless you get a hard case i do n't think there really is anything much better that is out there i might line the inside edges with an additional layer of neoprene it 's nice and minimalistic , so if you do n't want bulk it 's a great bag
sleek and fashionable samsonite delivers another quality product my gripe with it is that it leaves not much room for anything else my charger did not fit otherwise , great product for a working professional
this bag is great for my hp # . # widescreen it is well made and perfect to carry around my only complaint is the storage for the power cord with my hp power cord in the bag it really bulges out of the pocket and i am concerned that it will eventually tear through
the bag is slim , durable and fits my laptop perfectly the shoulder straps are comfortable and are adjustable to different lengths when you add the laptop power cords , papers and/or <unk> , the bag tend to look a bit bulky but overall it is an excellent bag to carry your laptop and other minor items this bag has met my expectations after i ordered it on amazon
