it wasnt what i ordered at all , however this was much better than what i had originally ordered no # stars for the wrong order shipped but at least # <unk> the one i got instead was really
the charger fits too , but expect a bulge from power brick it 's an adequate fit chromebook # is too slim for this , it seems , but on acer 's c # would fit this perfectly like a glove the color is not as vibrant as shown on the product image , but i expect that 's my monitor over <unk> the colors i would n't have minded a cheaper case , but the extra room to carry a charger was a feature i was not going to compromise over-all , nice purchase , but you 're essentially paying $ # more than the competition for the extra compartment for extra accessories
this sleeve perfectly fits my # `` macbook air and really protects it it 's worth the cost , for sure i 'd give it # stars if it had a shoulder strap i recommend this sleeve for anyone
this is great for my mackbook air # , i have the plastic case and it fits nice it would have been better if there was a <unk> to carry it on the shoulder
this is exactly what i wanted for my new macbook air it 's tight-fitting but i like it even if it ca n't fit the chord in it well without bulging out funny i just wanted a case to protect the outside of my laptop if it 's in a larger bag this does just that
roocase 's super bubble neoprene sleeve case cover comes with a unique <unk> : it has bubbles inside ! lol seriously , this design works as expected since purchase i have never used any `` skins `` that you wrap around your think macbook air # , i just use this bubble sleeve to protect it i store my macbook air right next to my thick books , inside my crammed bag pack , and even just on the floor with other books stacked on top of it and it really works
i have the # . # & # # ; chromebook , got this for that meant to protect while in a backpack , does n't seem like its meant to be a standalone item , but thats fine by me
this is a really nice carrying pouch for the macbook air i got this case for my son 's # . # `` air and it is a winner , especially for a middle school student where a lot of banging in a back pack will occur the only problem is the accessory pouch is really tight for the charger since the air has a fairly long battery life it probably is not necessary to take it along all the time but it would be nice if it was bigger others have said it does not fit the laptop well but i think it is just about right the only reason i gave it # stars for the fit is the accessory pouch
i bought this for my macbook air and love it i fit a charger for the macbook , a logitech wireless mouse , and an iphone # and # charger in the front pocket the case is durable and protects computer well
this case is great fits the mac air -lrb- # `` -rrb- perfectly , is lightweight and well padded the side pocket is an added bonus for inserting a computer cord great price too
this case seems very protective , and has plenty of padding throughout most of the case i would like to have more padding on the bottom seam i work in it and every macbook that i 've seen that has damage from a fall usually has the damage on one of the bottom corners
one reason i bought this because i really liked the first case that i bought to protect my kindle , but the zipper does n't work very smoothly compared to it i 'm not sure if it 's because this is a bigger case with a longer zipper or if it 's a lower quality zipper another reason i purchased it was because i needed something i knew would protect my hp envy x # and which would easily slip into a backpack or messenger bag after searching <unk> for a case with those characteristics and which specifically said it was for the x # , i purchased the roocase i crossed my fingers that the fit would be ok , which it is , but it 's a tight fit which i figured it might be the next size up was for # & # # ; laptops and i was n't sure if a looser fit would be more , or less , effective in protecting my x # hopefully i never find out that i should 've gone with the larger case
when i got my case , the zipper was jammed so i could n't even open it to try it out a couple days later , the company contacted me and i told them about it they sent me a new one , free of charge , and sent me a way to ship back my old one to them great customer service i have n't had a chance to use it all that much yet , but it seems to be a much sturdier case than the one i was using before it fits my macbook air # -inch pretty snugly , and i have an incipio case on it
i am using this sleeve case for my # `` macbook air pros : the interior does a great job of protecting the notebook with the `` bubble `` protection i like the color selection and it has a pocket in the front for my charger and care manual cons : i wish it had a carrying strap all in all , i am very happy with the sleeve i plan on keeping it in my school bag for easy carriage , since it does not come with a strap i am happy with it 's protection of my laptop
this case was purchased as a gift for my mother to go with her macbook air the case looked very well made and protects the laptop effectively when she travels the <unk> color suited her well and the accessory pocket makes it easy for her to carry the power cable good price , quality , color i would recommend this highly in fact , i purchased one for myself too
i bought this for a samsung chromebook series # , and i feel as if it protects the crap out of it the little bubbles on the inside cradle the laptop very nicely the zipper has a smooth action i think the case will last for years there are only two drawbacks when the package arrived , the sleeve reeked of a warehouse i ended up wrapping it in newspaper and putting it in a garbage bag over night , and doing that only cut the smell in half i hope the smell goes away soon if you have a shedding pet , the material it ; s made out of will attract the hair every so often i 'll take a piece of tape to it to get the hair and dust off the case
this case is pretty sweet it fits my # `` macbook air , as well as has enough room to snugly fit my wacom bamboo under it , and the stylus in the pouch the only downfall is that it gets a bit snug even without the bamboo tablet when i put my power supply in there , but the flexible neoprene accommodates it
i like it it has more space than i thought it had it is also quite protective i dropped my mac air with this case and my laptop is still
great design , love the inside protective bubbles inside , can fit the charger into the bag . shipping and delivering on time . highly recommend it four star and not five because the assembly of it looks cheap , and i doubt it will last more than two years . my bad for the high expectations
cute case for macbook air my daughter likes the `` bubble `` interior the outside pocket is nice for storing the cord thick to protect , but still pretty lightweight to carry she uses this on a daily basis and it 's holding up well
i got this for my samsung chrome book -- i love the color and the size and the amount of padding the pocket is great for the powercord and flash drive this was a perfect solution
`` i replaced the incase that i previously purchased -lrb- and returned -rrb- with this sleeve -lrb- which i purchased from amazon -rrb- for my # inch macbook air it fits great and has good padding and workmanship the zipper works fine and does not scratch the surface of the computer the little zippered compartment offers handy extra space a good buy and a good price
this protective cover is really good , so far the best out there ~ ... my # . # `` macbook air fits like a glove , and the zipper wont interfere with the notebook also the super bubble neoprene gives that extra protection no other cover will provide , forget about those foam covers , this is the perfect case if you really want to protect your notebook i take it to school everyday , is always around inside my book bag , and my computer is like from the first day fully recommended ! !
not only did i receive this case quickly -lrb- i need instant <unk> -rrb- but it was exactly as described my mac airbook fits in perfectly , it 's professional looking and it has style i feel better knowing mycomputer is safe in transit and i love the fact that i have a unique case i was very disappointed that apple does n't offer sleeves but now i 'm <unk> this one is perfect
i 'm very satisfied with this case i really like the zippered portion because it is very useful to hold extra items the design is nice and it has the protection i need for my macbook pro air the price is also reasonable i highly recommend this product
this protected my laptop very nicely it has nice cushion for my laptop which makes me feel safe and secure about leaving my laptop there it even fit my cord to charge my laptop and delivery date was right on time . & # # ; i highly recommend . & # #
good quality case fits the # -inch macbook air well , though like others it is not a perfectly tight fit i especially like the bubble insulation which seems to provide added protection to the laptop the quality of the zippers is high overall build quality seems high
i really like this new roocase for my macbook air # some cases for # inch laptops do not fit right because they do not have widescreen displays , where this roocase fits great it has a really snug fit , and added protection because of the `` bubble `` foam pads i would recommend it for anyone looking for a macbook air # case
i love this case i purchased it for my acer aspire # . # `` netbook and i truly love it as others have mentioned , it is well made and greatly protects my netbook the front pocket is great to take the charger on long trips it is stylish and practical at the same time buy this case you wo n't be disappointed
this case is awesome fits my macbook air # . # perfectly . it 's a very sturdy case and the inside `` bubble `` liner really protects my macbook air the zippered side pouch is very roomy i am so glad that i purchased the roocase
i hesitated on purchasing this sleeve for two weeks , i really thought it would be made out of cheap materials but it was n't i love the sleeve , my mac fits great in it and there 's room for other items , like your plug it 's a must have ... get it now ! ! ! do n't wait
i really like this sleeve it was cheap it provides great protection for my macbook air it is pretty aesthetically pleasing also , the pocket that is on the outside of the sleeve is quite useful my only slight complaint is that the bubble interior catches on the silicon feet of my case -lrb- not really a fault of the sleeve though in my opinion -rrb-
i bought this for my samsung chromebook it has a high quality feel to it and is well made it 's achieves the perfect balance of providing excellent protection , but still manages to be thin - even with the charger and cord in the front zipper pocket overall great product , i 'd highly recommend for anyone with a macbook air or samsung chromebook
i 'm crazy and love pink everything -lrb- i 'm a guy -rrb- this case is the perfect size for the surface and the zipper pocket is great for storing the pen , power supply , and mini display port adapter a lot of the & # # ; official & # # ; surface cases were too small for the pro , but this is great and feels like it provides great protection
i got this case because apple did n't have any <unk> of the right size when i bought my # `` macbook air i 'm glad i got this one and not the `` official `` incase one this one was n't made specifically to fit the macbook air , but it fits well enough that i 'm confident carrying it around i have n't had any problems with scratches or undue movement the `` bubbles `` inside the case hold the macbook air firmly the outside pocket is great for carrying around the myriad adapters and dongles you need with any mac -lrb- <unk> to vga , usb to ethernet , usb to pc headset -rrb- and the power brick i like the orange color too
i purchased this case for my # inch macbook air the case fits my computer perfectly and provides a lot of protection as i transport it back and forth from work and home i also appreciate the zippered front pocket for my charger and my vga adapter this case is also offered at a fantastic price
bought this as a gift for my sister 's new samsung chromebook she 's very pleased with the fit and padding she has two cats , so it provides the protection for when she puts in the case

i have the samsung chromebook and it fits great i can put my charger in the zipper pocket and the bubble inside seems really protective i took it from ny to <unk> and back , seems perfect
i searched extensively on-line and in stores for a carry case for my mac book air # `` all the reviews that i read seemed to emphasize that because the mac is so small and thin , it would be best to have some type of inner protection the roocase super bubble neoprene sleeve case cover , fits the bill i 'm very satisfied with it i put it in my purse when i flew recently and it was easy to take out for security inspection and i did n't have to worry about it getting marked or dented i 've since gotten a hard cover , also double protection to keep my baby mac safe ! i selected green and i 'm happy with the color it does come in many color options and i do highly recommend it the bubbles inside really protect it
i got this to protect my macair when i take it places it is small and compact , but this is what i wanted ... basically just a sleeve for the macair i then put it in a bag that i 'm carrying everything else in
this case is lightweight and does n't take up much room in a backpack it protects the computer very nicely , and is stylish also , it is more affordable than most covers
love this case i have it in my purse with the zipper side up and opened so all i have to do is reach in and slip the macbook air out and slide it back in when i 'm finished no one ever knows i have the laptop in there exactly what i needed
as the samsung series # . # inch model was just released , there were no products available for custom fit protection i took a little risk purchasing this macbook air case , but the case fits great and there is only a little extra space in the sleeve -lrb- about a # inch -rrb- along the zipper other than that , this case seems very well manufactured , and the bubble inside lining is quite nice , providing firm and precise <unk> of the laptop when carried the external pocket is neat , but can not hold more than the samsung charger , a cell phone , and a couple usb drives overall , i 'm very pleased with this product
as i mentioned in the title , this sleeve adds a lot to the profile of the macbook air # ' , but acts as a very nice protection for this awesome machine it seems durable and easy to clean the bubbles inside are what gives it the bulk , but you can notice the added protection right away it also has an external pocket for carrying the power brick this is a great feature

this attractive little roo case is a perfect fir for the # . # inch macbook air it is lightweight and does not increase the bulk of the item much unless you also carry the power cords , which are a very snug fit in the front pocket i got the one with the dark blue trim and it is very attractive the smell inside the main compartment was a bit overwhelming initially but i propped it open in an open air space for # hours or so and the smell dissipated i just got the case so i ca n't speak to durability although it looks and feels durable very happy with the purchase so far

i bought a plastic case to put my air it , because well , i have a tendency to ruin beautiful things however , when i travel and i have it thrown in an attache case i need a bit more support this product is perfect for it it fits snuggly without needing to stretch and has small <unk> bumps inside to ensure its safety the case looks great i have compared it to cases they sell at the apple store for $ # and found this one to be much nicer
this case fits my macbook air # `` perfectly it provides it a lot of protection so i do n't worry about throwing it in my backpack i also like the extra zippered pouch in the front to carry adapters and the charger i bought a similar one from the same company in blue for my husband for his # `` macbook air and he also really likes his this case is thicker than his -lrb- his does n't have the bubbles -rrb- and in my opinion provides superior protection
i have had this case for about a month now the case is a little too big for my mba # ' but i like how much <unk> it provides the zipper does get a little stuck sometimes , but i use it daily and it has no signs of being broken yet i would recommend this product if you care about protection more than design the case is a bit bulky but it does provide a ton of protection
the case is a great fit for the macbook air # `` the excess room some people refer too is almost non existent , and is used up if you add the adapter to the front pocket would definitely recommend
fits my samsung chromebook perfectly and provides the everyday protection for the laptop as needed also , a big plus on this product compared to other ones is the presence of side pocket for accessories on a side note , the colors seem to be limited i wanted something either just black or just grey or a <unk> but the color was n't available regardless , good product and i like it a lot
this is an excellent sleeve there is optimal <unk> a really handy zippered compartment i wish that it was a bit more snug but other than that it is perfect

i bought <unk> super bubble neoprene sleeve case cover when the mac air came out last year i am very happy with my purchase a year later , i bought another mac air # `` on <unk> of my friend in buenos <unk> , i did not like the sleeve covers available in the store , less attractive , # times the as much so i bought <unk> again , this time a <unk> combination my friend in buenos <unk> is very happy
i 've been using this case to protect my macbook air for a couple of years it 's great i love it i slip the case inside my backpack and put the laptop inside
this case is great - super padding , compact and excellent protection for my laptop it fits nicely in my swiss gear backpack and helps me transport my computer during my work commute
they do a good job it 's a bit hard to keep the flaps shut using the cutout tab they keep popping open but for a couple of bucks , it 's very worth it
the ` girls ' love these as thought color makes <unk> files less work i do n't like the colors but they 'll be in the bomb shelter storage unit until their day of destruction comes due so who cares
the sleeves were fine , however , on the black sleeves , the plastic was all <unk> , like they had been overheated for such a reasonable price , it 's not worth returning otherwise , all the other sleeves were fine , colors were very vivid , as shown i 'm happy with the purchase
these came just as described they were perfect covers for a mix cd that we made as a `` wedding <unk> `` for our # wedding they shipped quickly very happy with product and service
i 'm very satisified with my purchase and it arrived as describe in the condition and time frame as promised i buy alot of jewel cases being a <unk> i have to use them alot , i prefer to use the different color ones instead , you can put # to # cd 's or dvd 's in the <unk> they are reliable and durable , and i 'm a happy customer and the price is out of this world
just needed some general sleeves to protect my dvds and cds i did n't count them as some did , but i have plenty for my money they work well as near as i can tell , none are damaged
i needed to use some of these for shipping - i find that i like them alot for giving someone a copy of a cd or dvd they are easier and less bulky for carrying around too - i 'm pleased with this purchase
i do like the quality , but am puzzled by the lack of inside pockets it shows on amazon will keep it , but really would have liked it to have those pockets
it 's difficult to find a sleeve that fits a # & # # ; laptop that is n't just a plain black case this one is perfect everything fits , and the colors are much richer in person than in the photo and so far , it 's held up to the rough treatment it gets from me
fits my # & # # ; toshiba laptop perfectly and there is just enough room in the pocket for the cords & mouse the pattern is exactly as pictured i am very pleased and would definitely recommend this product
excellent product , prompt shipping , colors much brighter and prettier than pictured online website did say my computer would n't fit in this sleeve , but i trusted another reviewer and it fits great love how it is stretchy so i can put my cord and mouse in the outer pocket lots of room and pockets , really makes it very functional
it 's perfect for me my # . # laptop fits perfect and there 's a big front zippered pouch for my mouse and charger they fit in nicely plus plenty of room for other things you might have also like that its not heavy or bulky
i bought this case as an alternative to the folio for my asus tf # but mostly just to protect and store the detachable keyboard dock when not in use fits perfectly , however after just the first or second use the corner seam of the protective flap on the inside is already coming apart
i bought this for my boys # in samsung galaxy tab # s they have a bulky <unk> case , and headphones , and they all fit in the case together and that is the reason that i bought this particular one i am only giving it # stars because i did not buy it for its intended product and do n't like i know if it is good for that or not
the pictures do n't show it , but inside the case is a flap that you can tuck your tablet into so the zipper wo n't touch the edge it 's a very nice feature to help prevent scratches i have an asus tf # that i carry without the keyboard dock this case is a bit large , but it holds my tablet securely when tucked into the aforementioned protective flap the front pocket easily accommodates the charging cable , ac adapter , stylus , and <unk> usb <unk> sd card <unk> it holds them all flatter than i expected , which was surprising to me - i though it would be a lot bulkier with everything in there i can easily tuck the case into my purse alongside all my other stuff and it does n't take up much space sewn along the inside wall is clear plastic that provides a couple of pouches for sd cards it would be better if this had been sewn into the front pocket , because i 'm too paranoid about scratching the screen or the back of the case to use the pouches
came quickly and as ordered got the green case for daughter 's <unk> # & # # ; tablet to hold the tablet and all the cables , cords , etc . plenty of room to hold everything including the tablet while in the protective leather carry case as well everything nice and organized and always kept together great price too
