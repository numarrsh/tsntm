i thought i already wrote a review of this neat little product but i 'll give it another try this is a wonderfully colorful and roomy case for my ipad it comes with # stylus pens and microfiber cleaning cloths which i had forgotten all about so it was like getting a bonus everything works wonderfully together and fits in my tote with room to spare the sleeve is roomy enough for a pad or credit card case to be slipped it i carried it everywhere except today and naturally i dropped to ipad no damage to it but goes to show if you think enough to buy a sleeve , use it this sleeve also can be used for my netbook all in all i am very happy with the purchase and would recommend it
nice case , there is a slight plastic smell inside the zipper pouch , but you just need to air it out does not <unk> on your tablet and does n't smell as bad as ppl make it out to be unless you really stick your nose in the pouch then yeah my tablet fits nicely with keyboard and stylus attached product came with cleaning cloth which i use often and two extra stylus pretty good deal love the colors and the inside is super soft
i got this for my daughter 's surface # it fits great and offers protection when she takes it to school the item is very good quality and about half the price best buy in town
i really loved this item i was looking for an easy cover for my laptop , just to stop it from getting dusty and it does the job pretty well it has a good interior and the extra items it brings work great for me
what a great deal i 've enjoyed it all and have received many compliments on my cover i have a surface tablet and it fits perfectly with extra room for additional items the smell is there but it 's going away and really does n't bother me
i 'm mildly bird obsessed , so this bird and <unk> printed tablet case is just my type of thing i have a # inch tablet , and even with a silicone cover on the tablet , it still fits perfectly i 'm very happy with this <unk>
i only wanted a little more protection for my surface and this works exactly the way i needed to with the exception that it no longer fits into my purse , but having my surface safer is worth the inconvenience there is a smell to it and it remind me of walking into sams club its a <unk> smell that kind of lingers , but i do n't think its as bad as some say over all it was worth it and i 'm quite happy with it :
i have a # ' laptop , and this case is too big ! on the positive side i 'm able to put my charger , mouse , and laptop into the case it is not the most protective case , but for the $ its okay
i like the sturdy case because it truly protects my chromebook , but i only gave it a # because after having it for only a week the rubberized zip pull cracked and broke in half
this is an excellent carrying case for my acer chromebook c # p it fits perfectly not to snug and not too roomy for excessive movement i travel every week with it and it has held up nicely i feel confident my little computer is safe and sound inside my luggage
i got this case for my son who has to carry around his chrome lap top at school its great , waterproof , <unk> -lrb- if he should drop it -rrb- not bulky , easy to open and slide the chrome into
love this case no nasty chemical smell as others mentioned about another case it fits my chromebook perfectly and slips into my larger tote bag with the power cord i really like the classic look of the black case , and how durable the fabric is in everyday use i would definitely buy this product again
just a stellar little case for an ultrabook it 's soft and offers a lot of protection yoga # s fit snug in the sleeve and even offered enough space to throw a charger in there if needed zipper was fully functional and shipping was precise per the usual with prime
i love this case fits my toshiba chromebook with room to spare i can also throw a variety of chargers in there with it for storage the <unk> <unk> design is adorable , and black is one of my favorite colors hahaha has a <unk> <unk> lining inside and it shipped very quickly so happy with it for the price that i paid if you need an inexpensive , durable laptop case this one is worth it
i love it , it fits my lenovo yoga just great , the cold is great and the opening is large enough to take the computer out without a problem , definitely recommend
this is the perfect case for my # . # inch acer i like to buy cases a size larger than the computer itself the price point was excellent and the case is well made and attractive in a bright pink color i would highly recommend this case
i really like this case fits my galaxy note pro perfectly it protects it very well , and is the perfect solution for carrying it around because i do n't like having it in a case the exterior feels very thick and protective , and the black case looks super sharp while the inside is incredibly soft microfiber
i was looking for a good padded case for my surface pro # and this fits the bill nicely it 's a little roomy in the case but it the soft interior keeps the surfaces of my surface and type cover pretty clean i 'd prefer to not keep my adapter and mouse in this case but it 's roomy enough to do so if you need to the exterior padding is also firm enough to keep the surface protected in a fairly empty back pack
recently received this this fit my thinkpad ultrabook x # perfectly there is padding not only on front and back on sides and bottom but not on the zipper -lrb- where you would n't want it anyway -rrb- overall construction seems well done
i use it for my acer chromebook , and love it because of the color , the strength and its fit it also fits perfectly into the front pocket of my carry-on suitcase
this is like the old speck case with the holes i have received several compliments on this case i wish i could find the same case for my macbook pro
its <unk> different than anything else out there also <unk> your macbook to breath and lets heat out of the machine as if there were no case at all the apple symbol still shows on the back but its a little <unk> overall you wo ' t mind
my old perforated case was broken and i am happy that i bought this case snugg macbook case is a perfect protection for my macbook air # , price is very good i love it
my last cover would pop off when i 'd open the macbook air 's cover too wide this one stays on and looks nice , i get lots of compliments it also keeps my computer from overheating
wanted this case to work soooo bad , because the material and sleek design was great but the bottom part did not fit properly and came off easily tried to `` click `` both bottom tabs in place and only one stayed in place consistently snugg contacted me and sent me another hard case cover and it fits perfectly the design , fit and feel are ideal lightweight , yet protective silver matches macbook in color and the apple logo is still visible through the <unk> in the top of the cover
i like how it has texture to it and it just looks different from any other laptop cover i 've seen i 'm a <unk> macbook air owner and it fits my # `` well ; i had some trouble snapping it on at first , but it was smooth sailing after i figured it out it is such a good price for something cool like this i 'm a happy camper
con : i was disappointed in the color of the bag it says that the bag is gray or dark gray , but this bag has a really deep green color to it i asked several others and they agreed that the bag looks more green than gray kinda frustrating because i thought the gray in the pictures looked better than what i received pro : outside of that , the bag is awesome it is a nice small to medium size bag , very well built and sturdy it has all the storage i need and i really dig the sleek design it holds my # & # # ; lenovo thinkpad , that i have to use for work , very snugly and securely overall a great bag just a little disappointed in the color
exactly what i needed i love that it 's water resistant it has so many different sections for different items the laptop and the front pouch are cushioned well
simply , the best laptop backpack ever it 's lightweight , comfortable and protects my macbook air , ipad and accessories with room to spare for miscellaneous crap i only wish that i had gotten it sooner and could have been enjoying the freedom it provides by being on my back instead of on my shoulder , like traditional bags , sooner
this bag is comfortable to wear and holds a lot the cushioned pocket feels like it holds my laptop safely the <unk> exterior is perfect for commuting in snow or light rain
i received this bag and i love it very much it has a great design and many compartments as it can hold everything i need and more i recommend this bag to any one
it is very well designed loved the color , the size , the inside protection fabric for the laptop not too heavy to carry but not too light either it is ok i get compliments for it and it looks quite cool with any type of work clothing you wear from suits to casual i love the fact that you are able to hang the backpack to your carry-on <unk> i recomend buying this item it is well made and of good quality
the color is just not grey even tho i expected grey . but its rather more green than grey however , great product the fur padding inside is amazing and all my friends want it now i wish there was a pen holder but i can do without . its a great compact backpack for people who do n't carry around a lot of extra luggage
this laptop is a perfect everyday use bag for techy people : it <unk> to big and its really comfortable and its not really <unk> has lots of compartments so u could put all your <unk> recommend you guys get this item ! its amazing : -rrb- -rrb- -rrb-
i dont understand why companies that sell laptop bags wont pull out a ruler and measure the laptop space guess i could do that but i hope my email and this review give spigen the <unk> to put an <unk> on that post haste bag is as nice as the photos , real compact exterior material does feel like it will be resistant to water i 've uploaded some interior shots of the gray bag as that seemed to have slipped their mind as well it is in bright orange in case you were wondering i like the gray , it is darker than a # % gray but could still be used for white balancing in a pinch
excellent quality and build internal padding is great plenty of compartments to lose your stuff in i 've had occasions where i 've had to search high and low to find something i know i put in there this is not a complaint all of spigen ' s products that i have purchased have never disappointed me highly recommend this to anyone
so far this bag has been on # trips -- only negative comment is the top -lrb- small -rrb- pocket is pulling away on left side if it get worst i will report to maker i really like not having to remove lap top for tsa -lrb- just lay it flat -rrb-
the materials used in this bag are nice i 'm honestly surprised by how much you can fit in this pack i travel all the time for work , and the butterfly opening will save you time going through security the shoulder strap system is awesome there are extra adjustment straps on the top , nice pulls on the bottom , and a sternum strap to lock it down helps keep the bag in place better for the times you have to run with the pack on
i have been using the backpack daily for almost a month and for one long distance business trip checkpoint friendly features worked great at both airports the backpack is comfortable to carry using either one or both straps the compartments are more than ample to carry all that i typically have with me -lrb- power supplies , cables , phone , glasses , kindle , few work papers , office supplies etc . -rrb- i especially like the compartment for glasses and the quick access pocket proved more useful than i first anticipated construction and quality appear very good
i just received this backpack yesterday and love it it has a lot of thoughtfully placed organizational pockets the material seems to be very durable and the shoulder straps are very comfortable and ergonomic i especially like the tsa friendly adjustable laptop compartment seems to be very well padded and will prevent my computer from getting dented i looked and looked for a backpack and came across everki and this bag lives up to it 's reviews i was looking at the tumi t-pass but just could not spend $ # . # for a backpack ... although tumi is a very good brand the everki backpack has more pockets and compartments and very happy with it so far
i am replacing a cuct # b from targus , from a job change the new version of the cuct # b has not been updated -lrb- everywhere -rrb- the major differences are in number of pockets , size and construction and this one hit a home run my first criteria was something that could attach to a roller bag , this one does nicely , tsa friendly , and enough space to hold more than one laptop -lrb- i 'm an engineer -rrb- this one does that the construction is great , the `` felt `` for the electronics departments , feels silky and not scratchy as i have seen on the updated version of the cuct # b and the samsonite xenon # everything screams durable on this thing i was leery to spend that much money , but well worth it
i love this backpack i have all the room i need and it is one of the best layer out products i have ever seen in this type of product would highly recommend this
i purchased this backpack for an msi # . # laptop and i was a little concerned that it would n't fit it 's a bit tight but fits perfectly i am very happy with the organization pockets and the overall quality of the backpack while its an investment , this is a backpack that i will have for life i am very happy with my purchase and highly recommend this bag
seemed to be of good quality was a bit too small for my # . # & # # ; hybrid laptop had some give and stretch but the stitches and/or zipper were going to pop if i tried to squeeze my laptop into this case
the bag is a pretty blue and keeps the macbook air safe , but the zip started malfunctioning within a week it gets stuck at the corner and finally just stopped moving additionally , i wish the bag was designed with an access for a wire to keep the laptop charged even while zipped up safely
this fits pretty snug on the acer aspire v # with just a tad bit more space lengthwise the material is soft , good quality offers good protection it looks just like in photos -lrb- mine is blue -rrb- just wish there were more color and design options
i 'm a college student and just got a new macbook air for getting good grades , i needed something that i could protect my new computer with , but would take up my whole backpack i know the computer is wonderfully light and small , but some of the computer sleeves that i 've seen look more like survival packs than small computer cases this works great , and although i have not dropped my computer in the case , i suspect that if i do it would hold up to the job :
very tight fit for my # `` macbook pro -lrb- late # -rrb- doesnt zip all the way with a hard shell case on the macbook very little cushioning , will not protect your computer from falls , will only protect from scratches overall i wish i bought a different case that had more
in the picture the case looks very soft and flexible , but i got a hard cover that is not soft to the touch and very hard to zip i 'm just glad my macbook fits in it
i was hoping the padding would be decent around the edge but it turns out there is literally \ u # no foam protecting the edges what protects your notebook around the edges is the webbing material inside the case after it 's zipped up i would have given this # stars but can not recommend it for a $ # laptop i ended up getting a pelican case which is a complete overkill but gets the job done
purchased this sleeve for a late # macbook pro # & # # ; for which it is the perfect size the exterior of the sleeve is not soft touch as with the alternative neoprene sleeves , but the material seems durable the zipper action is smooth overall a reasonably good product
i use this to slip my macbook air into my handbag when traveling to and from the office great for protecting my laptop and lightweight recommend for folks who travel with their computers <unk> price point for a <unk> product
fit is too loose for my # macbookpro <unk> quality seems good so far it does the job and i 'd give it # stars if it was a snug fit beware if you have a smaller <unk> <unk> : because the case is too large , it does n't fit well in my smallish work bag
was n't sure how much i would like this case , but i 'm pretty thrilled with it easily fits my <unk> with a speck cover on it without pulling or tearing at the seams and it 's padded enough to throw in my travel back for easy travel when i 'm on a train or plane , which is the whole reason i bought it ca n't tell if the chevron pattern is painted on , and there are some places where the threads are loose , but for the price , the quality is great overall , i highly recommend this if you 're looking for a quick solution to storing your rmbp while travelling
very cute case some loose threads around the zipper have me wondering how long it will hold up ; not quite as well-constructed as the case logic i used with my old laptop , but satisfactory for me
a nice simple case to protect my macbook i like that it opens on three sides , as opposed to those that only open on top allowing me to open and rest the mac on top of it only addition i would have liked was a small pocket for miscellaneous items , business cards , etc .
fits the macbook pro retina # perfectly exterior fabric is this <unk> woven material -lrb- not neoprene -rrb- kind of like what you 'd find on a backpack interior is super soft fleece there is a decent amount of padding -lrb- similar to your standard neoprene sleeve -rrb- zipper is quality , and goes around four corners i like to leave the sleeve in my backpack with one of the short ends unzipped my favorite thing is that the laptop is shielded from the zippers by these little flaps of fabric i also like how the only branding is a little tag on the side which could easily be cut off and a subtle logo on the zipper pulls i would n't not expect this to provide much protection at all from drops , especially because there is no padding on the corners , but it definitely fulfills its purpose of protecting the laptop from scratches etc .
i really like this and knew what i was getting so im happy with the purchase it fits my macbook pro # & # # ; retina beautifully the only reason i did n't give it five stars it that all of these should have a small zippered pocket for thumb drives or earphones , etc . get it , you 'll like it
pros : this is the only sleeve i could find that would fit a # inch retina without leaving any free space it fits like a glove and has a very soft finish in the inside that will protect your computer cons : the outside fabric is a bit too hard to the touch it does have a bit of a cheap feeling to it , but then again , if you 're looking to buy this for a retina macbook , it 's still a very good option , probably the best overall : i 'd highly recommend to purchase it , especially for the $ # . # price i 'd probably be unhappy with it for the original price of $ # . # , though
i love my laptop sleeve it 's very pretty , the inside is very soft and it 's padded and will serve its purpose of adding a bit of protection between my laptop and the world
for the price , you ca n't beat this sleeve the inside is very soft and protects the casing of your macbook i 've had it for two weeks and so far , so good
i bought this item after returning the $ # sleeve i bought at best buy , thinking i could find something cheaper and a better color at first while putting the sleeve on i was scared it would not fit considering there was trouble <unk> zipping up the item however , as soon as i got it in to zip it fit nice and snug without any movement but i ended up putting a hard cover on my laptop concern that a sleeve would not alway do the trick with protecting like i wished so i do wish there was a sleeve that was big enough to put both the laptop with the hard case on now every time i want to put it in the sleeve i have to take off the case but , having the sleeve around just in case is a good thing i like this item and it will do that trick for a tight fit
i think this is a great case for the price , and it seems durable so far it 's protected my computer very well however , i do regret ordering the light teal color fingerprints or any sort of & # # ; dirt & # # ; shows up extremely fast , and it already looked slightly dirty after a day or two of use i would order this case again , but next time i would go with a darker color
unlike other cases that claim to fit my late- # macbook pro # & # # ; retina but left an inch of space all sides , this one actually fits i had a hard shell case on my mac for traveling and it still fitted , albeit rather snugly this is a <unk> , no-nonsense sleeve with no bells or whistles and performed exactly as expected
i wanted this for my # in macbook pro -lrb- retina display -rrb- it 's looser than i would like but that seems to be an across the board problem for my size laptop still , it does the job the zipper seems strong , not cheap , and the inside is nice and soft
bought this for my girlfriend and she loves it , it fits perfectly and is protective we have had it for about a month now still happy with the purchase and
i would recommend this case i got it for my # `` macbook air and it <unk> quite perfectly without an additional case the down side is the little black tag on the edge it got a few drops of water on it and it <unk> black ink onto the rest of the case i was n't able to completely clean the stain off
this cover is really sleek and does a good job of protecting your mbp from minor bumps and scratches it also has the added feature of being airport security checkpoint friendly you can leave your mbp in the sleeve when it goes through the x-ray without any issues it fits well into my backpack and slides in and out easily i would recommend this case
first off , shipping was super fast they said it would not be in stock until july # st and that i would not receive it until july # th they shipped it way before july # st and i received it less then a week after i ordered the quality is great and it looks exactly like what they have pictured i have no complaints and would recommend to everyone
bought a new # inch apple mac book pro with retina and this case fits perfect i would recommend this to anyone looking to protect their new purchase i travel a lot and i love this case it has held up very well
it fits my # inch retina display macbook pro jut right i worried the zipper might come in contact with the edges of my laptop but they are padded and do not the way this case is designed i keep my laptop in it all the time and just unzip to use during the day while it sits in the case for extra padding and protection the case also protects the furniture . with the case open and the display up , the computer stays cool so there is apparently plenty of ventilation even when it sits in the open case the whole time i just zip it up at night to keep it safe from my curious cat
i have been looking for one that fit # samsung series # . # & # # ; ultrabook for a while and finally found one that fit perfect and is well made no slack or room for anything else , that is exactly what i want others i checked out and even returned because they are just too roomy or made for bulkier ultrabooks
very nice design and thickly padded my macbook pro # . # fits perfectly in here the interior is soft and plush and the perfect feel to protect this expensive laptop i really love
<unk> must <unk> at the caselogic # & # # ; sleeve being a sloppy fit for my mbp # retina , i bought the runetz i was not disappointed width and height were just right , there was a slight gap in depth , but it helped the nicely inside padded zipper less difficult to close
very great item i recommend this product to anyone runetz did a great job in making sure that my product was delivered on time and that the sleeve met my expectations i am a very satisfied customer
i was looking for a sleeve that would fit this specific macbook retina # model many other sleeves claim they fit this machine , but they are not really meant for it they will be loose as they are meant for the older macbooks that are thicker this is the one to get if you have a macbook pro retina #
the main selling point for this case was that the zip goes all the way this allows using the laptop while its sort of sitting in the case the interior is super soft and the fit is perfect the zip has a liner that protect the laptop from scratches the quality and craftsmanship is top notch overall i am very happy with this case i wish they had a version with a handle and a pouch
this sleeve/case fits my macbook like a glove i originally bought this item to be able to put my mac inside my book bag when i travel and not have to worry about the aluminum getting scratched up i also have my mac in a hard shell case of its own and if fits perfectly still ; so if you wanted to put an extra case for more protection it would still fit in this sleeve the only thing that could make it better would be a place for my to put my charger as well but i can not make any complaints about it other than that i am very happy with this product
this case is perfect it fits the macbook snuggly yet the zipper pulls around the computer smoothly it gives the computer enough protection and is not heavy like a hard case might be
well made , great product would greatly recommend it soft fleece inside is once addition to the product , inside out zipper does not scratch you other products in the bag
this sleeve case fits like a glove and is the color i was expecting it 's lined with a soft <unk> material so it wo n't scratch your laptop i have a macbook air with a hard case and it zips up just fine i highly recommend this item
i bought this for my # inch macbook pro with retina display , the sleeve fits perfectly there is enough space in the sleeve for my <unk> usb ant stick , so i do n't have to remove it every time i close the case i really like that i can have the case mostly closed when i 'm charging my computer as well
this is the perfect case for my brand new macbook pro with retina display it protects it from everything else i throw into my bag you can not fit a charger or anything else in the case with the macbook , but that 's why you have a <unk> the case is really high quality and super soft inside also , it is designed so that the zipper can not harm the laptop either love this case
this is a very well made sleeve it fits the retina display macbook pro like a glove the fuzzy <unk> interior is also very soft and pleasant to the touch the sleeve is made of a sturdy nylon fabric that looks and feels durable also , the zippers are really nice and smooth they wo n't scratch your new expensive laptop because there is a fabric lining between the zipper and the inside of the sleeve this product honestly exceeded my expectations especially considering the price point note : if you use a hard case -lrb- like a speck -rrb- the fit will be very tight , but it will fit unless your case is bulky otherwise this is an excellent product and i would recommend it to anyone
this case is super soft on the inside , i already have a hard cover on my mac but this is double the security if i drop it while i 'm traveling , love this case
this case fits my new macbook pro retina # inch laptop like a glove the soft interior protects the computer exterior from scratching when i transport it back and forth from campus in my backpack does exactly what i wanted it to do , and the teal color is beautiful the outside of the case is also very easy to clean highly recommend if you are looking for a soft case
this is a great product i bought it for my asus vivobook & it fits with a little room to spare i 'm very happy with the product & the seller delivered the product quickly
beautiful colour , nice soft lining in the inside , also a lining protecting the laptop from the zipper overall , first impressions are that is is great quality and it fits my new rmbp perfectly
i have been looking all over for a simple , protective cover to be able to take my macbook places this cover provides the perfect amount of protection , yet its not too bulky plus , the inside feels really soft and gentle on the macbook to keep away scratches and dents
this sleeve cover is actually better than i expected its much thicker than what it looks like in the picture it makes it soooo much easier and safer to carry my computer around i love the color
i was a little worried that my macbook would n't fit , because i have a macbook pro with retina display # & # # ; , which is thinner than the regular macbook pro but it fits really well without any case on it - no wiggle room for it to move inside the case and it 's super cute too :
i am very happy with my case cover for my macbook pro computer it 's sturdy , good looking , and has ample space for my computer i would highly recommend this case or any other case like it made by runetz
sometimes you just need something simple i needed a sleeve to keep my laptop from getting knocked around in my litigation bag this does the trick made well and sturdily constructed
it zippers so that is good when i first opened it i thought i was going to love it but i have had for weeks now and it still has a funky smell on the inside i can not get rid of i have <unk> it and even put dryer sheets in it and zipped up nothing can get rid of the smell the outside material feels a little strange , but i would still consider it nice if i ever get rid of that smell it was cheap so i guess you get what you pay for
the case is beautiful and fits my # inch mac book air perfectly but there is a terrible chemical smell to the case i have had it for four days and the smell has not dissipated at all
i still can not get the strong smell of the lining out of the case i have turned it inside out and set it in the open air , i have put dryer sheets in it , i have also used spray air <unk> it still has a very strong rubbery smell except for the smell it is a good size for the item i am putting in it
there was so much off <unk> when i opened the package for this bag that i wonder if i will now get cancer it smelled just like a burning bicycle tire and so i let it air out about # days outside and still i can smell it its so cute but wonder about the chemicals that were used in its manufacture fits my chromebook perfectly ,
it was exactly what i was expecting , except for the smell the product itself was designed well , and my macbook air # & # # ; fits perfectly theres even a roll of fabric to keep the zipper from hitting my laptop , but the smell is unbelievable it 's somewhere between new car tires and straight up burning plastic/rubber i 've been working on airing it out , but its still a relatively strong smell other than that it is exactly what i was expecting has a good zipper , plenty of cushion , and a cute print
i love this case i do agree with the other comments about having a strong smell i have been airing out it for days now hopefully the smell with go away
i purchased this to hold my tablet while it fits it , its a little to big on the top it also has a chemical smell similar to the one you get when you order things from china it 's not that pungent , so it does n't bother me but people who are sensitive to it might consider purchasing something else it 's a cute case but it 's definitely not cloth , more of a <unk> its not bad , and it will work for me
