if you are trying to find the version of this bag with zippers , this is it the two outer pockets under the flap have zippers to keep your ipod and keys from falling out the main compartment has a zipper to prevent prying fingers most <unk> versions of this bag do not have zippers on the two outer compartments , nor the main compartment -lrb- the only zipper is on a small interior pouch -rrb- about the bag itself , this is perfect for books , padded camera inserts , you name it very sturdy , large , durable , and perfect for travel
i love this bag it is the perfect size for what i needed to use it for i was <unk> using one of those grocery store <unk> bags and everything was getting wrinkled and thin this is made of a good sturdy fabric and have more than enough pockets to hold everything
this cover is far too tight for the macbook air the zipper is eventually going to damage the finish on the macbook air the interior is also made out of a -lrb- hopefully -rrb- fake fur the iphone pocket is also lined with the same fur fur = not good for electronics
great product , but for the microsoft surface its big this sleeve was made for the macbook air and it is advertised that it fits the surface tablet it works fine with the surface but not perfect in size as for the rest i am very satisfied
the sleeve fits my surface pro # perfectly , including the type cover the pocket on the side is also a great spot to store the stylus the soft lining on the inside is a great protectant , and overall the sleeve feels like a great protective product for tablets
i love this carrier i use this to carry and protect my macbook air # `` to and from work its really nice quality with zippers that are metal not plastic , the interior is top quality soft <unk> type material its very <unk> so packing the charger impossible i put the apple magic mouse in the side compartment and the laptop inside the large compartment its really just to protect and carry the laptop and something very small all other gear will need to packed outside of this carrier i love it so much i 'm buying another for my other laptop materials : <unk> : metal zippers , heavy <unk> : padded all around soft <unk> like <unk> : this carrier looks high end and high quality i recommend the seller and product #
finding cases for the surface series tablets has proven to be surprisingly difficult that said , this case is perfect ; it protects my surface pro without being too thick and is well-constructed i 'm very happy with it
this is the best possible protection for my new macbook air # & # # ; brenthaven has consistently manufactured the highest quality luggage and totes and have carried that over into their little ipad and laptop sleeves this will probably never wear out i even have room for my external hard drive and cable in a little pocket on the side
well constructed and clearly evident is this item is made of quality materials and the production process stress best effort in its construction arrived on time and packaged properly
have used this case for a couple of years now and absolutely love it perfect case for my # & # # ; macbook air fits great , very soft on the inside build quality is excellent imo good protection , and my favorite part about the case is handle that makes carry it around a breeze highly recommend this case
this is a good value its not as roomy as some of nicest dell bags but the quality is good and serves the purpose it has some storage compartments but not a lot cubic space to play with comfortably it feels a bit tightly loaded when you pack it with some accessories but it does the trick i 'm not disappointed by any means
really wanted a nice quality laptop case for my precious laptop this is the first one i ever bought and i think it 's worth the money super easy of course to go threw security screening at airport too i love all the pockets and the quality of the padding on the interior as well as the other details they 've added nice to be # % happy with a purchase
my husband ` drives ' a train and travels with the case full of his laptop and many other <unk> devices for his job the first one has lasted more than # years with much abuse , so he bought the same exact one again
this so well made i totally trust it will protect my computer i love swissgear products they have quality and it shows it is a little thicker than some but so much better made that it was worth it i would and will buy their products
i purchased this bag to hold a laptop , a dslr camera , and two additional lenses when i received the bag everything fit great i was also able to carry an external hard drive , pens , documents , and small necessary cables for the computer and camera ; with room left over after one week of use the fabric started to tear along the top zipper , so i decided to write the seller to see what my return options would be ... that was two weeks ago ... absolutely no response so , although i was initially happy with the size and specifications of the bag , i 'm now stuck with a seemingly defective product with no help from the people that sold it to me
this bag was great as far as materials , external design and how it was put together i did not like the internal compartments and the <unk> inside the bag i felt it had some wasted space and things were just loose inside
in short : this is not a dslr bag its a huge laptop messenger bag made by <unk> ! i will try to update the review with pictures so that you know what i am explaining below - good quality material - lots of space - reasonable price - zip on top for easy access to stuff you want to pull out <unk> bad - useless as a dslr bag if you have more than one body and one lens lousy , lousy layout if they meant this to be a dslr bag if i had to do all this , i could have bought a regular messenger bag and use separate covers for each piece of lens and other i have i bought from a # rd party seller who was very good if i have to return this , i have to pay the shipping both ways . which means i wont get much money back if i return this but soon i will get really frustrated and will throw this away
this bag 's layout is pretty bad there are two foam inserts total this means you can arrange to fit one camera body and one lens snugly , while all of your other gear bounces around in the main compartment there 's space at the bottom for a tripod -lrb- no foam inserts to divide up that space -rrb- , which i find to be a waste most of the time the only good thing i can say is that it does have sufficient padding and room for a laptop , and it does n't look bad if you 're a large person on shorter people , this bag will look gigantic , though
first when i read reviews on the bag , i was somewhat skeptical bag looked too big and bulky however , bag is big enough to my # d with # , # mm , battery charger and more accessories also , with out the camera , i was able to fit my gigantic # & # # ; laptop -lrb- <unk> -rrb- only bad thing i would say is the weaker strap , would recommend this bag to bigger guys -lrb- at least # & # # ; # , # lbs -rrb-
i have been looking for a bag for my dslr for more than a year and this messenger bag from <unk> is just what i was looking for i held off on buying this bag for a while because the retail price was so high but after it went on sale ; this bag blows the amazon basics , canon , lowepro , <unk> <unk> out of the water there is plenty of space for your camera , lens , accessories , et cetera the only thing i 'd change would be to add more organizational <unk>
this product is of no doubt good quality , the only concern i have is that , this is really a big bag it 's much bigger than it looks like in the picture i intended to use it as an edc bag when there is no need to carry a slr around it turns out not suitable due to its outstanding size there should be a picture of a man carrying it so that you will see how big it is
well constructed and well thought out down to the compartment below the bag , that i can use to store my flashes can hold body with battery grip and a couple of lens i 'm happy with it
i love this bag . it is perfect for my camera and my # `` dell laptop . i am still in school and i have to carry my camera and my laptop and this bag is perfect
this online purchase experience tells me one thing : you can never selected a product just because of its cute appearance the laptop case i bought smells awful like <unk> or paint i 'm not sure i suspect it may do harm to my health
this case is really good , i am giving it to a friend because it 's too big for my laptop i have a # & # # ; hp chromebook , so it does n't work - zipper is high <unk> two zippers that <unk> and soft on the <unk> on the front is good quality -lrb- might start to wear after extended use and abuse - has rings for a strap that are <unk> is on both sides of <unk> - does n't come with a <unk> for strap are kind of <unk> one big pocket -lrb- no little ones for accessories like mice or power cords this case is very nice , but it 's definitely what you pay for it is n't a really nice case that you would spend around $ # - $ # on , but it is very nice for it 's price i really wish it came with a strap though , or a handle
the sleeve is cute , but it smells really , really bad i 'm not sure if the smell will go away soon or not , but when i hold the case in my hands , the smell rubs off on my hands , and they start <unk> too
when i first received this , i absolutely loved it i had my own shoulder strap i used with this notebook sleeve and it worked great after about a month , i accidentally dropped it on pavement and there is a hole on the bottom corner with my laptop dented after another month of using this product , i realized that the piece that is keeping the d ring attached to the sleeve is tearing on both sides apparently , my laptop is too heavy to be using this item with a shoulder strap
the case did n't look as good in person as it did on the website and the neoprene smell was really strong i ended up sending it back because i did n't love it
the material is so flimsy , i do n't think it 's actually neoprene and the cover smells even after airing it out i do n't even use it anymore still think the cover is really cute
the size does fit my laptop pretty well and it is light weight good for travel but it is not a good value for the price whatever it is made of , the material stinks after a couple of days , the smell seemed to <unk> a bit but you can still smell it after a few weeks if you hold it close to your nose
i liked the pattern , good price , my # . # & # # ; laptop fits happy with the purchase , but i 've seen others later on that come already with the strap and other patterns and all that the laptop is not exactly the same size , i can usually fit in a book or some pens , which i do n't know if is the best usually cases are tight to the computer , this one is not tight in all the dimensions
cute and somewhat sturdy but the color is fading and i 've only had it for three weeks the design is adorable and i have gotten many compliments but the blue color of the sleeve is fading away besides the color fading , the sleeve protects my mini laptop well
it 's really nice but it does n't fit the asus # & # # ; which was the laptop i bought it for i use it anyway bit it 's really uncomfortable there is no room for cable or anything else inside the sleeve -lrb- my other toshiba sleeve fits great and has space for cable , and even mouse !
it is just as bright as the picture in person , which is a really bright yellow and pink with a softer pink as the dots on the banana my only problem is that i have to stretch the case in order to make it fit on my macbook air ll inch the tag says that it can fit up to a # . # inch item you have to do some wiggling in order to make it fit like it is suppose to the item is heavily padded and has medium sized zippers on it which in the end makes it worth the money i would recommend this item plus i get compliments from everyone who sees it
first off , i absolutely love the design i 'm in college , and i 've gotten compliments on it there its just adorable however , the sleeve is just that ... a sleeve nothing too think , and nothing that will seriously protect the laptop i mainly use it to keep dust off of it while i 'm transporting my laptop , and to keep the laptop from getting scratched by my notebooks and other school materials
its a great case , i need more protection thou , i do n't take it out of the house so its perfect . tight fit but the <unk> dosent rub against the ultra
very fast shipping it probably took # days for it to arrive after i sent in my order the background color is darker than how it appears in the picture the only reason i give it # stars is because it kinda smells weird & the smell is hard to get off i sprayed it with some perfume but smell is still there otherwise , i love this case it 's adorable and fits my mac perfectly
i will be using this in conjuction with a book type case for my samsung tab pro which does n't offer protection for the sides i had purchased a digittrade sleeve for my # in laptop and was very pleased with the <unk> it offered i left the styrofoam packing material for additional protection since there 's still ample room the unique design is <unk> from the cases that you can usually find in the big box stores
i liked it i no longer walk around with just my laptop unprotected the only problem is that it 's a tight fit maybe you could post a sizing <unk> on your page something like - if you have ... size laptop , then you should get ... size case i measured my laptop and got the exact same measurement i should i have gotten a size larger
a beautifully made case and came just like the picture showed the colors are vibrant the only downside is that it 's not as padded as some of the other cases
the cover is sturdy and the design is definitely unique compared to those cases sold in the local chain stores the odor is overwhelming when you first open the package but it does air out after a week or so
cute product , fits the mac book air # . # in nicely , even has space for an external harddrive etc left over because the material expands the artificial rubber smell is pretty bad though and does n't go away totally with time -lrb- had it for over a week now and its still there -rrb- so if you 're overly sensitive to smelly stuff i would think twice about buying it the product was shipped on time
the price is worth it the item looks exactly as the picture , colors are the same it fits my # ' macbook pro perfectly and as of now it seems like good lasting quality it has a bit of a smell when taken out of the packaging but in a few weeks it goes away it gets dirty easily , and not much cushioning but overall i am satisfied with the product
what 's not cute the & # # ; i had this in storage for a few years & # # ; smell that lingers on the case for about two weeks no matter what you do aside from that it fits just fine and actually has a bit of stretch room my hp is a # . # and i still have enough space to put my charger in there as well i 'm not sure where they get the idea of shock protection though i would not let my computer drop even a foot in this case
the shipping was quick and the product is great exactly how it is mentioned online i bought the rising sun red one with the asian <unk> at school a friend told me that this was pretty offensive to <unk> , chinese , and other asian peoples i was <unk> and researched online turns out that the rising sun symbol is the equivalent to carrying around a <unk> i knew it was the japanese <unk> flag bu i was unaware of the negative <unk> it had i immediatly stopped using it and am searching for a new one whether the artist knew or not just a heads up might not be a problem if there are not many <unk> around you on a day to day basis -lrb- or your a <unk> -rrb- otherwise these products are great
update # : still using this sleeve but disappointed that the corners have worn through on the bottom to the inner lining i am very careful with my belongings so this is from careful use i often put this sleeve into my shoulder brief - i do n't carry it alone much at all original review : this is a great sleeve for the # `` macbook air had a slight odor when i first opened it , but i left it propped open over the back of a chair for a few days and the odor is gone it 's cute and does what it 's intended to do - protect the computer from scuffs while transporting it easily slides into a larger brief bag it has two d-rings on the sides which are sewn on well i attached a simple shoulder strap and now it 's also shoulder bag - great for carrying it to the coffee shop , etc . it 's a sleeve - not a case which is just what i wanted
fits a hp # & # # ; lp the only thing missing is a <unk> would have given it five stars if it had come with a <unk> is great and the pattern is different which fits me just
the graphics on this sleeve are why i bought it , and went i got it , they really pop out at you it fits my # . # & # # ; toshiba perfectly there is n't a ton of padding , but you 're not going to really get that with a sleeve the only drawback was the lack of a shoulder strap , but i found a really good one her for $ # , so that was n't too much of a problem
love this sleeve only one drawback , it has hooks for a shoulder strap ... it would have been great if there was an option to purchase one especially if it were trimmed in yellow like the sleeve i have added a basic black one for ease of carrying when my hands are full
this product is very cute i order this for my dell xps # inch ultrabook it fits perfectly without any problem the protection is good enough to carry around easy to carry and open the only thing is this sleeve has a bit of the smell not a big problem , you can just open the sleeve and put it outside for a few days and everything will be fine the color of the sleeve match to the picture overall , i 'm satisfied
i bought this cover for my sister 's birthday because her laptop had no protection , she was just carrying it around and she is a very clumsy girl i wanted to get her something that would fit her laptop and was cute at the same time she opened her present and loved it ! ! it fits her laptop very nicely and it has plenty of padding if she were to drop it the only negative i have to say about this cover is that i think it should come with a strap so people can carry it on their shoulders if they wanted my sister had to buy a strap separately
delivered on time and great packaging it does smell when you first get it out of the box , but i hung it behind my office door for a couple of days it the odor is gone great for my laptop
my daughter bought this for her sister who has a quirky sense of <unk> she thought it was <unk> it is a very nice case and promise it will be a conversation
buy this because it will make you smile every time you look at it each day it has nice padding to protect my new # & # # ; mac air and is a snug enough fit to be placed in my travel bags i even able to squeeze in a dvd or two can get dirty but wipes clean with a damp
i gave this to my daughter for christmas and she is the talk of the high school all the kids want one . great protection for her computer , funny cover , fits in her back pack with no problems
its a pretty nice case i do have that odor that people are talking about but that is actually normal coming from neoprene products you will always have that strange odor but it is n't that bad at least you know its brand new and no one has used it
this fits my macbook pro perfectly and seriously it is so cute it is good padding without being bulky and the picture makes me smile every time i see it
i 've only used it once so far , but this sleeve fit my # inch laptop perfectly the different design also made it easy to determine which laptop was mine , and which was my friends '
i get compliments on this sleeve all the time and its so great at protecting my laptop i love it i noticed no smell of any kind and i am quite sensitive
this fits my dell inspiron # inch laptop and my ac power adapter i kept the inside packaging for extra padding awesome japanese <unk> design on the sleeve does not come with a strap but i had one already
it fits my mac perfectly people always compliment me on my sleeve because it 's very original and super cute it does n't really get dirty and you can easily just wipe it clean i love it
this case is really well made and i love how quirky the little <unk> is it fits my ultra book perfectly it 's only a sleeve so it 's not very protective but i just wanted something to put my ultra book in before i put it in my bag to bring places so this works great
i could n't choose between this cover and the one that has zebra on it i 'm glad i 've ordered both , they both look very nice and cute i also like the quality the case is very thick and seems durable
the sleeve is perfect for my macbook pro # inch with a speck seethru satin case snug fit , cute design , and ideal for backpack travel the inside of the case is green and there 's no extra pockets anywhere on the bag , but it has side handles if you want to attach a traveling handle i wouldnt do this however , because the material seems like it would <unk> if carried like that after a while
i purchased the sleeve to protect my notebook while in transit since i do n't have a laptop bag it suits this purpose effectively i liked it because it met my expectations while being reasonably priced
i love this case , its just sooooo cute and <unk> this case exceeded my expectations and has made carrying my laptop around a lot easier as other reviews have mentioned there is a smell when it arrives ; but it does n't last very long i simply sprayed it with <unk> and let it air out for about a week and a half , then it was fine anybody who has a silly sense of <unk> should definitely consider buying this case every time i look at it i ca n't help but smile or laugh
very pleased with this case for my sony vaio the colors are soft , not real intense , but pretty the <unk> is on both sides as others have said it is exactly # / # `` wide by # `` high , seam to seam however , it has a # `` gusset , which allows it to expand quite a bit the zipper is heavy-duty with a strong pull and it has two secure d-rings on the sides for attaching a shoulder strap i wish the zipper color were other than beige though the inside is a soft pink inside seams are all finished and it 's quite cushy , i believe a tad thicker than most neoprene sleeves
the bag is alright , but its not worth the # i spent on it its not really made well and can only hold # or # things without wires i think i 'm going to have to order something better
inside pocket has some kind of velcro fastener that makes no sense and certainly does not ensure things will be held in it almost seems like the velcro was sewed in incorrectly phone pocket does not make me feel like phone is very secure bag looks & # # ; classier & # # ; in picture than it does in real life
the bag is well made and big enough for everything you 'd need for the day , but ... it is not tan as pictured it 's more of a dark <unk> i think a guy would like it but for the <unk> ... it 's quite ugly actually
i was looking for a neutral bag for both myself and my husband to share carrying on our trip it is neutral however , the strap is so scratchy it can irritate the nap it is very cheaply made -lrb- think walmart -rrb- and the mesh pocket that should hold water bottles , does n't it is way too small i got around that buy turning the bottles upside down just make sure the lid is closed tightly that pocket for cell phones might have held one before smart phones , but not today 's an ipod wo n't even fit in there overall a decent bag , but do n't expect too much
this slingbag is okay for the price i would have liked the strap to be a detachable clip type so that you could sling the bag over either shoulder as it is you are restricted to just the one side
for me it does n't quite fit my needs but none the less is seams to be a good sturdy bag and i will use it just not for what i intentionally bought it for
the case itself is quite nice but , i have had problems with the shoulder strap with two separate cases the original case had a shoulder pad that quickly became unraveled due to very poor stitching i was able to return the case to the store for a replacement not long after i received the replacement , i noticed the strap was frayed i went onto the wenger website and e-mailed customer service about the problem i will black tape the strap extremely poor materials and <unk> , and even worse customer service
this is just what i wanted for traveling with my ipad it is protection yet can be packed inside a carryon two compartments inside and two exterior pockets provide options as well as handles for easy carrying and a removable shoulder strap
i had a similar but smaller version of this case for my kindle made by swiss gear and loved it so , when i purchased my new asus transformer tablet i knew i wanted to find a similar case for it this case is amazing and fits the transformer tablet perfectly it even has another partition for the keyboard dock and pockets for your charger , earbuds , <unk> wipes i recommend for any asus transformer owners !
my husband is one who is very careful when making selections for his personal use believe me he can spot defects or improper value placement on anything he absolutely loves this case and and that says a lot
i purchased this product as a quick fix for my laptop backpack needs well , i guess i got what i paid for i own a toshiba # inch laptop with and extended battery when placed in the laptop compartment , the fit is snug but when i attempted to secure the laptop with the strap provided , it barely fit the second thing i noticed are the straps ; they are basic backpack straps and over time , will break from the weight of the laptop and other items stored in the backpack the backpack offers no bottom padding so be careful how you set it down on the floor or ground the last negative item is the back padding the back padding is a little thicker than a cord board box if you have to walk some distance with the backpack fully loaded it is not a comfortable thing on a more positive note , it does offer plenty of storage area
this backpack was really disappointing it barely fits my # inch laptop and the cable to strap it is so tight that i believe this ended up tearing another portion of the backpack there is hardly any space as well compared to my other targus backpack , & # # ; targus # -inch sport backpack for laptops - navy blue & # # ; , this was terrible
this backpack has the sleekness of a laptop bag , and is sturdy enough to carry books and things too the fabric is slightly cheap quality and <unk> holes quite easily
it appears small but inside of it u can carry very very much things first when i saw it i said i 've been screwed but then after begin to use it i really luv it i bought the same one for my girl friend and i plan to buy another for my lil brother
this bag can carry a lot of stuff it 's comfortable and reliable it has room compartments the front pocket is big enough to hold a tablet , book , or more gear there 's also a smaller zippered pocket on top of that for pens and really small things
purchased this backpack for my work laptop , which is heavy , chunky , and large fits snuggly in the laptop pocket the water bottle compartment is perfectly sized <unk> is lightweight but sturdy
it would be lovely , if it did n't freeze on me every time i try to download something from going <unk> , this is a known issue with the wireless on this netbook , yet acer has n't released a fix for it yet a netbook that ca n't connect to the net unless you use a cord just is n't as much fun there is a new wireless lan driver on acer 's website <unk> # / # i 'm going to connect directly to the modem with an ethernet cable so i can download and try it tonight , and will report back
i bought one of these the set-up utility failed to work , and when i went online for a chat , the guy on the other end said i had to do a complete system restore that would take a couple of hours i find this completely unacceptable should n't a product at least work once ? ? ?
the computer is ok and working fine except that the battery is not holding the charge i can charge it fully , store it and the next day the battery is dead i tried to <unk> it by fully charging it and letting it drain completely and then charged it again to no avail i think i either got a bad or previously used battery i would have given it five stars if not for the defective battery
we actually purchased this netbook about a year ago shipping was quick and price was right the netbook 's wifi access worked great as long as it was within about # feet of the router we could not access the internet from from our bedroom which is about # feet from the router , no brick walls , etc . . we eventually sold it and purchased a kindle fire for remote use , and continue to use our older compaq <unk> when we need to use a keyboard extensively
i guess it is what one should expect for the price i do find it to be a basic computer , and it seems to run quite slowly , even though i am only using it for simple things like checking e-mail the size and weight makes it very portable , which is nice ... and it 's cute
i need to clean the c drive often because it becomes very slow but then again , i use it once every month or # so it 's not a big deal i paid $ # on a cyber monday special for it so it 's ok
this netbook serves it purpose as a backup to my laptop for internet browsing and basic <unk> it is used for <unk> and online classes i had reasonable expectations for the video quality and was accurate in expecting it to be a little slow and not top notch quality however , it serves it purpose for the price , the portability and ease of using will meet all reasonable expectations
this little netbook has suprisingly good features for being the price of a crappy cell phone the screen is vivid , and the keyboard is large enough for my fat fingers ample storage capability , and a sensitive mouse pad i do enjoy the mouse pad 's features and find its ease of use appealing you ca n't beat a netbook this size for the this price believe me , i 've looked this is the only one with a normal operating system , and the <unk> of a pc that i could find for under $ # yeah , does n't have a cd drive , but those are going the way of the <unk> anyway great for casual web browsing and email , but tough enough to handle my wife dropping it , more than once , although not recommended
i recieved my product early right out the box it looked shiny and beautiful i recommend this product for simple task such as internet browsing and movies it is a cool little netbook to travel with as well everyone should buy this netbook its simply the best
it is a good little lap top for the price i bought the same kind a couple of years ago and was very pleased with it this version comes with windows # basic which is very limited i 'm very upset that they went with this cheapest lame version of #
i am <unk> for this netbook and for the great price offered it is very similiar to my last netbook i am so glad that i found this and got a great price
i bought this for my brother as a gift it worked great until he tripped and fell on it does n't hold a grown man lol before that it was great
ordered as a `` lightning deal `` on black friday received very quickly check out process was simple wife is pleased would definitely recommend to anyone wanting a small laptop for web surfing would be # stars except the keyboard is a little small for a man 's hands
we got a great deal on this netbook before christmas and decided to buy it for my nephew , who is # / # , as he always wants to play with our more expensive laptops it is a great size for him and will play his nick jr and disney online games i have n't tried to do netflix yet , but that is really all he will be using it for so i must say it is well worth the price to save our adult computers
i have been an acer fan for several years when i needed a new computer for a program i was <unk> , i checked out a number of notebooks but settled on the acer aspire one it is very light , which is a plus since i have quite a bit of equipment to carry , and it does everything my larger computers do the only difference is that the aspire does not have a cd drive , but i do n't need it on this computer it 's a dandy ! compact and reliable
i bought this netbook for my wife for christmas and she loves it she has a desktop pc that she uses to pay bills and do work on this lets her sit in her <unk> and with the wifi , email , check out facebook and surf the net she carries it with us when we visit our daughters and on vacation it has lots of memory and she has tons of pictures and music on it it 's a great little unit
i bought this after using my sister 's more expensive netbook i love it it is great for toting to school instead of my heavy laptop i can do everything on it that my laptop does except stream netflix overall , this is one of the best purchases i have made
