i love this bag it came exactly as <unk> its stylish , sleek , and convenient i highly recommend the one complaint that i do have about it is that there is a secondary flap on the inside that folds over the slot for the computer i find that annoying and mostly just in the way , but not hard to deal with
this is a very well thought out and quality built case have used daily and it is perfect for my # & # # ; mac air the stm logo is not too overpowering , would prefer no logo but other than that personal preference this case is the one for # & # # ; macs
this is a very well made laptop bag the only downside is that if you have a lot of junk to tote around , it will be a very tight fit other that that , it is a very stylish and well made bag the shoulder strap is comfortable too
i ca n't explain how much i love this bag lots of room for a perfect sized bad it can hold a macbook # , ipad , chargers , and lots of zippers for cellphones and other things i seriously dig it
i like it , tons of pockets , light weight , looks cool a little expensive , but i do n't think you can find a bag much cheaper without it looking very lame and boring
this bag is very well made , sturdy and well laid out plenty of room for everything you might need with room to spare i will definitely consider stm products in the
the bag looks exactly like the picture i really wanted this bag and was excited about getting it . unfortunately the bag straps broke only after a week or so i 'm returning the product to the supplier
tried # x for a great , inexpensive laptop tote , both times the bag had a terrible slash across the bottom it was nice and light and fit my large thinkpad perfectly but , was defective and i did n't want to chance the slash becoming larger . sent it back
this bag is far larger than is necessary for a # inch laptop the padded compartment is so large that it provides little to no protection for your laptop when in the bag if you 're looking for a bag the size of a carry on , this could be perfect i was n't and needed far more protection than this bag would offer
same item was at office store , but much cheaper here on amazon giving it three stars due to limited pockets in the bag it has one main compartment for the laptop , and a second large compartment for files or wallet , umbrella , water bottle , etc . what i do n't like is the lack of small zippered type compartments there is only one so if you are like me , and prefer to have little spots to store your chapstick , sunglasses , <unk> items , etc , you 'll need to use a zippered makeup bag to store within this tote otherwise all of your little items will be competing for space in that one zippered pocket lining material inside the bag is kind of <unk> i hope it holds up
i purchased this bag for a business trip it was perfect to fit under the seat on the plane my # `` laptop fit great and i had <unk> of room for other items
when i got this bag i was pleasantly surprised to see the interior was a bit larger than i expected the outside looks great , and it does n't look so much like a typical laptop bag it looks feminine and professional the interior holds my laptop as well as notebooks , file folders , and pens i am very satisfied with it
it is big enough for computer and several other items , notebook , book , pens , small purse or make up pouch it holds enough for the strap to be a little heavy on the shoulder but works great for me for the price it is not a compact little sleeve for computer if that is what you are looking for it is a bag for your computer plus it is a little cheap in feel and probably wo n't last for years and years but i am happy enough with it for what i need
i got this for my sister who had priced the item at more than $ # . # more at office depot she was really surprised when i was able to find the exact item at amazon for so much less it shipped quickly and she is delighted
this laptop tote bag is a great size it has plenty of room for my laptop , power cord and other items i like the fact that it looks like a purse so no one would ever know you 're carrying a laptop inside the only thing that would make this tote even better is if it were on wheels
bought this case for my new mbpr early # model computer and was disappointed to learn it did n't fit despite this case coming up on amazon search for retina pro # inch cases i was sent a case that fits a # inch computer and it is extremely oversized for any # inch model i had to spend more money on a proper case that actually fits . this was a shame since i had purchased a case for an # inch macbook air over a year ago with no issues i 've learned my lesson do n't waste time with topcase buy kuzy or speck
the top cover works fine the keyboard is perfect for keeping out the dust and looks great . takes some time getting used to as its raised and feels different when typing but that i love . sadly the bottom base of the case is horrible it does not sit on the base of the computer nicely at all . it 's a cheap plastic and it does not hold in place , it comes right off totally not worth buying go to apple and get a good one . i was so mad that it didnt work out but i the top piece works nicely as well as the keyboard so
this top + bottom cover did not fit my # . # macbook at all its a shame because its a nice weight and my favorite color , which is typically hard to find
the cover does n't look like the picture # the cover does n't fit the size laptop that is advertised # the cover is described as rubber , no its a plastic cover
this product did not fit my computer it was extremely cheap plastic and was not the product that was advertised as being rubberized i would not recommend this product to anyone for their computer
we had to return this product as it was cracked and i never got the credit put back into my account that 's why we ordered the orange set i would love to have the credit back ? i wo n't ever order anything that might need returned for this reason
i bought this and right away i noticed a black speck on the top of the case after contacting them , they gave me a $ # refund if i kept it instead of replacing it for an <unk> one shortly after purchasing this case , both edges started chipping and i am not rough with my laptop all i do is tote it around in my backpack and use it around the house very , very unhappy with this product and am about to purchase from a different brand
i was not happy with the case at all it did not fit my hubby 's mac pro it was a # inch too big t i will need to send it
i did not get the sized item i ordered could not use the item because it was too big for my computer it was supposed to be # in case for a # in apple mac did not fit
i bought two cases , one in purple for my mom 's new macbook pro and a hot pink one for my model <unk> # macbook pro my mom 's fit perfect , but my case was way too small ! it fits my mom 's but not mine tried to find contact information to get it exchanged , but can not find anything now i am stuck with it waste of money think twice before buying ! !
i ordered this item and it arrived pretty fast however , the topcase i ordered in purple did not fit at all ! it was purely constructed and could not fit my macbook pro # ' i recommend to not buy this product from top case i am really disappointed in how it was made so do not buy this product !
do not buy this case , i had it for a month and without dropping my computer or anything like that , that corners of this case cracked and created a whole awful waste of money
i did n't get what i ordered they sent me a tab cover that does not match my computer , they did it twice and never get what i paid
i have only had this for a few weeks and the rubber on the case is pealing off i only take it from my laptop bag to my desk i feel this should not be <unk> or at least not happen in a few weeks . i take care of my stuff and there is no way the rubber should be peeling i would buy a different manufactures case if i was you
if you are lucky enough to recieve the correct case , you may like your purchase although it was not rubberized , and flimsy at best appeared the clear case would not stand a drop or protect the computer since there is no cushioning included i have been dealing with a return for # days top case claims the return was never received - even though i followed all rma instructions to the t. top case has proven not only to be deceptive in the description , but extremely difficult to work with i would not take the chance to save few dollars spend the extra $ # for a reputable company that you can trust , like speck products . very unhappy customer
do not buy this product the hardcase cover does not fit at all it 's a very pretty color , but it does not fit the # `` macbook pro the keyboard cover does fit , though , which is why i gave this two stars instead of one
i took off my case after about a month or so to check on my macbook and it left little dents all over ! ! ! really ? ! ? i bought this and now it costs me over # times the amount i paid for the cosmetic damage it left on my computer ? there goes my hope at <unk> it
i bought this case off amazon hoping for a sturdy hard case to protect my macbook pro unfortunately the product does not hold up well the rubber keyboard buttons are fine , but the case itself cracked extremely easily in several places once the case cracked , pieces around the crack started to break off and what was left became very sharp to the touch my expectations for this product were higher and i now need to get another case , because this one did not hold up
do not buy the case did not fit and the keyboard cover fits but you cant type with it on do not spend ur time and money on this useless junk
bc the pic added it was purchased with the macbook and when i ordered it it was way too big and does n't fit there was no card or number where i could exchange it .
i ordered this case for my # inch mac the keyboard cover fit no problems but it is a cheap made product the letters on the computer and keyboard cover do n't line up so if used to much its sure to give you a headache the shell however did n't fit it all ! it was to big for the computer ! the package came with no return address so i can not send it back either all in all this was the worst thing that i have purchased online . very upsetting
i really needed a case for my macbook after several weeks of researching , i went with this one because it had the best reviews , even better than some higher quality cases i read a few reviews regarding the size , but brushed them aside i received my order on time and was super <unk> but when i took it out , the cheap plastic was completely useless as it was way too big i am very upset and my attempts to reach out to the company have been in vain all i want is a case for my laptop that 's what i ordered but not what i got do not waste your money
looks good , but is a half inch too big for my new macbook pro # & # # ; with retina disappointing , as it looks nice , but i guess i have to go buy one in person to make sure i get the right one i 'd much rather get it from amazon
not teal at all the case looks teal in the picture and it came back extremely blue , like boy blue still pretty but absolutely not what i expected based on the
purchased this product in march # to fit a new macbook pro the hard case is too wide by almost # inch ; it is useless the keyboard silicone cover fits
it does not fit the laptop does not provide any protection cheap , very very poor construction and finishing even the free mouse pad is bad returned next day was trying to replace my # or # years old speck case got this because of the price i know now why it was only # $ and no # like the speck i was replacing will stay with what i have
make sure that you pay attention to the model number as the newest version of the macbook pro is smaller than the previous version the case is not rubberized -lrb- more like plastic -rrb- as advertised and did not come with a keyboard cover i wo n't be ordering from this seller anymore the customer service in dealing with my return was less than friendly
really disappointed with this purchase the case fits , it 's just really poor quality the keyboard cover is a joke , and does n't even <unk> wo n't be buying anything else made by
product did not even fit the computer it was too large the only positive aspect of this purchase was the keyboard cover overall bad and would not suggest purchasing it
very cheap material i 'm ordering a kuzy brand now this is not for the macbook pro retina either all around , very cheap except the key board cover will protect the keys do not recommend this
do not buy this i missed the dang return window but this thing stinks it does not stay on my mac whatsoever - its basically a tray to set it in lol . waste of $ $
i bought this for my macbook and was very disappointed in its quality i thought it would be a great alternative to the really expensive spec case , but i was very mistaken with in a week of putting it on my brand new computer it was cracked a few days later there were big chips out of the sides i have since purchased the more expensive case and i am much happy with it would not recommend this case
i have had this case for a while , and i noticed the side of my mac book pro getting dirty i took it off , to find the side of it , completely covered in junk , and the bottom as well as well as a few <unk> scratches that were not there before after # years , which is not bad , it has cracked really bad a good chunk of the top of it is missing , and they side is all cracked up do not be fooled by the positive reviews on this thread , this is not a good case and , i believe the red one is really ugly it is not as red as it looks in the picture , and it looks unprofessional and dirty
for the price , it 's hardly even worth returning guess you get what you pay for this provides no more protection than an uncovered macbook would the back corners are completely exposed -lrb- corners = most common place to drop and damage a laptop -rrb- the rest of the coverage is thin and worthless the keyboard protector is ill-fitting , and it 's not possible to type normally with it on since we do n't have the option for zero stars , let 's say that one star is for the <unk> <unk> color this case adds i 'll toss it and buy another speck shell
the one i got was not a perfect fit the top part of the case had this stupid space it wouldnt fit like a glove and it made the apple logo look blurry as hell
i just received my case my macbook pro is new # the case does not fit it 's about half an inch too big and wo n't stay on i 'm sending it back
i was very <unk> with this item i bought it for my daughter for christmas and it has broken and chipped in several places to the point where is not even useful anymore and needs to be replaced . i make purchases from amazon all the time , and this is the first item that i have been disappointed with
i was n't pleased with the case at all it did n't fit properly and was n't what i expected i will actually be returning it tomorrow and would like to find out what steps i need to take in doing
this case does not actually fit on to the mac book air # inch computer as advertised only the bottom piece fits when you put the top on , you ca n't close the # pieces and the top pops back off again the keyboard cover is fine though
seems to provide no protection at all thin , cheaply made and does not fit on the bottom side of my laptop at all not sure why they would make it in the first place . waste of plastic
at first i liked this but when the base started to crack i started to not like this cover i use my computer an average of once a week when i 'm not in school and i rarely commute with it so frustrating i guess i 'll go ahead and dish out $ # for a good case
i like the case because it looks nice but i put it in my backpack one day and then i noticed it started to crack i was very delicate with it do n't get this case
this case looks nice and will last a month or two at best before it starts to crack and break at every corner the laptop is hardly ever moved and if so handled very delicate so i know its not from abuse or drops , the key board cover is a nice add-on it does keep from getting those keyboard scratches on the screen that has held up well , after one year the case it self is cracked all over and looks like trash would not buy or recommend unless you need a $ # key board cover that will last a while
was n't happy with case as much as the other reviews the bottom case does n't fit my macbook it usually is coming off and could never stay on besides that the case is ok .
this case is the cheapest made case that i have ever owned it constantly falls off and the rubber feet fall off as well save yourself the hassle and buy something else
i bought it because it was pretty and the reviews were good i 've had it for over a year now and can say that i should have bought the speck case i do n't take my laptop on any adventures , unless you count a brief move from the coffee table to my bed room it has n't left my home since i purchased it so no rough rides in a laptop bag multiple times a week my guess -- the heat generated by the computer made it brittle now all of the corners are cracked mine also came with the keyboard cover but it never fit properly the entire purchase was a bust
since it is cheap , i do n't really have room to complain but the bottom of the cover does not fit right i still use the top cover and keyboard cover
so i 've had this laptop case for about # months and i am a very busy college student who is constantly on the go so this is always in my backpack i was very disappointed when i found that the corner had broken one day and from there it entirely started chipping off and scratching my laptop -lrb- very against the point of the case -rrb- moreover , it got dirty very fast i 'd recommend this if you <unk> want a cheap laptop case but if you 're looking for it to serve it 's function , this is n't the one
this was the worst case ever it was plastic , $ # . # and very <unk> the day after i ordered this case i want to the apple store to see if they had some that we 're cool and that i liked in this case , they did , and it was a speck case it is amazing get something that is not useless like this piece of junk
i love the color and it fits perfectly on mac however , when i tried to take it off the computer it cracked since it cracked , little pieces of it keeps <unk> off
the keyboard cover is what i most needed as a teacher who often <unk> my laptop with students unfortunately , the keys did not line up with my actual macbook pro
i am returning the case because it does not fit my computer it does n't snap into place and would fall off i opted to purchase a case at the apple store
i purchased the purple one and the color was right on so that was nice i have a macbook pro and the bottom part of the case does not actually clip onto the bottom of my laptop there have been times where i pick up my computer and the bottom portion is hanging off of it it seems like it 's just the tiniest bit to big to have a snug fit another big problem is that i 've only had the case five months and some of the clips have broken off and all four of the grips on the bottom have fallen off i would really recommend a different brand i 've had speck and gmyle cases that keep more dirt out and do n't fall apart quite as easily
note : this does not work on a white macbook , and i never got a refund for returning this i 'm sure it works well with macbook pro , but i never got to use
i recently purchased a # ' mac book pro for home use thought it would be just what i needed loved the color and weight however , the case does not fit my computer . it is too large and i ca n't use it
this case is a great color and it 's awesome that it comes with a keyboard cover the top shell fits my laptop extremely well the bottom shell covers the entire bottom of the computer , but does n't provide protection for the back corners of the computer unfortunately , i will have to find another case that covers the bottom back corners
who ever handled my order it was filthy i tried to clean off what looked like coffee stains i was very unhappy because i thought the keyboard case i bought was new
this is all personal preference so do n't really take what i say into consideration the hard case was actually very thin and the laptop cover was way too thick i had to keep pressing buttons over and over to get em to work
at # st i was happy with it i have had this on my macbook since i received it & a couple of days ago i took it off & saw a couple scratches what i do n't understand is if the case was on , why would it scratch im so annoyed & mad because mac laptops are expensive & i always take extra care of my expensive things if u are thinking about buying this i would go with a padded sleeve , -lrb- if you are a careful person -rrb- if not then invest in a better case i do n't know if maybe it scratched because i was supposed to take the case off every few days to clean it , but if thats the case , whats the point in buying a protective case
i have a macbook pro # ' inch and the case does not fit i love the color so much and how thick the case is but it wont fit not happy . i was so excited too not sure why it doesnt fit
product came with the bottom piece all scratched up which should n't effect the protective case except it 's pretty much just for looks and does n't look like it will actually protect the computer keyboard cover would be cool except it 's a macbook pro it has a light up keyboard and this keyboard cover does n't allow for light to pass through the letters also one of the buttons is incorrect you can see from that how much time and thought the manufacturer put into this product not worth the money
this fits on , the color is exactly as seen on the screen , but once it 's on - the laptop wo n't close fully , allowing it to possibly open up in a bag , etc while traveling i have to return it not risking a pen or something sliding between and scratching my screen this happens even when you take the keyboard cover off also , you can only barely see the apple glow through it , it 's not as bright as the picture
the case does n't really fit on my macbook right , even though i have the # `` it does n't really look anything like the picture , it all just feels cheap the keyboard cover makes it harder to type , i honestly would n't recommend this product to anyone .
i just purchased this in march , but the bottom corners of the case has already begun to crack and a piece that helps clip the cover in place broke off my mac rarely leaves my house my sister bought hers around the same time and hers cracked in the same area as well . $ # , you get what you pay for
the looks of the case is awesome , no doubt about it , but after a week of using it , it cracked then the case for the bottom wo n't attach anymore very disappointed . :
the purple finish chips off easily otherwise it serves its purpose to protect your mac i 've had this case for a little over a month and it looks like i 've had it for a while
this product was for my sister , graduate nurse age of # , for christmas her only standards for a laptop case was it had to be purple , be able to see the apple logo , and function as a case for her macbook pro # `` this product fit her criteria , but i know better than to get this product for myself this product is flimsy and of a cheap plastic and the rubber padding is thin as paper sadly i will never buy this product for myself because i know if it ever dropped the laptop would honestly have no protection basically i just paid for a product to give her a peace of mind try speck if you want a great quality case , i compare all my apple products to the high quality of speck and brands related , have a great day
if i put the bottom cover it leads to heating if i put the keyboard cover it becomes hard to write so i was only able to use top cover and mouse pad i did not find those two not very useful also
i bought this cover for a new mac i have no issues with the color but the product looked used the bottom white pads to prevent the case from moving had dirt and smears and one was n't put on properly so it was off center
i was n't aware it was used . it has dents , and there is a stain on the keyboard that was kind of a bummer . i wo n't order through this person again , but the company that makes the cases are excellent i 'll be going through the actual manufacturer next time i want a new color .
i loved this case initially it 's a great color , the keyboard cover was a great bonus , and the case feels wonderful i 've had it for several months now and i am disappointed that it broke i was taking the case off to show my decal underneath and the case split in a corner this is quite unfortunate , so beware to be careful when you handle the case
this is not even as good dirt shows up pretty easily on this and the case is always snapping off the bottom also its cracked on the bottom twice i would not buy this again when this actually breaks or gets extremely dirty , i will go back to buying a speck case
i was pretty pleased with this case when it first arrived ; it looks great and performs its function i found it fit well on my macbook pro and i will say that it does a good job protecting it however , after a minor fall , the case has started to chip at the edges it 's true that my computer is fine , which is the intended purpose , but i was hoping the case would be able to sustain a little bit more wear all in all , not a bad purchase , but i 've already thought about looking for a new case since this one is n't built to last
i ordered two , one of the cases was cracked on the side i do n't know it happened during delivery since there was no secure packaging only simple plastic wrapping , or it was initially like that did n't return ; too much <unk> otherwise the other one is good and still using
i bought this a year ago its cracked in # corners on the bottom part and # corner on the top i can probably use it for another half year before i have to get a new one as far as the keyboard cover goes , starts to rise by the left button and <unk> button i 've seen it on my friends keyboard cover -lrb- same brand -rrb- and it rises at teh same spot and some of the keys have started to fade
the case was great no issues putting the case or the keyboard protector however , after some wear and tear , the keyboard color does start to fade i eventually just threw it out and kept just the case on my mac
the case looks good and is sturdy but the keypad cover does n't fit well it is sloppy & effects the looks of your mac overall if you want to buy go only for the case it 's nice
bought a new mbp # & # # ; a # and tossed this on when it came the case fits nice and i am sure will offer a few years of protection but the keyboard cover blocks the light coming thru the letters on the keys light still comes around the bottom of the keys but this creates a <unk> making the keys harder to see in a very dark room but the cover does seal well over the keys
great looking cover dirt can get under it and scratch the computer , so you need to clean the computer once every couple weeks to keep it from harming the look of the computer itself
so far it 's kept my mac book safe but the packaging was so poorly done . when i received it it was in a plastic sleeve with no bubble wrap or anything to keep it safe
i ordered something similar before and the materials were pretty good but with this one for some reason i dont feel my computer as protected as it should be quality can improve
the only thing that was & # # ; aqua blue & # # ; was the keyboard cover the case cover itself was more of a regular blue , it was quite a disappointment but other than that , the case is great and it is rubberized
i received my case # days after i ordered it the keyboard cover fits my macbook pro really well the color is very true to the color advertised the case has n't chipped or anything yet i 'm happy with this purchase i would recommend this to a friend
i thought that it would be more baby pink , but it is definitely bright pink i 'll keep this case for a while , but do n't see myself repurchasing or truly recommending
i bought this hoping to get a decent keyboard cover along with my cover , and this product did not deliver the cover is opaque , so if you want to see the letters on your keys lit up , forget about it i 've only had this item for a few hours , and hopefully the set will <unk> itself by at least keeping my laptop clean i doubt i will continue to use the keyboard cover
