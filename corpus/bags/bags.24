oh man let me tell you , once you buy a swissgear you 'll never want another brand of backpack extremely well-made , and a five year warranty this particular one is soft , with a <unk> handle , and is very lightweight - perfect for those who want to haul more books , supplies , electronics , etc , rather than hauling backpack i 've had this for almost # months , and not one sign of flaws or defects <unk> handle , <unk> front side , has place for a few <unk> far elastic on the front or sides has n't shown signs of wearing <unk> : ? does n't have <unk> pockets for ultra organization elastic pockets on the side could be a bit bigger for holding water
this bag is in high quality and looks <unk> , if you are a student that do not have too much stuff , this is a good choice his # ' computer fitts perfectly into the bag and this bag do not attach onto your back and drag you down also , a lot of small stuff can be <unk> into different pockets but i need to mention that the pocket for phones can not fit an iphone # or # in , it is too small for normal phones
i have been using this backpack for about # months now and i am extremely satisfied with it it has a lot of room for your documents , books and the like along with your laptop my # . # inch lenovo thinkpad fits in there nicely it has a media pouch in the front for ipod etc but i have been using this to keep my # gb toshiba portable hd the material looks tough and despite my extensive use , it does not show any signs of wear and tear and it still looks new i have fit in every daily use stuff in it , from laptop to headache pills ! ! ! every thing a great thing to have if you are a student or travel a lot but want to travel light
i love this backpack i have a hp laptop that is # . # & # # ; and it fits fine not sure why the others had issues with theirs fitting pack has plenty of pockets for storage and a good amount of padding
this is the best backpack i have ever used very roomy -- carries my # `` macbook pro -lrb- a little tight , but certainly works -rrb- , books , ipod , keys , plenty of room for whatever you want side pockets for <unk> -lrb- # on each side -rrb-
my grandson 's been using since the first day it arrived i 's lightweight and ergonomic he 's in fifth grade and has many books , lunch bag and other things to carry it 's kind of more & # # ; older student & # # ; and he likes that
i have had mine for about # years now i work outside alot over the texas summer and it really comes in handy for what i do it is rugged and has stood the test of time the zipper recently broke due to everyday wear and rather than buy a new one i am going to take it to get fixed as i like it that much i strongly reccomend this product
i recently moved to a backpack for travel vs. the old briefcase and this has been a great change for the shoulders walking in the airports and the storage is far better as well
i am very pleased with this backpack it is just the right size for me i love the airflow feature at the back even if i am stuffing it with heavy things , i do n't feel much of the weight ... the cushioning is great it feels and look durable
best swiss gear backpack i have ever owned it is nice and compact , so it fits under an airplane seat i had an older sg backback that was much more bulky this is really nice and it looks cool i recommend it
i use this backpack daily for school & work i carry a work laptop in the day and a school laptop at night i bought this backpack over a year ago and it still <unk> & functions as if it were brand new
bought this for our teenager and have to say that it is the highest quality backpack he 's had we have been replacing backpacks every year because they tear or shoulder straps break so far , this looks like it will be tough enough for even him thanks for making this available for us
this is a great backpack it feels sturdy and has plenty of space and pockets and such i really ca n't think of anything else i 'd need or want it 's comfortable and seems to be constructed very well like i said ... a good buy
this is the most amazing pack i 've ever owned or seen i really ca n't say enough about this it i would recommend it to everyone the feel , the amount of pockets , just everything about it is amazing it has more than what i was expecting in a backpack and more
i have had other swissgear laptop backpacks and think that this brand is about the best brand out there for price and quality great amount of space for your laptop and other stuff high quality product that will last a while would buy again in a heartbeat
it arrived on time and it is very strong it carries all the stuff i need for class plus more , now i do n't have to carry # or # bags back and forth
bought this backpack simply because it just looks great online and could n't be happier perfect size for a # ' # `` person like me -lrb- i find most laptop backpacks from swissgear are too big -rrb- and could n't be more impressed with its build quality
this backpack exceeded my expectations and was well worth the money my son will be using it to carry most of his electronics back and forth to alaska so size , weight , padding are of utmost importance the swiss gear foots the bill in all of these areas i am very pleased ! !
this is the best purchase i 've made for myself this year because i walk long distances , use public transportation and walk and hike trails i use this backpack every day it doubles as my purse , has pockets for pens , phone , earphones , even your laptop when necessary a great buy !
i ordered this book bag because it was on sale for cheaper than the original prices of many different other book bags it had great reviews and i figured it would do the job for now i was blown away it has so many different features and compartments and works better than i thought that it would i would absolutely recommend this product to anyone looking for a good backpack for their laptop
we purchased this as a lightning deal this year for my husband to use as a laptop bag to take on several work trips he had coming up it holds a ton of stuff besides his laptop he now uses this every day instead of just when he travels
i bought this laptop bag for my work laptop it fits everything very easily it is very comfortable on my shoulders even when it is filled to capacity the cell phone pocket on the shoulder strap wo n't fit modern smartphones , but that 's not a reason to pass on this bag it has a sunglasses holder on the other shoulder strap , which is very nice when you walk into a building i would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a quality laptop backpack
i was going to buy a rolling laptop bag , but found this on sale and got it instead made my trip so easy plenty of room for my laptop and accessories plus tons of padding and pockets i was able to carry extra books , electronics , etc . sitting in an airplane seat it fit nicely under the seat in front of me and i was able to get to all my toys during the flight i have used about # other laptop bags during travel , but this was definitely the most comfortable , roomy , and easiest to use
full of pockets extremely comfortable and very easy on the back not extremely large or for heavy capacity but its medium size is what i was needing thumbs up for swiss gear on this model
i own many swiss gear backpacks for laptops , but i would have to say this fits best it does n't make you look like a teenage <unk> ninja turtle it has enough cushion to protect your valuable laptop from being crushed , yet at the same time it does n't look too bulky - more like a normal backpack yes , this backpack barely fits a # . # inch laptop if you try hard enough to squeeze it in - it does fit i just use it for my # . # inch so i recommend it for a laptop no more than # . # inches the three seperate compartment should give you enough room to organize your books , papers , and laptop etc . again without the bulkiness
i bought this backpack on rebate , and worth every penny ... my # . # ' laptop fits perfect , but a # inches laptop might not fit though i totally agree with previous reviews , had a lot of <unk> pockets to store everything like external hdd , extra cd 's , mouse , or cables it also has velcro straps that keep everything in place liked the desing and the fact that is has a media pocket that fits my ipod ! i recently traveled with it and had room enough to put a couple of jeans , extra t-shirts , a book , media devices , and other stuff and so it 's still confortable i just hope they made the front zipper bigger , but is not a big deal hope this review was <unk>
have been using <unk> backpacks and wal-mart packs that have only been lasting a couple of months have had this pack for quite a while and it still looks brand new excellent bag !
this is such a good general backpack the appearance is unique and the build is great ; typical for any swiss-made product this stylish bag is good for things from camping , hiking , and fishing , to school , work , and a whatever else if you 're looking for a bag that will stay in style for a while and last twice that , this is it
best for the price fits my # . # inch work laptop and my school # inch laptop only complaint i have read was that this guy purchased this backpack without reading description , he could not fit his # inch laptop that 's it , no complaints from me , love it , would not trade it or sell it , specially for the price i git it for in amazon recommend it to everyone in school and work
the item arrived on time and exactly like the one in the picture i love the features of the bag and the size is perfect for me the bag is made of high-end material and feels really durable - will last me for years to come this fits my # `` laptop well and can still put a book or two and some electronics and personal stuff in it as everyone have noticed , the bag feels light when you wear it everybody must get one
my son # needed a backpack for school there 's not as many texts nowadays but he does need one big enough to carry his # `` x # `` laptop , gym <unk> , lunch and various items i just wanted one to last the whole year he had a swiss gear last year and it performed extremely well , it withstood a <unk> # yr old the entire year , and was more filthy than actually worn he says this one is cool and not <unk> and he really likes the way it looks me , i like it , but it kinda ' makes me think of the shell of a teenage <unk> ninja turtle , though i have n't told him that unfortunately , just # mos into the school yr and the zipper has ripped apart this did n't happen on last yrs bag , but this one has really disappointed
i 've only had the bag a few days now , however i love it so far well made and plenty room for <unk> i carry on a daily basic i 'm coming to this bag , from being a over the should bag carrier for years i <unk> back and update this review after more time using it so far so good ! ! !
bought this and a north face backpack at double this price prefer this now great padding , can store quite a bit for its size , and sits well on the <unk> of the back zippers seem a tad flimsy in comparison to <unk> but i guess that wouldnt be a fair basis definitely recommend as a daypack or a laptop bag as long as the laptop is not more than # inches -lrb- wouldnt fit otherwise
this was an amazing find for the price we got it at you can tell it was made by those who make the swiss army knives because we keep finding new pockets it fits a # . # inch computer though its a bit of a squeeze
i absolutely love this backpack i use it every single day for storing my personal and work belongings , including my laptop and now my tablet the compartments and pockets are the right size for my needs it 's also very comfortable on my back this purchase was well worth it for me
its a good bag for a nice price i bought it for # $ its worth for that money it just -lrb- exactly -rrb- fits # . # ' laptop and it can just accommodate not more than # books and a laptop
it 's great to carry small loads do n't plan on using this as a duffle bag i like to use this on motorcycle rides during the weekend i can carry the necessary stuff without any discomfort
very cool backpack well-made with high quality material comfortable with it and your back does not feel much weight it can hold all your stuff ! i am very satisfied with this i am a business school student i have at least # courses everyday i put # laptop , and # textbooks & notebooks inside , plus ipod , headphone case , <unk> , and lots of other stuffs this bag handles just fine
this is just another great item from swissgear my family has purchased a number of these items over the years and have always appreciated the quality of construction and attention to detail this company has <unk>
i bought this bag to carry laptop and other it gear works a treat every layer is padded so i have the utmost confidence in its protection my macbook pro -lrb- # & # # ; -rrb- fits snugly - it is in it 's own neoprene type case too and it still fits fits all i need as a daypack
i bought this during a lightning deal on amazon , and it 's great for the price would i buy it at full price i do n't know - i just might shop around for other bags from swissgear or others :
i bought two of them , one for my husband and another one for me i can fit my # `` macbook , but i do n't think it would work for a bigger laptop it is also the perfect size for books , school supplies , etc . the numerous pockets allow you to keep things organized , and you can even carry two bottles at the sides i use the little pocket in the shoulder strap for the <unk> spray ; -
since purchasing the swissgear backpack , i think it is very safe to say that i will never purchase any type of bag / luggage unless it has the swissgear name on it i have been nothing but pleased with the backpack it fits everything i need for work and then some i have recommended your product to every i know
i 've had this backpack for over a year and mainly use it for travel it 's already paid for itself in saved luggage fees since i 'm able to use the backpack as my personal item , plus take a separate carry on even with it loaded up -lrb- lap top , book , snacks , power cords , phone , plus my purse -rrb- , it 's still comfy trekking from gate to gate at the airport the compartments are so roomy that when it 's full , the depth almost equals the width , so it does look a little <unk> overall , the quality is good and the arrangement of the pouches , access ports , etc are very well thought out which makes for easy access and a comfortable pack
i loved this backpack from the start there is so much storage in this backpack and it does n't hurt your shoulders if you have a lot in it it is great to just use as a day pack if you are going to an <unk> park or even just to a friends house
i bought it from another country cause i was tempted about the price when this product arrived it was love at first sight it has an incredible quality , many compartments and extreme <unk> <unk> of this product was on time and the product , as i said above , is very very good
the qualify is good enough one good thing about the bag is that it can maintenance its shape even it is empty or has heavy items in the bottom , unlike some other bags which may be distorted this keeps you look sharp and well organized . some minor negative points i prefer <unk> decorations , so i am not sure what <unk> the net on the surface serves also this point is not particularly to this bag but to many bags : i do n't like the mp # bag and hold first , i do n't listen to mp # , given now everyone has a smart phone second , the mp # hole makes the bag less resistant to raining weather
my son in law had his picture taken , with the newly packed back pack , and a <unk> face as he was walking out the door to work he thought that it met all of his expectations
i use it everyday for work and my ipad fits perfectly in it it is very well made i would highly recommend it if you are looking for a backpack to carry your ipad
after all of this time , my son is still using this bag he loves it and i love that i see it every time he shows up with his computer
swissgear makes the best bags my first sg bag of many years finally got worn out so i searched for a new one thankfully amazon still have this rare style in stock it looks so good and is so well constructed also , for some reason , it feels light with the same amount of stuff in it compared to my old swissgear bag - maybe something to do with the weight distribution or sling system i put my # inch macbook pro , # books , and a # inch binder in my bag and there 's still room for a little more did i mentioned that it looks so sexy
it 's perfectly fit for my back like <unk> 's hump when i wear it , the girls ca n't resist me , and all the guys want to be me if you want to be cool ... get this bag
i had been using a shoulder bag to carry my laptop , accessories , and work home and it just killed me i found this backpack for the right price and made the switch and i am happy with my decision the backpack is sleek and stylish the fabric quality and construction is sturdy to take on everyday wear and tear i 'm able to carry my # -inch laptop with charger and other accessories and bring pack folders and other items in it great product for a happy costumer
this is a great backpack if you carry a heavy load of things my laptop and books fit in perfectly and it is very comfortable to my backpack after buying this backpack , i would definitely stick to swissgear 's products
i bought this backback for my boyfriend whose old one was falling apart he absolutely loves it he uses it when he goes to work it fits his laptop perfect and everything else that he needs he has owned it for several weeks now and is proving to be a durable backpack
i love this backpack for business travel it is large enough to hold some file folders and some personal items and work as a single carry on with air travel the built in pockets for water bottles , phone and sunglasses are a nice bonus too
bought two different swissgear backpacks for spares -lrb- & # # ; just in case & # # ; stash -rrb- for our kids for when their old ones finally bite the dust both are very nice and the price was too good to pass up i love amazon ! i could not get these locally - no way - not at this good of a price -lrb- daily deal -rrb- i 'm very happy with them - tested them out to make sure they 'd be a good fit for our boys ' busy high school <unk> they are roomy and will hold all of their school books plus plenty more they are comfortable and the straps are <unk> the material is very nice - the packs overall are well constructed . worth spending a little more for a quality pack from a great company we 're totally satisfied
the reason i give this product # stars is that the protection this book bag provides for my laptop is great the compartment is strategically placed in the back so that the padding on one side of the laptop also pads your back , making it more comfortable to wear the bag also has a second bigger compartment so you do n't miss out on space when the laptop is in the bag i recommend this product to everyone who wants a nicer book bag or if they have a laptop it is also very nice for traveling
i use for backpack for school and travel with my laptop everytime i go to school . great protection for the apple laptop that i have i have a case on the laptop and it fits great extra room for books and other things that you need to carry . extra pockets overall i was impressed and would def recommend backpack to
looks and feels really well made it does not have the cheap looking plastic fasteners and parts many other bags have that soon break it has strong stitching and seams and it should last many years looks great , very adult styling wise , good for college student or adult you will not be confused with borrowing a bag from a junior high student this is small to mid sized bag very well padded to protect your stuff this fits a # . # & # # ; laptop just fine there are several pockets to keep accessories protected and organized and room left fora few books a really nice quality backpack
good : so many pockets , solid , not feel too heavy when you insert so many stuff in it bad : my # ' hp laptop can not be inserted into the position which <unk> for laptop . so i will buy a # ' thinkpad to suit this backpack :
i love this backpack , it 's my favorite travel backpack swissgear makes some of the very best bags , and this one is one of its best the stitching is extremely solid - you will never have to worry about it ripping heck , you might even find yourself in an action movie <unk> , hanging off a click with only this backpack holding you up for a fall off the <unk> , and it will save you and one of the most important characteristics of quality bags are the zippers - these are big and strong , you 'll never have to worry about them being jammed or breaking there is good padding on the outside layers , and within the inside layers it does n't have quite as many pockets , sections , dividers , as the other bags , but what it does , it does very well overall , i have absolutely no issues with this backpack , and so i bought a second one for an upcoming trip for a friend
this is one of the most beautiful bags i 've bought in my life the build quality is exceptional and the body itself looks strong compared to my jansport backpack it 's perfect and compact enough to carry a # . # laptop and since it 's nicely padded , i find it to offer maximum protection to my laptop the backpack is somehow water resistant but not water proof there 's also enough space left for books and lunch i recommend this backpack to anyone wanting a compact and stylish yet practical bag and for the price , it 's a steal
i 've been using this backpack daily for about two months and it has been working out very well i can haul a lot more stuff much more easily compared to the old messenger style bag i was using finally , the construction of the bag seems to be solid
its very convenient and robust product note that , its a computer backpack hence lot of cushion for safety we ca n't use it for personal travel bag to carry other than laptop items as the bag looks heavy and ca n't keep more items
i love this bag it 's got a lot of good compartments and great storage layout design i use it to carry my laptop and my tools for work i find the layout of the straps to be very accommodating i highly recommend this product
this item was purchased as a carry-on bag for a flight and # -day caribbean cruise it is well built , has heavy duty zippers , plenty of pockets and the red color stands out when keeping an eye on it as it sits around waiting in line with me at all the check-in desks i was very pleased with the bags protection for my ipod and ipad while on the trip the bag served flawlessly
the backpack is well constructed with sturdy straps and well made zippers the laptop compartment sits nicely against your back and will hold most # . # inch laptops -lrb- or a # . # inch laptop with a carry case -rrb- there are lots of extra compartments and the design looks great probably too small to carry textbooks in , but perfect for anyone looking for a sturdy travel backpack that looks great
i was pleasantly surprised how handy this backpack was when i traveled across country it is very light and can handle it 's weight while hiking through trails and rough terrain also very durable and you ca n't beat the price
i bought this bag a couple of months from now and let me tell you , this is by far the best piece i 've come across initially this bag looked small but when i started filling things in it , it just kept <unk> them with still a lot of room available my # . # `` laptop fits in nicely and still there is room for atleast # folders there is lot of padding for the protection of the laptop there are # other friends of mine , whom i know personally , that have brought this bag after i bought it so if you are thinking of getting one , do n't think , just go for it ! ! ! it is worth every single penny p.s . even after you fill in a lot of things , when you put it on your shoulder , you wo n't feel the weight
got this from a lightning deal was n't too worried about the color upon receiving , it held all my work documents , laptop and my phone accessories with room to spare
i bought this bag for my laptop and ended up using it for that plus carrying around other items as well nicely built and sturdy i have never worried about my laptop while transporting with this bag
i already had one similar bag complete black in colour which i am using since last # years and it is still in good condition so when i saw this bag for the deal price i purchased it asap for gifting my sister it has very good quality material and very sturdy in short good for the price
the backpack is amazing and very <unk> i liked it a lot there are so many space to put cell phone , glass , my notebook and the qaulity is very good i recommend this item
i was coming out of a rolling computer bag due to the amount of stuff i carry on a daily basis i was a bit skeptical if a backpack would work for me but this this has lots of space i would definately recommend this one if you are always on the go with your computer -lrb- # . # `` -rrb- / <unk> lots of equipment for a working professional only downside , since this bag is so deep i find myself `` digging `` for the items that rest at the bottom but i would not give up the space for the few seconds i loose searching two thumbs up
great quality and comfortable a lot of pockets that you can fill with a bunch of stuff . . but the smallest compartment should have a longer or bigger zipper so we could see inside better
the swiss gear bags are just awesome the design is far better than other back packs and the quality is just <unk> i have been using this bag for quite some time and till now there has been no wear and tear and i am quite sure it is going to last for next # years without any problems i got it at quite a good price too for about # $
it 's very sturdy and provides good back support it holds a lot but is not too bulky i use it for school , but i think it 'll make a good carry-on as well
gave it to college kids , appears to be well made and able to take couple of years of abuse without much problems time will tell since previous model did n't fair as well
i bought it for my son-in-law who loves it and uses it all the time whether <unk> or at home he used it in ca to carry his kindle , camera , water , snacks for the kids etc . it is light and holds a lot at home , he <unk> on weekends and finds it is very handy
i 'm now to the point where i ca n't imagine not having it perfect for any kind of travel use as a carry on or as a ` brief case ' . # compartments and easy to carry i love it
this bag is great for my laptop and school books it also has a cell phone slot and spaces for water bottles . only downside is the front pocket is tiny and doesnt open
got this for my son , who goes through backpacks fairly quick so far so good the quality is good , pocket size is useful , fits his school books , and seems comfortable to wear i have heard no complaints i am hoping that the extra padding means that it will take him longer to make holes in it
this bag is excellent the material and the built look like it will last for a long time it protects your laptop well and has intuitive compartments not the <unk> backpack for books and binders i would recommend this still update # - # the bag still looks brand new even with less than gentle treatment contrary to what another reviewer claims , i have a # inch hp laptop and it fits perfectly in the padded section
very well made , comfortable backpack it also offers lots of pockets as well as compartment for everything u can think of i have a laptop secured in this thing with # books in the next compartment everything fits nicely inside and the bag seems to handle the weight just fine , unlike frail old me
first the shipping was pretty fast and the price for this item was a great one , the quality of the product is excellent , i will shop from this store again if i have to
it 's nice , very useful , i really like it because you can use it in different ways , not only to university but carry it to <unk> the size is
seems to be a heavy duty backpack it is large , organized , just seems like a well made product and the best price around yes , we will recommend this product let 's hope it stands up to a college student
this has been in my possession for # weeks i love it it is built like a tank it looks so cool and almost futuristic like something you 'd see in a <unk> movie all the zippers are heavy duty and the <unk> zipper is protected by a flap the seams are rugged and the material is slick looking and tough as nails it has so much storage space , you run the risk of packing too much and weighing it down with great little access pockets , you have easy reach for wallet , phone , or anything you need for a day at work/school or <unk> a city tons of value for the cost
i 've logged more than # <unk> with this bag it still looks new well worth the price things i like : it fits under the plane seat as long as i do n't stuff the middle too much comfortable even with # pounds of stuff lots of pouches things i do n't like : no easy way to manage straps zippers need two hands
bought this backpack over a year ago and it 's holding up quite well granted the gray strap on the top of the primary strap is losing its stitching , it has n't affected the backpack in any way however , that was probably the result of my own doing and snagging it on something i owned other swissgear backpacks , but the quality of this backpack surpasses the previous one i owned as far as the laptop pouch is concerned , i can fit a # . # sized toshiba laptop but it does get snug and the zipper barely closes over it however , it does close so that 's all that matters as far as the other compartments are concerned , i can fit text books into the second largest compartment and my pencils , pens , and other materials into the front pouch with ease the two side pouches are adequate enough to hold water bottles and such , so another plus other than that , great
i have been searching for quite a while now for a multipurpose backpack this one fits the bill perfectly the primary use is for # day trips ... car , rail , plane this does the job lots of places to store important items such as passports , keys , and odds and <unk> lots of room for my overnight and next few days cloths and toiletries , plus still more room for tablet e-reader and mp # player the bag is well constructed with what looks and feels like quality rugged material all in all a great backpack at a great price
it is just what i was looking for ; was n't that set on the red color but i have to admit the color is not that bad i travel often for work and the bulky rolling laptop bag i have just does not fit in the overhead on the smaller jets this bag is great ; it does fit a # or # inch laptop so if you have anything larger get a larger backpack for me both my work laptop and personal laptop fit perfectly the quality is great like swissgear brand ; very nice for the price
love this backpack ca n't think of anything else i would want this backpack to do it holds everything i need , securely , safely and comfortably if you need to carry anything less than a # `` laptop , i would highly recommend this backpack i have used it everyday since i got it i 'm sure you will enjoy it too
i bought this backpack anticipating a vacation with my sister out west i put two laptops , my nook e-reader , snacks , power cords for the electronics , my normal & # # ; purse & # # ; items , and other miscellaneous odds and ends i was traveling with a broken <unk> in a cast this backpack worked perfect i did not feel & # # ; heavy & # # ; on my back , the straps are well padded , and the room and space in the pack is great i could have stuffed more in there very happy with my purchase
i expected a backpack designed to tote laptops what i got was a packback designed to tote laptops well made and full of nifty little swiss compartments hidden ` <unk> zippers and vecro i ca n't imagine what the <unk> intended for some of the pockets , but who can understand the <unk> <unk> mind
i love this backpack , however it is a bit on the small side its been more than needed for me but i could see some people having issues with the size
i checked a lot of backpacks on amazon and selected this out of all i finally <unk> # colors <unk> combination and black i dont know why black backpack is # + dollars more than the flashy <unk> still i did not want the flashy one i selected black and am very happy with my choice when you hold the bag in hand you will feel the quality of it its amazing with sooooo many compartments it can easily fit one days clothes if you are travelling along with the laptop fast amazon shipment and good price
i 've had a number of swissgear backpacks over the years ... they last a long time despite a lot of use because they 're well-made . access in to the bag and each compartment is easy
when i read a couple of comments on this backpack i was hesitant because they said that it was n't big enough i 'm glad i did buy it and let me tell you that it has tons of space and lots of different compartments would definitely recommend it
