the case is relatively water resistant ; however , water can get through the zipper area if enough water is on the case and it is extremely flimsy if looking for a case that is going to keep your laptop dry and not broken , then i would n't recommend it
for me there is just not enough padding sure it will keep your laptop dry , but i 'm not happy about the overall protection if i had to do it over , i would have paid $ # for something that would actually provide some protection for my machine if i dropped it
this case is well put together , but there are some qualities i have n't tested yet i have n't put its water resistance to the test , and hopefully i wo n't other than that , the zipper seems heavy duty , and the padding itself is sufficient but not bulky ; i can slip it into my backpack easily my only quibble is that my # . # `` asus fits a little loosely
should provide adequate protection for regular wear-and-tear situations i would n't want to bet on the computer being protected from a fall from a desk top -lrb- or from waist level -rrb- onto a hard floor , ` though
this case was absolutely perfect for my new toshiba # . # inch laptop it really is a great case for $ # , i mean how can you go wrong and it really is water resistent i tested it out just to be sure
if you want a simple laptop sleeve , this is the product for you it has no pockets or anything so if you 're looking for a laptop case in which you can store other things , keep looking the material is really nice and well-made it does n't offer too much cushion , though , so you still have to be careful you do n't set your bag down too hard if it 's just sitting inside of the sleeve inside your bag
i really loved this case except for it being sewn together so the front pouch on the one i got was terribly crooked and not acceptable wish they had offered an exchange option as i would love one that was properly made
i have a samsonite bag like this -lrb- so i thought -rrb- this bag is a mere shadow of my bag all the same features & looks but not the same <unk> it is not as well padded nor is it as big on the inside main pocket it will do the job but for what i paid i got took this bag is worth about $ # not $
i was somewhat nervous , as this case was only around $ # , i thought i was going to get burned it is high quality canvas , and is a perfect size it has held up going to work and back on a daily basis i would definitely recommend
i looked everywhere online for a nice purple laptop bag with a shoulder strap and finally came upon this one i decided to buy it because it was purple , and not too bulky now that i received it , i am super happy with my purchase my laptop fits perfectly and there 's even enough for for my charger and other stuff this is perfect for school
very nice case for the lap top it fits real good and i love the extra pockets for disc and mouse and any file folders that i need for the day put together real good
i really like this it is cushioned and i keep an extra laptop in it for protection and i like the straps in the inside that keep it in place and the pockets to keep anything else that you might need i would buy it
have arthritis and shoulder issues need something light weight holds up to a # in has room for charger and other stuff i use this for class and have travel as well it hooks nice on suitcases and not cumbersome when going through security color is nice two we have # in the family
i had shopped the bricks and mortar places and could find nothing but a bag i hated this bag really fit my # / # inch laptop it is light and well made and i love the purple color
it met my requirements it was the color i wanted and it was the only one that had a built in strap in the back to attach to a rollaway luggage for security
my daughter bought this case for me , we travel for our job so we needed a case for the little laptop this one is sturdy and very nice it has a safety belt to hold it in best all it is a wonderful purple my favorite
i received the case in a timely manner it was exactly what i expected and i am happy with it i wanted something other than black and the color is nice there is plenty of space for carrying accessories and the laptop secures simply and securely i would definitely recommend this product
i bought this case when i bought a large screened laptop the bag holds a # . # inch laptop with room to spare all around there is sufficient room to stow cords , papers , etc . inside and then add a book in the side pocket it can be worn as a shoulder bag the purple is <unk> the color is professional without black , but has the stain resistance of black helps the case stand out in a crowd = = like under a table
made well with extra compartments room for my laptop , cooling pad , cords & gadgets as well has a velcro strap to help keep the laptop in place and if you want it for smaller items has a removable divider for the bottom love the color , a rich dark purple the metal pieces seem strong & durable , easy to add & remove the shoulder strap
this bag is very user friendly it 's light weight , not adding extra weight when laptop is inside it has an adjustable shoulder strap , making it easy to carry comfortably hard plastic on the bottom so when not in use , it can be easily set aside without worry of losing it 's shape i would not only recommend this particular bag , but am purchasing another one as a gift for a friend
i love the color my # . # inch toshiba fits in it with not a lot of room for anything else , but the outside pocket is plenty big enough to accommodate the cord and other accessories shoulder strap is comfortable and you can put it on the handle your rolling suitcase when traveling seems well put together
this laptop case meets my needs perfectly ; it has ample room for my # . # laptop and lapdesk as well as for all the accessories i love the color and it is very sturdy i usually put it on the floor in my truck and it has stood up very well
i 've had # of these because i love the design that much ... both of their zippers have failed at the same spot after much use -lrb- so yes i got value out of the bag -rrb- i am a bit of a road warrior so i am going to buy a booq slip backpack and try that next but beware , the zippers on this bag will wear out and they are about impossible to replace or fix by how the bag is made
great bag - style is cool , plenty of storage , high quality , and just the right size for my ipad and some other stuff the bag is well padded and water resistent so it will keep my stuff safe shoulder strap has plenty of padding and is quite comfortable
love the fact that this minimalist bag is forcing me to keep a lighter load quality materials , nice compartments , and great padding for all my goodies it 's my daily bag to/from work and always with me when i travel love this bag -- had to find it on amazon since they appear not to produce it anymore not sure why - it 's a winner
my macbook air # `` fits into this bag like <unk> man snaps into a slim <unk> here 's what i often keep in my bag - laptop - ipad # - <unk> <unk> bible - <unk> i want to go to work <unk> , i 'll ditch the bag and then just carry my ipad # and a # <unk> pen otherwise , i love using this booq mamba catch s . after # months of regular usage , the bag is still in great shape it 's an outstanding minimalist shoulder bag this is the bag that i use the most i also have a booq flow m backpack but do n't use it as frequently
i originally bought this case for my # . # lenovo laptop , but it did n't quite fit that well at the corners instead , i use it for my ipad i needed a shoulder strap for the laptop case anyway this works perfect for my ipad that is already enclosed in a snugg case the extra pockets hold cleaning cloths , extra stylus , etc .
this case is perfect i just needed something streamlined to put my # . # acer in , so that i could throw it in my bag without scratches this case is perfect it has straps inside and an <unk> shell design so that the netbook can be used while in the case -lrb- though not for too long bc of overheating possibilities -rrb- the outer and inner pockets make the case extremely convenient , and i 'm fairly certain this is the only case my netbook will ever need the neoprene is n't overly thick , but i 'm not planning on throwing my computer around <unk> , so i 'm not looking for a <unk> armored case this case suits my needs exactly
i searched high and low for a # . # `` laptop case they were either too small or way too large when i found this one , i decided to get it even if it might not be just what i wanted to my surprise it was better than i expected beautiful color , pockets to hold all of my computer stuff , and best of all it was built very well it protected my laptop just as i needed it to do
i got this cause it was the cheapest # . # & # # ; case i could find to buy after spending a little more than i intended on my # . # & # # ; laptop , i was cheap for the case i should say this surprised me : very nice quality , specially for the price , does n't look any cheaper or less durable than a $ # case the color is pretty , the pockets in the front are a great plus , since neoprene cases rarely have pockets i recommend this to anyone with a laptop this size unless you want something very sophisticated , different size or material , or a brand name , i do n't see why you would need to get a more expensive case
i loved the case when i first took out the package it had a nice finish and i loved the way it felt on my hands , the color white was beautiful and the price even better compared to others when i placed on my computer it fit snug , it was the perfect case until when i opened up the computer to find out the screen would not fully open returning this one and getting a speck we 'll see
case itself is nice , but i bought it for my macbook pro late # and it fits not entirely well you can live with it , but it is perfectly fitted for my computer
the color is absolutely beautiful i love the color however , there might be a design flaw close to the port where you 'd connect your mac to power adaptor the case seems to take a little bit room so its not that smooth to connect the power adaptor but overall , a fair buy
this quite a solid product however , one design flaw has prevented me from <unk> this item # super stars the battery indicator lights are completely covered and the button for it can not be pressed other than that this case is pretty tight
excellent case and wonderful bargain for my # mbp # the same case went for the usual $ # at both apple and <unk> in my area i did not have the issues described by some other buyers the back clip of the case only slightly impedes the newer style of apple ` <unk> connector it connects easily at a very slight angle furthermore the case arrived in pristine condition , not scuffed i also like the sheer <unk> of the cover that makes it look <unk> `` macbook , `` instead of a pro , hence perhaps less <unk> to thieves ? -lrb- then again maybe i 'm <unk> ?
fits perfect , great color -lrb- i got a white one -rrb- and as far as the white color is concerned , it is a very slight shade of off white not yellow tint or anything , but a little less & # # ; <unk> & # # ; in your face white very <unk> pleasing to the eye there is not cut opening to for the apple logo , but when the logo is lit up -lrb- computer on -rrb- it does faintly glow through which is kind of cool quality is great ! , not cheap , and is a hard plastic that will give great protection
when i ordered this hardshell incase i was n't expected this product makes my mac <unk> -lrb- <unk> color -rrb- turned into my favorite white body as white as i want surprisingly , it looks so white like <unk> and the best part is the apple glow in the white -lrb- ! ! ! -rrb- when you open it it 's perfectly fit the mac <unk> body but you need to wipe the fingerprint often since this is the glossy one i am so glad that i bought this because it is not easy to find the white incase cover like this
this case snapped easily onto my macbook pro # , fits great , and looks beautiful it 's got a glossy hard finish and no cutout for the apple logo , which is exactly what i was looking for and the price ca n't be beat
the reviews were very <unk> and helped me decide to order i had wanted a white computer , so with the absence of the color white , the next best thing was to select a cover to protect my new macbook and change it 's color could n't be happier the glossy white cover is smooth , securely fit , and attractive for those who might not want to conceal the apple logo , the glow from the apple does shine through the cover when it is lit beyond satisfied which is hard when one is <unk> on buying before being able to physically see and feel
good case to protect your mac but it shows finger prints and the monitor display does not push back all the way until you push it until it feels you broke something ... but you didnt
got this for my new macbook pro as i 'm traveling intensively fits great , the new # degree macbook charger can be connected without any trouble and the notebook does n't get extra hot only downside is that the notebook does n't close as tight anymore as before due to the little plastic holders of the case - but that 's ok given the protective advantage
i looked for awhile before buying a case for my macbook pro - i figured to protect something this valuable to me , i 'd better do my research this case , albeit more expensive than some of the others , turned out to be the best $ # i 've spent in awhile it fits perfectly - including the new # degree magsafe power adapter , which was my main concern it also leaves room to attach a locking cord -lsb- something other cases cover up -rsb- it has a great <unk> feel , which looks classy and gives some grip as well the black definitely matches the rest of the computer and looks awesome next to the aluminum the macbook pro is a beautiful machine , and this case compliments it perfectly
i had a speck case on my macbook pro for # years and it stayed safe then , i switched to the pink incase cover to <unk> things up i just took the pink incase cover off of my macbook pro this weekend and there 's a giant dent on the cover of my macbook - not happy it had only been on there for about a year it was also chipped and cracked in numerous places , too i am so gentle with my macbook pro and i never had these problems with my old speck case needless to say , i 'm going back to speck incase is garbage
i buy these incase <unk> because they fit snug and do their job but they do crack easily -lrb- i do n't normally toss my computer around , so not sure how they got the cracks in the corners -rrb- the finish is coming off at the corners though , looks like chipping paint
i have the # inch macbook pro non-retina display with cd drive this case fits except the bottom component does not snap in to the back of the laptop ; it isnt deep enough although i can pull it down and make it come off ; it is secure enough and will not come off unless i want it to after a few months of using this , # or the # little rubber stands have broken not a huge deal though
the top half of the case is awesome it fits just right ! unfortunately , i can not say the same for the bottom half the right side of the bottom half refused to clip in thus making the case not worth $ # maybe it 's just a defective case if the bottom half clipped in like it should then the case would be worth it
case was exactly as advertised it has a nice snug fit and it looks great the apple logo shines through the case so you can still tell it 's a mac
i enjoy my incase hardshell it is very sleek and snaps on to the macbook easily i also enjoy that the apple logo still glows through the case one negative is that fingerprints show pretty easily as a result of the material the case is made of it is relatively easy to clean , but can sometimes be an annoyance overall though , definitely a good product and worth the expense
love the incase so far , only had it for a couple of days but looks great on my mbp # inch fits very well and works great with the new magsafe adapter my only complaint is that in some lighting conditions it has a purplish hue to it , as my case is supposed to be black this only happens in some lighting conditions and is something i can easily live with taking into account how excellent this case is otherwise
it 's sleek and fitting , which does n't add much bulk to it i also like the refined look it has bit one problem is that with <unk> light , the black incase shell appears a very deep purple color but most of the time it is it 's attractive black finish also , there is a slight smudge bear the top , where i have no idea came from
i like the case a lot and the <unk> makes it nice to carry my laptop around if needed it feels like it ads a lot of weight to my mbp also , i ca n't open the screen all the way because the top cover hits the bottom cover neither of those issues are too big of a deal it does it 's job at protecting my mbp
i beat the crap out of my macbook pro , and this case has helped immensely looks great , fits great only negative is the grip pads on the bottom of the case fell off after a few months of use
i had my old case for # years and it lasted through many travels these cases are by far the best for macbooks very sturdy , not too bulky , and very nice to the touch
if you can find a decent price on this -lrb- i believe i found one for $ # ish -rrb- then definitely buy i truly love the case , yes , but i do feel the $ # price point for a new one is a bit ridiculous so my rating is for a <unk> one , since they are out there
i have had one of these on my laptop for about a year now , so i ordered one for my brother and it is exactly the same as mine and is a great laptop cover
i was surprised to see this case a such a great price it 's a perfect fit in my # & # # ; <unk> pro it 's easy to install ; it just snaps in place i do n't plan to ever remove it i chose the rubber-like matte finish . in addition to looking good , i can work with it on my lap with no concern for it sliding off the apple logo is still visible when the computer is on and open
it was what i was expecting , id recommend , it wo n't really protect from a fall , but if your laptop falls from about # feet its probably done for anyway it will protect from dust or scratches i recommend to anyone
this a a very sleek case that gets the job done i 'm somewhat disappointed , however , that <unk> add my charger and whatnot to the pocket -lrb- <unk> -rrb- it does n't fit nicely and it does n't feel secure i feel like if i drop the case everything will fall out if you 're wanting a travel case and do not plan on keeping all of your components stored , this case will be fine if you want to use this as a main case for your <unk> may feel it comes up short as i do
protective sturdy stylish black material with shoulder no frills packaging but easy-to-use and well <unk> zippers velcro strip for holding id , pens , and power <unk> , may not be large enough for all purposes velcro strip <unk> longer or use a zippered design pouch for fast trips without cds and other notes , could be very useful would not <unk> larger projects this is a social writeup review
this laptop sleeve is amazing it is very sleek and smooth it is exactly the right size for my laptop the zippers were very durable and the packaging was easy to open this is a social
decent quality construction on a protective sleeve the zipper works smoothly and the laptop slides right in this will be much more convenient to carry around on trips than a full bulky laptop case nice and sleek
exactly what i needed and at an affordable price not the most <unk> case , but it has good padding and the side pocket is sufficient for a mouse and other small accessories
my gateway <unk> laptop fits perfectly , my only <unk> is the small pocket . the picture is misleading in the sense that you cant fit as many things as <unk> like inside
this laptop sleeve gets the job done it fits my # . # laptop with room to spare the sides are cushy , so it will probably protect it from a fair amount of damage the material feels kinda cheap and smells a bit funny , but since this is the cheapest sleeve i could find , i 'm not complaining
this sleeve turned out to be an extra good value a lot cheaper than going to my local computer stores and buying a sleeve nice padding without being too much
perfect fit for what i needed and not bulky there was room inside to hold the battery charger as well so that was a plus strap length is just right so overall a very good value for the money prompt service from this seller it was a pleasure to do business with you
i picked this case up awhile back and it is one of the best that i 've ever seen and at the price , i could n't go wrong it is very well made , very well padded and equally functional . i use this laptop case every day and have n't had any bit of problem with it . it 's the best that i 've found so far and if you are looking for a really nice laptop case that will last for many years to come , pick one up you wo n't be disappointed . aaa + +
i like the material , it has a great zipper the packaging was simple to open my laptop is safe and secure in this new great case i highly reccomend this product this is a social writeup
not what i thought i was hoping for better it does n't open up and the exterior is not as good as i would have like my mistake on reading up on it
it is as it appears , basic but functional . the handles are just what i need and better padding than the sleeves . with a # & # # ; plenty of room in pocket leftover time will tell how it holds up
i find it very well-made and for the price i thinks is a good sale . even when the downside of not having a shoulder strap , i think is still useful and covers my necessities as a laptop sleeve
this is a small , no frills laptop bag for our usage , that was exactly what we needed , as we just needed something basic to protect the laptops for a <unk> class that we are teaching the padding is thin , but will provide a little protection the only downside is that bulge when including the charger is a little awkward , and does n't allow the bags to lay flat i would prefer a side pocket for the charger , rather than the front pocket on this bag , but that is a minor complaint
i needed a new laptop bag for my new laptop and i chose this one because of it 's low price this is a very good in expensive bag i 've had no problems with it at all i 'm able to put both my laptop and my lap desk in it note that it only has on side zip up pocket , but that was okay for me i only put the smaller accessories in it like flash drives etc . so i 'm very pleased with this bag
nice laptop bag for the price padding inside protects well pocket is ok for cd/dvd 's , charger and what not , but not for anything too big like a full size laptop cooler
i ordered the item yesterday # / # , and it already arrived this morning now for $ # i was not having any high standards , but this product is exactly what i needed , nothing too bulky or material heavy , the design is perfect , and seems very durable would purchase another one and reccomend this item
i purchased this bag for a spare laptop that i use for vacation travel it works for everything that i need it seems to be well padded and i have not had any problems
this is a really basic laptop bag , but if you are looking for a good value , this is it it does have some padding and fits my # . # inch screen nicely best deal i could find for a laptop bag out there
this is great for my lenovo , which is slightly bigger than some laptops it holds it in securely , and has a roomy extra pocket for the cord and mouse very durable , and the handle is a plus when i 'm carrying a few things well made , good value
i needed something small and convenient to store my work laptop in this bag is perfect for a # . # & # # ; computer the computer fits perfectly and the front zipper pouch is perfect for the power cord the handle makes it super easy to transport and overall it 's lightweight and not bulky , just perfect i 'm very happy with this purchase
the bag is a little flimsy but considering the price it is alright the purple is quite pretty bag is fine if you do n't plan on carrying your laptop around often i use it basically to store my laptop , and it is fine for that
i get everyone 's attention when i am carrying my computer in this purple bag we have a lot of <unk> fans where i live and work everyone asks me where i got it when i tell the the price , they can not believe it it is perfect for my needs not heavy and not a lot of wasted bulky pockets simply and smart
this bag is perfect for my new # . # `` laptop i love the color , and i think this is a great buy i just went on vacation , so i got a chance to use it , i love it for me , it is just what i was looking for
i was having a hard time finding a lap top bag for my # . # inch that was n't terribly expensive , but then i found this one i just love this bag and was so happy when my lap top fit ! ! great price ! !
i went back to college this year after many many years away from school this fit my hp laptop perfectly and was very handy for bringing my laptop to school it 's padded very well and even has an outside pocket where you can carry your mouse , charger or paperwork
i bought this bag to take my laptop on vacation it fits perfectly in this bag and i feel comfortable with the protection i get when my laptop is stored in it the pockets are big enough to fit the cables and mouse in them
# . # dimension is fine - # . # is too small ; mouse keeps going over edge . # would be better material starting to curl a little where the heel of my hand moves over it okay but not great
i got one of these for my wife to protect the screen of her macbook pro from the keyboard when it is closed i loved how thin it was , yet the size was perfect for the job so , when i got a macbook air , i ordered one for me if you have a hard surface , this item can also be a useful mouse pad
this thin mousepad is amazing my mouse glides over the microfiber with ease , making this an excellent gaming pad for the money doubling as a microfiber cleaning cloth , a clean monitor is always just a swipe away -lrb- no <unk> for cleaning supplies -rrb- the wide profile gives me full access to the area on my # `` monitor without lifting my mouse . :
i cant find second one which is slim as this and have the same quality and as they showed , you only need to throw it between the screen and keyboard since <unk> has no screen lock and it always allow you leave a little bit space for this pad
i purchased this for an acer netbook -lrb- # . # inch screen -rrb- so i thought it would fit the case was <unk> tight for the first month then the zipper broke , so it is more of a netbook sleeve i suppose it still protects the netbook , though it is not sealed in there
this case answered all my problems , tight fitting and still space for the charging cord , dvd burner , ethernet cable , phone data cable ect perfect case for me and probably you as well
this piece is amazing i bought this mini sleeve for my wife 's # . # hp notebook and what a lovely carrier it is the texture is soft and smooth ; it feels like silk i trust my wife 's gon na love it this is surely a sleeve for any mini notebook and for the price , i could n't have had a better deal
i purchased this item for my asus transformer infinity with keyboard dock this mini sleeve fits as if it was actually made for the tablet the material seems to be made out of neoprene and is thick enough to provide substantial protection from short drops i have no qualms about shoving my tablet into briefcase and forgetting it while it is protected by this product best of all , i got this sleeve for less than $ # this is one of the few times that you seem to get more than you pay for
i love this sleeve it fits perfectly for my tf prime and dock and also has the second pocket with plenty of space to store a cleaning cloth , mouse , stylus , and then some
perfect sleeve for hp mini laptops except it is kinda small for the # . # in mini hp laptop i bought along with , almost thought it might tear the zip off when i was closing it but it still fits tho a very <unk> sleeve i love it :
i bought this case to store my microsoft surface rt tablet with a keyboard it fits my device very snugly this case provides sufficient padding for my device and keeps it protected when in my bag my mom also purchased one to store her asus <unk> it fits her device well and she is happy with the case if you are looking for a sleeve to store a # `` tablet that is not an ipad , then i would certainly recommend this it will not fit an ipad because the ipad has a very weird shape that only fits things made for ipads
i will be using this case for my ipad air and my portable keyboard mainly when am traveling by plane the ipad will be in a <unk> case , so i know it will be fully protected i will put this case in the front outside pocket of my <unk> which i carry on i will also use it if i want to take the ipad and keyboard with me for road trips and or to another place near home it is well made and cushy and with these two items it is full - but not stuffed to the point of breaking the zipper there is also a zipped pocket on the outside that i can use for papers and my stylus - if i did n't have the inside compartment so full , more could be put in this outside pocket i wish it was a bit larger , but the next size wo n't fit into my wheelie pocket hopefully it will last and maintain its nice look and not get ragged with careful handling
i bought this for my daughter 's hp notebook computer i am so pleased with this purchase the front pouch has a zipper to hold her charger the material is thick and the computer is well protected all this for a very reasonable price
i purchased this quite a while ago for my kindle touch and it was fine when i received my new kindle fire hd # . # i tried it and it fit perfectly like a glove what a nice surprise
seriously it is like it was made for it a little tall but the exact length for it to fit snug for the price could n't find a better case with a zipper compartment other than the # dollar incipio
