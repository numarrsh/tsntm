bought this for a friend of mine as a gift because she just got a new laptop . it seemed really nice and since i have amazon prime <unk> i was able to get it fast shipping
the fit is perfect , the red keyboard cover is rubber which is great but it does take a bit of getting used to and my wpm seems to have slowed a bit but that 's fine the red also does come off on the fingertips but rubs right off so also not a problem i love it
the case arrived on time , was easy to install and it looks great the keyboard cover slipped on very easy the cover snapped on and i noticed what looked liked streaks on the inside when i tried to remove it it was tough , but it finally came off recommend wiping it down with a dry , clean cloth before you put it on fingerprints wipe off easy with dry cloth i am very happy with the way it looks and i 'm thinking about ordering the pink for when i want a change i definitely recommend this product
my mistake , i ordered a case that is the wrong case and was n't what i needed for my daughters mac book air the quality and product delivered is exactly what was described however i just could n't return it due to having thrown away all of the return labels , box , etc .
i have hardly any complaints the case fits perfect easy to close and open computer with the case installed it was easy to install my only complaint would be that the rubber keypad cover does not show the <unk> light from the keyboard
this case is a beautiful turquoise blue color - exactly as pictured and described i am simply in love with it it snaps on nicely and seems quite durable i 'm very happy for the price i paid the only issues is that the matching keyboard cover does n't really fit the keyboard , but that 's fine - i do n't really need it the cleaning cloth is great - cleans very well
overall the bag is well made and protective of my laptop however i could n't give five stars because i think that the look of the bag is a little bit <unk> functionally , it 's great i did n't find that the padding on the shoulder straps was as stiff as other reviewers the bag is very adjustable i really like the fact that it does n't have too many pockets on the outside this is important to me because i plan on using it in <unk> areas and i do n't want to leave many opportunities for <unk>
i like the way this bag distributes the weight of the contents i must carry on a day-to-day basis my previous bag -lrb- a messenger bag -rrb- only had a single shoulder strap and after a while i discovered i could barely endure the weight of it on my shoulder the everki glide makes things a whole lot easier i 'm constantly on the go so there 's plenty of compartments to store my various items i 've had the bag for approximately two months so as far as i can tell the quality is good and reliable also , there 's an extra layer of padded protection , which prevents items in the bag from jarring against your spine during movement the only thing i wish i had is perhaps an external side pocket where i could store my water bottle but this is n't a deal breaker by any means overall , this was a good investment for me
excellent backpack , wo n't hold # `` gaming laptop 's though msi gt # <unk> too big with such a nice bag i decided to keep it and give as gift for someone with non # lb laptop ended up with microsoft laptop case from <unk> ca n't put $ # laptop in backpack that wo n't zip after it is in
i bought this for my macbook pro at first , i thought it was a pretty purple color i take care of my macbook and do not bring it out however , this case starting breaking within two months it is cheap because the quality is extremely cheap it is breaking , chipping at edges there are little purple plastic pieces all over it has not been dropped it stays on a desk everyday
it looks nice , i even like the keyboard cover it comes with but , as the old saying goes , you get what you pay for with light use -lrb- only holding my macbook on my lap , and never placing on a flat hard surface -rrb- the bottom corners are literally <unk> i randomly find chunks of blue plastic that have popped off of this case final <unk> : dish out the extra $ # for a case that will last . i do not recommend this , unless you change up your cases frequently and do n't mind them falling apart and looking <unk> after a month
the case looks like one of the speck cases i have plus the pink color shown online really reflects how it looks like in person the keyboard cover also really helps keep it clean and whatnot it 's not bad at all for the price i paid recently however , i noticed some cracking on two of the corners of the case
it was good and it lasted about half a year before the corners really started chipping off for me i 'd say it 's not the permanent solution if you only want to buy one case for your laptop if you want to change colors once in awhile it does n't really matter
was delivered on time , fit my mac book pro with out retina display perfectly . keypad cover fits and does n't move around much . screen sheet cleans love it . pleased with my purchase
i was expecting a more solid color , but ended up loving the more see through color it ended up being the keyboard skin takes a little getting used to , but now i love it keeps it clean and adds some nice life and color :
it came in a great time frame and fit my macbook , even though it was a bit of a tight fit but i suppose it 's supposed to be that way it 's a little darker than i thought it was going to be but it 's still pretty
for the price i paid for this case , it was totally worth it the only complaint i have is that the bottom of the case does not cover my lap top completely the color really stands out and i 've already gotten multiple compliments if you 're looking for a new , fun case , i definitely say that this is it
it 's exactly what i expected the only thing i did n't like is the keyboard cover , but i think that 's a matter of preference fast shipping and good product , overall
good value for the price -- nice color and feel way better than another one that i had before this where the rubber feet kept falling off this one is secure and functional
this is a very nice and solid case it snaps on beautifully and is thick enough to protect my beloved mac lid closes perfectly . the keyboard cover is also very nice and gives it some style i 've had no <unk> with overheating or anything of the like
this is by far the best quality macbook case i have found the material is not that cheap plastic that it is usually made of it is durable but not bulky and definitely protective the keyboard cover is a little thin but it does its job worth it to buy just for the case
i just received my dark purple case and it fits perfect and the color was dead on to the one in the pic i will definitely recommend to my friends
i am about to purchase another one this one came in great shape , on time and looks fantastic on my laptop ! ! no scratches or dents and it even smelled
i bought this for my girlfriend 's mom as a present for her mac and i have to say that the color is really vibrant and the case fits very well the keyboard cover is n't bad either she likes it a lot i would highly recommend this case and keyboard cover to anyone who likes the color yellow . <unk> make sure that you look up the model number of your mac because you do n't want to get the wrong case
other reviews have mentioned a smell associated with this item and there is indeed a strong one i. had to let it air in the sun for several days before i could use it other than that , this sleeve/case fits my lenovo x # quite well
i have the pleasure of using a dell xps # this year at uni this case is awesome if i have a full battery good for a monday afternoon lecture
the product arrived in # weeks , and the # `` size is a very good -lrb- slightly snug -rrb- fit for the thinkpad x # i like that the laptop is protected from rubbing against the zipper i also like that there are straps to use as carrying handles i would like the carrying handle straps to completely extend under and around the laptop inside the case for extra durability and security while carrying a slight looseness in the staps would still allow the neoprene to stretch
everything was good package : good delivery : good product : good customer service : good satisfaction : good fit to lg p # : perfect although width can be reduced a bit for this computer overall : good . <unk> :
bought it for my # . # & # # ; thinkpad x # fits very well , i ordered built ny # & # # ; sleeve too but like this one better becuase it is less bulkier but still protects my laptop as the seller says you can use the sleeve as a mousepad too the handles hidden inside the bag are nice additions , although i do n't think i will use that feature often highly recommend it for x # , x # users since it is very hard to find a nice sleeve that fits those # . # & # # ; laptops
poor quality material , creases easily and permanently , colors fade after just a few months it was relatively inexpensive so i threw it away about # months after i got it - not a big loss but i wish it was higher quality
just remember these sleeves do not protect as well as an actual bag , they are cute and fun , but do not do much to actually protect the computer and have no place for cords or
it 's a cute protective case with a unique design ... but it does not have much in the way of a carrying strap but , the foam type material should protect the laptop from minor drops and scrapes
this is great to carry my laptop in the only thing i find rather odd is that there are handles -lrb- not pictured -rrb- sewn to the inside of the sleeve so if you want to carry the sleeve by the handles you ca n't zip the sleeve up all the way i hope that makes sense since i mostly just wanted it for padding when i carried my laptop in another bag , this was fine
the colors are so vibrant i love it there are hidden straps on the inside that you can expose if needed it is so beautiful and i am constantly getting compliments on it fits # & # # ; macbook perfectly a few issues but still things that i can deal with zippers are a bit stubborn , but always end up working in the <unk> one side of the case , totoro 's eyes have weird shadows on them i thought that it was how it was supposed to be until i looked at the other side , and there was no shadow just looks a little weird , it 's probably only mine final opinion : great purchase at an amazing price
very cute , and nice material only thing is that it smells really strongly of plastic when it first arrived , and i do n't really like the fact that the handles were on the inside but all in all , very happy with
love this case so much . fits my macbook # inch perfectly . definitely recommend this case to any <unk> fan . took about # weeks to get here . no big deal though totally worth the wait
i adore this ! at first , it did have a strong odor which i was very not fond of , but it does fade it takes a bit of time , but it does i love love love this case
i was contacted afterwards thanking me for my business when i first opened this up , it did have an odd smell however , being in the fresh air made it better having this case keeps my laptop cushioned and safe
it 's cute and looks just like the picture however , if you are not a fan of <unk> colors i suggest you do n't get it the coloring can lend it to look dirty sometimes otherwise i have gotten quite a few compliments on it and i have no real complaints
same issue as everyone else it 's <unk> too big for the laptop it advertises to fit , which is too bad because it 's one of the nicest looking ones i 've seen
it 's not for macbook pro # `` it could potentially damage your laptop save your money ! look also not that great as it appears in the picture looks like someone already used it and returned ! go to this video file for more details
i chose this <unk> because it was listed as ` like new ' in the description however , when it arrived today , it looks as if someone stuck a # & # # ; piece of duct tape on the leather and ripped it off there is no residue , but it ruined the leather on the case
first one was too big so we called and they shipped us the one with packaging that said for # `` like other reviewers , the straps to hold the lcd screen does n't come close to fitting for a # `` so i thought ok , i 'll use it on my # `` nope ... hangs out on a side by # `` so you can zip it up i do n't know what this is for but not for mac 's i suppose i do love the look , design and quality of manufacturing just do n't know why apple 's selling it on their site
while this is a lovely , high quality product , i was disappointed to find that it is too large for the macbook air in fact , i 've been to the apple store since ordering and have seen the same folio there , marketed as a macbook pro accessory -lrb- no mention of the air , for good reason -rrb- to the credit of <unk> , they were very courteous when i brought this issue to their attention even though they claim the misleading product label was beyond their control -lrb- they said that they do not control the listing ; amazon does -rrb- , they still refunded me the cost of return shipping
really nice quality but it is a bit big for the # `` macbook pro the only way the straps hold the screen of the laptop is when you fold the piece inside to make the laptop tilted for your wrist when typing should have listened to the other reviews i was attracted to the fact you could leave it in the case and when you open it the screen comes up too , it does not . still a really nice case though
my brand new computer flew off the roof of my car in an <unk> with this case days after i got it the computer was fine slightly slightly bent -lrb- but nothing broken -rrb- corner and that is it case was a little scuffed but the leather almost looks better broken in anyway
i bought this laptop sleeve for my hp laptop computer i did n't want a standard laptop computer bag which would be big and obvious to carry my laptop computer in this product is just as promised it fits my laptop computer properly and offers sufficient padded protection for it
i purchased this sleeve not too long ago , and am very happy with it my laptop is # . # & # # ; in size , so i was afraid it would be too loose it fits just fine i am a little concerned with the amount of static is has been producing lately but so far , no issues
this is a great case , very well made and it looks nice but it was a little to big for my # inch retina macbook pro there was so much extra room that i could feel my laptop moving from side to side while i was walking all in all it 's still a great case and i would recommend it to anyone that does n't have a very thin profile laptop
its not the best thing around but as a dust shield that i desired works just fine bought in conjuction with a laptop carrying case/bag . really its just a <unk> shield when not in use because of my # year old 's tendency to splatter <unk> dirt and mess everywhere slightly big for my # . # inch laptop but not a big deal at all
good materials and finish big zipper tha <unk> in and out very simple not too thin not too heavy fits acer v # , # inches as it was make for it
the sleeve was exactly what i was wanting to store and transport my laptop in to keep it safe from scratches not much room for a mouse or power supply , but if it is compact , i 'm sure it would fit stacked on top
i have purchased a number of these laptop sleeves from amazon and other companies they work great , reasonable price , easy to clean , fits most laptops and fully functional
i bought it to protect an older # . # & # # ; dell inspiron that i wanted to pack away for later use the fit was absolutely perfect it seems to be well made and offers all the protection that this pc needed packed in a box with other items i would definitely recommend this sleeve for laptops of similar size that need a little something for scratch or dust protection
i bought this for hubby 's # . # inch lap top by dell it fits snugly enough but not so snug that it 's a pain to get in and out he puts his lap top in this and then inside his backpack for work and school it provides extra protection to <unk> his <unk> <unk> product seemed comparable to $ # laptop sleeves at office max i paid $ # i think soft cover with some amount of padding but not tons of it good for students with or without a specialized ` lap top ' back pack
the case is fine , great quality but my laptop did n't fit perfectly not the product 's fault , in the end my computer did fit because i had to force it a little bit i still like it asus vivobook # . # & # #
we were looking for something to keep our laptop protected while we traveled this fit the bill perfectly fits inside our bigger bag & keeps our laptop cushioned from bangs & bumps
it is a foam like material so will somewhat protect computer it is black with a little design to it it is well worth $ # . i put black carbon fiber wrap on the front of my laptop to sort of match the material
this is a great sleeve for my new dell laptop computer i got for christmas perfect for protecting it from scratches , bumps and dirt computer slides in easy and out easy soft inside lining is great protection for computer <unk> on outside of sleeve which is <unk> lines are great to help grip the computer with sleeve on in soft and stylish very impressed with product
i purchased this in august for my # . # & # # ; dell i use my computer for school , after half a semester it was already scratched and it had dust on the screen and keys every time i opened it some review said the case fit snuggly , mine has plenty of extra room it is very good quality and solved all my problems
great sleeve for the money however this is made for larger laptops for instance , my # macbook pro had plenty of & # # ; room to grow & # # ; inside the case not a bad thing , but just not
i 've never written a bad <unk> before but here is my first one . first of all the hard case looked used , there were stains on the top part and small dots on the bottom part the keyboard cover was completely worn out . the color is much lighter than what the picture shows and the case comes out every time i try to open my laptop i absolutely hate it and this was a waste of
i was n't crazy about this case , when it arrive it had a small red stain near the apple logo , and little scratches on the inside , which made me think that it was a refurbished item it made my mba look dirty however , it was easy to put on and did a good job at protecting my mba , but it was harder to remove the case i did like the keyboard mat so i am returning it and ordering a speck case from another company -lrb- e ** y -rrb-
the hard cover covers up the mic if you video chat often it can be bad enough that you have to remove the cover every time you chat otherwise works great
it could have been better if the rubberized shell case cover did not have a crack but if it was n't for the defected shell it would have been worth the price
i think this is an okay product for its price i use skype a lot , and when i put them on , the other side can not hear my voice thus , i can not use the bottom cover ; i just put on the upper cover i love its color , it is very cute
i got this case because i loved the bold purple in the picture , but in reality it 's a much lighter , grayish lavender it protects the case well and was very easy to snap on , but it shows fingerprints like no other this would n't bother me so much if i could figure out how to get them off , but it seems every time i touch the outside of my laptop , i 'm just adding another layer of permanent dirt as for the keyboard cover , i love the way it looks and feels the color is true in the image provided however , i was really disappointed when i noticed that it muffles the audio of my macbook when i 'm listening through the speakers , as opposed to headphones also , it blocks out about # % of the light from the keypad so i ca n't type as easily in the dark it really has a great look , but now i do n't use the keyboard cover for those reasons
although the colour is not as deep on the mac as shown in the picture it looks more like lilac when fitted on the mac overall okay so far i 've only had it for # weeks
added key cover is nice the fit of the top case is not tight enough for me i keep having to check if it is snapped on
i purchased this to protect my new macbook air # `` from scratches i have a <unk> cat and i wanted to make sure this item stayed as pristine as possible for as long as i can the item is a nice shade of lilac , not a royal purple like the photo depicted but i love purple in general so i was fine with that the other reviewers tipped me off so i knew what to expect the installation process is a snap , it clips right on just like a hard shell cell phone case would i did n't have any issues the keyboard cover also slips a tad but it seemed to stabilize once i got it completely aligned i like that it all matches , and you can see the backlight perfectly well through it the apple cutout on the top cover is a nice touch , and i 'm very pleased with my purchase its a great value for the money i spent
well when i received it half of the film wrap i guess protecting it was already torn off it also had scratches on parts that were wrapped over top of it for purposes of protection it does a fabulous job , which is why i bought it , i just wish it came in supreme condition overall though i really like and it brings color to my mac easy assembly , no problem . the product is not the same in the picture because there is an apple cut out , which i like very much the keyboard color is the same color as it is in the picture , and works beautifully i have no problems typing whatsoever
i love the purple hard shell , purple keyboard protector , and soft purple cover for my new macbook air , # & # # ; each does just what it is supposed to do in the color i love
case fit very snugly on the laptop the key pad protector was a bit bulky though and required too much pressure to type on it correctly i bought the set though at such a great price that it was cheaper than the hardcase by itself -lrb- which is primarily what i was searching for -rrb- it has taken several drops from my toddler so it gets a great rating from us
the case is awesome it protects my mac and makes me feel comfortable while traveling or transporting my computer the keyboard cover took about a day to get used to but has come in handy , especially when spilling a little bit of fruit juice on my keyboard it provides the perfect amount of color to brighten a boring class
i love the material for this case the rubberized texture gives it a matte finished look that does n't make it feel or look cheap it snapped right now for me it 's true with other reviewers have said about how the laptop is a lighter purple than what is <unk> in the display photo , however , i like it and it does n't bother me i still think this is a great price for a good product
i bought two of these , they both fit great and i am happy have no idea how they will hold up for the long run , but sure a great product for the price
looks good but not that <unk> fine , good enough for the price i like the feeling of the keyboard cover the color is kind of <unk> , lighter than the color in the picture overall , nice
it pretty much looks like the way it is displayed it fits well on the mac and the keyboard gives it a nice tough the keyboard is easy to type with as well
got this for my wife , she loves it so i love it the feel is comfortable and pleasant , the color is pleasing and installation is easy it is fashionable and functional , the best of both worlds
although not super heavy duty , this case is great and protective for regular use the keyboard cover makes it kinda hard to type , but it 's keeping my computer nice and clean and safe from any outside effects nice and soft and a great color
the case and keyboard cover came just as described and i absolutely love them although , the case can be difficult to put on and remove i am still very happy with it
great purchase for the price came in good packaging , included bubble wrap the case fits very well on my macbook air it 's not loose or too tight very easy to put on the purple is not as dark but it 's still pretty i love that it has # foot pads on the bottom of the case the keyboard cover fits perfect i was worried that the backlighting from my keyboard would not show through but it does keyboard cover does slow down typing speed but you get used to it
i thought i reviewed this already but i guess it wants more look i 'm sure if you own a macbook you looking for a way to protect it this helps , but it 's not perfect but i 'm giving it # stars anyway
the key is to put on the shells by clipping on the from first and then snapping the rear into place the finish is rubberized , allowing for a good grip on my macbook air the keyboard cover is a solid fit and great protection it just lays into place
cover and silicon keyboard cover came quickly -lrb- # hours -rrb- after order however , top cover had some damage to it it has n't harmed the structure , but has a discoloration which is aesthetically <unk> so far -lrb- about # weeks in -rrb- , product is working well
the case was slightly difficult to put on and does n't seem to offer much protection , but it does look nice the keyboard protector takes a little bit of getting used to ; it 's a bit difficult to type on also , after just two weeks , the color is beginning to wear off of the spacebar
i know the picture shows a keyboard cover and a case , but i only got the shell it 's the only part i wanted anyways , but i was still a little sad the case itself is good this one has the apple logo cut out , and i tend to get junk and lint from my backpack in it i prefer the ones that do not have the cutout however , the case is an awesome color , and stays in place keeps the shell safe , and free from scratches when hauling it back and forth from <unk>
i 've had the case about # months & at first i really liked it i do n't use the keyboard cover because it 's annoying to type with it on , and also the letters do n't line up quite right i did n't really care about the keyboard cover though , i mostly just wanted the case like i said , at first i did quite like it , it 's thin & does n't add bulk to the macbook air but after a few months the plastic has cracked around all of the clips that hold it on i do n't think it 's going to be long before it becomes unusable
the case is a nice fit , seems sturdy , just as expected the plastic keyboard overlay is a waste , though makes the keys feel sloppy and reduces my typing accuracy color is much brighter than expected i had hoped for light blue , but it 's darker / more saturated than it showed on my screen
so , i love the color of the case the key board skin looks nice , too , but is a bit hard to get used to even though i only wanted the case and keyboard skin , i 'm a bit disappointed that i never received the cleaning cloth or the <unk> unfortunately , i noticed a small stain on my case it 's not that noticeable but i would prefer it to be & # # ; stainless anyways , i like how the case fits perfectly to my mac it 's nice and simple
i just got mine , and i love how easy it is to snap into place , and it fits my new # <unk> # -inch macbook air really well the keyboard cover does take a little getting used to because it makes the keyboard & # # ; thicker , if that makes sense for me i 've noticed that it 's <unk> down my typing speed just a tad , but i do n't know if it 's something that 'll just take some getting used to and also , it does cover up the lighted keyboard a little bit , so if you find yourself relying on that feature a lot , you might want to try to find a clear cover for me personally , coming from a # <unk> macbook , i do n't care all that much overall it seems to be working out pretty well , though for this price , you really ca n't go wrong
the case looks really nice it was surprisingly easy to install the keyboard cover is easy to type on ; i had expected not to even use it , but i put it on just to see how it would look , and have left it on it looks great i was the first person in our office to get a cover -lrb- we all got new macbook airs in august -rrb- and everybody loved it so much that we all have them now , in different colors this <unk> has cut out the apple logo , which looks much better than the brands that cover it this may sound silly , but the blue keyboard is very cheerful to look at i recommend this product without reservation
i was looking for a stylish way to carry my laptop and paperwork i saw this set and it looked as though it would be a functional bag when it arrived i was surprised at the quality of the bag it is strong and sturdy , and <unk> looks great i highly recommend it
i love these bags the main bag fits books notebooks folders and more very nicely then it has another zipper pocket for keeping smaller items more organized the other bag is great if i just need my tablet or laptop and a folder for the day or paired with the bigger bag the small accessory case is great for all my chargers for my computers or cell phone and it matches the bags i really loved the price too of course the set should be at least # dollars highly recommend for class or business or even travel as a carry on
this set is very trendy , very chic , and very convenient ive had it for a few months now and i finally decided to write a review on it because it is still holding up to part this was honestly one of the best purchasing decisions i have made in a very long time so stop looking and buy like it <unk> did you wont regret it
i love this bag ! it fits my laptop with room to spare it has several compartments it looks like a regular purse and can be used for travel i love it and would definitely buy it again if your looking for a cute laptop carrier , i highly recommend this
it is a dollar store quality product this piece of plastic would snap off so easily by itself , how on earth it is going to protect my lap top . it is a very thin plastic that would snap into your lap top i payed # dollars for this its not cheap , i replaced with other
i have returned # of these due too poor glue holding the little rubber feet on the third one still has the feet falling off but it took just over a month this time so no more warranty i will not be buying this brand again the rubber on the plastic case also rubs off on the edges which does n't look attractive later on
the case was good for about # months then it developed a crack on left corner for minimal use , never dropped . it also developed a crack near bottom to the feet the rubber feet fell off as well pretty fast very dissatisfied with this product will not buy again , unless my product was a lemon people seem to have better reviews
unfortunately , under very light use , this skin broke after one year the material on the sides of the skin is very thin and brittle it cracked easily i would not purchase this item again
