this bag is cute and a very good value for the money i have received many compliments on it i use it with my # . # laptop but a bigger one would fit good there is also alot of room to carry other things , like a charger , papers , magazines ect
it 's everything i thought it would be i have a large bag for overnight work and this one is perfect for when i just need to take my laptop , it 's still spacious enough for a binder and a couple other thing it has great style
i loved this bag from the moment i saw it - it 's not the same old boring black computer bag it 's lightweight and roomy enough to hold my laptop in it 's padded compartment plus files , magazines , snacks and other small essentials it could n't really hold all my power cords though - i have to pack those separately when i travel the fun print made me smile every day - it 's a little girly , but not so much to be <unk> unfortunately , the bag has n't held up over time -lrb- made it almost a year ! -rrb- and the stitching has ripped and the handles cracked but i used it nearly every day for my train commute and air travel - so it was definitely worth the extremely reasonable price i 'm going to look for something a little tougher - but i 'd recommend this for anyone looking for something fun , pretty and light use
i had done an extensive search for a nice and comfortable bag for my laptop and i came across this one on amazon and ordered it when i got it , i was very pleased with the quality and loved the colors i highly recommend
i was looking for a laptop bag since the original one from hp was heavy and boring and i wanted something stylish as always amazon was my choice and this bag fit my bill perfectly i bought it before christmas so i 've been using it for a little over # months and it still looks great and is holding up well for the price i 'd be happy if i use it for a year if you are looking for a fun , stylish <unk> bag then go for this
i love the color , the style and the components inside it is compact at the same time flexible i am able to carry it several ways such as in hand or over shoulders i am glad i purchased
good product and works really well for what i purchased it for well <unk> i would purchase from this company again i really like this case <unk> hold 's several items i needed it for
the title says that this case is for a # inch macbook it is , but it is also for a # inch mac book i am sure they sell this same bag listed under the # in cases as well the case itself is nice and i think it will do but there is at least two inches of wiggle room that the computer can slide around inside it is all about getting a sell so that is why they do this i am dissapointed in them it would be nice if the title said what it is such as a # inch case
great fit for my sony viao very well made one especially nice feature that most sleeve do not have is that when you zip the zipper , a protective cloth <unk> below the zipper track also closes to protect the edges of the laptop hence , the laptop does not rub and become scratched against the zipper track lastly , i honestly did n't think i 'd like the handles , but i have changed my mind -- they provide better utility and handling of the bag my only issue is the bag does not have and outside pouch for accessories such as the power cord and the <unk> ` brick , ' usb , etc .
i bought # different covers for my # `` mac book pro and this was the winner the sizing is correct , it fits a mouse and power cord and it is compact it is also a handsome , protective case i 'll get another for my boyfriend
thick walls , reinforced bottom , cushy handles , and a convenient zippered side pocked all make this a great value for my # & # # ; macbook air very attractive and professional design as well the # & # # ; - # & # # ; case is the one i actually received instead of the # & # # ; case , but i prefer it having a bit more space
its just the right size for macbook pro # `` , has a belt strap on the other side to slip down onto a roller board bag handle there is room for the charger inside and a mouse its very well made , i do n't like bags that are too bulky , too big for the laptop , wasted space , this is just right for the # `` macbook i would buy again when this wears out , but its very well made , i 've had mine for # years now , traveling
i got a case logic sleeve made for a # `` macbook pro and it was way too big i bought this one based on the reviews saying it fit perfectly and they were right the sleeve fits my # `` macbook pro perfectly and has a nice firm padding inside that seems to cushion the computer pretty well the extra pocket on the back fits plenty of stuff including the full length stock apple power cord the handles are a nice touch as well making it easier to carry i am # % happy with this purchase and would highly recommend it to anybody with a # `` mac
when i got this bag in was the wrong color -lrb- i ordered black and got pink -rrb- it has a plastic bottom instead of the cute feet in the picture looks and feels like a cheap diaper bag not a computer tote sending it back i will never order this brand again
the inside pockets and the laptop compartment were sewn upside down so how can i put things there if the opening is at the bottom how could it has passed the quality control if there is any are they <unk> i ca n't return it because there is no return label maybe because it is not qualified for return i was supposed to order the upright <unk> so i am thankful i did not i regret buying the item delivered to me
i love all the pockets on the inside and the bag is the perfect size for my # inch laptop , but it does n't hold its shape at all that means the pockets on the inside require you to use both hands -lrb- one to hold the floppy pocket open and the other to put in whatever you 're putting into the pocket the bag itself <unk> over too because it has no structure so far , its well made ... no problems with tearing or weak seams overall , i think it satisfies the need to have something large enough for my laptop size , but i think the construction could have been better not bad for the price though
i was initially disappointed when i received this bag i thought it looked too big i wanted to return it , but they said they would charge me the free shipping cost , and i would have to pay to ship it back not wanting to be out $ # , i just kept the bag it is really a good bag it does look better in the picture than it actually is despite my initial disappointment in the bag and company that sold it , i am really happy with the bag it is very durable and nice on the inside with plenty of pockets , a place for the laptop in the middle with a strap and a place for books on both sides
the bag is great , however it is a bit on the wider side and i wish the insides were of a lighter colour to easily find items but the fact that is it <unk> , is wonderful
this bag totally exceeded my expectations the photos do not do it justice the quality is great , design is very cute this actually fits my # . # `` widescreen dell laptop -lrb- note : the only issue i have with this bag is that it does fit my laptop 's width , but not the <unk> so it 's sticking above the foam pads about # inches . the inside of the bag is separated into # section ... the middle has thick foam that i feel very comfortable protecting my laptop there are areas to put your cords or other items with smaller slots on one side and then on the other # rd side there is an inside zipper and # more larger slots there is small slot on the <unk> of the bag that looks small but is actually very deep all the way to the bottom of the bag
this product is so fantastic . it holds everything that i need to bring with me to school ... everything seller has fantastic ratings and it is well earned i love the bag and can not wait to order more
i searched all over for a feminine looking yet professional laptop tote that would fit my widescreen laptop , cord , and all of the paperwork i regularly carry with me to client meetings i fell in love with this bag and find that i can fit everything i need every day into it one huge bonus for me is that the shoulder straps are a little bit longer , so it is comfortable to carry this bag even when it is full i 've had mine for # years with no problems it shows just a little bit of wear , but everything is intact and the sturdy fabric seems like it will last for many years highly recommend this bag for daily use
very cute computer tote ! my daughter loves the damask print the tote does have an insert to <unk> computer in between still roomy enough for a wallet , a few notebooks and other stuff laptop does not slide around in bag due to laptop slide in price was very good
i bought it to carry my # `` toshiba laptop , it fits perfectly and even has an elastic strap to keep it on its place on top of that , its perfect to carry all sort of things i 'm a teacher , so i have to carry around <unk> of folders and lose papers it has many pockets of different sizes and the quality is excellent
i love this bag it has a pocket for me to slide the laptop in and room on either side to store papers and whatever else i may need i am very happy with it
i just took a trip to ireland for # days this tote held everything i needed with all the pockets it matched my carry on bag by <unk> <unk> so very functional & very stylish
as a network technician , finding a feminine laptop bag that fits a # . # & # # ; laptop is like finding a needle in a <unk> , yet here it is it does fit my # & # # ; just fine , although i would agree with one other reviewer it does need more padding around the laptop area as long as your mindful of how you treat your bag , while your pc is in it , you should be fine also the manufacturer has changed the design just slightly so be aware , it does not have feet any longer but a layer of clear plastic -lrb- like from grandma 's couch -rrb- over the bottom of it this is by no means a reflection on the seller the seller was great my bag got here in no time at all and it was brand new in tack and well packaged this is a great bag and it does have room for more than just your pc , lots of little gadget pockets and places to put things i highly recommend it
this computer tote looks amazing you would never know it is anything but a fashionable bag , but inside it is all business for all my work items it is well padded and protects my laptop completely
this bag is very roomy , has # large divided sections and pockets on both sides of the interior the middle section is padded on both sides and closes with a velcro strap so your laptop is very protected also the entire bag closes with a zipper the bag itself is lightweight and really classy looking -lrb- not like a shopping bag -rrb- love it so much , i ordered one for my daughter in brown with green dots <unk> <unk> dots computer tote thanks for offering such quality for an affordable price
very sturdy and really cute travels well and easily fits into my carry-on with the laptop when i need to consolidate bags at the airport this bag has held up very well
this is a great bag i have a # inch hp lap top and needed a bigger bag than i could find in the stores this one works great it has slots and pockets inside for accessories inside there are three sections the middle is the most padded and has a velcro strap you can put over to `` lock `` your lap top in place the entire bag also zips shut i have even used this bag for interviews to carry my portfolio it looks great without being too girly quality and useful and cute
whoever designed this product is either stupid or a fool the base of the macbook air fits into the lower portion with the upper portion hanging a better design would be to have a sleeve so that the monitor also fits into the sleeve exactly like the lower portion i am surprised that such a basic thing was missed out by the people who have designed it the quality of the leather is good , however for $ # . # you would expect a better product
i would agree with one of the other reviews , the case is good leather but its doesnt make sense they would design it without some kind of sleeve for the monitor even if it was a elastic bank to at least keep the case from flopping over the way it does . that is the one disappointing thing about it , otherwise it would have been perfect i love macs but i hate the metal feel of them so anytime i buy a mac product i am quick to purchase a case to keep it protected and also i dont have to feel it the $ # . # price tag is a little steep for a product that lacks in service just be aware of that when you purchase the case , the the case does not cover the monitor when in use as you can see by the pictures there is no attachment of the top portion of the case to the monitor
very nice quality product overall i am pleased with the case the only downside is that the monitor has no way of being attached to the case as stated in previous reviews of which i was aware i remedied this with some small thin velcro pads i do not mind the adhesive velcro attachments to the back of the monitor it does also add some bulk to your mba which is an acceptable trade off for protection and the nice portfolio binder look and feel
took a chance on this even though the other reviews mentioned that the top case cover didnt hook up to the top of the computer however , i have to say that i dont find this to be a serious problem and this is one of the finest quality pieces i have purchased in a very long time would give it five stars if there was some way to resolve the top case issue , all i can think of is a couple of velcro dots , but i dont really want to attach them to the aluminum
perfect fit , nice magnetic latch overall a beautiful protective case it would have been nice to have the back of the macbook air adhere to the inside of the case -- i used a small bit of velcro to do the job for me i am pleased with the purchase the case looks good , feels good and does not add much bulk to the macbook
this is a very nice product in construction and appearance functionality was lacking , in my opinion , in that the upper sleeve was not attached to the macbook air screen as a result , i had two # `` strips of elastic sewn to the upper corners to hold everything in place i have attached a photo overall , i am very pleased with this purchase and would recommend it to others it arrived in a timely fashion and is a very nice leather construction
i have used this case for my air for over # years now and it has saved my device numerous times i gives the extra protection , without having to be enclosed in a full zippered case will purchase again when i upgrade to # & # # ; air this month
i can not understand why <unk> air did not show apple what an <unk> product this is it protects completely while shielding the front and entire outside , anyhow , it is
<unk> leather case for apple new macbook air # `` - book type -lrb- black stylish protector for macbook air it fits perfectly giving ample protection yet still shows the beauty of your mac highly recommended for macbook air owners
if you plan on using more than a laptop , ipad and something to write on be prepared it is a very tight fit and no room for my b & w headphones -lrb- p # -rrb- you can use only earbuds to travel with it protects your laptop really well , but for all practical purposes this particular bag is not suitable for me
the bag would be more useful if it also had a strap to hold it on your roller luggage while traveling through the airport the top handle is not wide enough to go over most luggage handles
professional looking bag , fits my ipad , sony vaio , iphone power cords and <unk> adapter the only con is that if you have a case on your ipad the bag becomes abit tight around the edges other then that , looks great and professional
like the bag it is a tight fit for my lenovo # & # # ; with extended battery but works well and is loosening up place for everything not a big fan of the velcro and this is the one area i do n't like when i need to get something in the middle of a meeting overall an excellent bag
love everything about this bag except the plastic connections to the straps if i place an expensive laptop in the bag i want something stronger than plastic holding everything in place i cut off the plastic and put in some metal carabiner clips
i use this everyday to carry a # & # # ; macbook retina everywhere i go the retina has some wiggle room , but a macbook pro would fit perfectly the case has a padded and soft lined pouch for my ipad the accessory pouch is large enough to comfortably fit my macbook cord , a small mouse , and several extra cords , chargers , headphones , etc . it has two additional full length pouches -lrb- one inside and one outside the flap -rrb- that work great for file folders the bag is perfect , with two minor complaints there is an internal flap over the laptop pouch which i think is overkill so i leave it tucked in also , the velcro on the main flap is extensive , so very noisy when opening the bag
i 've been using this <unk> for over a year and it has stood the test of time weather and heavy use have not <unk> it it has ample space for all of the usual laptop accessories , and can accommodate a few magazines with ease i 've also been caught in the rain a few times and it has kept the laptop dry i even dropped it once , from a height of nearly two feet , with no damage to the laptop in short , it does what its supposed to and looks fairly good doing it
i got this along with some suitcases in the same series i kept the suitcases , but returned the pack unlike most travel packs , it had very few small pockets and organizing features , but pretty much just # large pockets so it might be fine for clothing , but not for business travel
i found little to dislike about this bag it is a good size and feels comfortable on my back there are n't a whole lot of different compartments , but what 's there is adequate for my use it is an attractive complement to the rollaboard suitcases in the series
many , many , backpacks to chose from but this one 's a value and standout <unk> i am replacing a older version that was stolen a few days ago on a trip to tx -lrb- <unk> -rrb- my fault for not putting it in the trunk of my vehicle ! highly durable and has many compartments for your travel needs -- really great for those that travel light they -lrb- travelpro -rrb- have many in their line to chose from i have several of their models and they stand up to much use and abuse to bad the thief wo n't get to all the places that backpack has been
it 's so nice durable , the right size , nice looking , not too many small zippered compartments which is nice for me , comfortable on the back but works nicely when fit onto the matching rollers it probably is n't any better or worse than many backpacks that most people already own and i 'm not sure i would have bought it without buying the matching rollers but i 'm really glad i did it 's a really high quality pack , great for a carryon or a under the seat carryon . really light !
i chose this backpack for two reasons ; first it was compact yet it appeared to house all the needed protection and multiple compartments for my computer and other electronic devices , cables and gadgets secondly , it was the companion piece to the <unk> <unk> bold # inch roller bag which is a great piece of luggage the backpack slid down over the handle of the roller bag making a compact traveling unit i am proud to report after my first international trip , this backpack worked out perfectly i would recommend it to anyone
i 'm gon na make this short i ordered tenba expecting some quality and durability it arrived and i was really happy the bag itself looks sturdy and has really some nice compartments for the camera and laptop and some other things but after just a week of use , the metal joint in the strap began slipping until finally it snapped almost dropping the bag containing my laptop and camera inside
received tenba messenger bag as gift for a trip to disney world after # days of use a seam on the insert had split and the velcro that runs around the inside of the insert had come unsewn on day # the strap broke with my # d mark ii and my canon # inside luckily i was able to grab the bag before it hit the ground i will never buy a tenba product again , i value my camera gear to much
this bag is much thicker and stiffer than i expected from the photographs i had seen of the product i returned the product since it was not the compact answer to my <unk> i 'd hoped for it is certainly rugged and will hold plenty of gear , but it is not the dream bag for carrying photo equipment around all day in my opinion i did not like the materials or construction of this bag
it 's a decent bag , but it 's much larger than the description suggests unlike my older tenba messenger , which is a soft sided bag with a padded insert , this bag has rigid sides so it always takes the full # inch width it 's really more like a talk gadget bag that 's a bit taller no one will think you are carrying a briefcase , it screams camera bag the larger one with the pull out insert was better designed
my # & # # ; lenovo laptop fits so tightly that i 'd have to say any given # & # # ; would only have a # chance of fitting if you think yours is even slightly on the thick side , forget about it there are plenty of pockets , but they are also snugly stitched such that even a fat marker seems a challenge
took this bag to italy for being a tourist during the day fits everything you need to be comfortable also great for bringing <unk> airplane if you 're already carrying a tablet or small -lrb- # & # # ; -rrb- laptop in the bag , the one thing it 's not sized right for is magazines , notepads , or newspapers study built , looks great
i received the bag a week ago as soon as i opened it , i was amazed with the orange color i had bought honestly , it 's much better than what i imagined it would be like then , the space distribution is brilliant , with perfect space for a full size dslr with a professional lens on it -lrb- canon # d with canon # l -rrb- , and an <unk> # `` i still have tons of space free after i introduce the <unk> mentioned items into the bag however , the shoulder strap that came with the bag broke # days after using it normally it 's not a nice feeling to be walking on the sidewalk and suddenly watching your camera bag , with fragile items inside , crashing against the concrete floor tenba should have better quality control with that anyways , if you buy this <unk> distributed bag , know that you might have to buy a # dollars shoulder strap in order to efficiently use it
i ordered this tenba bag for a cruise , mainly because i did not want to lug around my camera backpack the mini proved to be the perfect size allowing me to pack my dslr and three lenses , plus other camera gear without the bulk of a <unk> camera bag the features are great and the bag is narrow , as the description says : & # # ; messenger bag & # # ; , allowing me to easily store it under an airline seat the materials seem first rate finally , the color selection is extensive enough that with the brown one , it did n't look like i was sporting a & # # ; man purse & # # ;
very well made product , was a little too big for my needs this would be great if you do a lot of traveling just hand them your whole bag with all the equipment that should n't go through the x-ray
i put my dslr in here , my ipad , lenses , flash , filters ... you name it it 's a great bag sturdy , easy to open and access your camera fast love this bag
this is really well built plenty of space for my <unk> m # , ipad , and # inch macbook air , along with a lot of gadgets for a recent <unk> boat vacation i almost wish they had a smaller size , as i have space left over without all the extra gadgets
this bag exceeded my wants in terms of needing something pass & eacute ; for transportation i 'm able to fit my # & # # ; mbp , ipad , and all camera equipment and then some comfortable in
purchased this bag to hold my d # and # lens and my ipad everything fits perfect and the bag is comfy lots of support and a ton of pockets for anything you could think of this will be my bag of choice for a while
so happy with the camera bag - very well made and fits my micro four thirds camera and # lenses with room to spare specially like the fact that you can access your equipment from the zippered top padded spacing for an ipad too plenty of outside pockets for extra little things perfect size for toting around for an all day photo shoot
i really love this bag so far i have a canon rebel with three lenses , which all easily fit , plus i keep some cords and books , the charger and extra battery in it i love to have my camera accessible , so wanted messenger bag style my favorite part is the quick access zipper on top so i can get to my camera without having the open the whole bag
the tenba mini messenger bag is very well made , comfortable and has plenty of room i do feel that sizing this as a & # # ; mini & # # ; is very misleading as the bag is far from mini in the main compartment my <unk> fits along with an <unk> lens , two other lenses and a <unk> and shoot camera and that leaves room enough for at least another lens the other compartments have enough room for chargers , cables and other miscellaneous items then it fits my macbook pro in the laptop slot too coming from a crumpler # million dollar home , this bag rocks it has more room , is still feels like it was built and designed with pride and does n't scream steal me , i 'm a camera i purchased the bag in brown and it 's a really neat color , i had considered the orange but felt it might be too bright
i had the intention of commuting with this bag , but i actually never used it it came wrinkled , scratched , with a hole in it , and with the tags detached it was obviously used and i am returning it tomorrow i will never buy another ebags branded anything again i will also say that the magnetic closure seems useless if you try to lift the bag by the handle , the flap opens up enough to spill everything out this is more of a huge purse than a laptop messenger
the leather is nice and thick it 's a good price however , the inside material is very crinkly and makes a <unk> sound , which i find annoying i thought there was still some paper in it , but there is n't
this bag has a handle , but it is not centered at the top of the bag , so it is extremely difficult if not impossible to carry the bag by hand for more than a few seconds the pocket space in the bag works well - which is nice however , the bag can not be sealed shut and the material on the inside is rather cheap and makes a weird <unk> sound and also there are notable & # # ; ebags & # # ; <unk> on the bag , which is kind of annoying
the leather is kind of soft so it 's easy for it to be scratched . still serves its purpose as a professional looking messenger bag . the straps could be more comfortable too
i bought this bag for my cousin who was starting medical school she wanted a bag that looked a bit more formal than for school she loves it very much and was very happy with the compartments and quality and feel of the leather this was <unk> the ` look ' she wanted ! great buy
nice leather and good attention to detail bag has velcro closure to secure laptop it easily fit a # . # laptop it it lightly padded in the laptop partition magnetic closures keep the messenger flap closed the only draw back , if you can call it one , is the shoulder strap is fabric and not leather but that alone does <unk> from a fine inexpensive proper laptop bag
i love this laptop it is a very classic bag , i look forward to it aging and getting that character of a well loved bag the only thing i do not like is the rather noisy interior
this bag is well made and has a ton of space i <unk> loved the way it is constructed and the many compartments . why not five stars the magnetic closure is weak when you pick up the bag , the flap flies open and thus makes it awkard to wear the bag unless the flap is against your body if this bag had a better closure , magnetic or otherwise , it would be a five star bag
i bought this for my grown son to use everyday he had <unk> the backpack he used to use i was so pleased when this arrived by mail i was very happy with the quality of this bag i will be giving this to him on his birthday
this cover was way too big for my macbook air # `` and the material was stiff enough that the air <unk> around inside it even with it zipped i sent it back and got another sleeve ez la robe sleeve for macbook air # `` # or newer <unk> have no idea why the same company could <unk> on one item and fail so badly on another which is supposed to be essentially the same thing the only good thing about this cover is the <unk>
this case doubles the thickness of the macbook air on the thick end , and more than doubles it on the thin end so i 'd estimate that it increases the total volume by around # x since i felt the point of the macbook air was to have something that does n't take up much space , i returned this item and replaced it with a thinner neoprene case on the plus side , the material is very protective - crushing then slowly expanding , which does a good job to absorb impacts so if you primarily care about protection and not size then this would be a good case
i 've been looking for the right sleeve for my macbook air # `` , and came across with this item already own the `` incase sleeve `` incase neoprene sleeve for macbook air # `` - black - cl # which i got at great price in a local store i think that case will be good for travelling , and if i want to keep my item light , yet the one i 'll use in a daily base is this -lrb- be . ez sleeve -rrb- product it simply protects my computer much more , it 's easier to use , especially with the `` speck cover `` i ca n't ask for more i also got it at a great price , since it was an used item -lrb- did n't notice it at all -rrb- i recommend this product to anyone who owns a macbook air # . # ``
the protection this cover is simply the best possible no other cover is so good had one for my macbook pro for over # <unk> and it 's still perfect just bought this new one for my new macbook air
i got this for my wife to use with her # `` macbook air , and she reports that it is an excellent sleeve for giving her computer that little bit of extra protection without making it <unk> bulky it fits the computer very snugly , but is n't difficult to put it on or take it off it 's very useful when putting the mba into a larger bag for commuting or traveling it 's also useful just for discretely carrying the mba around with this sleeve , people really ca n't tell whether you 're carrying an ultraportable computer or a simple paper notepad i 'm giving it # stars instead of # only because its functions are so limited one wonders if clever designers could have figured out a way to add a small secondary sleeve or pouch to hold a pen , a few papers or maybe <unk> that said , it does one thing , and it does it reasonably well please note that while the outside of the sleeve looks black in most pictures , in person it actually is an extremely dark blue the inside is bright pink , of course , but you ca n't see it when the sleeve is closed
this produce is very well made and seems to be tough the look and feel is professional enough to carry the mac air around in a business environment -lrb- meetings , etc -rrb- but also durable enough to be thrown into a back pack when on holiday it could benefit from a small separator inside to allow the power cables to be kept for longer <unk> as i 'm concerned they may scratch the laptop , but it is the best of several i 've tried i would recommend this to people who want a light , attractive and practice pouch
i bought my mb air # `` and was searching for a case i did n't want to pay -lrb- again -rrb- for an incase , so looked on amazon and found this from the pictures , you would think that the case would be similar to an incase -lrb- i.e . soft case that is floppy when not in use - nope it is <unk> than i had been expecting , which i like , as the case doubles as my lap desk when i am seated it does a solid job of protecting the computer , and really fits the definition of a sleeve i like that the colors on mine are a dark navy and the inner color is a lighter blue , so it pops against the navy a bit it does n't add too much weight to the already quite slim computer , and fits in all my bags with no problems
i travel a lot via train and airplane and this thing has worked great easy to open and close and also easy to slide in and out of a bag everyone knows what i am talking about , in airport security and you have to remove your laptops but its <unk> into your carry on bag this case is easy to slide out to open it and let it go through security and then easy to slide back into place in the bag i have n't dropped it yet , so dunno how secure it keeps it , but it has kept my laptop from getting any blemishes while traveling
this case is made of a very dense sort of memory foam it feels very strange , when you push on it the material <unk> and then slowly -lrb- over the course of minutes -rrb- returns to its original shape from a physics point of view this is an excellent idea the idea is that foam will absorb the impact rather than your computer that said , it is still a slipcase , which you may want to put inside of something else , especially as there is no room for anything else inside the case the case is very thin and obviously designed specifically for the macbook air which fits nicely but if you are planning on using it for another computer it needs to be also very thin i can just barely shove my asus # inch netbook into it , but getting it back out is a struggle
the la robe mbair is a unique slipcase that is made of a memory foam material -lrb- similar to the memory foam pillows -rrb- at first glance it does n't seem to be well padded but once you feel the case you realize that it is more firm than an ordinary `` plush `` slipcase this extra firmness really allows the mbair to protect your macbook air from bumps and possibly the occasional drop -lrb- though i did not test this feature ! -rrb- it is well constructed and provides an attractive solution to protect your prized macbook air *** plus points include : *** - good protection from minor bumps - good construction - can work for some non-apple laptops that meet the size requirements -lrb- thin & small *** negative points : *** - no pockets - a bit thin but protects well - a tad on the expensive side
this is a very good-looking sleeve , and to the eye one would think it was neoprene but instead it is an odd , semi-rigid type of very hard memory foam a tag on the package lets one feel it first , but unfortunately that 's not an option online it 's super snug and adds almost no weight the zipper appears to be far enough on the outside not to scratch the macbook , but there is no inner fabric lip to ensure this just be clear that you are basically getting a hard case without hard-case protection i would recommend trying to check this out in a <unk> store before <unk> online
the be . ez laptop case is designed specifically to fit the new , # `` macbook air additionally , for my use , it also accommodates an ipad the case is padded by a layer of dense memory foam , which makes it a good option for protecting one 's laptop from the occasional bump and bruise it 's a great option for protecting one 's laptop or ipad when in a bag or backpack from other items in one 's bag : other books , pens/pencils , etc . the case is n't very thick , so if it 's going to be used as a primary form of protection , one should still exercise caution i 'd expected the case to be made of neoprene , so the memory foam was a pleasant surprise and really sets this laptop case apart from others available on the market the external padding is a black , with a thick , sturdy zipper in a contrasting lighter pink the colors available are stylish and complement the sliver of an air very nicely
i am really impressed with this product the material is interesting - it is a very resilient foam that absorbs impacts , sort of like a memory foam <unk> for your laptop the seams appear to be very well made , with no sloppy stitching or rough edges the interior is very soft , and wo n't scratch your laptop case this particular model fits the # inch macbook air perfectly it 's loose enough so that the laptop slides in and out easily , but it 's tight enough that the laptop does n't slide around this is a quality product - it appears to be well-made , and designed to last a long time the <unk> heel might be the zipper , but all in all this appears to be a good investment in protection for your mba
i had no idea that the material it 's made out of was memory foam-like it 's really a great case compact but protective -- i 've actually dropped my mac a few times in this and had no damage this is something the apple store would charge # $ for
case fits perfectly , zipper is not small and flimsy , but a decent size and seems sturdy i do n't imagine it breaking anytime soon the zipper is also out of the way of the direct opening so it does not scratch the laptop this case is not hard but not like a slip cover either , its a nice balance between the two <unk> its memory foam is the perfect amount of thickness , i do n't think it adds too much thickness to the laptop , i can carry it in a large purse no problem , and it is super light the only thing im not sure about is if it is water repellent . . so i would be careful around spills good case , exactly as described
i 've been using this case for my laptop and it 's been working wonderfully i love the <unk> material ; it 's soft and comfortable to hold , yet still provides adequate protection i particularly like the way be ez designed the case , with the bright colors that are still subtle and stylish it 's appropriate for both work and a more casual environment i 've found it difficult to find many other cases that look both professional and stylish the case is also very lightweight and does n't add too much bulk , as other cases can i also occasionally use this case for my ipad ; pretty much whenever i 'm not using it for my laptop it fits my ipad well and also provides proper protection from the pens and loose change in my bag overall , it 's a very nice case that 's great for any occasion
while <unk> through an airport , i dropped my backpack onto a hard tile floor my unprotected macbook air was in it i was so afraid that i had damaged it thankfully , it was okay ; but i knew then that i needed to get something quickly after searching through numerous options , i selected this one it has an extra layer of padding and is very well made it 's actually very attractive , as well i am not going to do a drop test to prove that it will do the job but i think it will ; and this is an incredibly modest cost to protect my large investment in this mac
this is a great slipcase and a big plus is you do not have remove your air from the case when you go through airport security saves time and effort and protects your laptop
when i first got my macbook air in december , the cases that were available for it were few and far between i ended up having to purchase a case for a # `` laptop ; my macbook air was just lost in the case - the case was much too big for the svelte size of the mba along comes this case by la robe - i could n't be happier it fits my mba perfectly , and also provides a good deal of protection the neoprene lining is such that you can actually make fingerprints in it a la memory foam with the mba fitting snugly inside of it , you know that you are getting good protection , and also , the case will not take up much room in a backpack or large purse i highly recommend this case
i love this case . fits the # inch air perfectly . it is snug -lrb- you can shove your charger in the sleeve ! as you should n't anyways -rrb- the <unk> is great just buy it
this macbook air -lrb- mba -rrb- sleeve fits perfectly , snug enough that the laptop will not shift around too much but not too tight where one might struggle with it to get the laptop out designed specifically to fit the mba the sleeve does add some thickness to the width but for cushion in case you drop the laptop i love the simple chic design be-ez is a french company i was trying to scope out the reviews before purchasing and came across their website . -lsb- . -rsb- <unk> only gripe is that i wish they had their other designs for the mba on amazon
this gives you solid protection the inner ` memory foam ' provides a great bumper to the outside world an ipad # fits nicely in this case when you want that type of protection the zipper is solid and easy to grasp my only observation is that it is a bit bulky ... but that 's what gives it the protection i use it when i need that extra peace of mind
fits the latest -lrb- as of dec # -rrb- # inch macbook air perfectly very dense foam <unk> the computer and certainly gives the impression that it is really protecting the computer - although i have n't done a drop test it 's easy to get the macbook in and out of the case the zipper seem sturdy i would definitely recommend this case
had this a week and really like it the sleeve is made from a material more like memory foam than anything , and it seems to be more protective that the typical neoprene ones out there the case looks good , fits well , and the zipper is kept well away from your macbook air so i do not feel scratches will come from using this product
