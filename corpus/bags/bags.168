this notebook -lrb- mini laptop -rrb- is adorable not to diminish it in a man 's eyes , but it 's classy looking , slim and fits in your hand easily the set up was a cinch , and anyone -lrb- even a <unk> person -rrb- could turn it on , follow the quick set up guide and be playing with it within minutes
its a good basic netbook with not that many <unk> it has a nice grip surface so gloss and fingerprints is not a concern it comes with win # starters which is kind of s bummer and you 'll have to upgrade to win # home to add an external disc drive but for under # its a great value do n't expect to play too many games on it or run too many programs the cpu is a little slow be sure to upgrade the ram to # gb
i 've had my toshiba netbook for a few days now and i 've really been enjoying it the first thing i did after receiving it was install the ubuntu # . # operating system in the place of the windows # starter edition the netbook runs much smoother with the ubuntu system with the windows # system it was noticeably slower i am using my netbook as my school computer while i am going to college it fits quite nicely in my backpack it 's light enough and small enough that i hardly know it 's even there this is my first netbook i researched a while before i made the decision to make my purchase and i 'm happy to be able to say that i made a good decision with this one so , if you 're looking for a good , lightweight computer that 's very portable , i highly recommend the toshiba nb # netbook
i love my toshiba netbook toshiba is the most solid netbook on the market it has the convenience of a tablet and the real computing power of a bigger laptop i 'd recommend it to anyone foe ease and dependability
this laptop was awesome it was for my then # -year old daughter i could n't see spending tons of money on a laptop for a kid , so i go the least expensive product that had the best reviews it functions just as it should it 's <unk> than a regular sized laptop the blue is a vivid , fun color we do n't play a lot of games or anything -lrb- she uses her ipod for that -rrb- but she does use it to connect to the internet , and she has used it with netflix i did end up buying a wireless mouse for her to use with it
i bought this computer for networking with my office while travelling this is great , lightweight , easy to carry , airport friendly , etc . only drawback is that it is a little slow in function , but for the price , a great deal
slightly slow it needs more ram , other then that , its a great purchase i have always wanted a netbook , and its worth the prize it came on time as scheduled and runs pretty good i use it daily , played games reasonably well , depends on the game when i upgrade its ram , it will run perfect
this thing is perfect for me , i love it and i 'm so excited that i bought it at the exact right moment , for $ # a few days later it shot up to $ # ... and someone actually had the <unk> to try and sell one used for $ # i got it in blue because that was the least expensive color at that time people , who cares what color your netbook is ? what counts is its capability , and this little powerhouse is a gem
love this netbook i was looking for an inexpensive netbook to help with the start of my own business and my husbands ' travel needs and we both use it all the time it has a decent battery life and is perfect for moving around the house or traveling without alot of bulk
did alot of research before i picked this one had for about # months now , no problems at all i did purchase full windows # version + added memory fast , easy to <unk> love the fact it has full size keyboard would recommend to anyone .
very happy with the netbook ... windows # starter edition is kind of slow though ... it should be equipped with min # gb ram ... but over all good product , neat colour and size and weight
i love my toshiba netbook i do n't often rate an older product , but i have to say it 's lasted me for the past four years without giving me any serious problems it 's lightweight and , after four years of nonstop use , still has battery life lasting at least four hours before i need to plug it in for a <unk> the color is also eye catching and attractive i use it mainly for writing , not so much for watching videos , but even when i do so , it works very well my only quibble is that , when i first started using it , it <unk> me <unk> to upgrade to windows # it comes with the starter edition , not the whole one , so i waited it out until i managed to get a free windows # upgrade from my job take that , bill gates other than that , i have no complaints
the nb # is also a great netbook for pc enthusiasts although it comes with windows # + -lrb- <unk> -rrb- , i 've managed to uninstall that crappy os and dual boot both windows xp and ubuntu # -lsb- ... -rsb- with no complications i 've had it for # months so far and it 's solid toshiba makes excellent hardware do n't need no <unk> apple
i did a lot of home work on a lot of netbooks and this toshiba came out on top so when it came time to purchase this netbook i found and received the lowest price through amazon now that i have had a chance to use and play with my new netbook i know i made the right choice and i could n't be more pleased
i got this little machine from amazon a month back it works well for me light weight and easy to use i have no issues with it and very much like it to carry it around for everyday use and internet surfing given the price and size it is not a machine for gaming or applications that require high resources only thing i wish it had is better speakers for good sound quality i recommend this product to my <unk> and family
netbook is as described and worked great out of the box the portability of this item is wonderful and we take it everywhere battery life seems to be excellent so far also
i read a lot of the reviews before i bought this little netbook , glad i ignored most of them this is a great little gizmo , it 's not for gamers it 's not for <unk> but it 's perfect for <unk> the web , email , facebook and day to day stuff or travel to keep in touch it 's small -lrb- the keyboard takes a little <unk> -rrb- and light weight . it 's more than fast enough people who expect this to run and do all the things a desktop or full <unk> laptop do are being silly it 's not what this is for i like it a lot
i did n't think this little thing could be so powerful and fast although this is true i recommend buying # gb ram to get the fullest <unk> it is sleek , light , fast , nicely fit , and pure netbook i have tried out many computer through out my life time and this one is among one of the best ones
i found this item to be a fantastic purchase i purchased it at # : # pm on a friday and received it by # : # the next day it was very easy to set up and has been a great option for me to use at school when all the other <unk> stations are full
the color is just awesome and the rubber gripping material is a great idea the notebook is perfect for internet browsing , email and etc . the screen is very clear and the speed is pretty good too i upgraded to windows # home premium and installed # gb of memory toshiba makes good laptop computers
i bought this for my daughter , works better than expected , i 'm planning to get one for my wife too i have a toshiba satellite but this is far more faster -lrb- i added some memory to it -rrb- , works great for internet surfing and <unk>
got this for me wife as she just needs it for web surfing and few small word docs she loves the small size and portability i did upgrade the memory to # gb and added a flash drive for <unk> of # gb also windows # start works well as does office starter the free version ads are not that bad and free <unk> is nice
i have had my netbook for three weeks and after getting used to it , i have grown to really like it i like the size because i travel with a full size laptop for business and take my netbook along for personal use i did upgrade it to # gb and i think it runs a bit faster i also love the textured finish on the top it has great features and i would recommend highly to anyone looking for a # inch netbook
i purchased this netbook -lrb- over a ipad # -rrb- for work on the road the keyboard on this netbook is great , i can not type on the ipad # , not to mention this netbook was less than half the price of the ipad # i was considering the battery life is great considering i do n't have to bring a charger with me on the road i did just upgrade to the <unk> # gb ddr # memory upgrade that is well worth the $ # + price tag i would consider it a definite no brainer ** i have read reviews that the # gb upgrade will not work with windows # starter on my first windows # starter update i did encounter problems with the <unk> i switched the old # gb back in and it booted right up i then put the new # gb back in after it <unk> and no problems since after numerous windows # starter updates
i purchased the netbook for an overseas deployment i needed to do bill paying and e-mails , plus i wanted to read <unk> i found out my local library offered <unk> for <unk> online rather than take multiple electronic devices , i decided to buy the netbook , and have been able to <unk> all i want
when it comes to laptop toshiba is my brand tried , tested & awesome my budget got me on hold but when i saw a refurbished nb # i never hesitated to buy it i remember my first laptop , i bought last # in ny and it was a factory refurbished and it last for # years until the battery gave up so i trust toshiba and the seller to have this product to be a good one and hoping it will last more or less the same with my first one
this is my first netbook and i have been impressed so far when i bought it , my main concern was the keyboard layout and battery life and this netbook delivers on both counts the keyboard feels fairly close to a regular laptop keyboard , the keys are only a tad smaller but not small enough to create problems when typing the battery life also seems good so far -lrb- i 've had this only a few weeks -rrb- i am able to get prob # hours of battery life , which works for me as for the speed , it seems good -lrb- i mostly use it for browsing and emails -rrb- from this perspective , i certainly recommend this product , cheaper than a laptop and significantly easier to carry
this computer has lasted for for # years so far and though i do n't really use it anymore , it was a great , inexpensive little computer it has definitely slowed way down since i bought it but i really only needed it for a year and it served that purpose the color is very bright and vibrant , the display is nice , the keyboard is small but easy to use and comfortable no cd drive -lrb- due to size -rrb- but it 's great
this was a good purchase i wanted something very portable , and this was it the <unk> keys on the board are full size letting me type to speed the surrounding keys are downsized but that is of little concern i do research in libraries and the nb # lets me take notes easily i did upgrade to # gigs which was very easy to do and inexpensive and worthwhile battery life is good , too so far , so good
i got this netbook because i saw it got really good reviews and i needed a small little laptop to get things done for school and surfing the internet it does n't have a cd drive which is a little bit of a <unk> but it does everything i need it to do and i have had no problems with it it looks nice , light weight , built in webcam , and i also like the feel of the keyboard overall great netbook i would highly recommend it to anyone
so far -lrb- i am somewhat a <unk> -rrb- i am extremely pleased with this little gem although i have been receiving warnings from skype that it is running slow , it still seems to make skype calls ok it also works very well with netflix and the other routine functions -lrb- word processor , <unk> , internet of a pc -lrb- albeit , not as fast as my desktop with <unk> processor -rrb- i have to admit that i did not want to wait , so i bought it at bestbuy
gave it to my dad in india i set it up with a wifi router , installed with skype and <unk> all the websites he may visit regularly it works great the portability is amazing and the initial battery life is really great windows # lite is such an improvement , and so is ie # it works great on this little piece i recommend it
my # `` notebook was in the shop for all sorts of <unk> , and i happened to see and read reviews of this mini notebook on amazon decided to try it out for its size , you get a lot of bang for your buck i upgraded the memory with the # % off coupon from toshiba , bought an auto adapter for trips , because the size of the netbook is so much more convenient then amazon offered a discount on the windows # home premium upgrade you do n't need it , but it is nice and did n't cost much at all am impressed with toshiba have decided that when i need to replace my large notebook , i will definitely look at toshiba first inserting the new memory module was a breeze -lrb- directions in user guide online at toshiba -rrb- and download of windows anytime upgrade from amazon was a snap just go to programs and look for windows anytime upgrade - follow directions and it 's done
my new toshiba netbook replaced both a pc and a laptop it has a fast processor , long battery life , several usb ports , with a real keyboard , plug-in mouse , able to run my office software that the new tablet computers ca n't more importantly , it was far less expensive than a tablet computer so far , i am loving it
i was extremely impressed with the speed of delivery received within same week as placing order the netbook has been perfect for my teenager easy to set up light-weight and sturdy and sound `` system `` is just great
this was a great purchase i brought it for my # yr old <unk> and i have n't heard not one complaint about this netbook it 's light weight , great screen resolution , easy to use and has all the social media <unk> she wanted to use , plus it 's fast
item works great . super easy to handle and carry around experience so far has been good i am not a super heavy user just needs it for fun and to look thing s up online i also have direct tv <unk> on the go and it works great so
i bought this laptop for my wife as a birthday gift she 's only had it one day and loves it i like the easy grip <unk> , full keyboard , fast speed and most of all size i would recommend the product , no flaws so far
for value and performance , it 's hard to beat this little jewel i looked at a number of netbooks before buying this one and they all had something that was n't acceptable to me -lrb- poorly designed keyboard , not <unk> , etc . -rrb- not true with this one - well designed , compact , good video , well designed <unk> , memory can be upgraded , not <unk> fast but adequate for general use i liked it so much i bought two of them , one for my wife and one as a graduation present for my grand daughter by the way , both of them like it as much as i do
love my new little laptop so convenient to just pick up and go anywhere a great little traveling companion so i can check my e-mails when i 'm not at home
my old <unk> p # photo storage and <unk> bit the dust and it would have cost $ # to fix it and $ # to get a newer model looking for a cheaper option , i researched netbooks and found this toshiba , which has a built-in card reader and only weighs # . # pounds bingo ! ! love at first click and it 's so much more versatile than a photo storage <unk> with way more capacity i do a lot of traveling and this will be perfect for my next trip to <unk> and northern spain all this for $ # -- an unbelievable bargain
i fully satisfied this little and powerful netbook , however if someone who buy this product with extra memory , just please <unk> out after you get this product ... to see the bottom of your netbook the memory on my netbook is ddr # . not ddr #
i bought this at amazon due to a good price and good reviews from past users i wanted a small computer i can travel with and just keep in my lap when i am at the <unk> table or watching tv so far it has not disappointed it runs well with good battery life
this computer is the best thing that has come along i recommended to everyone since i have been using it , i have great satisfaction and i 'm super happy with my purchase i also bough a wireless mouse since i like the feeling of pc mouse , but other than that , i give it # stars
i 'm a old user of toshiba laptops toshiba is one of the best computer i have had ever now i have bought this <unk> netbook and is incredible the performance of this little machine is very nice , light & fast the only problem is that now everyone want to try it i love the toshiba nb # in the orange color that is not exactly orange is more tha <unk> , a beautiful <unk>
i purchased the netbook mostly based on reputation and because i already own a toshiba laptop i have been very happy with my purchase of the netbook i love the color also the netbook is performing very well i have installed microsoft office # , i plan to upgrade the memory to # gb my <unk> & i travel alot out of the country and purchased this netbook mostly for this reason , i feel like the netbook will fit perfectly with our travels
i was able to quickly install and get the wireless connected without any problems seems to be just perfect for my needs and i will be able to <unk> to my office accounts while i am on the go online user guide seems very helpful now i just need to create my recovery disc and i am good to go
this is exactly what i needed - lightweight , small and easy to carry without sacrificing screen quality and processing speed the keyboard is extremely comfortable for its size , the screen crisp and clear it 's advertised mainly as a communication device for web browsing , email and skype but i 've already put it through some serious software and graphics loads without a <unk> i was n't planning on using it for heavy-duty <unk> applications but it looks like it will be able to handle anything i dish out without objection i purchased this at a small military retail outlet at a fairly remote location in the middle east and it came out of the box undamaged and ready to go , with no problems this is a great buy and i 'm pleasantly surprised by the nb # 's capabilities , capacity and quality recommended for anyone who does n't need more load to carry but does need ease of handling and packing , especially if you 're on the move a lot
i love my new toshiba notebook sure there are others out there with more bells and whistles but for the price i got exactly what i wanted and needed the battery life is awesome i 'm considering buying another one for my son who is in high school
i am `` the computer guy `` - i assist people from home to enterprise <unk> from <unk> to <unk> to <unk> i often will replace windows <unk> with netbooks like these to significant ; y cut costs -lrb- # netbook , # `` monitor , # wireless mouse combo = $ # -rrb- for my clients especially since `` cloud `` computing and web based applications are more prominent now i completely wipe the netbook and install ubuntu <unk> -lrb- netbook <unk> edition -rrb- the computers fly and all software is free the netbooks in particular are well designed low power , great <unk> design and just out run the competition if you 're looking to surf the net , print and edit a document here and there , these systems will do you great and last a few years
to work effectively at my teaching job , i needed to get a windows computer -lrb- i 'm a macbook , iphone , ipad guy in the rest of my life -rrb- small , lightweight , flexible and cheap were the <unk> after reading a bunch of reviews , i settled on this toshiba -lrb- including a # gb chip upgrade -rrb- while i 'll never be a windows convert , this is a great little machine that let 's me get my work done i removed some of the <unk> , loaded <unk> and a free <unk> program , and i am there i 've only had this computer a few weeks , but it seems dependable , and with the # gb chip is plenty quick for office type tasks
i recently switched from a macbook to this netbook i love it it 's small and light , so it 's great since i have to carry it everyday it does all the basic stuff you need i highly recommend it
great little netbook , able to put in purse and carry everywhere would highly recommend to any user , students , retired <unk> , or home office as of # / # , still loving my notebook , skip in my purse and off i go ; better than an ipad
i absolutely love it my full sized toshiba is getting a vacation for sure as i have been able to do almost everything on my netbook i upgraded the memory and upgraded from windows starter to windows home premium and i am ready to roll with my mini it fits in my purse or tote and is so lightweight i do n't even notice it on my lap definitely worth the price and i will probably be a netbook customer from now on
bought one of these little `` puppies `` for the wife , loaded up skype and she was off and running -lrb- or talking -rrb- seriously this is a great `` computer . the price could not be better picks up wifi with a good solid connection although there is no cd rom there are ample usb ports i downloaded all the `` open source `` software one could ever <unk> this very functional box i have just ordered a # nd for a friend
i purchased this netbook in september # ; here it is june # , and the hd has died i gave this netbook very light use , and it has n't been dropped , knocked about , or the like to explain the major hardware failure to add <unk> to injury , i spent # hours today on the phone with toshiba trying to get a <unk> technical support told me that such a failure is `` normal wear and tear `` -- potential purchasers , take note they kept switching me to customer service , which , from all appearances , is n't a line that anyone <unk> because , of course , tech support `` does n't give out `` the number for customer service i wo n't go with tosiba again , and suggest that you think twice before you do
the sd card slot is not reading at all i regret i did n't find it out earlier when return to amazon.com is no longer an option -lrb- i found the problem # days after i received the item : -lrb- -rrb- , i had to deal with super slow and no responsive toshiba customer service they said i need to pay $ # . # shipping to ship back my defective crap computer be cautious of the possible hidden charges before you make your
i bought this item to replace a laptop that i 've had for over four years , since my old laptop was getting slow crazy thing is there 's virtually no difference in speed between the toshiba nb # and my four year old laptop sometimes it takes three minutes just to close a few tabs on chrome it takes five minutes to open up internet <unk> it does not come with ms office -lrb- the one that came with mine was a trial version that expired after a few months -rrb- i would not buy a toshiba netbook again
do n't buy one of these i purchased mine about # months ago and just hate it it is a waste of money it 's slow the keyboard sucks i upgraded the memory but that did n't help had to disable the touch pad the audio is terrible i honestly can not think of anything i like about this machine i thought toshiba was better than this
the computer started <unk> when it came out of the box when we called the manufacturer , they advised us that we would have to take it to an <unk> repair center and wait # days to fix it there was no offer to send us a replacement this was a brand new computer if it does n't work out of the box , it should be immediately replaced do not do business with this vendor customer service used to be of premium importance in japan apparently no more
already returned it , . sound coming from speakers almost ca n't be heard , . went to store if it just me having this problem , . no , . . all toshiba netbooks speaker sound has extremely low level , . . speakers on this net-book , . . are in reality useless , i could n't hear anything without external speakers after return , . i got acer with speakers working normally , . . and i do n't see any difference in performance , .
after weeks of researching laptops and notebooks i finally thought i had the one ordered it and was happy with everything until today when the keys to type in my <unk> went ballistic and would not stop repeating i ran toshiba fix and then found out it would cost # . # to talk to someone as the problem would not fix itself i am very disappointed after spending # months to find the right computer only to have it go bad within a week of receiving it nice litle machine otherwise but continued to have to <unk> through <unk> just to log on and then when it went to sleep had the same problem over and over if this is in the # st week what do i have to look forward to long term i have returned it and now get to start all over i am at least happy with amazon for standing behind everything and i would not buy anywhere
we bought one of these for my wife as others have stated , the audio is <unk> the thing heats up quickly , and , once it does , you can smell the components cooking shortly after , it starts malfunctioning : either dropping the network signal with every other link click or hanging not a very well made machine i 've noticed my wife is back to using her desktop instead of this thing it 's a waste of money
the toshiba netbook is an impressive looking machine it is well constructed and quality throughout the casing however , it is extremely slow and would require an upgrade in ram additionally , due to the placement of the speakers on the bottom of the unit , the sound quality is poor we called toshiba customer service directly for help in set up , and we were told there was a $ # . # charge for any technical support
it is pricey for what you get it should come with windows # home premium and a cd player , and # mag of ram for the price , you can add $ # . # for those good points small to carry and large buttons for large fingers also to easy to click on the <unk> , or goes to next screen by itself if i could do again , i would not have bought it . . but i can live with it
this is a great , light little computer . i use it all the time i took a star off of it because i wish it was faster . but for it 's size it does the
i purchased this netbook after getting tired of lugging my laptop around when traveling i really like it for this purpose it fits inside a small carry-on tote -lrb- even inside a sleeve -rrb- with lots of room for other things in the tote easy to pull out for the x-ray machines at the airport the full size keyboard is helpful , although i use it mostly for checking e-mails , social sites , and internet surfing i 've never had a problem with connecting to the internet i purchased the toshiba after doing some research on the internet i 've had it a month with no problems would not want to use it as a full time computer , but great when traveling
purchased this at the time tablets were becoming popular we have a tablet , too but , i like the `` <unk> `` of a netbook that <unk> to a small laptop so far performance is fine , slow but i 'm working on <unk> it up if you read the reviews , add the things people have mentioned , and <unk> the toshiba junk that comes <unk> installed , you will be fine
i read many of the netbooks reviews on amazon before i bought the toshiba nb # -n # i traveled with an acer netbook for a couple years and was very pleased with its performance i wanted to upgrade to windows # so i bought the toshiba based on reading the reviews everything has worked `` out of the box `` and i am looking forward to using it in our travels to europe what is most impressive about the toshiba netbook is that it is nicely finished and loading and using additional software is very easy i would like to have # gig . of memory and may buy it later i just wish amazon would recommend the correct additional memory for each netbook they sell it seems that many netbook buyers adding more memory have some difficulty when buying the recommended memory
i bought this net-book knowing that it would never be as capable as a large full size pc i wanted something that was not as huge a laptop but not as <unk> as a tablet overall i am happy with the performance because i use it just for surfing the internet and when i travel and watching loads of movies on its # hard drive another plus is that it will run most windows programs such as word processor and <unk> so if you are looking for a cut down version of a pc with a lot of memory in a familiar pc <unk> this is a great product
i have tried just about every netbook on the market , and nothing comes close to the toshiba nb # i now own two of them -lrb- both blue -rrb- and aside from adding a gig of ram to each unit , they just work better and faster than any notebook or netbook i have ever used they are the perfect size and run as smooth as a jet i could go on but i will finish by saying toshiba hit the golden ticket with this model
the built ny # `` laptop case might be a slightly better fit for the # in macbook air but this case works okay there is one pocket , which is handy for charger , mouse , etc and a removable carrying strap really cute case and goes nicely with my built ny kindle sleeve in french bull . :
i ordered this bag for my the netbook that was purchased for my wife . it is just the right size for her netbook and it holds the charger and several other items she needs she did take the advice of one of the other reviewers and used fabric markers to color the bag in and it makes her even <unk>
i bought this bag for my new ipad and it fits perfectly love it , it 's washable and has the # different handles and the front pocket for the charger and headphones
i ordered this because of the size , hoping it would be a good fit for my new microsoft surface while it says netbook and dvd portfolio , the surface fits like a glove the front pocket is great for carrying my cell phone and the chargers too
the quality of the bag is very nice , but it is just a little too small with my hp envy # and t # i in the bag , i the bag barely closes at max strap length
i 've had this bag for about three weeks now and overall i 'm pleased with the size and it ability to accommodate my d # , x # and three lens to add a laptop would be pushing it the only reason i rated the bag a four is because the clasps have a tendency to come undone , other than that the bag is great
fits my canon # d and two lenses , plus my macbook air and a whole other mess of stuff tons of storage , but does n't look like a `` duffel bag `` stitching quality is amazing and appears like it will last a long time
i can not believe this product has received such high reviews from others , i suspect it is from people who work for the company because this does not stay on it is a very thin hard plastic that does not attach securely the low cost makes returning it for a refund a waste of money given the postage one must pay
i bought as part of a gift for my wife she likes the look very much , but the top cover will not stay on it constantly , and after any minimal touching , falls off poor computer has a bottom cover -lrb- which has stayed on fine -rrb- , but no top i will wind up buying another case from another brand waste of money
really tried to use this case as an alternative for the speck one but i did not work at all did not stay on my laptop and the material seems very cheap got the speck one after all however others seem to have better luck
i was very disappointed in this product i checked the model number before i purchased this case when i got it and tried putting it on it did not click on easily and it falls off and will not go back on i would not recommend this particular one
i loved the color of this case what i didnt like was the bottom piece had air vents ... a lot of air vents whats great about the macbook air is it doesnt have a drive or fan so i didnt understand why the vents were there i really want to protect the my macbook and feel like the vents make it susceptible to scratches the case was easy to get on but not so easy to get off at all
like the color a lot but it does n't fit perfect when i open the laptop it catches the lower shell so i have to be cautious but it is fine
i like it but the top keeps coming off they need to make sure that when you snap it into place it stays there still i use it all the time
great price - looks pretty on and was easy to snap on the lap top i purchased this for my daughter in hopes that it would be a good protection in case she bumped or dropped her laptop it is hard <unk> and will not protect the laptop from falls but maybe minor scratches is all more for looks wished it was a bit more durable but then they would have to raise the price
this cover is just so-so the fit is n't great but it stays on and it feels pretty flimsy i do like the color and the transparency and i love the little feet and the angle they give for twenty bucks tho , i was expecting a little more than this however , i think it will serve its purpose and protect the outside of my macbook
<unk> different colors to choose <unk> from nicks and <unk> reasonable <unk> <unk> bottom fits but the top , only three of the corners were able to snap in place i still ca n't snap the forth corner however , it still sits in place just bothers me that one corner is not snapping in place
i am very happy with this product i had to watch the video tutorial to make sure i snapped it on right but i got it & was on in a matter of # minutes my only complaint is that i did not receive the silicone keyboard cover that supposedly from other reviews came with it one of the reasons i went with this brand over others was because of that does it come separately , or was it just a promotion little disappointed , but other than that ... great deal
the case is very pretty , and stands out it fits okay , but putting it on seems a little nerve <unk> due to it being plastic it also came with a keyboard cover , which is nice , but the & # # ; mcover by ipearl & # # ; on the spacebar is a little bit of an eye sore the keyboard cover also has an error on the caps lock section , with the hole not fitting with the light the keyboard cover can make it a little more hard to type , but overall it does its job the case , while keeping my computer protected from scratches , does make it a bit difficult to tilt the screen back because the pieces are a little big in the bag of the case , they hit together when <unk> back the screen , but it 's not too bad the sound might scare you at first though the built in stand is a nice touch , but for me it hurts my wrists to use it after a while so i prefer not to overall it 's a pretty case , and i 'm glad i purchased it
the pieces seemed a little clumsy when i was snapping them on it has adequately protected my air sufficiently so far , however i have n't been to hard on it so far
this case is stronger than some other cases i have seen , but ca n't prevent hardcore damage from happening -lrb- such as dropping the laptop -rrb- it is very difficult to get on , as others mentioned , and i almost returned it for this reason now that it 's on , it stays on firmly the pink hue is a little more metallic pink than the picture suggests , but still looks nice
this product was a easy to put on the company is great if i was waiting on apple to give me some kind of protection for there product i would have been waiting along time
my <unk> likes the cover the color is right not to pink and not red either the stands looks weak but they do the job if you are not moving it a lot when she comes from school she just kind of throwing it in the couch or the table but it is find because the cover is doing its function not cracks or <unk> to the cover or the computer i recommended it
feels like you 're going to break your mac book when you 're putting it on but once its on it has a nice look to it good buy for the price
the case is nice , i liked the color i thought it would be soft but it 's a hard case i did n't read the description it 's easy to install the only thing is that the bottom part does n't fit snug , it 's a bit uneven but it stays put so i 'll will keep since it 's not so noticeable overall nice case , would give # stars if it was n't for that
when i first bought this case , i thought it was going to be like a clear case . . its not , and it has more of a matte finish ! which is fine , its still cute in my opinion , there are too many air <unk> at the bottom . . its kind of annoying but i did love how fast it came i ordered this case last night , and i got it this evening ! in less than # hours very good . i would definitely buy from this seller again
very light weight and vibrant color bottom cover fits perfectly and snapped right into place top cover lip is a little too thick and clips the bottom cover when open macbook to # degree angle
my husband bought me this cover for my macbook air and it exceeded my expectations , it even included a free keyboard cover its easily snapped on and off , it was very easy to assemble , and gives my new laptop a pretty in pink personality it also was here in no time , very rapid shipping thanks ipearl you guys are great ! !
i got this for my macbook air # inch it fits great and adds no weight to the computer it will protect it from scratches but not if you drop
