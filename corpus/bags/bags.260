this bag has plenty of space , but it is n't laid out well it needs a separate zippered pocket for large items -lrb- a console , textbooks , etc . -rrb- and then a smaller section with pockets to fit your various items the center pocket of the bag just gets crammed full of stuff and it becomes hard to find anything you need without digging for it also , the pockets are all too flat and small to fit anything thicker than a # inch in them ; i could n't fit my mouse or other objects into them if i wanted to
i like this bag a lot it 's large enough to carry my # . # toshiba , but it started to come apart already around the zipper area i did have it really packed though and it was quite heavy , but since it 's designed for a laptop and travel , it should not rip so easily i 'll have it repaired because it 's worth keeping it 's comfy to wear and looks nice just sew it better around the zippers and you have a great bag
this bag is great for the real gamer , but it 's just too big for me it can hold many gadgets and games , however , it can get very heavy for everyday use i will keep the bag , but i will only use it for trips overall , not a bad purchase ... just not what i was hoping for
this bag was purchased because of the wonderful reviews it received ; it is in fact a fantastic bag it is well made with sturdy material , has a lot of space and pockets , a secure space for a large computer -lrb- asus g # s -rrb- , and it is a decent price however , the reason it is only getting three stars , is because this bag was not made with women in mind the cross chest support strap is in a very awkward spot and there is no real way to get it fit comfortably a few inches up would make a huge difference my husband tried the bag on with no concern , and probably most of their customers wo n't have issues but if a woman will be using this bag , be sure to keep this in mind
this is a very nice backpack for most laptops up to # . # `` , except for an asus g # although the computer fits in the bag the zippers a very tight on the corners i did n't use the bag , because i was afraid the zippers would rub on the corners beyond that this is a very well made bag i did load it up with my laptop and # decent size text books , with plenty of room to spare for gadgets the straps and laptop compartment are very well padded i do not see the need for the weather cover , most people would get out of the rain in a heavy down pour it would be useful though
if this thing had n't been to wide to fit under a tiny economy airplane seat i would have kept it i like the bag but it 's definitely made for console gamers heading to a local lan and not road warriors maybe i 'll pick one up in the future
they thought of everything for this pack , especially the removable <unk> console sleeve and rain cover the pack was too big for my # & # # ; girl frame to carry a load comfortably
did n't know about the brand , but surprised with the quality of materials and finishing fits my msi gt # perfectly i recommend this to people who people who like smart yet casual bag
i have a large # `` asus g # s , and it just barely fits everything else is awesome and has plenty of space and pockets , but the laptop area is still a tad tight i bought it because i thought it would have tons of room , but i find myself wrestling with it just to fit my laptop maybe its the zipper style and since you can fully unzip , maybe that 's the issue i would say that if your laptop is more than an # . # `` thick , than look elsewhere , but my # . # `` thick laptop is stuffed do n't let that part drag you down , it 's an awesome bag , lots of handy pockets and <unk> to make carrying a bunch of stuff easy it 's made me a mobile computer geek lol worth the money though if your laptop fits i remember reading one review <unk> that asus would fit , boy i 'd like to <unk> that guy
although my laptop is a # `` screen model , i do a lot of traveling and was interested in the beacon for it 's large accessories capacity the laptop holder has a padded raincoat to give additional protection and is easily big enough for an # `` model , maybe more it swallows my macbook easily the accessories pouch is a good size , with more than enough space for a # sized folders , magazines , books , cameras and everything else the traveler needs for a <unk> on the outside there are carrying handles and two rather small exterior pockets and an additional pocket which forms the outside of the accessories pouch the material is a heavy-duty , rugged cordura type material which i imagine will withstand some rough treatment the padded shoulder straps are a little on the thin side , but perform well enough with even heavy loads pros : massive capacity , very durable , well constructed cons : small exterior
just got this backpack today , and from what i 've seen , the quality of construction is outstanding not just the laptop compartment , but each individual inside pocket has a very soft lining to protect gadgets and such the bag is super roomy , and i would definitely keep it except for one issue : the laptop compartment does n't fit my -lrb- admittedly huge , but still # # `` -rrb- asus g # jh i know other reviews have said otherwise , so i can only guess that the design has changed slightly when i put the laptop -- no matter how i <unk> it -- i ca n't get the <unk> zipper to close ; the corner of the laptop sticks out about # of an inch other than that one issue , i would suggest that anyone looking for a good laptop bag get this well worth the money
there are not too many backpacks -lrb- about # -rrb- that can hold an # . # `` laptop the pack has plenty of space and handy pockets to store various items love the color contrasting orange / black design this would have received # stars if the straps were thicker -lrb- rather on the thin side for caring such a heavy load -rrb- and the laptop sleeve area is a fuzzy orange material which can cause build up in any exposed areas like usb ports , etc , but it does offer a cushy protection luckily my laptop came with a very thin black cleaning sleeve which i put my laptop in before placing inside the backpack overall great product if you go to the manufactures website , they have a great <unk> video review that sold me on this backpack
i have had this bag for about # weeks now and i really love it it has more room that i thought and is a lot more comfortable and supportive than the swiss army bag i used previously the support system really balances the weight of what you have in the bag -lrb- i carry a lot and the bag is heavy -rrb- i notice a major difference with the same load the only thing that is wierd are the zipper direction on the side pockets great bag ! ! ! do not hesitate to purchase i bought if from fry 's because i needed for a trip almost immediately
the first thing you will notice is that all of the features have little cardboard <unk> attached the second thing is that the orange seems a little too safety colored but , after searching the web for hours trying to find an option for my <unk> # , this was the one i landed on the <unk> # fits nicely in the laptop pocket - with just enough room the pocket is lined with a nice screen friendly material - which is a real plus for a large tablet pc the back pack has plenty of pockets , a cavernous main pocket , and lots of interior flap pockets for holding your mouse or whatever the rain <unk> is a nice feature and the zippered pocket it lives in , provides a kind of secret pocket that can double to hold something like your wallet so far , i like it but , i kinda wish that i 'd tried the alienware version i feel that the price is about right for the level of quality , etc . , but would like to have seen it at around $ #
this bag is awesome ! there is literally a pocket for everything i 've carried my laptop , my ps # , <unk> cameras , ipods , smart phones ; it holds everything nicely i have a # inch laptop that 's unusually large and it fits in this bag perfectly ! it is so easy to be organized with all the compartments in this bag absolutely love it i gave it four stars because the side zipper did break an easy fix though , it was nothing major
this backpack has no trouble holding my massive g # , a stack of textbooks , a # -inch binder , and miscellaneous items including index cards , writing utensils , etc . i did initially have trouble -- the first bag i received had damaged straps however , i followed the rma process on everki 's website and a new one arrived in three days phenomenal customer service that truly stands behind their guarantee
this will carry a lot ! great for big laptops -lrb- alienware -rrb- and tons of storage room the way it is set up makes it easy to keep things organized and you can put items you want easy access to in the side pockets the hidden pocket at the bottom has come in handy to : -rrb-
ordered this for my m # <unk> # fits perfectly , very soft laptop pocket , and plenty of storage space comfortable to wear , and super high quality it was a little pricy , but i love the protection it provides
<unk> ca n't say that enough i used an old targus backpack for nearly # years when i finally upgraded to a # `` laptop and needed more space for all of my peripherals , i upgraded to this -lrb- after a ton of research and reading reviews -rrb- i 've had this backpack for a couple of months now , and i have had no problems with it at all i recommend this product
i bought this for my gt # <unk> pro laptop and the laptop fits in the laptop compartment perfectly -lrb- albeit with a little bit of room to spare , which is no fault ! it 's <unk> roomy inside and i highly recommend it
i like everything about it except the furry stuff that the laptop slides into it is just an odd color functionality is great and it seems to be built well to last a long time i like how the laptop has a seperate zippered compartment to keep it seperate from my books and other items
i have a msi gt # gb ram - the laptop is # . # & # # ; and weight about # to # lb thick gaming laptop i ca n't find any other laptop backpack like this one i can put my laptop and a cooler master <unk> x # in there and still have a tone more of space left to put a ipad in there -lrb- or # more ipad
the things i like about this bag are it can easily hold my # & # # ; gt # in the laptop slot the strap is very soft and comfortable even with heavy loads lots of slots n <unk> i do n't like # once the straps get wet they are a pain to carry around so not that great for hiking this bag is an overkill for just carrying a laptop there is just too much space if you 're carrying say just a # & # # ; laptop
i purchased this backpack roughly # months ago for my asus g # , and it still is holding up amazingly the back portion fits the monster asus g # perfectly , and i use the front half for the power supply as well as my other accessories i have used the console sleeve twice , and surprisingly , i got my laptop and the xbox to fit , albeit it was definitely a tight squeeze if you 're looking for a stylish laptop backpack , and you consider yourself a gamer , i would highly recommend this backpack i 've brought it to many <unk> events , and will definitely continue doing so
this bag is tough enough to travel through # <unk> , during long flights - open/close , open/close for airport security and most important . protective enough to take care of your things this bag is huge ! ! ! held my msi # . # laptop snuggly and safely this backpack feels very balanced and comfortable carrying for long periods of time probably close to # to # lbs . inside felt less carrying . it i love this bag plenty of pockets , secret pocket what else do you need it is a little pricey , the only downside , but if you travel a lot this is the backpack you need to carry your valuables . <unk> said
this backpack can hold an xbox one and all its components along with games and controllers with room to spare amazing style design and great padding very thick on the bottom i own several swiss packs and none compare to this one
this bag it 's really good for larger laptops and has plenty of storage the build quality is fantastic i purchased this for a # . # `` laptop and the bag holds it just fine the additional sleeve it comes with would be perfect for a smaller game console like a ps # or a wii
i do n't review things very often but this bag deserves it i have had it for a few years and it has been great can easily say its the best laptop bag i have ever owned and i use it every day i was disappointed when one of the zippers started to give me some problems i would have normally thrown out the bag and looked for something different i love this bag so much i contacted their support to see if i could get it fixed after <unk> a few pictures they said it was covered under warranty and would be shipping me out a new bag <unk> i am blown away at the quick response and how they handled the whole thing i am not used to getting that kind of support after owning something like this for a few years do n't hesitate to buy if your on the fence
as far as laptop backpacks go ; this baby is the bomb has all the pockets you could ever need very comfortable , even with a # lb laptop sitting in it do note this backpack has a cool little pocket on the bottom that contains a weatherproof cover that actually ties over your back essentially making it perfect for carrying in harsh weather overall , i would consider this a top of the line laptop carrier and highly recommend it
it is really comfortable to use and it is not so big as some people tell -lrb- i have watched a lot of reviews -rrb- , unless you are a small person or a child i guess it has plenty of space for cables and tech devices and for your headphones the console sleeve can be used for a second laptop today , i just used the cover to protect from the rain and it worked perfectly , of course you can not <unk> your backpack inside water , but it is water resistant just <unk> the water from it and it was clean i 'm enjoying my new backpack :
love this bag extremely good quality i feel safe putting my expensive gaming laptop in this and taking it on the go this bag also influenced me into purchasing an everki satchel style laptop bag for work after the dell one ripped have n't really used the console sleeve like i imagine , but it has plenty of room for cords and accessories
this bag is great it fits my alienware # inch laptop which is quite a large laptop i can also fit my laptop cooling fan in there as well in the console compartment and still have room leftover usually if i 'm taking this laptop somewhere i need to be able to fit laptop -lrb- about # . # `` and # . # `` thick laptop <unk> <unk> <unk> cooling <unk> of <unk> laptop fits all of that fairly comfortably and does not look too large when wearing it i 'd say the zippers could be a little bit more sturdy but i do n't really abuse them and am usually fairly light when opening them so i do n't see an issue with them
this backpack is amazing from the moment you grab the handle the product screams quality each pocket is made well and there are lots of them i love that i can fit a large laptop , speakers , <unk> mice , a headset , headphones and lots of hard drives in this backpack there is a special carrying slot for your xbox # or ps # if you like the whole thing feels great to use and carry again , the quality is king here i would buy again - in fact i just ordered one for my brother yesterday also - the water proof bottom and rain cover work great buy this for your large laptop
i have an asus g # jw , a dslr , logitech g # headset , couple of earphones , a kindle , <unk> , and a bunch of clothes that i carry around with me after looking around -lrb- because i had enough of lugging a duffel bag -rrb- , i decided to throw in twice the amount of the targus xl and bought the everki beacon i was expecting a huge backpack to arrive but not exactly it 's actually a pretty decent average size with generous pocket space for all my electronics first thing that strikes you would be , holy crap this thing is really well-made all my previous laptop backpacks feel flimsy compared to this ruggedness definitely well worth the $ # and extra express shipping fees to get it if you 're still <unk> between to buy or not to buy , just buy it well worth every penny
using a # & # # ; asus laptop plus all the files i need over the weekend so i can work from home hold everything , looks great the orange separate bag does n't fit my laptop but it would fit a # & # # ; great my laptop fits in the bag itself and the separate orange bag i use to carry paperwork and files perfect for a college student or <unk> that needs to bring home the entire office everyday
this is my first gaming style laptop backpack , and so far i am very impressed and happy holds everything i need and fits my # inch msi laptop like a glove the waterproof bottom has already came in handy i have a headset that breaks apart into # pieces so that works well with this i use it daily and so far no signs of wear after a month of solid use
this backpack fits my monster # . # inch laptop , in addition to my tablet , books , money , phone , etc . it has many pockets , but they are n't useless and small like many other backpacks with multiple pockets it 's easy to stay organized , and i keep finding new places to fit my things in it i also have back problems , but this backpack is n't as painful as many others i 've used the weight distribution is good , and the straps are comfortable on my shoulders
i purchased an asus g # laptop a while back , which is incredibly huge this backpack easily holds the laptop , a cooling surface , large headphones , power cables , and anything else i need to transport without a problem it 's extremely sturdy and good looking , and provides the best fit for an enormous laptop i returned a few bags from other manufacturers before purchasing this one , and could n't be happier with it price is a bit steep , but you 'll be very hard pressed to find a better bag trust me - i 've looked
i have an asus g # so i needed a large bookbag with a nice padded interior to lug my pc around this was such a great investment , i recommend it to anyone who 's looking for a quality bag
i have been looking for a backpack bag that can hold my asus g # gaming laptop the beacon backpack is the best that i have found on the market that will hold that beast
my asus g # fits in here with no problem and it protects the laptop flawlessly i was in what could have been called a <unk> one day on campus , and had to walk about half a mile back to my dorm in the mess i get back home and everything in the book bag is completely dry thanks to the book bag raincoat in there i never use the console case though , threw it away
i 'm not a laptop backpack fan to begin with i received a new notebook from my company and needed a very large case and found this one so i decided to give it a try it worked much better than i anticipated loads of room for all my peripherals ... modem adapter , usb to serial adapter , mouse , charger , patch cords , cross over patch cords , thumb drives , etc . the separate zippered pocket for the notebook is very well padded over all a great product
i have n't had this bag for very long , but so far i am very impressed - it seems very rugged and durable i actually got this bag because i was looking for an option to safely transport my xbox one the laptop & # # ; sleeve & # # ; in this bag that is meant to protect laptops actually fits the xbox one like a glove , it is almost as if it was designed for it furthermore , i can fit all of the xbox one accessories in this bag with plenty of room to spare i would definitely recommend this to anyone
i love this bag it does everything i need it to it fits my asus g # very well plus plenty of room for anything i can think of within reason it is very well made and it has a look that will never get old i thought it was going to be huge but it is n't and it carries very nicely i would recommend this pack to everyone that needs a big bag for a big <unk> replacement it wo n't disappoint i love this
i was looking for a backpack to replace my asus one than came with my g # jh as you may know , that laptop is huge and needs a solid backpack to contain in after reading the other reviews , this backpack claimed to hold a g # well , and that it does it is a nice snug fit , which imo is better than it being too big is has a ton of extra space for whatever you may need my asus bag could n't fit anything else other than the laptop , charger , and a mouse this backpack can hold that , plus every notebook and folder i needed for a full semester of engineering classes it is comfortable and pretty a solid bag and to the person who described the insides of this backpack as dead <unk> fur ... you are absolutely correct and your review was the reason for my final decision to purchase this backpack
this is the best laptop bag i 've ever seen i gone through a couple of bags i commute via motorcycle with my laptop so the bags get a lot of use this bag is comfortable , weather proof , and it fits my hp hdx premium # `` laptop . the pockets and dividers inside the bag are genius
this is a high end backpack , but if you just spent $ # + on your over sized gaming laptop ... its worth it i have an alienware mx # which is huge for a laptop its thick , chunky and heavy and i had a lot of difficulty finding a backpack to hold it the beacon fits the mx # very snug ... and i mean snug you have to pack the laptop it the laptop pocket first , then fill the rest of the pockets , otherwise the zippers are very tight and might just <unk> the corners of your laptop the stitching is high quality , no frayed strings or edges as of # months of everyday use i take my laptop everywhere , also i have all the accessories and school books as well i do not recommend over stuffing this bag , every bag has its limits if i have to much stuff i will either leave some behind or take another bag i hope this helps
pros : it 's a hard shell case that will definitely protect your mac from scratches , etc . i like the circle cut out for the apple sign and the color is exact to the picture , a see-through lavender cons : for the bottom case , the two clips that keep it on are right where i rest my hands when typing and searching the web , etc . , so that gets irritating after a while the top cover catches on something or is shaped differently on the right side , so when i open it , it makes a clicking noise i do n't think it 's damaging my laptop , but i hear it every time i open my computer all in all . . for the price it 's worth the cons ! !
to glue <unk> and <unk> to it is wonderful , love the case , it was fast shipping the only problem i have with it is it does indeed click when you open your macbook ... this is why i do n't use the bottom piece of the case otherwise , for the price , it was what i was looking for
the cover almost fit perfectly over the macbook pro , except that the opening in the top cover is not centered directly over the logo i will recommend this purchase
i love my new case the purple looks great and fits securly on my macbook pro my biggest problem was the packaging they could have at least put some bubble wrap around the thing it had a protective film to keep it from getting scratched , but otherwise was just in a flimsy shipping bag luckily for me there were no cracks or breaks , but it seems like little bubble wrap or padding would have gone a long way i would still recommend this product ! just be forewarned about the packaging
this product fits the new -lrb- # -rrb- macbook pro well it looks good also , the one thing that i want to mention is that if you have a palm cover on your laptop then the clips are extremely hard to get on i cracked this cover trying to get it over the palm cover , but it is still functional other than that , i recommend this product
i love my hard case cover for my new macbook pro it is exactly what i wanted and i did n't have to wait long for it to come in the mail it does fit snug in a way that it cracked on one corner , but other than that , i am pleased
i bought this to protect my new computer while i searched for what i wanted , a soft silicone case , much like i have for my cell phone i could n't find what i wanted , so i settled for this surprisingly it fits perfectly , i have the newest # inch macbookpro i have n't really taken it out and about yet , so do n't know how it will hold up over time , but for now its fine
this was the fastest i have ever received something from an online purchase , and an extremely satisfying one at that i love the color purple , and this case makes my new mac look even more gorgeous than she already is lol seriously this was a great buy , and took basically no effort to put on my laptop i would most definitely recommend if you 're a true lover of the color purple and you want something that will protect your computer would definitely do business with these guys
i am very pleased with my new purple macbook cover it does what i need it to do and it 's elegant looking with the see-thru color the company sent me the wrong colored keyboard cover but quickly sent me a replacement after i contacted them
i am a college student and have had my mac for a little over a year , so there were some minor scratches -lrb- mainly on the bottom and sides -rrb- this case makes my mac feel so much more durable it is made very well , and engineered to fit the extra plug-ins into it it is n't exactly true to color , unless you look at it from a <unk> area i like the fact that it is see thru because i do have laptop stickers on it and i was afraid it would cover them up this product is truly worth the money , and it is cheaper than the similar cases -lrb- even the silicon ones -rrb-
after i ordered this i was prepared to send it back after thinking about the hole in the center i had decided i wanted it to be cut out into the shape of the apple when the box came i was pleasantly surprised that it was n't a circle after all and it was a cut out of an apple the bottom part threw me at first because you have to hook the tabs under the lid once i figured that out it was fine the color is transparent but once it 's on against the silver it is a nice purple not loud at all
i love this cover on my macbook it 's not only protecting one of my favorite electronics , but it 's my favorite color ! compared to another case i had purchased , this one stays put
i love this case and have gotten so many complements on it it 's durable and shipped really fast the only thing that was wrong with it was the little white circle pad that goes on the four corners for the bottom piece for me though , it was n't a big deal i 've been using it for about # months and love it it was a really great pice too totally worth buying on here versus the $ # ones at the apple store
i dont understand why people are complaining about the packaging that it is delivered in the case is delivered in a bag but it is coated so it does n't get scratched it was very easy to assemble and it looks great for the price it is a great value i dont even feel like i settled i love it and my mac book pro is protected
it was delivered quickly , easy to clip on my computer and i am the envy of all my friends not only is my new investment protected well , but the purple is so soothing
really nice light pink color , different from the other tacky <unk> pinks out there mine had the apple cutout , not a round hole only problem is that it snaps on a little too well ; i tried to take it off afterwards and it wo n't come off i gave up for fear of breaking it not really a problem per se , it just seems like its on for good
case was as described a cute color and an apple cut out for the logo on the top it took me a bit to figure out how to snap the case on the bottom once i got it on , it was fine it looks especially cute with a pink keyboard cover , which i also bought from this seller i had some issues with shipping , but the seller resolved it quickly a cute case at a good price
i ordered my case and it came in about # days it was very easy to snap on , but take caution , it is definitely not as pictured as it is on amazon it was way lighter the apple logo cut out is perfect , and i had no problems snapping it onto my macbook
it is real cute and fairly easy to install . i am not sure how well it will protect my macbook but i am only looking to avoid scratches , so i think it will do the job just fine the packaging is rather unprofessional , but it did n't suffer any damage , so no complains there
before i purchased this item i kept wondering if it was an apple cut out or a circle cut out , mine came out as an apple cut out fitting was overall good , though i feel like it does n't really <unk> especially well for the bottom part i 'm not too sure though and i do n't know how to take the bottom plastic cover off because i actually found some dust particles along the sides of my macbook which i want to rid
i definitely do n't know what the negative reviews are about this case is simply beautiful ; a really cute pink , as pictured unlike what others have said , there is no circle for the apple logo everything is as pictured it 's an apple cut-out , not a circle the case is snaps on easily , and is simple to take off for cleaning sturdy , good quality , beautiful color when i ordered this , i discovered the top case was a bit loose , so i e-mailed the company , who then immediately apologized and shipped me a new one ; it arrived within the next few days definitely an excellent buy ; purchase it and you will have no regrets
when i ordered the cover , i was really worried about whether or not the case would even fit i have a new macbook pro # inch , and even though the information said it would , i was still really worried it came in the mail just a few days after i ordered it and it snapped on perfectly everything lines up exactly and putting it on was a breeze
i received my cover within days when i opened it up , it was exactly what i was expecting it was just the right pink color as shown on the page , had the apple cutout , and it was amazing quality it snapped onto my laptop with ease and looks terrific i am very pleased with this product
the color is the exact same as the photos show and it 's very easy to put on , it just snaps in place has been pretty durable for me although i do keep my laptop in my backpack a lot of the time would definitely recommend
we recently purchased a chromebook for our daughter and all of the other sleeves and holders were <unk> priced when we found this we were a little concerned about the quality , but decided to take the chance on it it is well built with a zipped main pocket , a zipped smaller front pocket and a velcro middle pocket it is a great size for the chromebooks and would also work great with a netbook
it will definitely hold all pictured which explains why it may be a bit larger than # . # i wasted some liquid on it & it did preserve my chromebook , and was super easy to wash & dry
i use this for my ipad sleeve it helps to protect it while traveling and also has a compartment for little things such as earbuds , extra battery , power cords etc . plus it is very light weight
i wanted something cheap to cover my samsung chromebook this is able to hold the charging cables nicely in the front when the laptop is in the sleeve , there is about an extra half inch of space this is n't a big deal , but i wish it fit a little more snuggly this thing has some nice details , like a small lip that goes over the laptop to prevent is from getting scratched by the zipper there are the # pockets along with # little packets in the main compartment for memory cards the color is a lighter , brighter pink than the picture shows it is almost a neon pink overall , the construction looks solid i 'm happy with my purchase
i ordered the wrong size - \ but it still works great for my samsung nexus # tablet . and i can carry my phone , charger , a real notebook and pen etc with no problem . color was same as picture i like it a lot
i used this case for my asus # b the netbook fit snugly in the case that came with a shoulder strap that i never used there are <unk> within the case for storage in addition to the outer pocket the outside pocket will fit the power accoutrements , a mouse , and maybe a battery all in all a nice case i was looking for something hard-shell , but this was sufficient did n't get a change to test how water proof it may be
fits hp dm # us great with room for charger , optical drive , flash drives etc . good padding and is not attache style so it should go through tsa nicely i would prefer if outside pocket were zippered instead of velcro but i would also prefer to be married to <unk> <unk> jones ... but such is life . update : # / # still very happy with
i am using this case for a # `` hp <unk> # p laptop the laptop just fits inside the case but leaves very little room for anything else the outside pocket will hold a small mouse and headphones or a paperback book
this is a great bag and i would recommend it to everyone it was exactly what i needed and wanted when i need to replace my other cases , i know the company i 'll be ordering my replacement
really handsome and well finished case for a small netbook or an ipad all accessories fit , including a couple of <unk> or files or writing pads shoulder strap included nice color -- <unk> than royal , not as dark as navy blue best case i 've <unk> for the new compact electronics
this case turned out to be the perfect size for my # . # `` asus netbook it fits easily without it being crammed in like some other cases it has velcro straps to secure the netbook and pockets for carrying extras , like a mouse or media it also has a shoulder strap and a handle , which makes it easy to shift from shoulder to hand carry it 's padded for extra protection and it seems like it will be durable as well for the price , it 's a great value
i thought this product looked great , and could not believe the price -lrb- $ # -rrb- i ordered it for my brand new macbook , white unibody , which it claims to fit this case does not fit the macbook white unibody the bottom was fine , but the top would not stay on , no matter how many times i snapped it on the case was just to big also , the plastic had several spots that had visible cracks i am returning it and buying the speck satin case , which i had on my old macbook , and i loved save yourself the hassle spend $ # more and get the speck , which is perfect for this laptop
i ordered this item after a lot of shopping around for a decent case that i did n't have to blow $ # on i ordered the used one , like i expected it had a few scratches but nothing that would prevent it from working well i put it on , but the top lid would come off every time i closed the lid it would stay on if i left the lid partially open though i tried it on my sister 's macbook and it stayed though , so it could have just been my computer but i am not sure because ours are the exact same anyways i liked it , did not fit though
i got my case within just a few days and immediately put it on my mac it 's a great case but when i began to really look at it i thought there was a hair that had gotten underneath the case i took the case off and noticed that it was actually a defect in the case it wasnt a scratch or a crack , its like something is trapped inside the plastic also , the case scratches and scuffs very easily nice to look at though just thought i 'd get better for the price i paid
i think the hard candy case is a nice `` change `` compared to the bland macbook color i like it i dont love it it seems very durable & sturdy but i have yet to drop my macbook and i dont plan on `` testing `` this out lol i 'd say buy
looks good on the unibody macbook and goes on very easy and does not leave marks on the mac or make it bulky it covers the lighted apple logo on the back of the screen i like that it makes the computer look less fruity and expensive aka please steal me i have the black case and the apple light looks like a round <unk> eye with it covered my only problem with it is that bottom cover is too smooth and your computer can slide off a surface very quickly because it kind of acts like a sled i 'm going to look for some non slip tape to put on the two rails on the bottom if the bottom was less slippery i would give it five stars
it 's not amazing but it fits pretty well and for what i spend on it is a really good case it is really clear not dirty clear like some cases and the most important it does n't heat up my computer !
i absolutely love this cover i am a huge pink lover so of course i will but it was n't hard to put on and i keep it on every day it 's really nice to have a cute cover protecting my macbook
i ordered this product used , so i was kind of hesitant when i received it , although it was a little scuffed , it was n't bad at all in fact , it was rather fantastic it clipped right to my macbook , and has added an impact cushion for the few times it has decided to fall off of my rather high dorm bed it 's a very nice protective shell , very durable , and , as a plus ... is very aesthetically pleasing i would highly recommend this product for macbooks , -lrb- i 'm not sure if they 're made for pc 's , but i would recommend it for those too , so no worries -rrb- definitely a great product ! :
i just received my white hard candy case bubble shell i 'm absolutely satisfied with it i double checked it all around and i did n't see anything wrong with it no scratches whatsoever and it fits perfectly i also love the unique bubble design i would definitely buy another one in a different color
bought this product back in # and am still using it this product , while a little bit on the fatter side , offers much more protection than a laptop sleeve i do not plan to buy a laptop cover for my macbook pro , as this product does the job for both would highly recommend
i am a very picky individual and i spent a lot of time researching for the best sleeve / case for my new macbook pro # `` the <unk> # stood out immediately as a top product i went ahead an ordered it and i am completely happy with my choice it is light , but offers the sturdy shell protection i like the way it completely opens up when unzipped - other sleeves only have a zipper on the top which might scratch your computer when removing or storing it do n't worry about the viper zipper touching your macbook - it fits perfectly with no floating around and a seam separates the computer and the zipper images of the inner padding almost <unk> white , but this is not the case - mine is a light grey
this is solid case for a macbook pro -lrb- # in unibody -rrb- it is sturdy and yet elegant the outter fabric is nylon that reminds you of those high end tumi bags both flaps have hard ribs the protect what 's inside the zipper is placed is such a way that never comes in contact with the body of the computer thus preventing scratches i would recommend it to anyone looking to buy the best protection for their macbook pro i went to several apple stores to see what they have and nothing came close to this one case amazon has a good price on it and if you think this is expensive ... your laptop costs # times more ... ! !
i love everything about this case ! ! i searched high and low for the perfect case and it was worth the hunt , because this case meets all my expectations it fits my # & # # ; mac air like a glove it is lightweight , yet durable so i feel confident that my computer is protected i love how the zipper never touches the computer and how it zips all the away around for <unk> access it is perfect for taking to school and fits nicely in my backpack or shoulder bag you can find cheaper products out there , but if you are looking for quality than look no further
great backpack , really comfy , has awesome <unk> like a an <unk> coat that you can pull out as needed however , the buttons on mine , two of them , fell out within the first week of wearing it
has the best laptop protection i 've seen in a backpack very well made with high quality materials i 'm not sure what the complaint is with regards to the <unk> ... they seem fine to me the inside part of the snap is even attached to a small loop of fabric allowing you to get your finger underneath to close the snap also , somebody complained that the backpack would n't sit upright on the floor <unk> come on , i 've never seen a backpack do that the only downside i can see is the chest strap it seems like it could pop off with a solid tug and the pocket on the right shoulder strap -lrb- which will not hold an iphone -rrb- interferes with the position of the right chest strap i ca n't slide it low enough to be comfortable and will probably cut the pocket off to allow the chest strap to travel to it 's lowest position
looks very understated easily fits a # inch laptop really useful slots fits all my gadgets perfectly the small pockets are covered with soft material inside making it ideal for an ipod touch or other pricey gadgets without having to worry about scratches only wish the main compartment was a little larger has a waterproof cover tucked in the bottom , which is pain it makes bottom uneven , making it impossible to place the bag upright in most cases but overall a good backpack for a good degree of rugged usage
what happened ? there are no internal organization pockets as pictured or in the product description this is just a plain neoprene sleeve , like others <unk> i specifically chose this item because of the internal pockets i 'm wondering if this is a substitute as other reviews state they have the internal pockets the peacock design is bright and as pictured i 'm very disappointed , particularly since i spent a lot of time shopping and comparing laptop cases
my children bought this for their mother 's laptop , an macbook pro # & # # ; so far , she 's gotten plenty of compliments hold everything securely and provides enough room for binder and accessories too
