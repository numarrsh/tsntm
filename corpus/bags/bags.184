the picture shows a hard case with a cutout for the apple logo this case does not have a cutout that said , it is still a very nice case it snaps on neatly with very little tolerance it 's hard and stays snug to the macbook 's metal body it appears to be opaque but when the mac logo on the lit is lit up it glows softly through the case in a deep purple , which i think i like better than if there had been a cutout
this is an excellent case smooth soft feel makes my new book feel great in the hand and it does have a nice matt finish the apple glows nicely through the top and it has good ventilation on the bottom the only reason i 'm giving it a # start instead of a # is because it had some very small chips of top coat on the front of case -lrb- near front opening -rrb- when i first got it nothing i ca n't live with also , it does seam to smudge easily -lrb- finger prints -rrb- it is a nice case though and i would highly recommend it good quality feel
i was excited to find an inexpensive case for my retina display the case provides limited protection if you drop it , but certainly will protect your new computer from scratches etc . . its thin , light and looks great i found a video on youtube that helps me decide on this case too -lsb- ...
i 've had this case a couple weeks now and it fits over my macbook pro with retina almost perfectly the only flaw is it does n't seem large enough to wrap around the lower front of the case i often have to pinch it to snap into place but it does n't last long this is a minor flaw as it does n't cause the case to fall of or feel loose , it 's still snug i got the <unk> brown color which was the only color other than black that was n't obnoxious i can access all my ports just fine as well this case provides protection against scratches and minor bumps
this case is a great economical case for your precious investment the case is <unk> appealing the purplish hue of the apple logo is something i find quite appealing the case itself has some characteristics that let you know it 's not expensive i still feel i have not put it on right yet the sides are pretty loose and do not snap into place like i thought it would the case does have a little rough feeling around the edges where your palms would sit it can be slightly noticeable all in all , you do get what you pay for and this is honestly a decent purchase and i would buy another one if i needed one
i feel like this is a no brainer , it 's way <unk> than the spec case , and achieves pretty much the same thing the feet had some weird peel thing going on with them , but i just rubbed them so that all the <unk> stuff was peeled , and they are great , took a couple seconds buy with confidence
the case snaps on with ease and snugly it protects from scratches and provides a little more stick to your grip when handling i would give it # star if the edges were not so sharp
the color is good , once you get it on the finish on the top of mine is slightly rough and not entirely smooth as i wanted from a rubberized finish the price was good however and it has the look i wanted overall i am satisfied enough to keep it but will replace it if i find a better one in the orange color
it worked well for a while i like that it is mildly rubberized , to enhance grip , and the plastic feels pretty durable however , the rubber `` feet `` on it are cheaply glued on and all four fell off within a month of using it update # / # after the company posted the comment you see below , i reached out as they requested the person that responded to the support email from their website told me to reach out through amazon and the comment below tells me to reach out via email with the link to this review update # / # after posting the updated review , a company representative reached out and replaced the whole unit for free the replacement feet seem much more sturdy than the original , but time will tell
liked the cover i 've read lots of mixed review about this cover and decided to try it for myself for the price it 's really great it gives my mac book pro a second layer of protection with scratches i have a small dent on my case and it covers it nicely
i 've used a few speck cases in the past for older macbook pros i like the kuzy better it has a more snug fit , less intrusive feel also feels great when you carry it around only complaint is the edges that grip the case in the front -lrb- where your wrists are -rrb- are still sharp like the speck cases i guess there 's no solution other than to gradually sand down the edges to make them smoother not a big deal over all my other wish is that they sold less girly bright colors and more solid but faded colors like in darker red , or darker green
the case fits well , and has caused no heat issues for my mbpr the finish is nice , nice grip in hand , and works well for what it is some of the edges are n't smooth , probably where the mold was poured unfortunately , this is on the portion that sticks up over the edge of the base of the laptop where your wrists sit it 's been winter , with long sleeves , so not an issue yet , but i 'll have to use something to smooth the edges other than that , good case for the money
works like a charm , snaps right on i was worried that the tight-fitting edges might scratch my macbook but it does n't seem to have done so however , two issues # -rrb- one of the small feet has fallen off from the bottom after only a month of use # -rrb- there 's greasy fingers all over it ... for some reason it attracts grease like crazy :
i ordered two of these for myself and my <unk> they fit great , stay on , look good , are just a little bit rubbery but not so much that they 're sticky , i 'm very happy and they were a great price they do leave a few smudges here and there from time to time , but i am very pleased
good product - easy to put on , color as described , texture feels good -lrb- slightly matte , not too cheap feeling -rrb- the ventilation holes line up perfectly which i thought was thoughtful also , the gray stickers on the base raise the laptop slightly which help with ventilation only problem i have with the product is that the back corners of the base of the laptop -lrb- near the bottom right and left of the screen -rrb- are not protected
this is a very reasonably priced case and does offer a decent about of protection as far as prevention scratches to the case of the mbp the case fit is not perfect on mine when it first arrive i have to file down a couple sharp tabs and the case does retain finger prints like no other over all for the price you can not go wrong hopefully kuzy will come out with a slightly more <unk> product at some stage
although i thought the case would be a bit more opaque in color from the look of the picture , it fits perfectly and looks great the slightly rubberized case also makes gripping the laptop a lot easier , many is the time i almost dropped my <unk> because of the <unk>
shell came very fast and was neatly packaged together the color is far more vibrant than in the picture , though not necessarily a bad thing i agree with other reviews , the backside of the laptop is not protected enough the case also can get caught on edges very easily as well due to this design it was cheap good to hold me over until speck comes out with their version
its just what i needed so i could put my computer in my back pack and purse without worrying too much extra about it getting scratched or sticky it does the job and it a awesome color thats what i love most about it
i really like the case at first i was worried because the bottom part of the case was n't staying on after playing around with the case for a minute i found that the case has clips and you have to push on that spot to get it to lock into place after i figured that out it stays on really well i had to take my laptop in for repairs and it to me minute just to get it off my only complaint is that the little rubber things all came off over a couple months i would have just glued them back on but lost them
this is a great protective skin this is a hard shell cover but its not going to do a bunch if you were to drop this on a really hard surface the case does get in the way of the usb , firewire connection so you have to pull the case down a bit to get stuff connected all the way
i love the fit and look of the case there was a scratch on the case when i got it so i ca n't give this # stars and i just do n't care enough to send it back and get a new one it 's to protect the machine anyway ... so it will get marks on it i just was n't expecting one right out of the package
great fit and finish no problems after a couple of weeks directions did not make clear the precise orientation of the top but not a big deal as it 's easy to figure out
i bought this case with the hopes that it would be a bit more <unk> than it is , but overall it serves its purpose of protecting my macbook it fits very securely , and i have n't had any problem with it coming loose , etc . it does n't really add any bulk to the laptop , which is nice fortunately , i have n't dropped my computer , so it has n't been tested in that regard overall , i would recommend this cover to others
i like the snug rubberized design the macbook pro with kuzy fits inside an outer case , which is good my only complaint is that the <unk> edges which are intended to snap onto the computer , do n't stay in place
i 've had this case for about # weeks now and i love it i have n't had any problems with it it fits perfectly on my # & # # ; retna display macbook pro i received exactly what was described , rubberized hard case i 've had a hard case before and i did n't like how slippery it was but this case has a nice rubberized texture on the outside i would definitely recommend it
meets are basic expectations so far , it fits , protects from scratches and looks nice , clips on and fits easily i will probably order a sleeve to protect a little more while it 's in my bag to and from classes
this is a great looking hard case cover for the mbpr and does n't add much to the native form very easy to install i have had this on my laptop for # year now and it has protected it well i do baby my laptop and keep it in a padded briefcase -lrb- booq <unk> brief - also great -rrb- when not in use the only issue that i 've encountered thus far is that # months ago , the # rubber feet on the bottom starting coming off not a big deal to me though as they are easy to replace -lrb- if even necessary -rrb-
nothing much to report it 's a cover . does it 's job the only thing i do n't like is that it fingerprints super easy , but i love the color and the protection i had another brand previously that broke immediately and this one did not
did not give # star since i have not dropped my computer to see how well the case protects it case does not cover the the side of the computer case on the screen side gives me some concern if that is the corner that hits the ground time will tell
i love this case it protects your mack book very well it is very slim and lightweight the only thing i do n't like is the fact that it is hard to clean
i could not be more pleased with my purchase i have a mid # macbook pro w/retina and this fits perfectly and makes my laptop look amazing sitting out on top of my white desk i would describe the color as a sort of robin 's egg <unk> turquoise it 's not too bright , not too soft ... just right : -rrb- i also bought the silicone keyboard cover and everyone comments on how chic they look together when they first see it seller was so fast shipping it : i ordered it on a friday and it must have gone out that same day because i received it on monday
i bought this for my boyfriend for his new macbook pro it fits perfect gives the macbook a sleek appearance no problems to note i would definitely buy this again or recommenced it to a friend
i bought this to replace a broken speck case that i had this fitted my # & # # ; macbook with retina display -lrb- early # model -rrb- very well it looks and feels very nice overall , similar cases like this are made by different companies and there prices <unk> from ~ # to ~ # dollars the previous one that i had -lrb- speck -rrb- was twice as expensive as this however , i think the quality of kuzy is better i am very happy with my new case and i am happy that i didnt spend more for this this kuzy case gets my highest recommendation
the case came in earlier that <unk> and <unk> wonderfully it fits like a glove and does have some hard edges around the wrist rests , but its bearable i recommend this to anyone wanting to protect an investment
great product for the price the feel is soft rubbery some might find it a bit slippery fit is good need to make sure you snap all tabs into place
this shell for the macbook is a perfect fit with vent holes in the right places and all the ports have easy access the plastic feels a little flimsy when you receive it but after putting it on the mac it 's just right the <unk> of the rubberized finish is just enough to give you a little extra grip on the laptop i 'll report back over time to see if it has developed any cracks or has come loose so far so good and i 'm very happy with the purchase
i 'm a <unk> speck user , having purchased a speck case for every macbook i 've owned for work and play since # , as well as some other speck products i got this kuzy because the equivalent speck model for my newest macbook was double the price , and the previous speck case i bought broke after just a few months of casual use i was surprised by the quality and craftsmanship looks like kuzy is my new go-to for macbook covers
i know the laptop is beautiful in full aluminum but , it is <unk> to protect it from bumps and <unk> this is the ideal protection layer update , the mac retina is a very nice aluminum body , but it is also very easy to damage it the kuzy has helped me to <unk> it like new from time to time i can take it off , clean the mac , clean the kuzy and then put it back i like the rubberized feel it prevents me from <unk> it and playing hard on my macbook retina does get hot but with the kuzy ventilation slots and my own laptop cooler it stays ok i bougth it black , but to show off the aluminum mac i would also recommed the clear case
this case is really nice i have had it for a while now , and my laptop does n't get too hot with it on either -lrb- i use my laptop more than # hours a day at least -rrb- if you want a nice case that wont damage your macbook this is the way to go
fits like a glove and looks great totally worth a few bucks to protect a + # k laptop especially when you can do it in style my only complaint is that it shows <unk> quite a bit but better the cover than my laptop
i do love it its exactly what i wanted and exactly as it was described in the listing it fits perfectly and although the color is n't the greatest , not the purple i wanted but it does look nice , my friends have said it looks really nice i have come to love the color and i honestly feel my mac is protected from scratches i just bought my mac so i want to make sure it does n't get all scratched up i recommend this to anybody with a macbook pro # . # & # #
the case is awesome , it does n't make the laptop to bulky and there is almost no weight difference my family has a problem with their computers overheating with just the hard covers but since this one is rubberized i do not have and problem with my case getting to hot the edges of the case fit perfectly with my computer so i hardly notice its even there
i was unsure about this case when i first received it seeing it on my laptop now , i love it so much it 's a great extra protective barrier when my macbook is n't in its case it is this soft matte plastic looks so sleek , was easy to put on , and it stays on no problem definitely recommend this case to others
honestly the perfect case ... fits perfectly , looks sleek and offers good protection for such a small case its wonderful and for the price it is unbeatable i have had it # week now so it has been tried and
one of the best things you can do for your # . # & # # ; apple powerbook pro it is reasonably priced and protects the surface of your brand new macbook pro besides looking really sharp it is a inexpensive insurance policy for surface scratches highly recommend it
easy , snap-on fit that <unk> perfectly with the edges and all port <unk> of the macbook pro retina the rubberized finish is easy to grip with no fingerprints highly recommended if you want a sleek , lightweight , snap-on shell to protect the finish of your macbook pro retina
the case really has protected my macbook pro retina display from scratches and bruises and was one of the first products out this past summer for the retina display i do wish they came in more colors , but the black is
this kuzy case is a perfect fit for my macbook pro was looking for something that gave me the protection for my laptop , which gets taken in and out of my bag a lot this definitely fits the bill without adding significant bulk , plus i love being able to & # # ; <unk> & # # ; with color !
the product has a good quality and matches the description i bought the black one and it is really slim and feels comfortable when you typing or carrying your mac pro out deserve the price
i had a kuzy clear case already , it fit perfect for my macbook and i also like this black case so much kuzy - # # <unk> chevron sleeve cover # -inch for macbook pro # . # `` with or w/out retina display a # and a #
this is the case to go for if you are looking for something simple with a matte black finish the apple just lightly glows through and it looks sexy over the whole case the fit is very nice
i am really happy with how the laptop case looks its a really pretty color and i received many compliments on this case it fits my # inch macbook pro w / retina nicely you can still see the apple logo when your laptop is on when i got this case many people were wondering if the logo showed through the case the laptop case is hard but has a soft feeling to it i love this case so much its a must get
if you are looking for a slim cover that will protect you macbook but not add bulk this is it the bonus is you are able to see the apple logo thru the case this is the perfect cover to protect your macbook from daily bangs , etc but you will still need a backpack or other case to carry this in when you are on the road overall i love this cover and highly recommend it
this case is sleek and just as described , protects your computer as a case should i would definitely recommend this great product you barely realize there is a case around your mac a + +
we have a <unk> of mac 's and have been buying the $ # competition from the apple store disgusted with how the competition breaks - went looking for a more economical solution very pleased with the kuzy going to be buying a lot more and get these out to our team - rubberized texture excellent feel - no fingerprints - very durable - not cracked corners
this is my second kuzy cover for my macbook pro retina i am considering a third cover in a different color the case fits perfectly , does not add weight or bulk to my computer very happy with my purchase
i received the kuzy macbook pro case last night the case fits snuggly around the laptop and snaps in place so i do n't think it will be an issue keeping it on it came well packaged so there were no blemishes on the case the only minor inconvenience was the shipping it took a little longer than expected , but after contacting kuzy , they made it right in the end so over all i am very pleased with this transaction
this case fits perfectly on my macbook pro # inch with retina display i love the rubberized case and the fact that you can see the glow of the apple through it shipping was super fast and came within # days i love the color and to anyone who is considering this , it is definitely worth the money !
i knew i needed to protect my expensive macbook pro to maintain its best resale value so i looked over this case and read the reviews and decided to give it a try wow , what a wonderful surprise ... it came on time , packaged well , and it fits perfectly ! ! so happy i chose this product it 's not slippery , so i 'm not worried it will make my mac slip out of my hands it actually has a very nice quality feel and is every bit worth the price i am not a fake reviewer ... my review sounds so good but the idea is to tell it like it is buy it and enjoy as i am everyday i use my macbook
the new macbook is much more delicate than previous models and this case offers great , and very needed , protection the case is easy to snap on and is easy to wipe of with a damp towel
my daughter loves it and it fits her laptop perfectly it is a great cover for the price - way cheaper than the covers on the apple website and i think just as good
this case looks great and fits my new macbook pro great it shipped very quickly and the color was exactly as promised i 'm very happy with e purchase experience and the product
it arrived # days early , and it fit exactly perfectly it took a little <unk> to get the bottom on , but it fits and the color and quality is so nice i wish i could have every color
i just bought a new macbook pro and am a little ... rough on my belongings , so i knew a case was going to be a necessity i 'm glad i purchased this case i like the rubberized texture , it makes it easier to hold onto , and the light purple color is beautiful and exactly what i i wanted
keeps my laptop protected from scratches and dirt when i carry it around with me easy to put on/take off -lrb- though i have n't actually taken it off ever -rrb- very lightweight , does n't add bulk
i recently got my macpro retina display case , and it is just awesome it fits perfectly , the rubberized texture is great , the prize is really fair considering that sometimes you find similar products in stores over $ #
one of the best macbook covers out there slightly <unk> texture gives you great grip but not too tacky also , half the price of griffin or speck this thing is really , really nice oh , and it 's slightly more translucent than the speck so the illuminated apple logo shows through a bit more , if that 's important to you
this shell fits my daughter 's new apple # inch retina display computer perfectly it snapped on for a snug fit the semi transparent material allows the apple logo shine through beautifully
fits great , does what it is supposed to do it is really a great cover made well , has lasted longer than any other i have had for past computers , and is still looking good and in great condition . :
first we all spend a lot of money on our rmbp so i wanted the best case read the reviews on this case and was sold i just got it today snapped on right away fits like a glove i love the rubbery feeling protects and has cuts in it to let it <unk> the heat very happy with this case also , get lots of looks having a black macbook this is a must buy ! !
i purchased the gray case and shortly after putting it on , my new macbook pro dropped the case saved it for sure the company appears to be quite responsive thru the whole <unk> cycle
i chose this product based on the other reviews i was skeptical , but i am sure glad i bought it the case is black and the apple logo shines through the case i love the rubber feel to it <unk> i could n't be happier
great look , great protection and great fit with no sharp edges other covers had sharp edges that bothered the palm of my hand where it rested on the edge of the macbook while using the track pad but not this one
just as good as many overpriced comparable shells wish it had a little more & # # ; rubber & # # ; feel , but it fits perfectly and looks great best of all it protects my computer with very little bulk
just got this in the mail today and could n't be happier ! ! the color is true to the picture and snaps on super easily ! ! i was a little hesitant because it was n't that expensive but the quality and color is fantastic i would recommend this to everyone
this is exactly what i wanted and was expecting and worth every penny it protects from scratches and makes the macbook pro much easier to grip securely when getting it in and out of the case i would n't be without one of these
it is great it is a hard case but it is also sort of a rubberized material that feels much nicer then plastic it fits my mac book perfectly and i saw no defects or anything like that i did need to clean it off once i got it but no big deal i really love the blue color on it as well it looks very sharp <unk> a great by for $ # , much better then the other cases for $ # or $ #
just installed this onto my # inch macbook pro with retina display and i have to say the installation was much quicker and easier than i thought it was just a quick snap on and everything was in place the only set down is that on the bottom part only one of the # side parts snapped into place , and the other is just kind of hanging there it 's not a problem though because the other # on the bottom snapped in perfectly and when my computer is sitting on a surface you do n't even notice the case itself has a very nice feel and plenty of ventilation space on both the bottom and back of it added bonus - it looks great
the cover clipped perfectly on my computer and stays in place without a problem so far i 'm very happy with and i love the color i would definitely recommend to help protect your computer
easily # ! the case originally appeared to be cheap plastic until i opened the entire packaging and experienced the soft feel across the case the softness is wonderful and brings many benefits - softness - easy to grip - durable - smudge resistant - fits on <unk> - none :
initially when i opened this i was disappointed because i thought it would have a more & # # ; rubbery & # # ; texture but it looks cool and was easy to snap on i feel like my laptop is much safer with this case on it
i love this case it 's light weight but protective i intend to have my macbook pro for years and this will keep it from getting scratched also the color was just like the picture my brother and my sister have them
i like the rubberized feel of this hard case cover <unk> my macbook pro retina # model it went on very easily , but hardly makes it any thicker but i know i have some good scratch and bump protection for my investment
after <unk> several products , this product by kuzy has proven to be the best available it has a rubberized finish similar to many cell phones , which is a welcome addition to the exterior of the macbook pro slick aluminum finish the fit of this case is well designed , and feels like an extension of the laptop has n't popped off randomly , as other cases tend to do highly recommended product
i got my new mbp retina for college and was so worried about bringing it there without a case , considering none of the standard case makers have come out with their products yet i bought this case on a whim , and it is beautiful it fits perfectly and has a smooth finish the tiffany blue color is stunning and at ~ $ # it is a steal compared to the $ # speck , incase products defintely get this case to protect your beautiful new retina
totally satisfied , and it does n't seem to add to the heat factor of the mbp retina fits easily , looks nice , protects most of the surface -lrb- not against a shock , but certainly scratches -rrb- , an easy solution that allows you to throw your mbp in a bag without fearing and without adding too much bulk
the product works great the ventilation is in the proper places to allow the laptop to breath properly the only issue i ran into was that the rubber grips on the bottom seem to keep falling off i finally glued them on and they have n't given me a problem since overall good product
i bought this cover for two reasons : -lrb- # -rrb- to distinguish my macbook from all the others while going through the tsa line at the airport and -lrb- # -rrb- give me peace of mind while handling it overall it accomplishes both it 's a simple snap-on installation , although you do have to apply quite a bit of pressure to get it to & # # ; snap & # # ; all the way ; otherwise it will slide off the only thing i dislike about it , which i 've already gotten used to , is the bottom snaps around the bottom of the laptop can be slightly uncomfortable at first however , it 's just something small to get used to and other than that , it 's a good-looking , durable way to protect your laptop while still looking professional for work
i ordered this on a sunday and it arrived on that next wednesday ! very fast free shipping i am very satisfied with the case , it fits perfectly and protects my new macbook i would recommend this to any macbook pro retina owner
great product , easy to apply macbook pro retina bottom and lid snaps on easily and looks like nice protection like the <unk> of the lid so apple logo is still <unk> and visible shipped fast before promised good product one con having a little problem with dropping wifi if it get too far away but the loss is just # feet
fits powerbook perfectly -lrb- early # model anyway -rrb- it snaps on , has a nice feel , and protects my mac nicely also , with this rubberized hard case i can go ahead and add stickers to my laptop , as seems to be the <unk> even amongst computer <unk> , without actually marring the nice exterior finish of my mac there are vents on the bottom for air flow i do worry a little that adding the case will increase internal temperature -lrb- logically it <unk> -rrb- - but it has never been a problem , and a little cooling pad more than <unk>
i ordered this case for my new rmbp , and it fits just great it does not cover and of the ports or vents , and the rubberized shell protects the rmbp great one of the biggest benefits of the rubber casing is when i remove the rmbp from my laptop bag it makes it much easier to grasp with one hand , and the rmbp does not slip out of my hand the cost is just right , and the case arrived quickly
when i first opened the box , i was a little skeptical it just looked like two pieces of plastic once snapped on , however , it feels like a quality case it is not <unk> duty , but will definitely help to protect the outside from dirt and scratches a great investment
i purchased a different cover for my son 's macbook last year and thought it was a pretty good product it is made of a hard plastic , seems really rugged when i saw this product i figured i would give it a try , expecting it to be basically the same material i was pleasantly surprised to see the rubberized texture of this cover -- it is far superior to the other one my only ` issue ' with it was the plastic <unk> lines -lrb- from the molding process of the plastic -rrb- were sharp and scratched my wrists after i installed the product on my machine i had to take a knife to smooth off the rough edges of the plastic , but now it is fine i love the protective attributes of this cover and would definitely buy it again
perfect fit , high quality feel for my # `` macbook pro with retina display the fit was so tight and perfect i had to squeeze out a couple of air bubbles between the top shell and the lid of the laptop it 's like a second skin the orange color is nice and <unk> bright the shells snap on very nicely with almost invisible `` hooks `` and have perfect spacing for all the connectors and also all the air cooling <unk> delivery was fast and trouble free could not be happier
i love the case excellent fit and appearance downside is that the frosted rubber coating is prone to collecting finger prints i am reluctant to use cleaning products on the case so i have a dilemma , as to how to remove the fingerprint smudges without damaging the finish of the case
this case was a great buy inexpensive and it protects my mac very well why pay $ # - $ # for a case that has the same protection and style as a kuzy case it arrived at my house # days earlier than expected , which is a big plus in my book great company i highly recommend this case and company to anyone
i was a bit worried that the kuzy cover would have much less quality than the more expensive competitors , considering the price difference but , my worries are pleasantly put to rest i have friends that have the more expensive alternatives and the quality is par with theirs the fit is great for my macbook pro retina # & # # ; it snapped right on , and is a bear to get off which i like , it does n't some snapping off every time i pick up the lid i would definitely suggest this product to anyone looking for great quality without having to spend a lot of money
i love this case it fits snuggly , is smooth to the touch , the apple still shines through , it 's slimline so does n't make the laptop feel thicker or bulkier ... definitely get this to protect your macbook pro
