you get what you pay for , not very sturdy item still in box because very flimsy i meant to return it but never got to it dont <unk> if you want
let me first off state that i ordered this case for my macbook pro retina so by my own mistake i ordered the wrong case and had to return regardless seeing as this version is too big i am not reviewing it on the <unk> i am reviewing it on it 's look i can not believe there were so many good reviews that said it was attracting i find it to be incredibly ugly , dull , and very cheap looking i would not even consider putting a case that looks like this on such an expensive computer thus making the computer itself look like a cheap piece of plastic i am going to go with a more expensive speck case
the case is fine , but i did not receive a `` topcase mouse pad `` with this , nor did i receive it with the topcase sleeve purchased what 's the point of offering a free mouse pad if it is n't even included i would 've bought the items regardless , but now i 'm just disappointed
color is true to what it shown i love it for my macbook pro . it clips on at the top of the screen and bottom however the bottom piece does n't clip anywhere in the back i honestly did n't even notice until i played with it one day as a college student it is the perfect middle ground of practical , useful , cute and professional i believe you can also get matching ones for ipad , iphones etc . my only complaint is it has small chips on it these are probably from my own use though
i ordered this cover for my # `` macbook pro the color of this product is beautiful i have received compliments on the color alone , seems as if this shade of blue is hard to find i also like the feel of the cover , it is smooth and makes it feel and look more expensive than just a regular plastic cover it snapped on fairly easily i received the case within two days which was nice because i managed to scratch the cover of my macbook within the few days that i was without a case the price is awesome too i am only giving it # stars because i am a bit worried about the actual protection level that this case will offer my laptop
awesome look , exactly what i hoped it would look like not sure if i put it on correctly though . . it seems like it did n't snap on properly in one spot . . but that could be my own mistake other than that , i love it i 'd definitely recommend this case to all of my mac users
i ordered this on friday night and it was here by monday the case in the picture looks more <unk> or turquoise to me but it 's really a light blue overall , for the pice i ca n't really complain
this item came a day before the expected delivery date , which is always nice the color is exactly as pictured , which i was a little worried would not be the case there are no scratches already on the case , which was a problem some others experienced it was easy to put on i also read that it would be difficult to take off , but when i did take it off , just to be sure , it was no problem at all
my daughter needed a new macbook cover and asked for this one for christmas it was in excellent condition and worked perfectly she has found it to be durable and it priced at a very good level
i received the case very quickly and was what i was expecting , i would order from them again i was hesitant after reading about some of the <unk> about the case breaking , i hope mine does n't
people ask where i got it from and constantly comment on their liking of the color my favorite part is seeing the apple light up in the back when i turn on my mac : -rrb- p.s i also recommend you buy the matching keyboard cover :
this case fits better then the case i bought from the apple store and it was way cheaper the color is really pretty too -lrb- just like the picture -rrb- i 'm happy =
i love the color first and <unk> , but i also love that this laptop case does not scratch like cheap plastic cases have for me in the past this case has a matte soft feel to it you ca n't see the apple logo when your laptop is shut , but then when it 's opened and the apple is illuminated you can see it through the case as pictured , which i think is kinda cool
i really like the hard case and keyboard cover unfortunately , the screen protector was loose in the sealed package , leaving it vulnerable to be cut when i opened the package so i ca n't use the screen protector otherwise , my favorite part of this product is the keyboard cover , which is perfect for my # macbook air
i received a case that i was n't initially happy with fortunately , the seller was responsive to my feedback on amazon - seller immediately sent me a replacement case with keyboard and screen protector included overall , i am very happy with the with all three items ! and a + customer service
when i first saw this case i was so excited it fits like a charm on my # inch macbook air but not only does it being the cover for the top and bottom of the laptop it also brings the keyboard glove and the screen protector i have n't dropped or scratch my laptop yet to say how durable it is but i like how stylish it is and it 's not bulky at all i would very well recommend this item to another apple laptop owner
this is a great case i bought it as a christmas present for my boyfriend -lrb- who owns a # macbook air -rrb- many keyboard covers i have looked at are incorrectly labeled on the top line -lrb- his does not have an eject key , volume is f # , f # , f # -rrb- , but this one matches great he is going to love it p.s . liked it so much , i bought a companion one in red
my case just arrived and i love it it has a hard shell for the body , a keyboard cover and a screen protector the keyboard cover actually has the keys printed on it , so it 's not just a clear cover i am hoping it will look better as it ages than a clear keyboard cover does ; my sister 's has started to turn yellow the screen protector is ok , not super high quality , but it gets the cheap done - and for less than $ # , what more can you ask for
this cover traps heat inside the computer , my macbook air was burning up it is hard to put on , took me a while to get it on and does not fit perfectly the screen cover falls off and it is made of cheap plastic . the cover attracts a lot of dust , so i get throw it out the case has a small crack at the side when it came i am buying some other case for my macbook air this case sucks , it will ruin your computer or set your motherboard on fire crappy air vent , no air <unk> out
i would not purchase this product if i could do it again the case does not hold very well to the laptop i hear the clicks and every so often the case comes off when i close my macbook air i will invest my money elsewhere and also when my product arrived the corner of the bottom case was broken i did n't bother to report it because i did n't feel like it was that big of a deal , but i am not fully satisfied with this product it just feels like it does n't fit well
this case is so simple and has protected my air as if it were one of the more expensive and rugged cases i really do n't think i can use my computer without having this nice little casing on it to protect it
every time you touch the case you leave prints and they are impossible to clean off the key board cover is difficult to use when you want to type anything with two hands the case smells bad
shortly after putting this product on my laptop i cleaned it with a simple <unk> wipe and it <unk> the color of the plastic , for reasons i know not why also , the bottom does n't fit very well and when i transport my laptop with it it falls off
i got the turquoise the case and everything does its job the soft sleeve bag smells really bad the bottom of the hard case has four sticky cushions but one of the sticky cushions came off pretty quickly making my mac lopsided . but everything fit perfectly the keyboard is kinda hard to type on
the hard case is perfect and it fits my macbook like a glove however , it can be a little tricky to figure out how the top piece fits onto your computer the sleeve is perfect too and i use it whenever i store my computer or take it somewhere i do n't use the screen protector and the keyboard skin works well too the only reason i did n't give this product # stars is because it really is a lot of blue - and blue is my favorite color i only really use the hard case and the sleeve i got a <unk> keyboard cover to offset the enormous amounts of blue in the case and sleeve other than that , it 's perfect
good value for money spent their customer service is prompt and responsive the screen protector was not helpful i could n't get it on the bottom part of the case arrived broken , but they quickly sent out a replacement and i did n't have to hassle about sending the old one back or shipping labels etc .
this is a perfect assortment of items that one would need to protect their new macbook the only problem that i had with the items were they smelt really strong of product i had to leave the soft case in the garage because of the odor other than that , i would highly recommend
the bundle was awesome , we could not pass it up the cover , case and keyboard cover are awesome , for the price u get gray bundle the cover costs almost the same at other sites
for the price you can not beat this product i have gotten numerous compliments on the case it looks amazing and in addition it helps to protect my computer my favorite part of the package is the sleeve
i 'm very happy with my customized macbook i have been a pc user for a long time , but i am really enjoying the mac and i wanted to be sure to protect my investment so far so good , but i 'm not going to throw it on the ground to test it
i love the snap case it fits perfectly , feels great , protects , and is pretty the keyboard cover works very well and is pretty i really like the neoprene case the screen protector was an added surprise , but was useless i never got it to sit right on the screen and it did n't fit well the big thing for me was the snap on case for my macbook pro retina and that worked quite well
the screen protector is hard to put on but that is to be expected with a screen of such size other wise it was a great deal and the case looks
this is a misleading advertisement of what 's included the pictures and description advertise a wireless mouse as part of the bundle to be semi fair , the title does say mouse pad , not mouse regardless , why include a mouse in the picture as opposed to the mouse pad , and why say that a wireless mouse comes with the mouse pad , if that 's not what is included the keyboard cover was also already bent , so would n't stay on the keyboard properly the cover was absolutely not rubberized it 's pure plastic , no coating whatsoever needless to say , i was really disappointed upon receiving the package
everything that came in this package felt cheap , from the silicone keyboard cover to the thing that is supposed to protect my computer it does n't look nearly as nice as it does in the photo , so do n't fall for it the sleeve does n't even feel protective , and it arrived damaged i 'm very disappointed i 'm worried my computer will be scratched by the product more easily than it would without it
& # # ; did i just pay for this ? & # # ; save yourself that moment and move onto a better product the cover slips off the bottom of the macbook air , the keyboard cover looks like the second cousin of bubble wrap and the screen protector only ruins the quality of the display the only reason this shipment did not get a # -star rating was for the mouse it 's cheap looking but it works fine you paid for a great computer , do yourself a favor and spend the extra money on quality accessories
i ordered the bundle package the the hard case that shipped is about # & # # ; too large all the way around and does not fit at all the keyboard cover , screen cover and mouse were good i need a replacement on the cover to fit the macbook air # & # # ;
the color of the case does not look like the one on the picture , is not mint more like a hot blue the mouse is really great actually , the sleeve does not fit perfectly is a little bit loose
everything works great for the most part , especially the mouse which i did n't have any issues with the plastic case and screen protecter were slightly hard to get on my laptop , and i ended up not using the screen protecter after trying to put it on several times the keyboard cover seems cheaply made and sometimes comes off when i 'm typing the sleeve bag smells really bad and plasticy although it 's cheap quality , everything works well and ultimately serves it 's purpose , which , if that 's all you care about , then i would recommend getting this however , if you want to get a good quality <unk> , i would look somewhere else
everything is made of pretty cheap material , which is to be expected given the <unk> price as other reviewers said , the sleeve reeks of cheap plastic -lrb- the fumes were driving me insane , even after airing it out for # days -rrb- so i just threw that away immediately the case is lightweight but still too heavy for this thin laptop so i only keep the bottom portion on because the top one was weighing down my computer when i would push it back for more contrast the mouse is cheapy but works fine and the keyboard cover is the thing i like most
i really can not complain since the price was a steal on a good case that fits perfect the sleeve is not so bad , just do n't use it often the mouse works perfectly however , the keyboard protector does not fit and the screen protector is a pain in the butt to put on without air bubbles trapped in it and i do n't have that kind of patience it serves the ultimate purpose of the purchase so i 'm pretty happy giving it # out of # stars because if the keyboard and screen protector worked well it would have been the most <unk>
i wish the screen cover came with instructions , i had difficulty getting it on then found i had gotten fuzz under it so i threw it away other than that everything is amazing the case is a little difficult to snap on but if it were easy it would remove easily too the mouse works great , i like the storage compartment for the usb connector the sleeve also fits well and it protective i was <unk> by apple not to use the keyboard cover while using the computer as the keyboard is effectively the ventilation for the new airs i still plan on using it to keep dust out when not in use i received this within one week of ordering , with tracking and i could n't be happier with the seller
mouse cheap and thin fragile plastic screen saver also a cheap worthless film cover useful enough but color is a washed out minty color the only worth it part of this bundle was the snap on case kept it all just for that
the hard case prevents the screen open more than # degrees those two clip pieces on either end of the back is too thick i tried and got some scratches on my macbook air
great deal , works fine i 've had it for about # months now and the corners are starting to <unk> i do n't think i 'm overly hard on my electronics - keep things fairly protected , but i 'm going to have to buy something else now to protect my macbook
i bought this item because my computer needed protection and because of the price for the price , it is all plastic but worth it my computer is not getting additional scratches and i like the mouse -lrb- all cheap plastic -rrb- because it is wireless good deal if you are looking for basic protection ... very basic nothing fancy if you need basic protection for everyday use this is good if you are looking for protection from dropping this would not be what you want
shows dirt easily but other than that works fine good color keeps it protected keyboard piece and screen protecter were n't for me though just a good shell and travel
this is an okay product i have had this product for a little over a year and the hard shell case is already cracked and pieces of it are missing the carrying case and keyboard protector are still in great condition for the price , the product is decent if you want something that lasts , do n't buy this
the top does n't stay on very well at all i do n't use the mouse or mouse pad the bottom does keep the top from opening up further than without the case on
the sleeve was fine , but the hard case stains easily with handling , and the mouse is of cheap construction the best part was the keyboard cover the screen protector was n't an exact fit for the screen overall , this is an okay product
the best product is the cover for the keyboard the second best product is the soft cloth cover the hard case prevents my macbook air from working at all i love the color and is probably the main reason i bought it i am curious to know if anyone else found the same problem with their hard case cover
the color is great however , the sleeve is very thin and cheaply made the rubber case is great though very easy to snap on i would not purchase this again , but the price is what you paid for , so i should n't complain i guess
pro : everything is good the envelope case is of higher quality than i expected for the price the color is perfect , and everything is sized properly and seems sturdy i would n't have bought a mouse separately , so the one that came included -lrb- though very light -rrb- , will be great for my needs it even came with a promotional mousepad i would recommend this to anyone who wants a new look for their computer , or a commuter like me who needs a little bit of protection for it con : only complaint is that the keyboard protector that came with the computer does not stay on the keyboard the size is fine , but there is no kind of <unk> , so it just slips right off i wo n't be using that part of the package
it 's a great product for the price received it in a timely manner all features are very good -lrb- not sure about the mouse yet - just have n't tried it -rrb- i would recommend it
the best thing about this bundle is the keyboard cover , it fits perfectly and you can not even tell it 's on there it fits so snug that it reduces the click noise from pressing the keys the mouse works well too , i dont know why everyone is complaining about a & # # ; cheap feel & # # ; to it the laptop case it what feels cheap to me it has a cheap plastic feel to it and i imagine it will probably break within a year the carrying case is interesting , it fits very snug but you have to be very careful with it because any imprints made to it wont bounce back , once its there its there i paid # $ for it with shipping , and overall i am satisfied but i wish the quality of the laptop case was a bit better
it 's been # month , & so far so good purchased this for my son 's school issued imac love the snap case mouse is thin plastic & probably would n't stand up to constant use , but fortunately , my son does n't use it much mouse pad is really thin & arrived <unk> , but it 's really too thin & lightweight to be much good anyway the neoprene sleeve is good & like any other you could buy , but note it is a lighter color than the other stuff overall , i 'm happy with the purchase
i do n't use the mouse but the accessories i really like the cover has started to crack but it 's still working and protecting my macbook the sleeve has unraveled a bit after a month but it 's still serviceable the blue is pretty but it gets dirty quickly , at least with the sleeve i can reverse it so that the black lining is on the outside
came with four items and what a steal the color is more of a <unk> was hoping for an aqua blue but this color <unk> just have to buy # aaa batteries for the mouse to work
everything stated was included i love the feel and the look and it was a great deal mouse is a bit weird on some surfaces but other then that i am pretty happy i will definitely be buying from this seller soon
i love this macbook case it fits my macbook # & # # ; perfectly i have had the case for about six months now and it still looks brand new it protects my computer just like it should the computer pouch is also great the light blue color got dirty fairly quickly so i turned it inside out because the inside of the pouch is black it still looks great and you cant tell that it is actually inside out the rubber keyboard cover fits perfectly as well as the screen protector i have not used the mouse so i could not say how well it works i am very happy with this purchase !
i was a little <unk> about buying this bundle especially with it being so affordable , but i could n't be happier the color on the rubber case is exactly what i expected and it feels great the soft case comes in handy for extra protection when i 'm lugging my lap top around the mouse matches the case nicely but it feels a little cheap , but it works perfectly fine and for the price i 'm not going to complain i 'd recommend this product to anyone with the lap top
so many things included and all were good the cover is a good protector and it is pretty the soft case is easy to use and pretty the mouse was a great treat and works just fine the protector for the screen and keyboard were perfect the mouse pad is not so impressive , but i really bought the set for the pretty , functional covers
if your thinking about getting this for your new macbook air # in . get it ! ! just got my bundle a day ago and it made my whole day i absolutely love it everything you see in this bundle is what you get everything i expected and more to be honest and for a great price too ! i would definitely get it again totally worth it its just awesome .
it is a great deal for the money but also not to mention how beautiful it is and how great it works the case really protects my computer all around with boys in the house i 'm always so worried about dings and scratches mouse is <unk> and works great the sleeve is very light in color and that type of material gets dirty easy but can be easily cleaned i highly recommend this product !
this products work <unk> on my mac ! ! they fit very well and i 'm very happy with the color the keyboard cover is the best because it protects the keys so good ! !
too small for a # . # & # # ; <unk> portable dvd player ... . . but it is built with quality construction i like it but you need a portable dvd player or computer that is much smaller than a # & # # ; portable dvd player frequently when inserting my portable dvd player into this carrier the <unk> switch turns on and i must <unk> the dvd player
this bag is a great size for an # & # # ; macbook air without a case and has some nice pockets i 'm sorry to report it will not withstand even # minutes a light <unk> without soaking through this was a big surprise because while i know it 's not water proof , i assume it would at least be weather proof for # minutes
i purchased the # . # inch case for my # `` sony vaio laptop my vaio would barely fit inside i had to squeeze it in and fight the zippers shut i got an instant refund and i will be returning it shortly perhaps these cases work well for slimmer macbooks , but thicker pcs beware
i have two case logic sleeves for my old macbook pro # and one my ipad i bought this case hoping for protection for my new macbook pro # retina and the ipad however , the padding was very light and the inside of the case was lined with a rough nylon fabric you would need to place your laptop in a protective sleeve before you put it inside this case , to give the laptop cushion protection and scratch protection the rmbp # was very lose inside do not recommend for that laptop
i do n't have too many complaints except that i was hoping it would be roomy this fits my # . # pound samsung # inch laptop and some files from work , and a charger , cellphone and that 's pretty much it
i purchased this case and then returned it because i could n't fit a file folder or any # . # & # # ; x # & # # ; papers in the bag if all you 're looking for is a case to fit your ipad snugly , then this is a good choice the extra pocket has an organizer for accessories like pens , phone and other things i also like the removable shoulder strap i may consider this same bag but one size larger to accommodate other things i need to carry
i bought this to carry my asus x # ca the asus fits , barely i have a mouse short receiver on plugged in on the side of the computer in the usb port and this snags when putting it in the case taking it out defeats the purpose and <unk> losing it and i figured that being the size of a pad of letter size paper , i could put one in the case as well , to copy over notes into my files no way , there is not enough room i can fit the power cord and my mouse in the outside pocket and maybe a pen or two , but that is about it i realize now i should have bought a larger size to be able to carry a few more items if you are going to use this to just carry and protect the asus , and that is it - this should work just fine for you it is a very compact case otherwise and looks well built
nice - but if you use this for work and carry an ipad it may be too small i like to have my iphone , wallet , some make up , ipad , and a small folder it barely squeezes in this bag comes in # other sizes i am going to get the next lager
i bought two of these very nice case and holds all i need only two small concerns : # -rrb- the front pocket is very small , not very useful wish they made it larger . # -rrb- the zipper on one failed the first time i tried it , but they did send me a new case which seems fine seems like a good value
sturdy and small i used it for a # inch notebook and it is tight but does work the best i could find for my # & # # ; without spending a fortune
works well for my # inch macbook with accessories as well as room for some paperwork the case provides <unk> good protection for the computer the shoulder strap is a big plus
bought a # . # & # # ; tablet and bluetooth keyboard using the & # # ; computer & # # ; section for the keyboard <unk> pocket just has an <unk> fabric <unk> , but tab is in a case so it 's still protected would be better with padding can put ac adapter and other accessories in front pocket
it is very nice little bag , not too heavy , fits into my backpack very well -lrb- it is designed for # . # & # # ; notebook -rrb- the only thing i am not # % satisfied is that i wish it is a little bit bigger in the side the product says the dimension is # . # inch on the side , but my # & # # ; notebook with a side dimension # / # & # # ; barely fits in it would be better if it is half an inch longer on the side well , it works
well thought out case with ample room for accessories when you travel seems well constructed and my acer slim chromebook fits like a glove there is a divider on each side of where your laptop stores for papers etc and on the outside of the bag there is a good size compartment for all you cords and a small compartment for pens etc .
i use mine to hold my macair # `` and my ipad there is some room for a folder , and you can get the iphone , ipad and mac charger in the bag . the ext cord for the mac fits as well , but it starts getting bulky i my ipad is in a letter case and fits , and my macbook is in a sleeve and in a padded case , and that fits in only complaint , bag falls down , probably because of weight balance overall , it a nice bag , and nice price
nice small computer bag good for a # & # # ; system the good news is that this is my # nd one and i bought it because i liked the first one so much the bad news is that i had to buy a # nd one because the first started falling apart after a year
it 's a nice bag but it will not fit the lenovo ideapad flex # despite the fact that the listed dimensions indicate that it will the problem is that the corners of the bag are rounded while the corners on the ideapad are pretty much square we tried another case logic bag for # inch laptops that had the same issue we ended up having to order the # inch version to fit a # inch machine
this is a really solid laptop bag and is incredibly useful with an of the asus transformer line of laptops and tablets it easily fits all accessories and the device itself wish it came in different colors
bought this for my wife and her only complaint was that the shoulder strap was not comfortable but my wife 's # . # `` macbook air fits perfectly inside # out of
update : the bag <unk> broken which surprise me i uses the bag gently to carry ipad mini and small note unfortunately i am not able to return this item <unk> to the policy -- -- -- -- - i just realized that i am carrying an empty backpack . not empty but full with <unk> items thus i decided to carry a slim case wich fits a tablet , pens and notebook the case made from good material and i like the size -lrb- # . # -rrb-
i was surprised at how quick my order arrived and i was really very surprised at the capacity of the case , plenty of room to put in many extras apart from my ipad and seperate keyboard i have nothing negative to say about it , i would recommend it to anyone looking for a similar article
i have several case logic products and like them my only problem with this case is i wish i had gotten the next larger size to hold a few more items my fault , not the case
exactly what i needed for my ipad # , keyboard , iphone , and some work stuff this bag is fairly small , but can fit quite a few items in it solid construction , great price
had it for a few weeks for my macbook pro works great , sturdy and serves the purpose , although not as sleek as my earlier sleeve bag , but does the job , keeps my laptop secure and safe
i looked around at every laptop case on amazon and at staples , but went with the reviews about this one it is absolutely exactly what i wanted i have a dell # ultrabook but because of the battery that protrudes out the back a smaller # inch case would not do my laptop is # & # # ; wide by # & # # ; deep this case is great ... fits the laptop plus the fairly bulky power cord and some papers just in time for my trip to mexico
i love it it works great i have a macbook air and it fits great with my mouse it also has room for more items the strap is comfortable
great neat sturdy case with many pockets for adapter , hard drive cables i can only be disappointed with the many other cheaper chinese cases i have bought over the years instead of paying literally a few dollars more for these case logic branded ones
my ipad fits snugly but with easy access lots of nice pockets for cell phone , pens and pencils and paper notebook lightly padded with an durable <unk> covering convenient to use with either a shoulder strap or short handles and professional enough for the workplace absolutely love it
the case logic is very well made provides the means to stay highly organized whether ipad air , laptop or smart phone it all fits quite conveniently with easy access the case logic comes with a comfortable , removable shoulder strap and padded handle for easy portability and is a feature that use consistently the protection for the ipad and phone is just what i needed it is not too bulky and by no means awkward and the features are just as advertised the & # # ; luggage & # # ; strap is an added feature that securely attaches slim case to most rolling luggage neat product and i have recommended the same to family and friends
i bought this product for my surface pro # and the accessories it has plenty of space to accommodate the surface with type cover , a mouse , earphones , power charger , ethernet and mini display to vga connectors i can even put my cellphone in the external compartment , and still have space for other things
what i love about this is that it is slim and streamlined so that despite the weight of the laptop in the case , it never feels so bulky that you <unk> carrying it around it is manufactured with high quality materials and i get the impression -lrb- although i 've only had this for a few months -rrb- , that this case will last for a very long time the additional pockets are quite nice , but honestly i do n't use them that much i simply appreciate the solid construction and the <unk> of the case because it is a very portable it 's just as its name indicates : slim case
never had a bad case logic case and this one is no exception i bought it to house my high end acer iconia windows tablet it has room for the tablet , charger and a ton more paraphernalia if you need it , buy it you wo n't be
this is the perfect case for my lenovo yoga # s great quality product and perfect fit laptop , charger , mouse not tons of room left after that , but wanted a small compact case for a small compact computer
i have a case for my ipad already , but when im traveling , i <unk> had to hold my ipad in my hand this way , with this slim case , it comes with shoulder straps and all i do is sling it over my shoulder , and my hands are now free
perfect size case for my ipad since i got a bluetooth wireless keyboard # degrees rotate sliding cover case plenty of room and storage are for other items i took off the shoulder strap . great price and great quality !
i bought this when i got my samsung galaxy tab # . # , and it is everything i wanted it to be my tablet in the case fits perfectly , along with the charger , my cell phone , my bluetooth keyboard , etc . basically this thing can hold quite a bit of accessories for a tablet it 's not very thick even when it 's loaded down with all my stuff so it looks nice and professional
