my wife really wanted this color for her macbook air cover after only briefly having it , the bottom cracked and broke . i guess you get what you pay for . . but lame none the
i had a ten dollar gift <unk> so i only paid about # dollars it 's true to color in the picture my only gripe is that when i wiped the inside part down -lrb- for dusting purposes , prior to placing -rrb- the <unk> smudged off so there are a few spots with discoloration once placed on my mac
the case does n't fit my macbook air # & # # ; a # very well the bottom part is okay , but the top moves and clicks it is simply too big this is my second vendor with this item and i am giving up it arrived on time the color was pretty and just what was pictured i do n't necessarily fault the vendor because i am sure he does n't remove them from the plastic and try them on a macbook air to make sure they fit just one of those things
i have a decal on my macbook air , so i like how you can see through it i also love the soft rubberized touch , so it does n't feel like it 's going to slip when i hold it however , i ca n't seem to take the case off i can take the bottom part off , but not the top it 's very frustrating ... update # / # . # stars to # stars i still ca n't take the top case off i tried using credit cards , but i felt like i was breaking my cards and the case starting cracking , so i stopped trying the bottom case already cracked if anyone has any other suggestions without breaking my computer , please let me know
i like the fact that it 's a tiffany teal but it 's more pastel than i would have liked i expected it to be more translucent , and i had trouble snapping the bottom part correctly so much that i ended up cracking the top left corner of the cover there were no instructions on how to properly put it together i know it seems self-explanatory , but it 's my first macbook air and i had no idea how these covers work it definitely stays in place though , i might have trouble taking it off in the future
i liked the top case initially and fitted my macbook air fine however , it <unk> in several places and broken the bottom corners , so it does n't stay in anymore i bought it in june # and by february # it was broken already if you want to buy a product that fits well but do n't last , the top case will do it the seller offered a discount to <unk> , but i will not buy this product again
i just took it out of the package and tried to fit it on the bottom of my new macbook air . it looks like it will fit , but it does n't no matter how hard i try i 'm returning it for another
the product looks fantastic and the color is superb however the bottom piece did n't quite fit from the beginning the fact that this product was so affordable made me get over its imperfections unfortunately in a matter of weeks the bottom was unable to stay on my computer i would n't recommend this product to anyone who can afford one of the more expensive ones if you are just looking for a temporary case-this is great
i was n't happy with the quality of the product but the people at top case rubberized hard case offered to exchange my items out immediately they were professional and responded in a timely manner considering it was around christmas i would definitely shop with them again
i loved the color of this case and have had it for four months i have had several problems with it first , i was n't able to take of the top part of the case off which compared to the bottom , is a good thing second , the bottom part of the case began to fall apart all four of the pieces that held the bottom to the case have fallen apart the bottom part slides off whenever i try to pick it up i am dissatisfied and am already looking for new ones -lrb- though in a similar color -rrb-
i received two back pieces neither back piece snaps onto my laptop -lrb- model a # -rrb- there is always one side that does n't quite reach the & # # ; feet & # # ; are made of white foam and glued off center on one of the back pieces i have contacted the seller for a refund on the plus side , the case does n't cover both mic holes and the green color shown is pretty accurate
i was happy with the top part of the case that fit like glue the bottom part i had to change three times and its still not fitting in as i mentioned , its ok - not that great
nothing wrong with this case at all in terms of fit , but it is very cheap looking and i guess rubberized means different things to different people because i would n't describe this as such it does protect the computer a bit more than without it , so not a total loss
i have the new macbook air and to protect it i bought this it fits , but feels pretty nice but if you touch it with any mount of pressure on the end the clip will pop off and you have to push it back on again for the price it 's nice though the laptop still stays pretty thin , and the apple logo is still faintly visible
this case has served decently i bought it in january and one of the pieces which hold it in place has broken it has n't been a big problem yet , but these are definitely disposable as per the price color is good although more of a <unk> color than the bright , light blue pictured i like it
i get a lot of compliments on this case it looks really nice and fits perfectly only issue is it 's starting to fall apart , but it 's not bad considering how little i paid and how long it 's lasted
i like the color and it did arrive quickly however i had a really hard time getting it to fit onto my computer there were no instructions included on how to get it on and when i finally got it on correctly -lrb- it took three tries -rrb- it cracked on the bottom left edge from trying to push it on i had to put a dab of super glue on the crack to hold it together
the cover is the same exact texture and color that you see in the pictures from the seller the only problem that i ran into was the fact that the bottom piece was not sized correctly the top part snaps on with ease , but the bottom part does not snap on entirely to secure it it fits onto about # sides of my macbook air , but is not large enough to snap onto the final # th corner i 've had it for months now and it 's good quality material , just does n't fit right slightly annoying , but i got over it
the covers are a little flimsy and the feet on the bottom are kind of cheap foam material a couple of the foam feet are n't stuck to the designated foot area so it looks pretty cheap it does the trick and i was n't expecting anything fancy for the price i paid it 's just right for what i need
personally i was excited to get the case because i wanted a very nice durable electric blue colored case for my macbook air it was soft which i really liked meanwhile , i was a little upset when it arrived to see that the color was a bit darker than the color pictured on here apart from that it was all great a little over a month later , the part of the case under the trackpad , cracked ever since , the little tabs that hook onto your laptop at the sides have been falling off piece by piece and it 's overall falling apart it 's still usable but i doubt it 's going to last me more than a year or more
i originally bought it because i had seen the same cover on my friend 's mba in a ocean blue color , but the transparent one did n't turn out to be as aesthetically pleasing it gets the job done though
was n't as clear as i expected , and makes the air look cheaper the top piece fit nicely but i had troubles fitting on the bottom piece , there was always one side that was off from fitting in nicely so it tended to pop off in the end , it was n't worth the trouble and i took the case off ca n't knock it too much because of the price , but wish it had at least fit better
the top fit well but the bottom piece did not fit so well i got this as a gift for someone and they loved it besides the fact it did n't fit
this gets the job done and fits my mac air # ' model good i am not a fan of adding weight or size to the mac air , considering its small stature is its appeal but the air is so compact and the cover adds minimal size , its a fair trade off for protecting your investment cause <unk> knows we paid a arm and a leg for our airs
the case fits well on my apple macbook air # `` inch , the only complaint i have about it is that my decal sticker is not visible on the back you can see the apple emblem through the back though the product does n't come with any instructions to place it on your computer , but you do not need them the case is very easy to put on your computer the color is close to the picture shown here ; it is somewhat duller though after having this case for # months it has cracked and i 'm never rough with my computer the clips on the sides cracked a few months ago and i have now discovered a larger crack on the bottom side of the case it was cheap , but i expected it to last a little longer than it has guess i will be buying a new case soon
the cover fits perfectly and provides great protection for the price however , the color is a little greenish as opposed to a sunny yellow and it also came with some imperfections definitely a great value , but next time i would probably splurge for higher quality
i like the case and it looks good and definitely protects the computer , but the clips have been breaking just from a normal amount of opening and closing the laptop they seem really brittle and just sort of crumble so far two of the four clips that hold the bottom piece on have broken - if another breaks i am not sure if the case will stay on or if it will just fall off
i use the bottom part of the case , but not the top part the top does n't stay on , so it 's pretty much useless the bottom clicks right into place i guess it was cheap and that is why i did n't send it back
the case is a nice color and had a good feel to it , but the top comes off easily , it might be because the top of the macbook air is so thin
i got the color `` green `` for my macbook air there are no instructions -lrb- as others have stated -rrb- , but it 's pretty simply to snap on each piece the top piece fits well , but my only complaint is that the bottom piece does not snap on perfectly it seems as if the bottom piece was just slightly short in width but , for the price , this case is worth it under $ # and i can live with one minor detail that wo n't change my day to day operation
it 's not very rubberized at all the color is pretty but would be prettier if a little more translucent but mostly i ordered it because it was & # # ; rubberized & # # ; it 's just ok
case works great only had it a few weeks and it 's suddenly developed a strange & # # ; skin condition & # # ; and i do n't know why the thing has been sitting on top of my desk wrapped around my computer since i got it it 's flaking in one section on the top of the computer the spot where this is happening is right above the power cord plug maybe it 's a heat issue although the cord does n't <unk> much heat and i would think the bottom - where it heats up most of the time - would start flaking first it 's weird other than that , not a bad case
i was so excited to receive my first case for my new macbook air when i opened the package , the color was just the way i liked it and the case itself looked very decent and durable however , once i tried to put the bottom case on my macbook , some of the clips could n't clip on i spent probably a good # minutes trying to fit my bottom case . . but decided to give up the top case was much easier to put on though so as of right now , my laptop is sporting ` the top but <unk> '
the product was what i had expected it to be and i was not disappointed however it broke when i put it on granted this could have been a operational error on my part , i still had to order a different case which was unfortunate
this case is very true to color , i ordered the aqua blue and also got the keyboard cover there are a few things i do n't like though i have had this case for about # months , and the snaps that hold it on keep breaking , mostly on the bottom part of the case also , i really do n't like the material of it it is very matte , and it has gotten really dirty from fingerprints and everything else it is a good case to have if your just looking for something to cover it , but now mine needs to be replaced because it wo n't stay on for much longer i really like the keyboard cover though
it shows <unk> spots , but i like it i liked the color of it but already switched to pink i am sure i will use it again it snapped on and stayed on without a problem
this case is smooth and has a lovely feel to but it 's too much of a solid color i was hoping it would be lighter , or at least light enough to see the apple logo i added some <unk> to it but it 's also very had to stick anything to the material also anyone looking for a light teal color should know it 's different from a teal color , it 's pretty much exactly the color in the picture also make sure you it matches your model
for the cost , i say this case is great does n't fit # % , but its good enough but only gets # stars because it is cracking -lrb- after about # months of owning it -rrb- but it is in the areas i always grab it to pull it out of my bag
i ordered this particular product and it feels good on my mac air due to its rubberized coating however , its originally made of plastic so its really hard and decrease value of # k worth of laptop another thing bothers me is the plastic is so heavy that when i use laptop in my lap with screen leaning back , its just completely falls back due to weight of the case so , now you have lightest laptop with heaviest case
it is great looking not a perfect fit as in not as tightly fitting as i would like it , but i am pleased with it for every other reason and thanks for a prompt delivery
i like the case , however , the bottom case section does not snap onto my computer all the way i like the case , and love the color i just dont like that it wont snap on all the way so i am going to get a new one
i like the bottom part of the case but the top part is hard to get on and it does n't show the apple logo through like it presents in the picture online i am not even using it
the black color looks awesome on my mac but it did not came with the mouse that <unk> they were offering i would give it a five stars if it came with the mouse
this case was good , i just ordered the wrong size i never actually used it so i do not know how well it hold up , but it seemed to be a good case
brighter in person than online plastic is pretty brittle compared to other covers i 've had it 's a fine case but not my favorite since it 's a brighter neon orange <unk> , compared to the online image
the little tabs that hold the case in place are very fragile and break without reason two of the tabs are already broken so i assume i will have to buy a different case soon i have only had it for about # months
i purchased the new version of this case when the old one i was using developed too many cracks around the edges the new case is nice because it <unk> the second mic , but it does n't seem to attach to the bottom as well the hooks on the back corners are no longer there and the front clips do n't seem to stay on it serves it 's purpose and keeps my macbook air safe , but the older model was better in my opinion
the case had a nice color and it did n't make the computer too heavy like some cases did , but when i tried putting on the case it took me # minutes just to put it on the computer and some parts did n't even fit correctly so i just had to leave it as it is i felt like i was going to break the computer just from putting a case on it
this cover fits my daughters computer well and she loves the color not sure what part of it is rubberized it is all <unk> was disappointing but for the price we kept it
this case keeps my computer from being scratched , but i would not expect the case to prevent any other damage the case has a few flaws , such as , it constantly gets covered with fingerprints and sometimes pops off of the computer it is a little difficult to get the case to fit onto the computer , so it is frustrating to try to get it back on for the price of the case , i am not disappointed with my purchase it is keeping my mac safe i just hope i do n't accidentally drop it
did n't really fit that well and the little pieces of plastic that hold the case on started breaking and snapping off that said , it 's a good case for the money and a good choice if you 're like me and change things often
i brought two cases , one blue and one pink i am satified with my pink case , it is great it fits my mac air also , the color is same as the picture however , the blue one made me kind of disappointed one corner of the case is stretched and it is tight enough
it was cute , but got very cloudy and dirty looking that would never wash off pain in the ass to take off but hey , it was cute and did its job protecting my
i guess fine for $ # or <unk> did n't really snap on as well as i 'd like the plastic shows a surprising amount of fingerprints i put on lotion a lot which may be why but again , i guess i got what i paid for
i got a macair and wanted to get a cover , just to make it colorful i was not looking for a protective case i currently have the case on my macair , and it looks nice both portions of the case do n't fit my air perfectly , though in fact , the top portion of the case has come off a few times i do n't know if i just need to use more force to put it on , but i do n't want to risk breaking my computer to see so , for the price and color , it works for me
when i first got this case i noticed that it did n't quite fit right , i could not snap the other side on my mac air it eventually did fit , but there are two more snaps in the front that do not fit over it it 's still really nice , it 's not plastic like others are , it has more of a rubbery texture to it also , now that the cover is on i could not get it off again ... because it 's such a tight fit . i did get it off by <unk> two thin credit cards between the case corners and just sliding them until the cover popped off hopefully this does n't happen to anyone else , if it does : contact the seller -lrb- i did -rrb- and they will be more than happy to send you a new one if you want
the case does not fit well the bottom is very hard to snap completely into place other than that , it is made well , it is just a little off though
i love the color , and the case is really pretty it snaps on , fits properly , and meets all my basic needs for a case unfortunately , it is kind of cheaply made and it wore out very quickly it is still on my computer for now , but the edges and tabs randomly started chipping / breaking off for no reason also , the two of the little foamy things on the bottom -lrb- the feet , basically -rrb- fell off right away my computer would get really hot with it on at first too , but i learned how to work around that the keyboard cover is always <unk> too but i suppose that is to be expected
case cracked pretty quickly regardless , i 've kept it on & it 's worked fine i 'm sure it 'll continue to get more cracks & , when if begins to fall off , i 'll get a new one you get what you pay for
the case does the job and give a little extra protection from small dings , but the spots were the computer clicks into the case are weak the left side tab on the bottom part has already chipped off after only three months of use
its a super cute case though one of the clips did not clip on and it was not as easy to put on despite the one clip not snapping on the cover looks awesome
the case came on time and found us on vacation however , the bottom part was broken in the corners and we could not find the missing parts in the packaging so we believe it came this way not happy with the packaging it came in just a plastic envelope no padding , or bubble wrap to protect it
i got this case because the top edge of my macbook air , near the hinge , is sharp and uncomfortable to my hand because of the way i like to hold the laptop the top of the case solves this problem nicely it <unk> a worse problem though : the extra weight of the top cover causes the computer screen to gradually <unk> down and away if i wiggle the computer a bit it slumps immediately this case appears to be made of polyethylene and it 's . # inches -lrb- about # . # mm -rrb- thick perhaps a thinner one would be lighter and not have this problem
i have no issues with the top but the bottom pops off every so often i find myself daily having to put it back on and i do n't use the computer that much maybe one or two more centimeters and this would n't be an issue i would n't buy another one like this other than that , i like the look and feel easy to clean it just wo n't stay on
when i got this case out of the packaging , i tought the green looked really nice and very similar to what 's online but , after using it for about a month now , it has started to show signs of wear initially , i thought it was fingerprints , so when i wiped it off , i was surprised to still see that it was still there my advice is get the black one if you are worried about the wear
it is a tight fit and i actually chipped one of the corners trying to get it on but it 's on and i like it it 'll keep the original case safe from scratches and dirt
the bottom fits too tightly , it 's hard to put on and take off and the top needs more snaps to keep some edges on i was even worried about it scratching my macbook but the color and the feel is okay
i just needed something to cover the edges of my mac snapping it on and off was a hassle and i ended up breaking off the two corners also , the front is a fingerprint magnet oh my goodness it does the job , not well but it does the job
i was thinking this would be a little more dark in color and a little more thicker rubber its very thin and flimsy . but it seems to be doing the job as far as covering my mac .
i love the color and fit of my case so much you get exactly what it looks like however , i 've been trying to remove the top portion for months i ca n't even get it off using credit cards to slide under the clips because the cards are too thick i need to clean my computer but i feel like if i use any more force i could break the screen of my air not worth it so , if you 're planning on wanting to clean your computer often , i would n't recommend it i honestly am afraid of breaking my computer because of it . it would receive # stars if it was n't for this
this was a little hard to get on my computer because the hooks are small and it is very tight i am not sure i could ever get it back on again if i took it off
i love the feel and the color but the material is brittle the bottom part i have had to <unk> because the securing hooks have broken off i still have the top part but as this point it is more decorative than protective
this case does n't actually fit my computer perfectly it does go on ok , but it 's supposed to snap onto the top , and it 's a little too small , but still does the job brilliant colour , good price but you get what you pay for
it fits just fine , the color is exactly as pictured but the only downfall is that the case sometimes snaps off in one place but that just may be the case they sent me i keep it on my laptop everyday and it does n't block anything from being plugged in or accessed
i love the color however it is a clear green which means whenever there is a mark you can see it i can not open the computer all the way because the back <unk> with the bottom portion with this product you get what you paid for not horrible because it semi protects the computer however i can not see this lasting more than # months
i 've purchased this product twice it 's not incredibly difficult to put on your mac , although you will have to work with it a little bit it took me a total of # minutes to get the thing on the hard part is taking it off it <unk> to your mac like a tick to a deer i had to break the first one off of the computer it does an adequate job of protecting the laptop otherwise i will probably not repurchase this product and will get something a little pricier next time
i bought this after many reviews and i thought i made a good purchase for being only $ # the color is nice , but it does look a little cheap after reading reviews about scratching when taking off the case , i decided to try taking it off it did not damage my mba , but it was hell taking it off i 'm not too impressed with this product because the back clip stopped the screen from going all the way back the way it should i think after some time this will scratch the screen where the clips meet the bottom of the screen
- very good <unk> <unk> snug on my laptop -lrb- macbook air # - does a really good job protecting from small shocks and <unk> - gets dirty very <unk> be very difficult to remove -lrb- i snapped a piece while taking it off after leaving it on for a little longer than a month and a half i think it 's a great value and protected my laptop pretty well my biggest complaint is how easily it attracts fingerprints and smudges i 'm a clean guy and did n't have a single <unk> on my laptop w/o the case -lrb- save for the occasional one -rrb- but once i attached the case they were everywhere this could 've been overlooked if it were n't for two things : # -rrb- the case is n't the easiest to clean , # -rrb- i really like the look of my macbook air i figured it was worth the trade-off to have a case if it added a little more protection but the amount of prints it attracted was astounding i have since removed the case and opted for a travel bag that adds a little cushion for protection instead
i really loved this case the color is perfect , exactly how it shows on the picture but it does not fit my macbook air the bottom does not snap on one of the sides i tried everything but it just wo n't work the top case fits well , but came with a smudge stain . : / the keyboard is nice too but the only thing is that the top row does not match the original keys i love the product but i guess we just do n't all have the luck to get it to fit
ca n't complain too much as it was cheap it does feel a bit cheap it was for my girlfriend so i did n't inspect it much until i just used her laptop i noticed that you ca n't extend the screen all they way back without the top and bottom cover rubbing and making a cracking sound so it 's not a perfect fit but it was cheap and it is protecting her laptop from everyday scratches
no clicking , or other issues as noted by other reviews price was great would purchase again not as heavy duty as others , but for the price , more than content
its nice to know you have that <unk> protection considering these computers are a definite investment if you want a nice set up some times its the little things that make your toys stand out and add functionality great price <unk>
as with other buyers , i could not get the little tabs on one side to come up and over the laptop edge i guess if i were anal it would bother me but it stays on ok so i ignore it
i recently bought a # macbook air this product does a really nice job keeping it safe i doubt it 'll save your macbook if it falls from way up high but at least it keeps it scratch and dent free <unk> , this case looks really nice , the apple logo shines clearly through the case and it feels nice to the touch there is n't any installation instructions but its all pretty intuitive when installing the top part -lrb- the one that goes on the screen -rrb- , the side with three tabs goes in the border of the screen that has the webcam you 'll notice that there is a groove in each side of the case that matches the grooves in the bottom half to sum it up , its a really nice case at a good price that 'll keep your macbook air safe from minor accidents
i would n't purchase any other case cover since it does the job i really like it , the only problem is that it gets dirty easily and its really noticeable but it is nothing you ca n't fix
giving it # stars only because the bottom piece does n't snap completely on all sides it still fits and does not fall off but may cause an issue in the future
i had some issues with the first one i bought , it was broken on the side -lrb- just a small piece was missing -rrb- i emailed the company thought and they immediately shipped me another one the only complaint i really have is they get dirty rather easy i love mine though and i do n't even care because it makes your computer super cute
i 've had this case for a few weeks and it 's held up better than expected some of the edges are rougher than i 'd like and there 's a couple small chips by the corners but the case has n't cracked and stays on fairly tightly the color is true to the picture and a wonderful accessory the apple logo is clearly <unk> through the case when the power is on - i was really concerned about this prior to purchase and am really happy about the look
ca n't complain about it too much the only thing i do n't like is how easily it scratches if it did n't scratch so easily , it would be perfect from a protection standpoint , works great , and it does n't fall off
item just as described this is my second one the first one lasted about a year , which i thought was pretty good since it 's in and out of my backpack and is used a lot everyday
i got mine in & # # ; hot blue & # # ; , which is just as it looks online , but maybe a little less neon in person anyway , it snapped onto my # & # # ; macbook air easily it looks cute , is a great color , and is protecting the outside from scratches , just like it 's supposed to it 's a great price and i do n't think there 's much more you could ask for from a computer cover
this came incredibly fast i like the yellow color i had previously bought it in orange from another vendor and after # . # years one of the snaps broke off so i thought it was time for a new one and decided to try a different color the only reason i am not giving it # stars is that my old one had & # # ; legs & # # ; that allowed the laptop to be placed in an ergonomic position for typing i like that feature and this one does not have it
i like it i like the color , -lrb- red -rrb- the transparency , and the matte finish the case fits my macbook air # i was excited when i read another review that said that the case fits snugly because the last case i had was too loose this case started out fitting tightly , but now the bottom slips off easily the top still fits snugly
i was excited to get this new case in the mail and it actually came a few days early i 've found after a few days of use that finger prints will show up and you have to wipe it down to get them off - not a big deal , but be aware it does fit nice and snug to my macbook air , though and i was pleased that the rubber feet on the bottom seem to be of quality i was expecting them to be cheap and fall of easily overall , it 's a great buy for the price
i love the matte feel to it and its a perfect combination of hard yet soft case fits very well the top cover gets dirty pretty easily with fingerprints but im sure theres a way to clean it
the color is true to image i like the <unk> finishing on the case , but because of that matte texture , it can easily get dirty , such as pencil marks , which are hard to wash off also , i notice that the case has cracked at the bottom when it has never been dropped other than that , it does protect the laptop , and quality is pretty thick
overall great case for the price ! beautiful tiffany blue color ! and t matches there chevron keyboard cover and mouse beautifully ! ! i love the material because it does not show fingerprints two minor flaws is that the case fits nearly perfect but left side of my computer where the two speakers are does n't fit slightly over the actual computer to click it on you can hardly tell it is very minor but still not perfect both speakers remain uncovered so the speakers are fine the material also covers the apple symbol leaving the case looking very plain so i would recommend putting on one of the stickers that apple provides you when you by the computer otherwise its great
this case was cheap and it fit well i love both the colour and the texture of this case i would highly recommend it for anyone looking for a case on a budget
the case itself is very good and does an excellent job this was ordered with a keyboard cover but the company charged individual shipping of about $ # for each , even though the keyboard cover weighs almost nothing also , some of the key symbols were not correct i found that apple changed their keyboards recently and i had not read the description clearly enough i wrote a review , and was quickly contacted by the manufacturer they refunded the shipping and sent a new keyboard cover therefore , i 'm very happy with the company for doing such a great job of taking care of the problems
unfortunately i bought the wrong one for my macbook air but it fit my sisters older generation just fine loved the feel as opposed to the plastic plan to get the right
