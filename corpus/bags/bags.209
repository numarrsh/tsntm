the color is more blue in person its a fragile thin plastic that could break and scratch easily the case is only $ # , so my expectation was not high this case will only prevent against minor scratches it does not cover or protect back -lrb- bottom -rrb- corners of computer if you are looking for more protection this is not the case for you , you will have to spend a little more but if your looking for a little protection , and something that is stylish looking this will do the trick keyboard cover is cheap plastic as well , and fits descent overall , it 's good for what you pay for -lrb- if you need to return it cost you $ # , so might as well keep it
i really like this case like the description , it is a crystal see through type of case , so it looks like a tinted crystal the pictures make it look <unk> , but it is very see through despite that , i really like the color i got i rated it # stars because after a few weeks dust gets trapped between the case and laptop since my laptop was scratched before i got the case i 'm not sure if whatever gets in between is scratching it also , the keyboard cover that comes with it does n't fit perfectly to the keys it 's pretty nice for being free though
i liked this case for a while and did n't have any problems with it it 's a pretty color -lrb- less bright than the photo but i actually like it better this way -rrb- and generally a nice case it 's been about six months since i got it though and it 's cracking on the corners , which is weird seeing as i have n't dropped it or handled it roughly in any way oh well , it was cheap - you get what you pay for i guess
this product shipped out yesterday and i received it in the mail this afternoon the color is gorgeous - not quite the color that is shown in the picture , but i do think that i like this color more the material it is made out of is fairly thick not as thick as some of the other macbook covers i 've seen , but for the price , you really ca n't beat it it fit perfectly on my # inch macbook , and i 'm in love with how it looks already i wo n't be using the keyboard cover , however ; it makes it a little difficult to type , and it looks tacky on the whole , i 'm pleased with my purchase you get what you pay for , and you ca n't expect top quality for something under # bucks
this case is very protective and the color is great my computer had just gotten a little dent and that is because i didnt have a hard shell on it
not only was the case very cool , but the company selling was great i like the color of the case very much i was expecting it to look a little different , but i like what i recieved
i love this laptop case it was easy to put on and looks exactly as it does in the picture : -rrb- the color is very vibrant and it even came with a clear keyboard cover that i was unaware of the case really protects my laptop and also has slip proof feet on the bottom to keep it from sliding the keyboard cover works great it does n't slide around and keeps dust and other unwanted mess from getting between the keys overall i love this product :
i was a bit worried that this case would be a little too bulky or not as vibrant as it was in the picture once i put it on my laptop , i was so pleased it fit perfectly , it 's not in the way , and the color is exactly like it is in the picture
received this and was surprised at how plasticky and cheap it looked and felt i have returned it for credit it also did n't look like it would protect the mac book very well
i do n't really take my laptop anywhere i mostly use it at home and very rarely move it from my desk , so imagine my surprise when the corners on this thing started cracking
the color is a little lighter than in the picture , but pretty accurate overall the product itself felt more plastic-like than i thought it would be -lrb- since it 's supposed to be `` rubberized satin `` -rrb- it seems like it 's more of a plastic base with a thin rubber coating on top i have a mid- # `` macbook pro and it fit pretty tight after struggling to get it on , it 's stayed on - so it 's doing it 's job in addition , part of the case has cracked after about a month of daily usage -lrb- and no drops -rrb- it does protect against scrapes and such though
i really love the color of this product but i had a really hard time getting the bottom part to fit onto my computer i had to use pliers to bend one of the tiny lips that latch onto the computer the top part fits perfectly
i received my case right on time but when i opened it , i found that i had ordered a case that was a much brighter color than i thought it would be its a nice color , just a little bright for my taste fits the computer well , but i found i had to force the top cover on , as its a little tight overall this is a nice case
i would definitely recommend this product purchased it for my daughter 's macbook pro in her favorite color she always gets a lot of compliments about how nice it is i love it because it securely protects my investment
it 's ok for what it is it certainly will offer your mac some protection , as in better than none it 's light enough and offers some protection when carrying it around in a bag or briefcase it 's the least i would do in order to protect your mac
the sleeve is lightweight and durable with very thing cushioning it 's perfect for your day to day transportation the fact that it zips all the way around to the back is a major plus because you can open and use your laptop without having to completely remove it from the sleeve overall it 's a great case for the price you pay due to the thin cushioning if you 're one who seems to be more accident prone , you know who you are ... you probably want something with a little more padding the seller was wonderful packaged was <unk> on time and in prime condition highly recommend the seller
like some other reviewer i do not own a mac , but it was perfect size for my tab and accessories for the price , you ca n't go wrong it has a impact resistant protective outer shell it can handle small drops and impacts , and protect the screen from scratches i like the big zippers as it allows easy access i gave it four stars simply because it is pretty generic looking , but it does do the job as advertised and its well worth the price
this says it 's for the macbook , but i actually put my ipad in it as well as my notebook and pencil i use for class it holds them very nicely , and now i do n't have to worry about dropping my ipad while juggling my books , notebook , and pencils the zipper handles are kind of chunky which i like because it makes them very easy to grab zipping and unzipping is very smooth , and it has never gotten stuck both the inside and outside of the case are very soft so nothing could get scratched the only thing i do n't like is that outside of the case <unk> fuzzies like crazy i 'm always picking them off , but it is only a minor flaw other than that i think it is a great case and carrier for my ipad and notebook i got this product free for my honest review this is my opinion after receiving and testing the product myself
this is a great bag i can use it not only for the laptop but also to carry sheets of paper and a pen it is so soft and lightweight best of all it wo n't show dirt if you have small children or grandchildren and it does get something on it , just wipe it with a soft wet cloth and you are good to go it seems to be made of good materials the zipper seems to be very sturdy this is a terrific priced item if you are in need of a good bag for your computer , give this a try
i like this laptop sleeve because the zipper is easy to use and it opens all the way so i do n't have pull my laptop out from the top i can set it down and open it all the way to keep it cushioned on the sleeve -lrb- no scratches on the bottom of my laptop -rrb- it is soft and offers good protection it wont show dirt and i like that its very lightweight i recommend this product
disclaimer : i received this product in exchange for an honest <unk> sleeve was nice enough you certainly wont mistake it for real leather , and it isnt really anything exceptional per se , but it is definitely exactly as described it is in fact ideal as a cover that you use to travel with your notebook ours fit in here fine and the cable tie really is all you need to close this all in all , a decent product i dont think you would regret purchasing this
this is a very sturdy case and it fits and protects my new macbook pro perfectly i saw the same case sized to fit the ipad design was a brilliant idea great product i highly recommend
i do n't use that much , but when i used it , i find it is easy to use and for the price i paid , worth it this is why i bought this
i used it for my # -inch macbook air and it is perfect the <unk> on the top does exactly what you 'd think it would the fit is maybe a bit loose vertically though , probably to accommodate the # -inch ultrabooks but it is n't such a problem that you should avoid buying it
the sleeve reeks of chemicals and now my laptop smells like it too i would not suggest buying this product the material is so thin , it really wo n't protect your laptop anyway the price is right and the shipping was fast , but it 's not worth it i do n't think is safe to even be using this product
i really like this small and simple case based on appearance , but it has a strong chemical smell i attempted to hand wash the cover and that did not improve the smell very much pay the extra money to get a case that is cute and smells good !
this case is just beautiful i love the colors seems very well made there is only one problem it smelled so bad like gasoline i had to keep it outside for # weeks before the smell was dissipated enough to use it just touching it made my fingers smell like chemicals otherwise , it fits great , looks great , and is just what i wanted i just do n't like the idea of being <unk> from off-gassing
as previous reviews mentioned , this item is just a # & # # ; sleeve , not necessarily for macbook pro , and certainly not for the macbook pro with retina display it does smell like chemicals , but it 's considerably reduced after a few days i ended up buying an <unk> dual fold cover for my macbook pro with retina display , but this was worth the $ # gamble
very convenient to use the only negative i 'd say is when i received it there were some indentations in the case that i thought would go away by now but have n't still cute and durable
this product is a nice quality , but because of the way it folds closed the computer is only loosely protected i have a macbook pro which kid slimmer than other versions so this could have been the cause of the issue
this is a great case and its <unk> cheap it does come with a few dents in it but it was only # dollars so i really cant complain fir the price its a great deal ! ! ! i love the color and its super cute ! ! !
terrible quality -lrb- thin , cheap feeling material -rrb- offgassing chemical smell i had a neoprene case made by incase for a past macbook thought i could get away with this cheaper one sending it back asap
i got this case just to have something covering my mac when it 's in my backpack and i am very pleased with it the smell when you first take it out of the packaging is pretty strong but that is expected since it is a plastic product it eventually went away and i ca n't even smell it at all anymore i would recommend this
the case is accurate in color to the picture gets a lot of compliments i just wish that it had a separate pocket for the cords and such but it works just fine other wise fits right into my bag
i needed a slim neoprene sleeve for my toshiba satellite e- # and there 's nothing out there specifically made for that machine i got this sleeve , noting the dimensions of a # & # # ; macbook pro are just a little wider than my laptop it 's not the most snug fit , but it will do a fair job of protecting the laptop from scratches while i 'm traveling it would have been nice to have the dimensions of this case listed anywhere in the description so i would know ahead of time whether it would be a good fit outside dimensions are # x # inches -lrb- # x # cm -rrb- as others have noted , this is a sleeve , not a case : there 's no room to carry cables or peripherals , no handles , and no protection from drops or all but the most gentle bumps it will however keep out dust , prevent scratches , and give you something to hold on to with a little more grip than the outside of the laptop great sleeve for use inside another bag it does smell strongly of plastic give it a couple days to air out before using
for the price , this is a great case the color is lovely and the material is nice it is a bit loose on my # & # # ; macbook pro , but that does n't bother me really it 's nice to have a case that does n't bulk up the already hefty metal macbook
this is a nice cover the color was exactly the same with the picture when i got mine i think this can really protect my macbook but i wish they made a pocket for the charger because i when i bring my laptop with me , i bring everything so ca n't put any accessories , just the laptop and when it came in , it had a very powerful factory smell it does n't smell brand new but after few weeks it went away so for me , this is a nice bag for the laptop overall and i would definitely recommend it
i 'm a <unk> , and one of my many hats is running graphics <unk> at meetings and conferences my macbook pro spends a lot of time out of the office - either in my car or on the road when i 'm flying i carry it in a pelican case as a carry-on i carry a lot of gear in the case , and needed some added protection for the macbook this sleeve is a great fit for the macbook pro # , not too tight so you do n't have to wrestle with it to get it in seems to be well made , i love the color , and it provides just the right amount of cushion when stacked in my case with my other laptops
use this for my samsung series # in laptop its a little loose fitting but obviously it was made for a mac book pro so i 'm not complaining other than that i everything about it
i bought this for my daughter for her birthday she was so excited and then went to put it on her macbook pro # & # # ; and it was too small she could n't even use it went to double check the description and size of the product and it is for her exact macbook but it would n't fit neither the top or the bottom part of the case fit it is completely useless i ca n't even return it because it is past the time allotted for returns we were both completely disappointed i 'm out money and she is out a birthday gift until i can find something else for her
i bought this package looking for the hard case , everything else was an added bonus but the case itself did not fit my # & # # ; macbook pro ... it was too
the positives to this deal was that the package arrived quickly and the mouse works just fine however , the hard case for the # `` mac was too small and did not fit properly the case and the sleeve also have a very strong plastic smell that can be nauseating after a while i was also annoyed that if you consider returning this , you have to pay for it yourself i went to ups and they were charging me $ # to ship it back , so it was n't even worth returning it at all
i would not use the plastic screen cover that comes with this , it 's incredibly sticky and i did n't think i would be able to take it off again if i put it on i bought it for the plastic snap on case , and that fits fine but does not protect the area around the track pad and keyboard the mouse also works but does not include batteries the silicone keyboard protector flops around and does n't fit too well
i loved the color so much but now only after # months the bottom portion of the case has cracked it now gets caught on everything it makes me really upset due to the beautiful color and i get so many complaints on it now i must buy another one
i have a # macbook pro with retina display -lrb- no disk drive -rrb- , i read the reviews before purchasing and crossed my fingers that the hard shell case would n't bee too small ... but it is like other reviewers said , the bottom piece is just the tiniest bit too small but just enough that it wo n't latch on no matter how hard you try but on the bright side , the top piece fits fine . the screen protector is difficult to apply , and i ended up with some bubbles , but when the screen is on you cant see them anyway i am using the keyboard cover now and it is very awkward . it seems that the size of the keys on the cover are too small , so the computer 's keys do n't actually fit inside the cover just sits on top , leaving a space between the key and cover havent tried the mouse yet -lrb- needs aaa batteries -rrb- and the soft cover is sitting outside to air out the smell
i liked this product at first but after a few weeks the bottom half of the hardcase -lrb- the entire reason why i bought this product -rrb- broke and no longer stayed on my laptop additionally the keyboard cover does n't fit right and is <unk> along the bottom edge there is n't really any problem with the screen protector the sleeve is fine and i rarely use the wireless mouse but it appears fine
i recently bought this for my macbook pro # . # & # # ; and the soft cover fit and the mouse works great but the actual hard case covering did n't fit at all ! it was just barely to small like my computer grew out of it or something what a disappointment it was on time and in good packaging <unk> dont recommend someone else buying this for their computer unless you really just want the mouse , soft cover and keyboard glove -lrb- which fit perfectly ... oddly
the plastic parts fits perfectly , a few clicks and it 's done it makes your <unk> to look like plastic but it will avoid scratches my wife liked it the keyboard rubber protector is terrible it does n't fit the keyboard and i could n't use it more than # minutes the sleeve bag looks to be a bit larger than the mbp i think it was n't made thinking on the macbook but on a # inch laptop anyways now i use to put the mouse and the power adapter inside it together with the mbp -lrb- it still looks loose inside -rrb-
i was so excited to receive this product as i really needed something to protect my macbook i loved it until i opened the case and the top of the case already had scratches all over it i do , however love the color and will still be using it but i wish it came in new condition seeing as it is a new product
lucky that the hard case fits perfect , though a bit <unk> than i expected keyboard cover does n't quite fit , gap at bottom the soft shell has a toxic smell which will hopefully fade over time unsure of proper use of the screen cover as there are two clear plastic sheets with really odd instructions would give it # . #
the case looks a bit cheap and does n't fit exactly right when you lay your arms down to type , the case pokes into your wrists the mouse is cute the skin does n't exactly fit the keyboard either
i love how fast i recieved it , and it really is a great deal ive had it for like # weeks now the screen protector fits super nicely and if youre careful putting it on you wont get any bubbles the top and bottom covers are good too , if you buy it by the model number of your mac they should fit perfectly the only thing i wish was different is that the covers arent as sheer as i hoping , they are a pretty solid color , the apple still shines through but still the keyboard cover fits snug too it took me some time getting used to typing with it , but its not uncomfortable over all if youre looking for a practical cover this is probably the best deal <unk> find just remember to search for it using your mac 's model number found on the bottom towards the top in the middle . other wise you might get something that wont fit your mac
this is a fabulous buy the case offers the protection i want plus the sleeve is awesome the keyboard cover is so easy to see with the black letters and it keeps everything out of the keys the mouse is awesome too love the color my last laptop i used the hard cover and paid much more for it it was & # # ; like new & # # ; when i traded it in i highly recommend the <unk> covers
i love this item very reasonable price , and serves to protect my mac book in a stylish manner i would love to have one in all of the colors they offer
whether using the type or touch keyboard also the case does n't allow you to store the stylus using the magnetic power connector it might be cheap , but it 's useless for the surface pro amazon - please update your product description
i was very disappointed in this case although list says it will fit a surface pro , it will not i have no idea whether it will fit the rt or not if you own a surface pro this is not the case for you
sadly this item does not fit the surface pro properly the pro is a little to thick to fit completely into the sleeve , the openings do not align , and it will not close with the hard type cover keyboard needless to say , i was disappointed
i have had this case for sometime for use with my surface rt , and it works great with the rt . all of the ports are accessible , i can use the type cover with it , and if i detach the keyboard , i can fold the case over for a tablet only experience the only downside using with rt is that the bottom flap sort of covers the windows touch button on the face of the surface and you have to push it out of the way with your finger for use with the rt only , i give it a four out of five however , when i bought it , before the surface pro was released , it said , as it does now , that it works with both the rt and the pro this is clearly not true , the pro is too thick to even slide into sleeve , never mind the line up of ports and such for use with the pro , i give it a zero out of five
i wanted to protect my investment by buying a cover for my surface pro , but i feel like i wasted my money since the flap does not close all the way with my keyboard in it and the holes in the cover does not align because the case is too snug , pushing the screen downward and covering my camera but i thought if i cut out the top off then the hole for the camera will not be covered now i ca n't return it and it 's awkard to carry around with the flap open all the time even though the cover is durable , i wish i had never bought it
i bought this product specifically because it said it fit the `` surface rt and pro . well , it does n't , try as you might i am <unk> work , but it clearly was n't designed for the surface pro but , it is better than nothing i will wait another few months , and look again on amazon for something that it better suited to the pro
although surface dont need a cover but my only reason for purchasing the cover was to protect its screen for accidental fall or smudge but because of kick stand , there were no covers available and i was not much hopeful either as ms have not designed this product for any cover i was very pleasantly surprised to see this cover from navitech , and i ordered immediately it took some time to recieve it as i believe it comes from uk , but it was a beautiful and elegant cover very soft from inside , leather feel from outside and perfect fit after installing this cover , my tab was like a book which i can carry and keep in any surface only problem what i <unk> after # month of use is , its sewing is coming out from one end , maybe it was defective however to my surprise , i got a feedback call and when i told them my problem they were very prompt to process the replacement , which i hope will be there in few days overall excellent and totally worth purchase
case was bought for an ipad # the price was at the cheaper end of the choices <unk> , but the quality of the product was not compromised by this in any way the case fits perfectly and holds the ipad upright as shown in the picture it also folds down over the screen , when not in use , automatically locking it it does everything it says in the description really ; i was more than happy with <unk> ! :
too flimsy to support a tablet the parts made to secure the tablet are not strong or tight enough to hold it the sides of the case feel like covered over cardboard a total waste of money i would have done better buying $ # worth of bubble gum to top it all off , fed ex wanted $ # to ship it back to the united <unk>
in the pictures you see the keyboard attachment on the surface tab but you can not close the case with the keyboard on it you have to carry the keyboard separately not what i was hoping for the case is attractive and functional otherwise i received my order very quickly too i have the surface pro
i like the color and <unk> about it i read all the reviews and decided to make the purchase the only think i do n't like about this product , is you need to undo the velcro to make it stand up , i always need to remove my keyboard i also think this product should have a carring strap other than that i would recommend ths case <unk> park ,
the product is built nicely but it fits in a manner which does not allow for easy use of the flip out back on the surface the velcro pieces will ride up and then the center button is difficult to use
good quality leather and construction , especially for the price only complaint is that when closed , the case opening flap is on the back of the surface rather than on the front
over all i like this product it stays well on my case ; however , there are velcro little straps to keep the tablet in place when , but it very inconvenient when you want to fold it out and use the keyboard that would the only i do not like about but other than that , i love using it it 's very handy and protects the way i need it if you drop your tablet a lot , i would not consider this , but if you just something functional that look nice and just protects your tablet , this is a good decision
i bought this product as a gift for my brother he was excited to receive it and seems to thoroughly enjoys it he 's had it for awhile now and has no complaints the product does its job well overall , it was a good
i recently purchased a ruby red case from navitech and i am completely satisfied i like it and it looks great while protecting my rt surface the only slight problem is that sometimes the cover will ride up several people inquired and liked the cover and have also purchased one great service from <unk> navitech ruby red <unk> leather case cover sleeve for the microsoft surface tab windows rt & windows #
this better allows use of the touch keyboard and is very easy to carry the only improvement would be to have some method of carrying the battery pack with it , but then i 'm always carrying a bag and just put it in there , along with the flash drives i use this product is far superior to ones i thought i wanted
i ordered this product and when i received it the color was off , it did n't come with the keyboard cover or the cleaning cloth i contacted amazon and they said there was nothing they could do , all i can do is return it
the case started cracking within a couple weeks of using not at all happy after i spent this amount of money i like the keyboard cover , it does n't bubble up like the one i had prior , but the case has already had to be replaced will not be purchasing another
i ordered this product because it looked great and i wanted a protection for my new mac i got the product , it looked great but about # weeks after i received the case it started to crack in less than a month the whole right side of the case has cracked and fallen off the color is beautiful but how quickly the case is breaking is not worth purchasing this product
i guess i made my review on this product too soon it was very nice when i bought it the red was a nice vibrant red and was n't too dark i will say that but after having the case for maybe # or # weeks , i noticed on bottom where the lip to open the computer at , was cracked i took the case off and further inspected it only to find out that on the right corner of the case , it has <unk> and cracked there as well i was so upset that this happened to such a nice looking case i contacted amazon and they gave me a refund no problem but beware when buying cheap cases . it might just be a better idea to spend the extra money on a speck case
i just received the product , and what i got is not really what the picture suggests it is more see through , so the color is not as vivid the picture looks like the case would be more opaque and have a more substantial coloring i would suggest the seller <unk> the picture so that the buyer knows what they are getting i spent too much money to be this disappointed about the color
even though i kept this to protect my macbook pro , it was not as described in the advertisement it was sold as a rubberized skin , and turned out to be just a soft plastic that just felt the slightest bit as if it was rubberized ... but that was only an illusion
this unit was okay it was light purple not big and look at me - was more of here it is gave it as a gift she loves it not sure if she still has it <unk> <unk> -lsb- <unk> -rsb- <unk> . <unk> - youtube @ <unk> # <unk> -
nice color and feel , would have loved it , but the bottom part does not stay on i 'm not sure why , since this is the exact model number of my mac
i bought this product because all of its excellent reviews and the product is great but only for a few months it began to crack on the sides when i would put my computer in my backpack and has now cracked completely from the side
it protects my mac from scratches . the keyboard skin makes it a little difficult to type , and the bottom protector slides off too easily . but i guess it does the
packaging and good delivery time . but the actual item is not as bright color as shown in this picture this is transparent hard plastic cover so once install is not bright
it 's a great product ! ! it does what it 's made to do the keyboard protector makes sure that no dirt or dust go under the keyboard and if it does than you will definitely see it if it does the cover is great , very easy to put on and clean the reason i rated # out of # is that i am accustomed to typing fast , and the keyboard protector <unk> me to do so it 's a great buy and i definitely not regret this purchase
this case was just what i wanted i love the soft texture of it and the look over my macbook pro you have to put the bottom on from back to front , which <unk> my daughter when we put hers on and there are no instructions the keyboard cover is a bit cumbersome at first , but i think over time , as the rubber softens more , that it will be easier to type with overall , a great value
i got my macbook pro and my case today i really was worried that the case was going to be damaged or not the right color i have to say that the packaging was great and the color is beautiful i love purple and the case is perfect i love the matching keyboard cover as well overall this is a great case , and the price is n't bad either also you get a cleaning cloth but i used the one that came with my macbook pro because it felt a bit rough to me i 'm planning on getting other colors in the future
i love the product the color is just what i wanted and the surface is soft and smooth my only issue is that the bottom does not entirely fit & # # ; but its still workable and a good product
the case and keyboard cover both fit perfectly on my computer and look great it takes a little while to get used to feeling the keyboard cover when you type , but i 'm happy to know that the computer is safe from scratches and things like that
first off , the case arrived very fast and packaging was nice and big of course <unk> of amazon the case was easy to install , no fingers were hurt during the process and the case plays the part of the case however the case is a fingerprint magnet and smudges are easily seen when you just wipe the case but the cleaning cloth they provide with the case can easily clean all the fingerprint and smudges off , but who wants to carry around a cleaning cloth another problem i am starting to have is the keyboard skin is wearing down i am a heavy user of my laptop -lrb- about # hours daily -rrb- and the skin is showing some wear and tear already the skin is great but not sure how much longer it will stay together overall the case is great and i love the price i would easily recommend to anyone who is looking for a cheap , average , full body case
great fit and for the price you ca n't beat it my wife had a speck case that we paid $ # for and it lasted a few years but for the price of this case i could buy # of them the silicone keyboard is not my cup of tea but my wife seems to like it
this laptop case was delivered earlier than anticipated and it arrived in mint condition the keyboard cover also works well and fits the keys although with the keyboard lit up it is a little off , and getting adjusted to it was n't a problem the only issue that i could find with this product is that the case rubs against your wrists a little bit when you type as it sticks up i find that it does n't affect or bother me very much i would recommend this case , it is a good value for the money and fits the laptop in a snug way i would buy this product again
took me awhile to get it to fit -- at first i was afraid it was going to be too small for my laptop ... but finally i got it on and i think it looks great i also really like the keyboard cover that was included
this is a very tough case i am surprised how good it is for the cheap price i have had it for a couple of months now , and it has held up very well i do not take it on and off , so i do n't know how much it would hold up to that the orange color i got really pops
love that is was very true to color as well as size ! i absolutely love this case ! i like that it comes in tons of colors and that the case has a matte finish to it
i bought this laptop case after buying another for $ # which also came with a keyboard cover however unfortunately , that product was poor quality -lrb- it 's the <unk> one -rrb- so i decided to buy a new one this is a great bargain because for $ # you are definitely getting your money 's worth the case is smooth and fit on perfectly it looks exactly like a speck case and you can not tell the difference the keyboard cover also fit the keys exactly and it 's not rubbery so lint and dust wo n't stick to it plus it 's really easy to type with my laptop has not suffered a lot of wear and tear nor do i treat it poorly but i highly recommend this product it 's reasonable and very good quality
i love the case it fits perfectly the keyboard cover thing is kinda <unk> i use it but only because i do n't use my computer keyboard to type -lrb- i have another keyboard -rrb- it does n't always sit flush on the keys i thought it was because it was <unk> from shipping but no , it just does n't lay completely flat especially around the edges makes it a pain if you want to actually use it when you type but otherwise it 's fine
i really like this case it fits perfectly on my # `` macbook pro i did not like the keyboard cover as my fingers did n't slide as well between keys but it fit well on the keyboard the only think i would like to have been different is the snaps for the case for the bottom part , the snaps are near the trackpad and my wrists sometimes rub up against it and it can be a little uncomfortable for the price i paid , i would buy another one
i was searching for a case for my # in macbook pro for a few months now and i did not want to purchase a case without doing research for the best product i was a bit hesitant about buying this actual product because there were not any reviews posted , but i took a chance ; it was worth it the case fits perfectly and so does the keyboard cover there is a <unk> feel to the keyboard cover and it is really soft the color is not a dark purple at all , but it is the exact color that the photo presented shows , so if you 're looking for a dark purple , you may not want to buy this case i like the purple that it is , so if you 're not picky about the color , then this is a great option my delivery estimate was completely accurate , for i received my case on the exact date of the estimated delivery , which was three days after i put the order in i absolutely love my case and the keyboard cover and if you want a good quality purple case and keyboard cover for your # in macbook pro , then i highly recommend this product
i have ordered countless products from amazon over the years however , i have never felt so compelled to write a review as i do now i have ordered very similar brand name cases for <unk> the price , that have n't been half as nice in quality and color the case arrived promptly and was well packaged the color of this case is so deep , yet vibrant , and most definitely true to the picture i have had this case now for about a month and it is already showing that it will hold up better than the much more expensive version when i ordered it i did not plan on using the keyboard cover , but i decided to and have not taken it off ever since i will definitely be buying many more colors from this seller
this makes my laptop look cute and at the same time , it protects it very well it fits well unlike the one i had got from the store that would not say on not bulky at at
this is an excellent case , the color is the same as you see it , grate quality , and is soft i recommend this case to anybody that have apple computer
