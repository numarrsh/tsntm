i recently purchase this case/bag for my brand new ipad air after reading so many great reviews about it here i was very disappointed when i received in the mail the quality of the bag is n't bad , and its price is very good however , the size is simply too large for ipad air -lrb- even with smart case and logitech keyboard case on -rrb- i think it 's misleading to put ipad air in the title just because an ipad can be store in it it 's simply not designed to hold the ipad if you are planning to buy this bag for a larger -lrb- wider -rrb- than ipad tablet or netbook , i think it is worth the money however , if you are like me and looking for a bag specially for the ipad air , then this is not the one i have to give amazon credit for their awesome customer service they refunded me immediately after i expressed my disappointment
this is a great bag , with many pros - great materials - excellent workmanship - nice handles - zippered side pocket for cables , charger , etc . - great price on the negative side , just one thing : i bought it to carry around my motorola xoom and it is way too big i also tried with an ipad and it floats inside so i would recommend it without hesitation , but for a netbook for a # -inch tablet , just look for something smaller
has n't used it because bag seams too big for ipad air , but will probably come in handy in the future for traveling wished it fitted better and is more attractive
i was satisfied with the bag and thought it was at least worth what i paid for it i 'm just not sure how long i can expect it to hold up
even though it does not have locking tabs on the zippers , i figured how to lock it i have a cooler master u # notebook cooler which just barely fits but really , i ca n't complain for $ # for $ # , it 's pretty good
it is a lightweight sturdy bag that looks nice the case does not have any protection though for your ipad or notebook so i ended up buying a case to cover the ipad before carrying it in this bag i only had it for a month , but so far so good i would recommend this item especially since the price is good as well
i was disappointed when i got this at how much bigger the bag was than my ipad the ipad <unk> around in the bag , with about an extra inch of of space around the ipad on all # sides when in the bag i guess i wanted something that fit more like a glove it seemed well made , though the zippers were nice and the neoprene was of a decent thickness i also liked the carry handles and the zippered outside pocket i returned it and am going to try the speck pixel case i 'm looking for an inexpensive bag that will carry my ipad with its <unk> keyboard case attached
i purchased this to carry my motorola lapdock # in and while it <unk> a # inch `` netbook `` will fit , my lapdock barely fits i can get it zipped , but it 's like an extra large person squeezing into a medium jacket overall i think it would be good for any tablet , but not a smart purchase if your a lapdock owner like me
compared to other bags , this one is at a good price point my only complaint would be that the zipper does n't work as smoothly as it should and it sometimes sticks on the inside fabric overall , i got what i paid for and it 's functional
it is a nice case and it does exactly what it says but it does n't fit the ipad very well i have the ipad # and this case is much bigger i wish it fit more snuggly in the case but it was very reasonably priced
the bag is nice soft and room for extra cords i do n't use it much but i like it . wish there were colors to choose might have been and i missed
this is my first ipad , so maybe it 's not as fragile as i 'm thinking i 've got the smart cover to protect the glass and hopefully it will never fall i got this netbook bag thinking it would give the ipad some protection but it is just made from padded fabric , so if the cat sits on the ipad in the case , it might as well sit on the ipad directly to ease my mind , i would have liked a bit of <unk> however , it is an excellent little bag to carry the ipad around , roomy , cute with the orange inside , easy zippers , nicely made
the shoulder strap broke and i can not seem to get another one the plastic could be a bit stronger , but the rest of the bag is great with room for the charger , mouse disks and a few usb sticks
the laptop case is good for carrying a laptop and few extras it feels cheaply made after using it for about # or so weeks , the carrying handle began to rip half way on one side of the attachment i rate # because of the low quality material and how easily and quickly it broke under normal use it is still usable , so i try to be easy on it if you need an alright carrying case for your laptop , and you are on a budget , you might try this out and be very gentle with it so it wo n't rip at the base of the handle i would spend the few extra dollars to get a better case after using this one
this is a nice simple bag with more than enough room for my ipad and a zippered front compartment for any cables and accessories the zipper handles are made of a nice flexible material the only downside is that it had the strong neoprene smell that i could n't get rid of i left the bag out in the open to air out for a month and it still had that & # # ; chemical & # # ; smell i then put it in one of those laundry mesh bags , poured detergent over it , and put it in the wash in the delicate cycle luckily , the bag was still intact and looked new after the wash it still smelled after it came out , just not as strong i ended up giving it to a family member who does n't have a sensitive nose
not enough protection , the description of this item describes that it is for the amazon basics case for # to # in tablets , however the bag is way to large for the amazon fire its way to big , does not even lay vertical when held by the handles , tour tablet flops and bangs around the outer pocket is small , <unk> and not padded and will not hold anything securely you will brake your # `` tablet in this loose fitting brief case although there is room , you would not want to put anything else like a power adapter in bad with tablet because there is no interior protection i think this was designed for something else other than tablets frankly - seems like a <unk> `` <unk> `` bag really . # stars for quality and price , zero for description update : i found the zipper -lrb- tucked -rrb- for the outer pocket tucked inside i was also able to jam the kindle fire into the side pocket , sideways and it seems a bit more secure its definitely not perfect , but may be good for something else raised to ***
this product would be most helpful to someone who may not have a ipad cover already bought it for a work ipad which came with a very sturdy cover on it have used it for out of town travel and will probably use it more as time passes , but have not given it a lot of use so far
ive had this bag for # months and , surprisingly it hasnt fallen apart yet i say im surprised because the zipper work on it feels quite cheap and im not sure how long it will really last overall though the bag has decent variation in compartments to store whatever it is you might need and is well thought out for a cheap bag i should probably give it # stars but i would have wanted to know going in how cheap the zippers were overall , given the price , its ok
the bag is just good enough to keep the laptop safe the material is of ok quality and the space is just not enough to store anything else apart from the laptop
i like the price of this little case from amazon but it did n't turn out to fit my needs very well it 's pretty thin , i did not feel like my nexus # tablet was very safe from damage once inside there was a ton of extra space which i suppose is to fit netbooks , not tablets i like the pocket where i can store a charger and a usb to go cable now that i have an actual fitted case for my tablet , this amazon case will serve well to carry my tablet around while it is in its own more secured case
not as good as the <unk> which cost a few bucks more , but it seems adequate for holding my kindle in its case along with accessories such as earphones and a stylus
the case would be fine if it was n't for the sloppy interior pockets there are inside pockets on both sides of the case which & # # ; <unk> & # # ; out they are very effective at preventing the user from actually inserting a tablet -lrb- a laptop would be worse -rrb- into the case if there was a pocket on just one side it would be easy to simply cheat the tablet to one side when inserting i <unk> it out regularly the rest of the case is just fine well made and seemingly durable
this is a great case it fit my kindle fire hdx perfectly i love the separate exterior zipped pocket for the <unk> cord . i have two quibbles the interior is not divided if it had two pockets , i could put my keyboard in one and the kindle in the other second , the exterior pocket bulges with the power cord in it -- why did n't amazon allow for the size and add a gusset after all , the company makes both products
did not want a big bag to carry a small tablet this is just right my dell venue # pro has room and parts have a place wish the bag was a little thicker for better protection overall , a very nice bag and a good price
very nice case , compact and sturdy with good padding however , it did n't fit my ipad air and accessories very well ... the zipper had to be force closed i contacted amazon to return , and they refunded the cost and told me i could keep the case ... so sweet of them i then got the next larger size which is perfect for me
although # days late , i was refunded my one day shipping and got an extension on my prime account the case fits my asus memo pad hd # nicely and is soft . # out of # for being late but for the quick
actually surprised by the quality especially for the price , a great value the zippered pouch is hand for chargers and other small devices good sized sturdy handle for a small case if it only last a year or so i 'll still feel like it was a bargain
the bag fits my asus transformer book t # and the extra pocket for charger/accessories is really handy the bag is light and the handle makes it easy to carry i realize that it 's a generic netbook bag , but it 's a little on the large side for my tablet better too big than too small , though
i like that this bag offers good protection to my ipad and the side pocket is handy for the cords and other stuff if it had a shoulder strap i would give it # stars
i just wanted a bag to protect my ipad if it rains this does the job i wish it had a long handle though the product was shipped timely item as described
this bag was exactly as described the padding gives extra protection and that was a feature i was looking for it looks well made and definitely worth the price i would recommend to anyone needing a bag for their devices
i have # of these for an ipad # and # both ipads use an incase <unk> cover , and slip right in to this bag i feel like this bag offers extra protection for i know someone who has cracked a screen , and paid a nice penny to fix it because they did n't have a method of transport
i 'm using this bag for my asus t- # plenty of room in the main compartment for the t- # with the keyboard dock -lrb- and both with the ipearl cover the secondary compartment holds the charger , cable , and the <unk> tablet stand everything i need for heading out the door with the t- #
this is worth the money but my dvd player has one of those power cords that have the big black box and does not fit in well with the player
i purchased this for my ipad air which is not in any kind of other case but it is a little large for this to give you an idea of how large it is , i also have and ipad # which is in a otterbox defender case and with the case on , it fits perfectly in the carry bag this may be made more for a netbook due to the size but i am now going to use it for my ipad # while also using the otterbox defender case
the bag is great for a dell # . # lap top i went with the larger size and i 'm glad i did the bag has a lot of pockets and fits the charger , mouse and extra paper work with room to spare i gave it # stars because it is not padded very well and if it is dropped you might damage your computer all in all it is a great value plus the <unk> seem durable
i bought this to place a ` grid it ' panel in it to hold all the different charging cables , earbuds , etc for when i travel the size fit the grid it perfectly and keeps me organized
it is better than i expected , does the job everything i like to carry with me when i travel fits in this case , it is much smaller and lighter than my old one a good value for the money
this is a nice quality bag at a cheap price the only thing i did n't really like were the rubber grip zippers with the amazon basics logos on them it would have looked a little more professional without that and i 'm curious to see the durability of the rubber grips versus a conventional <unk> zipper grip i read other reviews complaining of a `` chemical `` smell but i think they have probably never smelled neoprene before some people were also complaining about it being a little over-sized for the ipad but i disagree this is not an ipad case , it 's universal netbook case i think it 's a nice size , especially if you have a case on your ipad as well you can also fit a few accessories in the separate front pocket without worry about it scratching up your device
over all nice case it 's not a hard case so it 's still possible to damage what 's inside unless your rough this should work and the price is right
because it is sized for a full size ipad , there is lots of extra room in this for my many <unk> i carry along some of the cables i carry in the side pocket and others go in the main compartment with the ipad i 'm not worried about <unk> the ipad against these other things because the ipad is encased in a <unk> slim original ipad mini <unk> # position flip <unk> magnet switch gave it # stars because it only came in black , and i was occasionally losing it , especially against the black carpet of our car a little red duct tape - problem solved
... it would have been a perfect # -star as a strapless # -star it is still great , with a smaller outside pocket to carry a wallet and cell phone larger pocket fits my ipad # with its <unk> case , plus a little room to spare so you do n't have to work at getting it in and out
i have an ipad # in an otterbox defender case fits perfectly and carries easily would be # star except the zipper ends with the amazon logo break off over time
got this as a way to carry multiple small electronics when traveling needed something to carry # <unk> , a samsung galaxy tab # . # & # # ; + keyboard as well as a couple of phones & a mp # player with earbuds so this should work perfect picked this size over the next size smaller as this one seems to have more features for only a few extra dollars build quality is good for the price
i bought this for my acer # tablet it 's too big for it and the tablet flops around in the bag otherwise , it 's a nice little bag protects the tablet and holds the charger in a zippered compartment if the sides were a bit <unk> , it would have helped i would recommend
i use this nice little bag to carry my ipad mini around the case if soft and has a little pouch for wires and <unk> i have n't tested it yet in rain or snow , but my experience so far has been a good one
got this for my mother who wanted an easy way to carry her tab # around it provides good protection and allows her to store the charging cable and wall charger in the bag i am very satisfied for the price
it protects the netbook and makes it easy to carry it around it is soft and very light not a shell case , so do n't drop it . but it is as advertised and has space for cables and charger
i like this sleeve with handles for my ipad it has an outside pocket that holds the power cord , my screen cleaning pad , and mifi device i was a little disappointed in the relatively thin padding since my ipad has a protective cover , this sleeve is ok for it , but i would not want to carry my asus <unk> netbook in it because there is just not enough padding generally speaking i like the amazonbasics products , but it would be nice if they had one other color option i have two external hard drives , and i did not want the same color case for both because i wanted to be able to know which was which without unzipping the case in any event , i like this sleeve for an ipad , and the price was right , but i do n't love it
just received this case it 's nice , i love the feel of the materials , handles and zipper pulls as others have said my one regret is that it is not as wide as advertised the specs say it is # inches , but it 's # . # on the outside that matters because i 've been wanting to store my wireless keyboard in there , which has a # . # inch case so it takes a lot of work to wedge it in there i 'm hoping it will stretch over time plenty of room for the ipad , though
she is very happy with this item also as a matter of fact she liked the call box <unk> as well and is enjoying all the items we purchsed for her <unk> & <unk> ; <unk> arrived promptly and in good condition thanks for the good
the case seems to be made of quality materials but does n't seem as well built as ones in stores however , for the price its good and i like taking it into meetings over all happy , but would be more so without the little amazon basics tag on the seem still a good buy
a recent trip proved the value of the basics netbook bag for my ipad + keyboard combo side pocket for accessories worked out fine no problems in airport
excellent case , great price only downside is the case is a little large for a # `` netbook the is a gap at top by the zippers not enough to put anything there , so it is a waste of space
bought for my asus q # e laptop fits wonderfully , seems well made , price was excellent adds a little bulk to a very small laptop , but adds a lot of protection and has pockets for charger and accessories
i had purchased a new case from a chain store when got my new laptop it cost about # times what this one does and was n't nearly as roomy that one did n't last a year before the shoulder strap came apart when i found this on amazon , it was just what i wanted and at a great price too
it is very basic which is all i wanted and has a decent amount of padding so for the price i think it is a good buy os i can carry my computer to and from classes
this hand bag is excellent for what i intended i purchased it to protect a toshiba laptop when it is being transported i did n't want to spend a lot of money on a bag and this model fell into my price range it is a very well made bag and has extra side pockets which is a plus to me for the price my recommendation if this is what you are after , buy it , you wo n't go wrong
this bag is identical to the case logic notebook bag except its about # . # inches smaller not a big deal for me as i was buying for a portable dvd player but if i was getting for a # . # & # # ; notebook , it would be to small am i glad i got the case logic for my vivo notebook other then that -lrb- size -rrb- this bag is perfect
well constructed , thick neoprene with bright orange interior the zipper pulls feel sturdy and the handles are well constructed i have no doubts this will keep my device protected well overall , this is a great little pouch , my only complaint is that the pocket on the front does not go all the way across -lrb- or have # zippers -rrb- i have a keyboard that goes with my # inch tablet , which is about # & # # ; wide , so it does n't fit in this case if the pocket in the front had # zippers i could use it to hold the keyboard as it is , i have to store it <unk>
nice enough for the price for an ipad , it is n't exactly a perfect fit -lrb- not too snug -rrb- and is clear this was designed for a netbook but it has bit of storage , seems to provide at least some protection for the price gave me what i needed
great bag for an incredible price ! my only complaint is that the strap makes a squeaking sound when i walk around which is very <unk> is n't a big deal because the straps can be
what a great little bag my ipad easily fits inside with its hard shell keyboard cover , but also fits when inside a book style keyboard/cover i can also fit my kindle in with the ipad -lrb- when its in the hard shell keyboard case -rrb- while it loses the slim profile when you put cords and plugs into the zippered compartment , its still a handy carrying bag it 's lightweight and has handles
received the netbook bag today i was surprised its very nice the only thing is my # `` asus netbook fits in it but it is a little tight , but it does fit the side pocket is ample for a mouse and power supply so all in all i like it for the price and qaulity i dont think it can be beat
also wanted a compartment to hold my collapsible stand , stylus and charging paraphernalia <unk> this would require a sleeve larger that an ipad this was perfect . ipad fits snugly and pouch holds my extra
if you want a bag that works with pretty much any tablet and netbook this is a good choice i 'm taking off a point because of its smell if you 're chemical sensitive you should probably look elsewhere other than that , good deal
ok , the bag is a little boring but it was worth the price it has several pockets to hold all the accessories that you need for a tablet it is made of a spongy type material , reminds me of a wet suit . should offer some protection against drops or bumps
this case arrived today -lrb- two days early , kudos to amazon -rrb- upon unwrapping it , i immediately tested it out with my ipad # i found that , as some others have said , there was a decent amount of extra room , but it still felt streamlined enough that i was comfortable carrying my ipad around in it also as some others have said , there is a chemical odor in the inside of the case however , it can only be noticed when your face is very near finally , i noticed that the wire holding the zipper pulls onto the zipper was fairly thin , and i think there is a very small possibility of them breaking in the future overall , this is a very good product and i look forward to carrying my ipad around in it
when i originally ordered this i had thought it was just going to be for use with my ipad this is far too large for an ipad alone , however i now have a case for my ipad -lrb- a kensington with bluetooth keyboard -rrb- and with that it fits snuggly and well and is nice to carry around outer pocket is a nice touch
was looking for a nice bag to carry my # ipads , some paperwork i sometime drop the phone in the front very happy and the case is well made it 's not huge , so check your sizes and make sure it will carry what you need i do n't use the strap , just carry by the handles
i wanted a lightweight , zipping carrying bag for my samsung galaxy note # . # -lrb- <unk> # -rrb- that would also fit my anker t # keyboard fortunately , that 's what i got although i was hoping that the little pouch in the front of the bag would fit my keyboard , it ended up being slightly smaller than i imagined ultimately , i just placed the keyboard inside the main bag since i already had a folding <unk> protecting my note now the little pouch is home to my usb cable and charging adapter , so it ended up not being too much of a bad thing
this is just what i needed it is light weight and will hold my ipad plus other things just right i purchased one for # times the amount for my husband , and side by side they are just about the same
i have to wear compression <unk> and can not put them on myself due to some <unk> in my hands a co-worker helps me and i always carried them in a plastic bag from a fast food place i wanted something that looked better but not like a purse this bag fits the bill
i bought my first tablet and i wanted a case to protect it and carry it around it this case was just the thing i needed and at a very reasonable price
i bought this bag through amazon for my ipad # that i just bought and it 's working out fine , although it 's oversized for the ipad i love the pocket in front that is big enough to carry not only the charging cord but my digital camera , its usb cord and its extra batteries with room to spare the only improvement i could wish for would be a shoulder strap -lrb- hence the # -star rating -rrb- , but you ca n't beat this for the price i 'm very happy with it
unless you do n't mind your tablet moving around a lot in this bag , get something that is specifically designed for a non apple product the bag is built good for the price , but my # & # # ; samsung tablet does not fit snuggly , and moves around too much so the rating on this bag is a good one , but just not what i purchased the bag for probably good for apple products as it fits much better , but not for samsung products , and definitely too big for anything # & # # ; or lower
this is a great little netbook bag it fits my # `` asus netbook perfectly the handles are a nice plus and make it easier to carry around it seems to be made well and the zippers work fine i like the front pocket because it 's big enough to hold the charger and a memory stick without a problem the color on the inside is amazon.com orange , not my first choice , but it 's on the inside , so not a big deal overall i like the bag very much
everything fits in the bag nicely i like the zippered pocket on the side i can store all the cords and extras in the pocket the bag is a bit too big for my device , but i have a small kindle ca n't beat this price
wanted a very basic laptop bag just for transporting from place to place and this does the job and looks nice i only wish it had expandable pockets even just a little bit otherwise this does the job , looks nice , and is
the only thing i could complain about would be that it collects dirt really easily if you have pets with light fur -lrb- like mine -rrb- , this case will almost never be clean if you would ever consider using it in a professional environment , i would keep a lint roller on hand otherwise the case is really comfortable to carry , is really sturdily built , and even with the pocket fully loaded with chargers , earphones and misc wires , never feels bulky or awkward
overall , a great case and a bargain my one disappointment is that it is a poor fit for a # `` tablet -lrb- it is advertised as fitting both # `` & # `` tablets . i wish the side pocket were only # `` wider -- it would then fit my nexus # snugly and securely
this case is simple lightweight and enough space for cords , etc . easy to carry this size of a case is new to me because i previously had a bigger laptop , this is much better for travel
the case works great overall , and price is right two <unk> improvements though first , handles are not needed most of the time and can actually get in the way if you want to sit the ipad on the case so offering a case w/o those might be helpful second , some of pen holder would be helpful to hold the stylus the big pocket on the outside works well overall , but a specific slot for a stylus would be one step better
i chose this because of the price i needed something to take my laptop and accessories from a to <unk> gets the job done and seems to be made well without any corners being cut my only con is that the inside does smell a <unk> funky i 'm no sticking my face in there every day so it 's not a big deal but there is an odor probably from the materials used it however does not deter me from buying the product
i have purchased a few cases to use with my microsoft surface # pro this case is an excellent buy , but be warned the picture that is displayed showing the inside pockets is not correct this version of the case only has # pockets and not # after # attempts to get this case in the # pocket version and each attempt had failed , i sent a message to amazon to update the picture to reflect the correct pocket which is # otherwise , the case is very good for the price the zippers work well , the case fits the items stored nicely and that includes the surface pc
i purchased one of these a few years back for my wife 's ipad and it does a great job for the money i decided to get another for my samsung # . # note and the bag fits the tablet perfectly however , when i opened the plastic bag it was packed in , the petroleum smell was pretty darn strong . my first purchase did not have that odor i am hoping this will dissipate over time . if you take the odor issue out of the <unk> , this bag is a great value and is well made
this one works really well with my ipad i like the side zipper that i can use to store my cord and charger it fits my ipad perfectly it is also convenient to carry it around but , i must be careful not to let it gets away from my hand ! !
what more can you ask for it fits a samsung galaxy tab # . # perfectly , with a bit of room to spare lots of protection and a great price thank you amazon basics
this is a good utility bag not very padded and none of the pockets opens all the way up , but there are a lot of them a pretty well made little bag
it has a lot of pockets , which is great the only negative thing i found was that it was a little bit of a tight fit other than that , it is perfect
some of the plastic joints on this squeak as i walk around i might be putting more weight in it than it 's designed for , which could contribute to the issue
this case is great perfect for my # inch sony <unk> fx # dvd player as well as the cables that comes with it the material is durable and of a good quality it is not super padded on the inside , but does have an extra layer there for padding i can fit the # inch player with the charger next to it , and then the additional cables in the zipper pocket on the front the handle is comfortable to grasp , and the design is sleek and modern the only thing that i did not like about this case was the zipper tab comes off very easily the space of the `` hook `` part that holds the zipper tab in place is somewhat <unk> , so it lets the tab slip out easily other than that , the zipper itself is heavy duty and nice overall , for the price and design , i would recommend this product
i am in the senior . . senior area i liked things when i grew up without computers and cell phones now it is a way of life , so i have adapted this laptop is my first one , and so far it is working great the case is useful and holds everything now where did i put my pen oh well , as they say try it and you may like it also , amazon is the greatest company ... it is like a cloud company where if you want it they have it !
my bag is nice , very well constructed , a little big for my ipad mini , but it is what i was looking for i recommend the product if size is no problem or you have a bigger ipad shipping was perfect , arrived on time
i thought the case would be more snug but i guess it works if you plan to put more than just your laptop in it it 's a decent size and does seem to offer protections good quality for the price but i think next time i 'll spend a little more for more protection
this is the <unk> little bag it provides protection and convenience of carrying and also a compartment to include accessories i love the portability with the handles for quickly grabbing and going it is a great buy
i intentionally ordered this size even though i have only a # & # # ; tablet i now have my tablet in a leather case with bluetooth keypad and it all fits perfectly the pocket lets me carry all the cables i will need nice and compact now forget travelling with my laptop
the clips for the shoulder strap look a little iffy but we 'll see how they hold the bag has more space than i expected it is a little too roomy for my macbook pro but it 's not much of an issue there are tons of pockets and really the only thing that feels or looks a little cheap is the clips i mentioned before great bag for the price
does a good job fits my touchpad with case on perfectly wish it had a shoulder strap and i 'm not a big fan of the amazon basics logos on every zipper pull would recommend for the money though
while i 've yet to use it much , the netbook bag was as well constructed as promised at a great price not fancy , but just enough to conveniently protect and organize my ms surface rt and a accessories
