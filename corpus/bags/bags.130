this sleeve is perfect to protect my # `` dell laptop i love the two color combination and the strap across the top to accommodate the flap it does exactly what it says it will do the inexpensive price is a much added bonus
the sleeve fits my # & # # ; toshiba <unk> perfectly , with enough room at the top to cover it completely the flap does not lie perfectly flat when closed , but it 's better than having a zipper that scratches my laptop or velcro that snags my clothes
a laptop case that fits my # `` hp does what it needs to case was really smelly , so i washed and <unk> it and now it 's fine ca n't really complain about it at all
this cover may smell bad for a couple days i read the reviews and made sure to air it out before putting my laptop in it and ever since then no problems this item is constructed well and holds the laptop firmly in place without being to bulky
i purchased this because i really wanted a sleeve for my very large laptop i was hoping -lrb- based on some other reviews -rrb- that it would fit it stretches to fit my laptop snug-ly my laptop : i have a widescreen # . # & # # ; laptop at its ' widest dimension it is over # & # # ; i was ecstatic that this fit it does fit very tight , but i feel that it is protected better by the tight fit
i would highly recommend this to anyone with a # inch laptop i have a # `` toshiba and was having a hard time finding a bag or a sleeve to fit it i even took my laptop to best buy to try things out and the bags -lrb- shoulder or backpack -rrb- were either ginormous or did n't fit , and the sleeves were not easy to use this sleeve is perfect - nice and snug , i do n't have to worry about zippers scratching the laptop or breaking it does have a bit of a smell to it but it will fade - definitely not a reason to not buy this hope this review helps you make a decision
i wanted something that would fit my # . # laptop and protect it in my backpack and it did ! ! it stretches to fit snug and i love it the price was n't too much so that was also a plus it had a brand new fabric smell but that didnt bother me cus it went away definately says what it
great laptop sleeve , recent purchase from amazon fits my new hp # . # well used it to cover laptop in my travel backpack and took it on a cruise and it kept my toy safe and secure dont forget the airport nonsense made the trip there and back without a <unk> serves its purpose and i am pleased with this purchase great purchase great price , all from amazon if you need a good cover get this one hope this helps
this item worked perfectly on my new widescreen sony laptop i was using a messenger bag as my carrier , but old laptop protective insert was too small this worked out well as a replacement
every time i purchase something from amazon it is exactly the way it was offered online to track ther shipment works easily and it is <unk> on time
this is a decent cover , i use it every day it is the only sleeve that has so far fit my asus rog <unk> i 've had issues finding appropriate saddle bags and or backpacks , without looking <unk> this unit allows me to fit it into a bag that does n't fit into it 's own laptop sleeve , but main compartment and i feel relatively secure about it 's condition , good price good item it 's is <unk> down , but i am a power user and it 's understandable the <unk> at the end , just get someone to sew edge back on , and keep moving
i chose this rating because i got what i paid for very reasonably priced item to keep the dust off your laptop not the best thing to look at , but it works
i own a # & # # ; toshiba laptop , and my other sleeve gave out , so i was in need of another i found this one and i like the price of it , so i put it in my cart and left it there the next day i came back and it was $ # instead of $ # anyways , of course i bought it , and when it came i put my laptop in it right away the fit is superb , the material forms a nice outer shell that will protect your laptop if you stick it in your backpack with textbooks i like the strap you slide the cover through , because this will eliminate any excessive wear you 'd have to deal with if you had a zipper top like the last one i had so glad i bought this product
luv it ! its great ! ! ! stretchy durable and it protects my hp envy # inch screen laptop its enough room to store a wireless mouse along with the battery cord it was a great buy for the price i have no complaints other than i wish the outside color was another color
i bought this to set my keyboard and mouse on the length is great but you can not stop it from falling apart , folding in half , and it 's as strong as paper waste of money
what a rip off a nice idea and it does what they say , but , within a week the clips to make it a desk top stand broke off i contacted <unk> several times and no response they also sent me a customer satisfaction email and i let them know my issue and no response i continued to use the product as a desk top but used a book to create the desktop angle and now the entire unit has cracked in two halves lousy construction and a company that does not support their product do n't buy
i found that i needed to put a pillow under the lap desk , because it is too uncomfortable to use on my lap without padding as long as there is padding beneath it , it works fine i have not tried to use it in the triangle position on a table yet
for the most part , i liked this product it has a one year review and with good reason at # . # months , the hinges developed a serious crack i continued to try and use it with care , but unfortunately , it broke in half just two weeks later -- very close to # months i was very disappointed and even contacted the company in hopes of some kind of suggestion or even <unk> sadly , i received no reply i like the look and design of the desk , but given the poor durability , i can not recommend this product without reservation forewarned is <unk>
i find this a welcome relief from having the laptop directly on my lap it helps with the heat buildup sometimes i have it all the way open to work on and sometimes i just leave it folded up and the mouse works on my laptop itself definitely a good buy for me
the pro 's are covered well by other reviewers , and above all the cut out slots for heat <unk> do work the lack of a thin foam or gel pad on the underneath where it sits upon your legs is an issue for me though although the laptop desk sits stable it is as hard as my laptop , so my <unk> and <unk> hurt after a while of usage
gives my laptop a higher profile when working on a desk the non-slip grips keep my computer in place - - my ipad too can not attest , as yet , to how well it vents the computer on my lap it does prevent my bare legs from <unk> onto the air vents , and so far , my computer has n't overheated the real test will be <unk> here 's to no more blown screen <unk>
this was a gift for my # th grade son he loves to sit on the couch or his bed while using a laptop or chromebook for the smaller chromebook , he can use the lap desk while it 's folded up , or he opens it up if he wants room for a mousepad to the side i borrow it often too when i was <unk> from surgery , i could lay flat in bed with my knees bent the laptop or chromebook truly stayed in place on the non-slip lap desk i could just adjust the screen to a comfortable level and surf , email or watch a movie i also like that it folds compactly for storage and fits well in a small bag for travel someone at my house uses it everyday
i am very happy with this purchase it folds for easy portability and has slots for allowing heat to escape i use it <unk> on my lap and folded in half and raised with the support arm on my desk the support arm inside is quite thin so make sure it is snapped into position before you fold the laptop desk closed completely
i just love this item i do some of my work while sitting on the couch and find this is a great tool to let my laptop breathe and it right at my fingertips as well
purchased this as a gift for my husband who travels a lot for business he constantly tells me how much he likes this product he says this is the best gift that he 's received and highly recommends it for anyone considering purchasing it he has put it to great use while <unk> by plane , as a passenger in <unk> and even from his bed while home on sick days it is lightweight and easily folds to fit into a computer bag this is a great buy
very pleased with this product made from a <unk> plastic , it supports my laptop in a flat or angled -lrb- raised -rrb- position the rubber pads prevents the laptop from slipping keeps the laptop cool underneath , and makes it easy to type on my lap folds and transports easily good product for the price very happy with this purchase and would recommend
this item is great , it provides a barrier to heat on a flat surface nicely , but provides multiple angles for easy typing and stores easily in a computer bag i love mine and have not found anything about it that i do n't like
i never write reviews , but am shopping for a new leather bag and felt compelled to comment i completely understand that a manufacturer can and will have occasional bad products - <unk> i am not a <unk> <unk> simply said , if something looks good and is built right , i buy it kenneth cole makes some nice looking stuff , however , two bags , several pairs of shoes and other items later that just happened to have kenneth cole 's name on them , were all poorly made screws breaking on the bag , interior falling apart , holes , <unk> , and i 'm very <unk> with my belongings bottom line is at this point , i will not buy anything with his name on the product because of numerous similar experiences - and for items that are not inexpensive to add to the poor experience
this bag is fair in terms of quality two very picky but hugely important points to me that are the cause for the one star this bag does not ever stand up on its own and the snaps are painfully hard to operate i would definitely stay away from this bag
the pin in one of the front spring loaded clasps broke after only two months i 've really been careful with this case since its purchase and one of the clasps still broke i do n't even know if amazon will <unk> because i can not seem to find any procedures on how to follow-up with them probably going to try and give them a call
the bag looks great and is made well ; but the way it 's designed , it does n't fit much i tried putting a macbook air in a soft case , a clipboard with a few pieces of paper and a # ' soft binder -lrb- not full -rrb- and the bag would n't close it 's made to fit a few very , very thin items a complete waste of money i ca n't even return it now since i 've been trying to use it hoping that it would work somehow for me to carry work things also , one of the front clasps is deformed and it 's extremely hard to <unk> it
i have gotten lots of comments from folks saying the bag is a stylish bags however , i have had two of these bags and they both have broke within the first month the first bag had a magnet that holds the rear flap closed and the second bag had the latch that holds the shoulder strap broke
i bought this for my husband it looks great and fits his # `` laptop but one of the strap fasteners is a hook <unk> and the strap keeps coming out of it causing the bag to crash to the ground
as some other reviewers noted , it feels great when you get it first time but after # weeks or so -lrb- depending on your use -rrb- you start seeing scratches on front and bottom the leather is very thin and is not sturdy at all other issues include : nylon low quality strap and very limited space it will fit a laptop , an ipad or <unk> , and a thin file -lrb- not a folder -rrb- i am thinking and may end up returning it the challenge is that all good quality leather bag will be around $ # - $ #
i got this bag as a present for a new job it 's quite good it holds a computer with a pretty wide screen as well as other materials the bag itself is well designed but the strap is horrible the clasps always come undone at the worst time i began having trouble with the strap within three weeks kenneth cole does n't replace them it is annoying that my wife paid this much for bag and we needed to replace the strap so soon
i was really looking for something that more high-end the bag was nice , had decent pocket location and i like the styling , but i did end up returning it a great everyday briefcase or travel piece , but not an elegant executive look
i just got this bag in the mail after reading several reviews well , the reviews were right , the satchel looks good , however this bag is not very big and not very space friendly first of all , the medal magnet <unk> are so weak if you put a average sized book inside the thing wont close the front looks like it can be adjusted , but dont be fooled , it can not so to sum it up , the bag looks like it will hold alot but the most you 'll get inside is a few documents and a small laptop so i wouldnt say this is for a student because textbooks forget about it but like i said , ... at least it looks good
i got this bag for my birthday back in august today , only # months later , it broke one of the front clasps slipped right off in the middle of the day i 've been using this bag almost daily during these months , carrying things like my laptop and a pad of paper i have n't been abusing it at all , so this comes as an extreme <unk> before it broke , i got many compliments on the bag , although it did stain easily on the back where it rubs against my pants i 'm extraordinarily disappointed that this bag decided to fall apart today in the middle of my afternoon shame on you , kenneth cole , for charging so much for shoddy craftsmanship
bought this for husband for christmas i ordered the tan color but it does n't look like the color in photo the tag says tan but it looks more brown then tan wonder if this was a mistake when they <unk> the item
i purchased this bag because i liked its looks , and it was very nice after receiving and attempting to put all my stuff -lrb- lap top primarily -rrb- in it , however , i realized the reaction bag did not offer enough internal space to allow for all that i need to tote additionally , i did not like the strap , which i use all the time i returned this bag and purchased a mcklein usa walton leather # `` expandable laptop case , which was better suited to my needs
whilst it looks great . the latches at the front and rear of the case are a little awkward internal space is limited overall a very good looking case that may lack a little in
good briefcase that is holding up well as i take it to court every day the leather is great it feels good , looks good , and even smells good the stitching is not as high-quality and is coming out in places overall , though , great value for the money
i purchased this for a # `` macbook pro -lrb- # model -rrb- expecting it to be somewhat close in size it 's huge amazon 's listed specs show # x # , which is incorrect it 's more like # x # it swallows a # `` macbook whole with plenty of room to spare in fact , i can fit two , possibly three similar sized laptops in there , and still have room for all their power adapters it 'll come in handy since i can likely fit school books inside so i 'll keep it , but for those just looking for a small bag for their # `` laptop , just know what you 're getting i posted a pic of the macbook in front of the bag , both standing upright to give an idea beautifully made bag though the leather is very soft and rich and will look gorgeous as it <unk>
this was a great purchase i was hesitant when i first received it but once i broke it in i do n't think i want any other one but this one it fits my computer , a couple of big notebooks , and important documents the front two pockets keep your pens , calculator , business cards , etc organized i am especially impressed with the protection for my laptop i have gotten a lot of compliments and the leather smells great a great buy for anyone that likes to look stylish and not old and
bought this for my daughter , who is a graphic designer well made , looks like quality only issue is the room in the main section if she put in her # . # & # # ; macbook pro , there was n't enough room for her portfolio -- a must for job interviews but still great value and style for the money
this is absolutely one of the best briefcases i 've ever owned i often have to carry lots of documents and heavy files , and most bags wear out and get damaged this bag has held up <unk> , and it looks <unk> professional when i bring it to court wearing a suit the only caveat is that the shoulder strap works rather poorly , and the buckle regularly comes loose i personally carry it in hand , so this is not an issue for me except when i am flying , but those of you who intend to use the shoulder strap should know it is not well designed it is the only flaw i 've found with this bag
overall a very good bag it has enough room for a computer and accessories , smart phone , and a number of folders it is not as roomy as a backpack , but it should suffice for supporting <unk> looks very professional and is very versatile it is professional enough for the business meeting and casual enough to support the academic <unk> the only drawback is the magnetic clasps on the back flap works well until the bag is full , and then does not provide a good seal i would like to see a buckle on the back flap as well other than that it seems to be holding up just fine to the daily abuse of work
my girlfriend got tired of seeing me walking around with my old nylon case and she bought me this i was suprised how much a good leather case costs i love the quality of this and i can see that it is going to hold up well for a long time i think the price is <unk> but i am not used to having such nice things other than my suits and shoes
i spend a lot of time trying to find the write briefcase for work i finally ordered this one and have been very pleased the quality of the leather is great the only drawback is that the main compartment is hard to access because the strapped snap into place however , the upside to that is when traveling i feel it is more secure
classic style , well constructed i 've gotten compliments almost every time i 've worn this bag at school two downsides : the bag itself it very heavy can be uncomfortable when you are carrying textbooks , and the leather needs to be treated with a <unk> solution but overall very professional and high quality product extremely good value for the price
very stylish and looks nice with whatever i am wearing falls over from time to time , so my only compliant is that it does n't always sit up straight however , that might be due to what i have in the bag more than the bag itself overall , it 's what i expected and i use it everyday
the leather is good quality and it is a pretty sturdy bag my only complaint is that the handle should be more solid and the front straps should lay down flatter otherwise its a great purchase my son loves it
really like the bag good size , quality leather and construction i like the two front pockets my only real issue is the latches they are equally hard to snap and unsnap you <unk> have to seat the latch down all the way to get it to engage and it 's sometimes difficult to get it to release i 'd still buy it again
i got this bag to replace my samsonite leather bag for work i was disappointed because the other broke soon after my purchase this bag has been great -- at a great price point my one concern was space , but it has worked out fine so far i 'd recommend it
i bought this bag because it was all leather , looked very nice online , and carried the kenneth cole brand i was quite pleased when it arrived as it met my expectations for look , feel , and functionality it has plenty of room for my laptop , ipad , and various other small items the only thing that i see could be improved are the magnets that close the rear compartment flap as the magnets are not very strong this often will not stay shut if you put more than a few documents or a notebook in the rear compartment otherwise , the bag is well worth the money it looks very professional and i have had many compliments on how nice it looks i would recommend this to anyone looking for a leather <unk> briefcase
great product after a couple of month using it , still like new this is a well made product , fine leather <unk> you are gon na use it for your laptop it should be # & # # ; and you have to use some foam in the base so your laptop dont get damage from the <unk>
i work for <unk> state university and attend several meetings <unk> the day i wanted something stylish and <unk> to carry documents to meetings this bag works perfectly and i have had several people compliment me on the style the only complaint i would have is that it does n't have a lot of storage space when i try to take a laptop and several documents to meetings i <unk> out and will not snap shut however , if you are looking to carry around a ipad and a few documents and look great and stylish while doing it , then this bag is for you
great looking bag with just enough space for laptop and other necessary items only thing i dislike are the metal clips on the front they click into the lock easily enough , but are sometimes tough to unlock when you need to open the bag
have n't had any problems with it so far the space inside which i assume is for my laptop is not big enough for a # & # # ; laptop which kind of sucked but i found another way to store it inside the bag looks good , hopefully it holds up over time
this bag holds everything got it for my husband and he loves the style and size fits his laptop -lrb- # & # # ; -rrb- and his ipad along with his many files we got this bag due to the width of the bag he wanted a computer bag with more style it 's been about two months and is still in great condition
i really like this bag it 's stylish and refined i love that it has a designated laptop sleeve lifted from the bottom so your laptop does n't hit the ground directly i just wish it had more space
pros : euro look , very comfortable strap , seems like good quality leather cons : a bit on the small side , access to front pockets is tight magnet in back flap is weak , should be a snap button at first the bag felt too small for my # . # `` computer and i even thought about returning it however , the next day the laptop seems to fit better and i kept it it seems like one of those bags that ages very nice i would like it more if it had a key holder inside
overall a pretty good briefcase of reasonable quality , especially for the price only small complaint i might have is that the clasps and fasteners are a little difficult to open and close other than that i have been using it for a few weeks and it is comfortable and easy to carry around
ordered this bag in tan as a present for my husband the bag looks just like in the pictures , it has a beautiful tan tone it has lots of practical compartments and pockets , and looks professional and stylish delivered to <unk> within # hours very happy with my purchase
i was worried when i bought this bag that it would be far too big for me when it got delivered to my doorstep -lrb- super fast delivery , shipped over the weekend ! -rrb- , i was pleasantly surprised to find that this bag is just nice for me it 's just the perfect size on the exterior , it looks great my mom commented that the bag looked like what dr <unk> from <unk> <unk> would use on the interior though , it could however have a bit more compartments for small items overall , this bag is pretty darn awesome even though i 'm just a <unk> <unk> in a corporate world , this bag makes me feel like a million bucks
i really put it to the test my last trip i was able to comfortably fit two full sized laptops , a kindle fire , a digital camera , and chargers for each device when i 'm not traveling , i use it as a regular briefcase clips on front are a bit tricky to open , but great bag at a great price
this bag is everything i had hoped for and much more it is made of quality leather , good hardware and the handle and strap are comfortable and fit well laptop and accessories fit well and there is plenty of space for my ipad and a separate area for all my paperwork overall , this is a # -star case that is well worth the amazon price
this bag looks professional and sleek it is the perfect combination of messenger bag and briefcase that does n't make you seem too young it is also quite roomy and can fit quite a bit in it it has two latches that are hidden by the decorative buckles you see in the pictures the latches were a bit of a pain to open at first , but they loosened up within a day because the bag has so much space and is made out of genuine leather , it is a little heavy without anything inside it
i use this case when i travel in different climates from # to # above it 's gotten wet and <unk> on and stil looks great i love the way it looks and is a very easy to carry around with or without the strap highly recommended and worth the cost
received the briefcase this weekend and love it i made a move from a backpack to this product and could n't be happier the fact that i ca n't stuff as much stuff as a backpack is a good thing my dell laptop , folders , ipad and all accesories fit without an issue love the look of this one
i do n't know what these people are talking about with the <unk> i 've had this almost a year and carry is daily for the price this is the best <unk> bag i 've ever owned there are many compartments
the item arrived just as described the leather is beautiful and the item is of high quality i 've been using it for a month at least and i love it i get compliments on it and i 'm very happy with my purchase
i bought the bag from staples , it is amazing and flawless , and as a bonus it comes with lifetime warranty i can place my laptop in this bag and it sits comfortably , extremely satisified i hope to use it for atleast # years
i got this for my husband who was using a backpack full of books , folders , and newspapers so for his birthday this year , i wanted him to graduate from the <unk> backpack but i knew it had to be something really functional , well made and nice looking , or he would n't use it this bag was exactly what i was looking for he loves it so much that he reminds me how well i did it often <unk> , old backpack
i ordered this for my husband for christmas , and we both love it the leather and construction are both great quality , and the bag looks great both with and without the shoulder strap the brass hardware in particularly looks really nice
a great deal for the price offered the pictures do not do justice , as this bag is of superb manufacturing and excellent leather quality it feels very light on hand or shoulder , but looks heavy-duty due to the leather finishing , but do n't get me wrong , it is thick leather very well done and as usual a great deal on amazon
from the moment i saw this briefcase i loved it it has lots of room and handy compartments it has worked perfectly to carry everything from my laptop and books to art supplies and my sketchbook
i use this as a doctor 's bag has a good front side for files , folders , room for pens and <unk> in the front the back half of the bag is large and i have a tendency to carry around more stuff in it than i need because of that it goes with me everywhere i go for the last # years and is holding up fairly well the large pouch on the back is n't holding it 's shape well now -lrb- only after two and a half years -rrb- , kind of bows out i think it will last another year or two under the very heavy use it 's received since i carry around a lot of stuff the weight is starting to wear out the fabric that hangs from the support bar in the middle i do receive compliments on my man purse
even better than the picture big enough bag to fit laptop and papers , and the color was even more beautiful in person i love this bag , perfect for law school
the bag arrived very promptly and was very well packaged the colour is fantastic and it looks great , certainly like a much more expensive bag bulky items are not best suited as the individual sections are obviously designed primarily for papers , small folders and your laptop plenty of pockets for small items as well all up this is a terrific bag and i 'm thrilled with it totally recommend this to others
the leather feels great and the build quality of the briefcase is superb i purchased a similar kenneth cole bag for $ # and my father took it this one is well worth the additional $ # i paid for it
i bought this for my husband and he really likes it and i like the way he looks carrying it : -rrb- it 's a win win there is a lot of room for his papers , laptop , etc . and it is a very handsome briefcase the quality of the bag is high , imo
actually , i gave this to my son - who is apparently pleased - so , i 'm sorry about a <unk> having to give its life - but it <unk> good ,
this is a great bag with a ton room the one i purchased was the tan -lrb- lighter color -rrb- because i think that if you 're going to buy a dark brown bag you might as well just buy a black bag as previous reviewers have noted , construction is super solid and i love the two pockets in front for my power cord , etc . yes this is n't top quality leather , but really good for the price and very attractive every time i 've seen this bag at the kenneth cole store it 's been full price so this is a really good deal
i 'm a <unk> and i meet many of my clients in their homes since i started carrying this briefcase a few months ago , i 've received compliments from almost all of my clients it its plenty big to fit calculators , pens , phone , etc . on the front and several large files in the larger pockets i will say that i rarely carry a lap top , so i do n't know how that would fit if it were in the with the files i would reccomend this to any <unk> looking to have a sharp and current image with their briefcase
i bought it for an interview of academic positions in <unk> it looks so <unk> to there <unk> easily contains a lot of things inside , very durable and <unk> me feel like a successful man
i purchased the tan bag for $ # i felt good about the bag fitting my professional style & yet remaining comfortably versatile & it fully fits the bill my laptop & peripherals fit comfortably the backside compartment is very roomy -lrb- books -rrb- & there is a separate area where files & papers fit i was pleasantly surprised by the number of compliments on the bag the comparable bags i considered were substantially more expensive - i am as proud of the bargain as i am the bag
this beautiful piece of luggage was just the perfect gift for our <unk> law 's graduation the color is great , and it 's a versatile piece thanks for a great selection on amazon !
i 've been looking for that perfect briefcase for years now : professional , easy to use , we 'll - designed , functional -- and at an affordable price well , this bag is all that and more it was a little stiff when it arrived , and that made it difficult to close the rear compartment and the front clasps at first as it has loosened up , though -- as leather is wont to do -- it has become very easy to use i 'd buy this again , but i do n't think i 'll have to ; it 's design and manufacture is as solid as they come well done , kenneth cole !
leather has slight imperfections that make it look like the bag is n't brand spanking new , which i like i 've received a lot of compliments so far plenty of room for my macbook , charger , pens , padfolio , etc . it even holds legal sized file folders i feel like it will last for years and years my only complaint is that i wish it had <unk> feet on the bottom , but i still think its a # star item without them if i ever loose this one i would definately buy again ive even considered buying a backup now so that when this one wears out i 'll have another -lrb- incase they <unk> this model -rrb- all my attorney coworkers are jealous of my bag , especially if they knew i paid probably half of what they paid for their bags
the description on the site claims that the bag fits # . # laptops however , when i received the bag , the label on it clearly states that it is for # . # netbooks i have dell vostro v # and it does n't fit in the bag i 'm very disappointed ! ! i 'm going to return the bag and never buy from this merchant again if i 've read all reviews i would n't have made this mistake , but i did n't expect such a blatant `` <unk> `` ! the bag itself is very nice
the add says it fits # in . laptops , however when i received the bag , the bag actually says it only fits # in . laptops ! ! ! what 's with that ? ? ? ! ! i had to check my order to see if i ordered the right thing the ad description is wrong i did not read more of the reviews - otherwise i would have seen that it does not fit # in . laptops i needed this bag right away now i have to return it and order another one this makes no sense
i ordered this carrying case for my # `` mac book and this bag does not fit it on the tag it clearly says this bag is for # . # `` computers , so i dont know why they false advertise for future purchases , i now know to read the comments b/c clearly had the same problem as myself unless ur computer was a lot smaller to begin wit do n't purchase this bag unless ur computer is # . # `` or smaller or unless you wan na cram your expensive computer into this carrying case
this bag is advertised as fitting laptops up to # . # inches i thought it would be ideal for my toshiba portege r # , which is a # . # inch laptop unfortunately , when i received the bag , i found that the label on the bag claims that it only fits laptops up to # . # inches my toshiba did not fit comfortably in the bag the bag seems decent and would probably work well for a smaller laptop or netbook , but it is too small for a # . # inch laptop
i can just barely cram my # `` macbook into it i do n't feel safe doing that , so for that reason alone i decided to return it it 's pretty clear that the front pockets are not really big enough for the power brick + long cord , let alone the other cables i usually carry -lrb- ipod , camera , etc -rrb- it does seem like a well made bag , it just does n't fit my needs at all
i bought the sumdex bag for my toshiba protege as an alternative to the toshiba sleeve , because i thought it offered more protection against physical damage and more room for accessory cables , mouse , etc . the sumdex product delivers on the former but disappoints on the latter the accessory space , which is not expandable , is too tight for my needs whereas the space for the notebook is roomier than necessary ; i wish sumdex had executed a better balance in other respects , the bag is well-made
good standard brief for laptops durable strap and smooth zippers i do wish there was a little more room for extras besides the laptop but it works well for its purpose
google was kind enough to send me a free cr- # computer , but i needed something to carry it in this fit the bill perfectly this is the third sumdex netbook bag i 've owned i find they are sturdy and designed to be exactly what you need the one problem with this bag is the amazon description it says it fits up to a # inch screen , but the tag that was on the bag when it arrived said it was for # . # inch screens that is perfect for the cr- # , but i can imagine that it would be a very tight squeeze for a macbook one improvement would be if the front pocket were a bit roomier and had some internal pockets and holders for pens , sd cards , loose change and such other sumdex bags i 've purchased had more compartments
i bought the case for my # . # `` notebook , it fits perfectly and still has room in the front pocket for the power cables , mouse , etc . after looking through # + cases on amazon , this was perfect
i bought a # . # inch toshiba u # laptop and wanted a bag that fit only the laptop , the cords , a mouse and thin mousepad this bag was perfect it has one large pocket for the extras , a shoulder strap that works well and handles i originally wanted a sleeve only , but i found that i like carrying the laptop by itself , not in another larger bag for traveling light , with just a laptop bag and a purse , this combo is perfect just a warning , the laptop can not be widescreen and it can not be larger than # . # inches diagonal , there is no wiggle room for anything larger
