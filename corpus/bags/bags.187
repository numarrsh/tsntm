for the money , you ca n't ask for <unk> 'll see how long it last green color is different then showed the color is kind of faded , not to happy with that , but will do the job
love , love , love the color it is a foam material so it wo n't protect from hard shocks like dropping it on the ground but it still protects from scratches and minor <unk> worth every penny
if i could i would give this product zero stars it does n't fit on my laptop at <unk> even close it looks nothing like the pictures and and my macbook slides around in it it has these weird rectangles on it the packaging the product arrives in is awful i would definitely not waste your time or money i will request a refund
i received my case about a month after i ordered it , and when it arrived i was severely disappointed the case is too large for the advertised # inch mac book pro - it does n't snap or adhere to my computer at all it was also shipped in very poor packaging and was damaged when i opened it . attempting to return it , but we will see how difficult they make this process
the plastic case i received does n't even fit on the top of my macbook and when i open it , the case grinds on the back of the computer piece of crap , do n't waste your money
seriously do n't buy this . it is n't the right size for the # inch macbook pro , it 's way too big and does not snap on like the picture looks like . serious rip off
first of all , the packaging seemed like it was rushed no information for this product at all second , i recently fell and dropped my laptop , which was also in a bag one would think this case would protect it however , the top of my laptop was dented since there is not much to this case my advice ; spend the extra money on a well-built case
either something went wrong during shipment , or this is just fake so do not fall for the title i was sent a beaten up and scratched macbook air case and not a macbook pro case like this advertises
the case that i received was not made for a macbook at all did not fit my laptop at all and came with smudges all over it do not order unless you want to get ripped off
when they send you the wrong item and even if they <unk> returning it , you have to pay the shipping cost to china as to the quality , it does not fit , particularly one with retina which the ad does not say it would not fit # inch mac pro with retina
i have a # inch macbook pro and this case does n't fit it the quality is very poor it 's inexpensive but ultimately not worth it if it wo n't functionally protect the laptop
this was not the right fit for my macbook pro # , # . # inch display i was disappointed because i like to have my case ready for when i get a new device not worth going through the hassle of returning
i expected a transparent case because it says clear it is frosted white and it did not even fit my computer when i said i wanted to do a return or exchange they said they would do nothing unless i sent pictures i know for a fact that it is not what it looks like in the picture it was already a really long time to get the case and now im dealing with having to return it if they will even let me i am completly frustrated and not happy at all with the product they should know what they are showing and what they are actually selling to the customer
i ordered this case for my macbook pro it said that it had a rubberized coating i received the case and it was pure plastic it also does not say the size anywhere the picture is also the wrong color the laptop case is a hot pink
this case is made of the worst material possible , it came with with dents and scratches when received the minutes you touch it gets scratch horrible , horrible purchase do think about getting this case , it sucks !
right from snapping on the case onto my # `` macbook pro , the case already did not fit snugly on the bottom , which concerned me a little bit thankfully , it stayed on after # days of use , the matte finish on the corners and the edges have begun to peel off and leave a very ugly plastic <unk> throughout the cover also , i noticed that every time i open the laptop , the cover of the top makes a little clicking noise when it rubs against the bottom case , which means poor planning and design sure , it 's one of the cheaper cases , but it 'll probably last a day or two at prime aesthetics my friend has been using a $ # case for three years without any signs of wear or tear it probably looks newer than mine right now spend a little more this case is definitely not worth your money
this is not the first time the wrong item was shipped there appears to be a concern with sending a cover for the macbook pro as ordered i received a cover for a macbook air ... three different times from three different companies it is quite frustrating having to send back products it is time consuming and unnecessary
i bought this case in high hopes of protecting my macbook without taking away from it 's natural beauty this case arrived scratched with four very large clear squares on the front that gives it a distorted look the website makes this case look like a nice clear case without four large squares on the front it 's very thin plastic and i ca n't see it protecting anything i will be requesting a refund from this seller
when the cases finally arrived , i tried to put them on and found they did not fit my laptop i have three of them and i can not use them i will not purchase from them again
i bought it as a gift for my sister , and the side chipped in less than # months with everyday up and down use i have a regular plastic case and albeit its <unk> and not as pretty as this case , is has not chipped or broken in any way there must be a better rubberized case out there available
i liked it but it is not that color , it is a little bit darker more like hot pink , not light pink . yes its clear but not what i expected
it looks like a good plastic cover . is really shinny but it is not pink . well is pink but like a <unk> . i dont know how to <unk> the color but is not the same pink the shipping took like a month im really disappointed with this product
i ordered this for my # rd gen -lrb- smaller , no cd drive -rrb- macbook pro # & # # ; , and recieved a # & # # ; macbook pro # nd edition -lrb- with cd drive -rrb- case it was not the product listed , so obviously i was upset i did however give this product a few stars because i did contact the company and they were very prompt and understand when it came to dealing with this issue i provided photos of the wrong product and they promptly offered a full refund <unk> to have received the wrong product , but have no issue with the seller
this case fits perfectly , but it has really annoying lines of plastic that form rectangles on the top by the clips i wish the lines were n't there because then it would have been great
it does n't fit perfectly , my boyfriend has the same one which is slightly smaller and fits like a glove , this one has a hair of space between the laptop and
i waited just short of three weeks past the last estimated date of delivery for this product to arrive giving them the benefit of the doubt , there was snow in the area but the snow was nowhere near the amount to grant # weeks <unk> i began to have doubts as to whether it was actually coming or not i emailed the seller and they only offered information that they shipped it the second time i emailed them with concern they actually sent me tracking information i think it should n't take two complaint emails to get tracking information on my product especially when it was almost # weeks late the product itself is satisfactory , however it did have scratches the scratches were less noticeable when i placed it on the computer but after waiting all this time for it to arrive , i do n't feel like taking the time to return it
this item did n't fit the computer it was advertised for the company was very helpful with the problem sad that the item did n't fit it looked wonderful i want the company got get lots of credit for making the problem right
i picked the rubber coated green , and when the case came it was baby blue i like it enough that i 'm not returning it , but definitely do n't count on the color being true no matter which you pick
i have had this for little over a month , and it is falling apart on me i am not rough on my computer , as a matter of fact , i only took it out of my home once i am disappointed and will have to purchase a new one soon . :
green is my favorite color , i purchased this shell because it said & # # ; clear green & # # ; however , i received a clear teal does not look like the picture , at all it 's grown on me but initially i was not happy
the case is nice , just what i was looking for fits around nicely and does not block any needed ports only problem is that it may be a little too loose it snaps when i grab it out of my backpack
i was looking for a fairly cheap clear case because it was going to get a decal sticker put over it the case fit great and still looks great even with the few scratches would i have liked no scratches sure but i mean when are you going to be looking at the backside of your laptop ... or the bottom i 'm almost positive that if i emailed them they would send me a new one i just know this is n't the first time it 's happened if they got the few knicks out they 'd be superb
it 's a pretty good case unfortunately i 've only had mine for a few months and it already has a couple cracks i 'm not sure what from but its still manageable for now
it was perfect fit it is just what i need it i picked a clear cover so that the decals and the art work i placed on my macbook is well covered and protected the quality is good and is so far durable
i like the cover , it really makes my macbook stand out in a clear case -lrb- as i do not like to accessorize my laptop -rrb- the only thing that kinda bothers me are the squares on the corners and sides it 's not that annoying or a big deal , just think that could be an improvement also , it 's pretty difficult to remove the case but i think that 's somewhat a good thing because at least you know it 's not loose and will easily come off if you accidentally drop it or something
i got a clear one because i have a decal on my macbook pro , i like it a lot but sometimes it slips off so you do have to be careful with
came in fast case is good , durable , looks nice on its not pitch black its more grey black when you put it on pretty good fit for my mac a little bit of room between front piece and laptop but its not a problem in my mind
this case is very easy to install , it looks great and fits like a glove on my macbook there are no instructions , however , they are not needed , the cover fits right on the macbook excellent delivery time , # % recommend this product and this
i love the color , it is a soft pink like in the photo fits great on my macbook pro # and it so easy to put on i love the feeling of it not to slippery and i got it in the mail super fast
i 'm still using it , has never come off by accident , same condition as i have bought and the sticky pads are still on the bottom of the computer i have yet to be able to part with the color , it goes its job ... computer looks brand new
fits fine , and have n't removed the case from my computer since i got it i enjoy less pricey cases since i poorly handle the computer and the case gets cracked computer still # % scratch / crack free and on my second case -lrb- first one ended up with multiple small cracks here and there .
this product was everything i hoped it would be it had a soft satin finish and went on easily , and not to mention a great price i have add it for more than a month now delivery was ahead of schedule
# -inch early # model fits great and keeps my laptop safe i have full access to all buttons it 's clear so you can see decals , if you have any , on your laptop
i really like this product it looks exactly like the picture it fits my computer perfectly i previously ordered a different one of these and was very unhappy with it the color was n't right and it was very thick this product turned out to be the exact color i was expecting and it is n't too thick i have had this product on my computer for about a week now it was very easy to put on the computer and it also comes off easily without messing up the computer
i will totally recommend this product it is very nice the color it 's a little bit different though i ordered the purple one and it looks like a darker purple , but over all it 's great
this case is really fabulous for the price so far , it rivals a speck case but without the crazy cost it snaps on nicely , is smooth , matte , and sleek i 'm very happy with this case overall
i ordered it , and it got here quickly i love the color , and it fits perfectly the only downside is that it can get slippery because it 's plastic and not the rubberized kind
exactly what the description says they were fast and easy easy to place and easy to take off it is clear enough to place stickers or whatever on the laptop
well , it 's definitely a good buy it 's perfectly clear , which i wanted instead of the frosted or colored cases because i love the look of my macbook all by itself it 's fairly easy to snap on , it does n't come with directions but its pretty easy to figure out all by yourself the only marks on it are from the spots where they <unk> the plastic into the mold to make the case , which are somewhat visible but do n't take away from the case i would definitely recommend it
i 've had my computer for over a year and this case has been on it since i got it really good for scratch protection only thing is , it bulks up the computer a little bit also , you ca n't open the computer as far because the snaps get in the way in the back but still , great product very pink though , very pink
i thought making this purchase was going to be a smooth transaction well i thought wrong i ordered a purple case and received a light blue case now i 'm going to have to wait again to have the right color shipped or order with somebody else *** please note *** i received the right color after contacting the seller needless to say , i love my cover and get a lot of compliments for it the cover give my mac a unique look
it is small ... but the perfect size for me i have # lenses and # camera body in the bag there is room for my ipad and <unk> <unk> the downside is i wish it came with more padding/protection
this was a gift for my daughter , who also received a new camera for christmas she was delighted with the bag it 's roomy and the compartments worked well with her camera accessories it looks great , too
today is march # th # not even a full year after purchasing and i have to replace it i am not a rough <unk> , especially with electronics , so i am unsure as to what happened suddenly there were cracks all through out the case that eventually lead to small chunks missing from the hard case it is almost as if the case dried out or something original review : i have had this case for a few days now and although i love it i ca n't give it # stars the top part of the case attaches securely but the bottom gets to sliding very easily that is my only problem with it , i really love the feel of it too with a better secured bottom it would surely have gotten # stars
update : i have had this case for two days and it has scratched my forearms to the point that i am going to take it off and throw it in the trash do n't waste your time on this case the black version of this case is absolutely not see through and the apple logo does not shine through at all i saw some reviewers mention that theirs is see through but they must have changed the case and as of # / # it is not see through at all i suppose it is a little <unk> to want to see the logo through the case , but it 's nice to show off your $ # laptop a little the case has an excellent rubber texture that is pleasing to touch and has excellent grip another reviewer mentioned that the front edges where your forearms rest are not level with the computer and it is noticeable enough to make me want to sand it down with a dremel tool or something like that
no one seems to know which model of the macbook pro the cover is for not all models are the same i have two , a late # -lrb- a # -rrb- and a late # -lrb- a # -rrb- these are just # of the models so , which case is this for
i will probably never use this it 's not quite what i am looking for because it feels so cheap , like it 's going to break this is the downside to internet shopping you can actually pick up and hold what you 're purchasing i think the item description is somewhat misleading . and for the price you can do better
opposite of what others have received the keyboard cover is the only thing that actually fits my laptop the top part of the cover is fine , but the bottom piece is too short and covers part of the ports of the macbook the only way both pieces & # # ; fit & # # ; is if my laptop is closed i wasted $ #
pros : absolutely none unless you like fancy cheap chinese product cons : it is cheap makes a macbook pro look like a generic acer pc computer did i mention it was cheap
case i purchase one from a different vendor for my wife it has been # years not a single problem , the one i got the plastic is like to soft and brake like dry soap
this is not an inexpensive alternative to other options it did not fit the mac pro well and there were plastic pieces that <unk> scratching both the palms of my hands and my wrists i suggest looking at other products and pay the extra money
this case performed well for around # months after that , it started chipping away on the corners for the price , i guess i could say that i got my money 's worth but , it would have been an awesome , # -star product if it had stood the test of time a little better
i do n't consider myself extremely hard on my gear , but these covers seemed a bit too easy to break they look neat and gave the laptop a different kind of feel if you 're just going for a change in aesthetics , they 're cheap enough
just bought the case and put it on , so i have no idea how well it will hold up in the long term however it seems to secure well and looks nice on the laptop only issue so far is with its price -lrb- $ # bucks with shipping for a cheap looking case -rrb- and the annoying keyboard cover definitely recommend getting a different cover because this one makes it hard to type and looks crappy
simply put , the case i got was not see-through at all , so i ended up just putting stickers on mine the case is alright , otherwise the keyboard cover worked fine , until it got worn / stretch out some how it basically does n't conform to the keys anymore , which is really unfortunate because i liked the cover
the top cover fits snugly and has a nice texture that improves your grip on the mbp the bottom piece is hard plastic with vents and the same rubbery finish my only complaint is that case 's front edges , both where the case snaps on and in other spots , are higher than the mbp 's wrist rest surface you do n't notice the edges if you 're wearing long sleeves , but they scratch your wrists if you 're in short sleeves that wo n't be a problem in the winter , plus the case is decent quality for the price , but i 'll probably remove the bottom half of the case in the spring
the case arrived quickly , and fit decently on my computer it looks very nice and does not add any bulk or noticeable <unk> to my macbook pro of course , it keeps the surface of my mb <unk> the only issue i have is that the plastic began to crack and chip off within the first few weeks i have n't had the case very long and it 's already disintegrating i take good care of my macbook , and i only move it a matter of # feet within my living room it does n't travel with me , and neither does the case it seems unusual for a product to <unk> like this , but because it was cheap i am giving this # stars knowing what i know now , i would still order this but plan on replacing it a couple times per year
i 've had this only about a week and already it has a chip on the bottom front edge also , the rubberized finished has rubbed away in a small area on the top leaving the shiny plastic underneath showing through i have been very careful with moving my laptop and it travels in a brief case especially designed to hold and protect it with <unk> foam padding , etc . since i paid $ # i guess i ca n't complain but i thought from the review i read that i would be getting a better quality product than this
it is a case , and it fits my # & # # ; macbook pro perfectly does n't cover the very back though which is weird the free keyboard cover that came with this is worthless too
i got this cover just to change it up -lrb- i had a purple one on before it fits well on my # & # # ; macbook pro the only negative thing i have to say is that it shows your fingerprints and dust , but i guess every black colored thing usually does that the keyboard cover that came with it was very cheap compared to other free ones that i have received with other cases but that 's not a huge deal overall a good case
i was n't sure what to expect from this case i 'm buying it for a early # macbook pro i 've had it for a few days it seems to fit fine and adds some degree of protection it came with the # case pieces and the keyboard cover overall , i feel it 's a good purchase for under $ #
well everything is perfect but the keyboard protector , that one is so cheap and useless ... but the hard cases were very good , easy to install and you can still see the apple logo
it protects my computer . it had some minor scratches and blemishes on the case , but personally , i do n't really care . i just want something to protect my computer and it gets the job done
pretty good inexpensive case for your mbp the over all quality is not not bad only thing i did n't like was the feet are white seemed funny when i ordered a black case bottom line good product for the
love this shell case it is a great fit for mac and it gives me a sense of added protection prevents mac from sliding over surfaces , which could cause scratches or potential fall it is not bulky , and simply looks like the device came like that highly recommended for anyone looking for a skin to protect mac from dings and
love this case i love the rubberized feel and how it doesnt feel like plastic the grips on the bottom make it nice so the case doesnt scratch my desk and prevents the computer from sliding when typing on it would recommend for anyone to buy it
i wish that i had purchased this cover when i first purchased my macbook even though its only two years old constant carrying and stuffing it into my computer case was beginning to take a toll on its appearance , but now it is completely protected
this case was cheaper than others so i was suprised , it fit perfect and has the rubber feel and the keypad cover is also easy to use and stays perfectly in place
there is nothing wrong with this sleeve , but i expected to have higher quality for the price the inside is n't soft , and might eventually lead to the finish off your computer wearing thin and there is probably not much protection if you should drop it and if you have a # or # . # inch laptop it will have about # & # # ; wiggle room in the case it fits my old hp dv # quite well though . bottom line you should spend the money on a better sleeve for your expensive electronics
feels very durable and think it will be easy to clean really like the fact that it is well padded to protect my macbook pro # & # # ; little room for much more in the outside pocket except a few papers and a pen on the down side for me was the lack of some sort of <unk> strap looking at adding my own to it like the opening being on the short end rather than the long side , like all the others
i really like this case i like the edge that it opens on unlike how most cases open on the long end and it 's a good size for the # & # # ; retina
it 's very well made the cushioning inside is the perfect thickness for me to feel confident that my laptop is secure , yet fit into my backpack without taking up too much space the zipper is also very secure
it is great to have a case made of <unk> <unk> instead of neoprene or other plastic i had a case like this , in a different color and bought this one for my daughter it is pale grey , sturdy and conveniently has the nice , chunky zipper on the short end so you can slip the computer into and out of the case while the case is in your backpack
as other reviewers have stated , this is a pain to deal with when you are ready to get up and move the desktop could be about an inch bigger i have a # & # # ; dell that <unk> barely fits my computer has a battery that protrudes off the bottom , so sometimes when i have the battery resting on the desktop , it will slip off causing my computer to slam onto the desktop but i have to use the battery as support because it elevates the bottom of my computer off of the desktop that -lrb- as others have stated -rrb- provides no airflow to the bottom of the computer and i 'm not crazy about the bottom part of the stand i like to sit with my legs crossed , but i ca n't for long with this because my feet end up resting on the stand which is quite uncomfortable after about # minutes
i have been using a lapdesk that sits across my legs the weight of the laptop and the lapdesk caused me some discomfort as i have been awaiting surgery to for a total hip replacement this started my <unk> to find a lapdesk that would bear the weight of the computer ; therefore , i chose the <unk> lapdesk to meet this critical need the lapdesk is excellent no weight or heat from the laptop on my legs it is well-constructed and an absolutely terrific product i highly recommend it
i recently purchased this <unk> lapdesk for my daughter who is in college living in a dorm room it is so perfect because it easily collapses for storage when not in use which is perfect for a limited space my daughter is able to sit in her bed while working on her laptop doing homework or watching netflix or chatting on facebook ! ! she absolutely loves it you can use it in other places besides just sitting in your bed i am going to purchase one for myself as well i highly recommend it it 's a great invention
i ordered the # & # # ; bag i received the # & # # ; bag when i returned the bag stating that i wanted the # & # # ; bag , i was sent another # & # # ; bag the plastic wrap on both items stated it was the # & # # ; model but the actual tag on the item showed it was the # & # # ; model was n't worth the <unk> of sending back again so it got tossed in the goodwill pile
this is not exactly what i wanted but it does the job until i find the one that i do want will be perfect to take on the airplane because it does n't take up much room since it is not bulky in any
i love this product 'cause # -rrb- it has a military look and it is supposed to be supplied military <unk> , # -rrb- it is well tailored for being carried by hand or on shoulder but i had size # for my laptop with # inch screen
vertical laptop bags are in a minority , and most have a single zipper at the top , whereas as this bag 's zipper wraps around three sides of the top so that the top opens completely this is not important in a horizontal bag , since there is more area involved , but a boon for the vertical format a velcro safety tab within the zippered part keeps the laptop from slipping out accidentally the accessory pouch expands generously and makes more sense than <unk> a separate partition within the main part this is an intelligent and <unk> bag , well-made , and <unk> priced one might quibble about the plastic clips on the shoulder strap , but these are pretty normal on laptop bags and not likely to snap under any normal use very happy with it
i recently purchased asus vivobook x # <unk> # t # . # -inch touch laptop and therefore bought this laptop case for it this product claims to fit # . # `` laptops however it did not fit my # . # inch asus
i bought this case for my macbook air and thought it was reasonably priced , but now i understand why that was so the case seems to be plenty serviceable when it comes to padding and protection however , i 've had terrible problems with the zipper , which continually gets caught even when material is n't getting pinched with it it usually takes several tries to get it zipped up , which becomes frustrating after a while i 'm keeping the case and it 's perfectly ok if you 're going to pay less than $ # for it , but if you 're going to make an investment in a case i recommend looking elsewhere
the quality and finish of the case is top notch works perfectly with my mac air i can leave the charging cable on after the computer is stored , which is very important to me the zipper is designed to close without hanging up on the cord the materials used are rugged
i bought this for my asus vivobook , thinking it would fit perfectly i <unk> the specs and found out when it came that it was too small it still deserves # stars for quality and speedy shipping the size issue was my own human error
i was very excited to get the pack ; i really liked the design , layout and versatility of the compartments unfortunately , i had it exactly # days before an interior seam next to the computer compartment began unraveling - to the tune of # inches i could have understood the failure had i overloaded it , but that was n't the case at all and why should i have to repair a defect after having just bought the product so i packed it back up and shipped it back as a return
it says it fits a # & # # ; laptop but that 's a big lie i bought this and tried to put in my # & # # ; laptop and it did n't fit it is more suitable for a # & # # ; laptop do n't trust it might be a waste of money
i 've had this bag for several days now and despite the beautiful design and the hidden <unk> cover , this bag leaves a lot to be desired the threading on one of the bottom strips is coming apart . later that day that i noticed the threading issue , one of the two zipper hooks on the front main opening popped off i 've decided that this bag will be a secondary bag to a better bag i 'm still in search of a main backpack because this bag just does n't cut it
this bag would have been big enough , but because it loads from the side , the opening is too small to get a # & # # ; laptop inside too bad , it is a nice bag , but i will be returning it
... but was n't what i needed i have a new # . # `` -lrb- diagonal measurement -rrb- widescreen hp laptop and this backpack looked large enough at first glance to fit it in fact it could probably fit it -lrb- albeit snugly -rrb- but for one small issue , the side loading zipper is n't large enough to pass a # . # `` laptop the opening is only slightly too small to fit a *** # . # `` *** laptop it appears it would fit a # . # `` laptop no problem . the issue is that the zipper is purely side loading it does n't wrap on the top or bottom at all , so the opening is actually slightly smaller than the compartment otherwise , the bag appeared well made and sturdy the look of the bag was exactly what i thought it would be and everything about it would have been perfect had it not been for the small issue of not fitting my laptop
great pack , the cover is fairly water resistant got caught in a huge down pour shortly after receiving the backpack <unk> still got in , but if it was n't for the cover i would be pouring water out of it the side load for the laptop does is not big enough for a # & # # ; laptop maybe a tablet but not a laptop need another # / # inches for one to fit i still use the pack for my laptop by putting it in the main compartment
