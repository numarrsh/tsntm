i would not buy this case again , because it has no convenient usb cord storage location i am sure the case will work great when if eventually drop it , but the fact that i have to store the usb cord in another pouch bothers me great idea ; poor execution
this is a great product and definitely protects the western digital my passport drive as advertised however , the designer of this case made one huge oversight -lrb- in my opinion -rrb- - they left absolutely no room to include the usb cable my goal for a carrying case like this is so that i can take my drive and my cable , in one case , and commute between my home office and my work office i just want to pick up the case and hit the road - but i now have to also remember to get the cable , put it in my pocket , and also pick up the case and go i know it 's a small thing , but to me this is a huge oversight
this case provides good protection for my # . # tb passport , but there are a couple of flaws it 's heavy it does n't have space for the cable , which i would think is a <unk> for a case the hole in the base so you can plug in the usb is n't lined up properly for the new usb # . # passports they 'll plug in , but at a slight angle running the drive inside the case , if you do plug the cable in , the heat from the drive melts the rubber bumpers inside the case still deciding whether i want to keep this the compatibility of case choice on amazon is n't clear , so i may have to shop around elsewhere since marketplace descriptions are pretty <unk>
once you put your wd portable drive in this bad boy , you need never take it out there is a little tab to open for the cable this is a hefty case which i trust more than another electronics case i 've seen . # stars four months of light use and the clip to secure it broke too bad because it was otherwise a great case
i purchased this item for my wd # tb passport for mac but it was n't <unk> i had to modify the rubber padding inside the portable hard drive now fits inside the case but there is a slight gap in the seal round the edges even when the hard drive is n't in the case the case does provide some protection for the hard drive but it 's only slightly water resistant at best perhaps if water was <unk> on it but it would definitely fail if <unk> in water for as little as one or two seconds
this case is not compatible with the western digital my passport studio it 's in the fine print under the description , right after it names several my passport types with which it is <unk> compatible it 's much smaller than the photo projects it 's nice and snappy water tight feeling i 'll find a purpose for it instead of returning it the search i typed in specifically said studio and this product came up in the results window there is hope after all computers are n't the know it all that we fear they might be as long as there are <unk> in the work flow , there will be <unk> , and that keeps us all in a job some where some how
i bought this because recently i was picking up my laptop and had forgotten that my wd passport was attached by a <unk> cable as i grabbed my laptop off the counter , the passport went flying across the room luckily , it still functioned , but i wanted to be safer in the future plus , the passport is so slippery , which is an issue in itself so i ordered a new passport drive and the nomad case certainly the case will protect the drive in case of a fall but why is the plastic shell of the nomad case slippery , too ca n't wd make a <unk> case
i damaged one of my portable hard drives which i care around all the time when i replaced my hard drive i purchased this case thinking it would be durable it actually is but the clasp that keeps it closed broke i just have not had a chance to send it back yet for a replacement
the case is definitely rugged and will protect your drive to that end it works great it is padded on all sides and looks like it would take a fall reasonably well , although i did n't actually test its ability to do so -lrb- why tempt <unk> -rrb- there is no real place to store your cable if you have a thinner drive and curl the cable just right , you can jam it in there , leaving the case bulging at the seems -lrb- not a good idea -rrb- there is a thin foam on the inside that you may be able to peel out to gain a smidgen of space , but i did n't bother trying since the drive is essentially a <unk> with out the cable , i do n't know what they were thinking with this design i am left going back to my soft case which has a pouch for the cable also , this case does add a little bulk to an otherwise small drive , but i figured it would since it protects it on all sides this fact would n't deter me from a purchase , but lack of cable storage means it is not a <unk> unit
it 's well built it 's even kind of interesting as an object i have a # tb usb # my passport drive and it fits just fine i 'm curious why there is n't an integrated cable carrier incorporated in the case unless there 's a hidden compartment i have n't found yet it 's already fairly large and heavy so i do n't imagine these were design concerns it 's a little silly to have a loose cable to deal with when it could easily be incorporated in the case
it 's a nice case but it does n't fit the wires inside if used with a # tb wd hard drive i do like it and the fact that you do n't have to take it out of the case to plug it in
the case is rugged and protects the # tb portable drive i use with it , but its bottom is smooth and slippery it slides as if it were on ice if you 're not careful , with the slightest nudge the case will slide off the the edge of a desk or the top of a desktop that 's happened to me twice , with the case and drive falling to the ground , and that how i know the case protects the drive its bottom should be redesigned not to slip and slide
this is a great case , and it protects my drive just fine it have even survived a few minor drops the only improvement that i think would help the product is a place to store the cord inside the case
well i am becoming a fan of wd usb # . # hard drives , the cases are to darn small there is barely enough room in most cases for the transfer cable and there is absolutely no room what so <unk> for a transfer cable that stinks , fix it
missed the part about it isnt compatible with the # tb hard drive but i was able to make it work and i think it will work amazingly overseas and
this case fits really well with my wd external hd my only complaint is that it did n't come with the protective <unk> in the picture i was really hoping to place my <unk> , -lrb- whom i was going to name <unk> -rrb- on my case so he could fight off any <unk>
its well built and probably does what its advertised to do but on the outside its all plastic and gets scratched easily i mean when you even keep it on the table and moves around little bit they should have had some sort of rubber to protect the bottom and also some sort of clip to hold the cable
i 've had this product for a few weeks now i do like it pros : hard shell , <unk> lined , looks sexy , molded grommet -lrb- nice to attach a carabiner or the like -rrb- cons : no place to store a usb cord , the little rubber cover that allows you to plug in your passport while in the case -lrb- closed and sealed -rrb- is a bit difficult to get open other thoughts : latches shut much like a pelican case i 've not tested to see if it really is waterproof it appears it may be though
the one thing i did n't notice when i ordered is that there is a port in the case for the wire , so you dont have to remove the drive to attach it . this thing is great except , as every other reviewer states , it doesnt hold the wire for the drive , which killed a star , and is kind of annoying
it has <unk> in the bottom of my purse for a year now and still solid you would have to see my purse to know that is a complement only improvement would be better quality port covers
i bought this case to protect my wd hard drive and i 'm glad i did i have the highest confidence that if it gets dropped or handled roughly , this hard shell case will protect it i also just want to say if you 're thinking you might not need one , think about this this $ # -lrb- got it at best buy for $ # -rrb- case is an investment to protect your , at least , $ # + hard drive not to mention the priceless home pictures , videos , music , documents , movies , etc you 'll be storing inside it i used it to transfer my pictures and itunes multimedia from a windows pc to my macbook it was n't complicated or difficult this whole process took approx # min to transfer about # gb of data after that was finished , the hard drive was used as a time capsule for my mac the process of backing up # gb of data , it was approx # min
i really like the rugged case it 's really tough and durable and definitely serves the purpose i bought it for , which is protecting my hard drive for # tb hard drives , it fits a little tight , but i do n't think it 's a problem
this is a solid piece of plastic i love that it has an external opening so that my passport does n't have to ever leave the case have n't tested it with water just yet , but it seems to have a solid seal to protect it , minus the opening i have this thing with spilling water bottles in my bags ... hoping for the best
if it had a little storage pouch or area attached to put the chord , i would have given it # stars it fits both the & # # ; wd my passport # . # & # # ; and # . # tb units perfectly and has much internal protection and the case seems to be well made and strong
i previously owned the soft case for the wd drive after accidentally dropping the drive -lrb- which rendered it unusable -rrb- , it was time for a more protective case my only complaint is there is no place to store the usb cable in the case during travel as did the soft shell storage case
this has been one of my best investments in a hard disk case till date my wd passport # tb fits just right into the box without any free space the additional rubber padding that comes with the box have not found any use so far once you have the drive setup inside the case , your cable can be connected from an external outlet directly to your laptop thus avoiding any need to take the hd out of the case only , concern is when you wish to travel or keep the hd in safe storage , the external cable does not have any space inside the box to put it in the hd takes up all the space available and the case does not have any more space left for the cable i leave the cable out
the wd passport is very sleek and i presume not well insulated so i bought this case , which is a lot of protection when everything is closed the fit is very snug and there 's a lot of soft plastic inside to cushion with a hard exterior once you got ta connect your drive , you open up a soft plastic cover to a hole in the case , that gives you access to the port of the drive why would you want to do that the port opening is probably the most vulnerable part of the drive , letting fluids in etc . even though the main seam of the case is waterproof there 's a gaping hole for the port a better design would be to have the drive connect to an interior usb plug , and have that connect to the outside of the case a # . # & # # ; connection running inside the case to the outside , so your drive is truly concealed the case is fine otherwise , i 'm just keeping this in my room , but i 'd like to not have a gaping hole on the side
i love this case cause it could protect my drive from being scratched , waterproofed , etc . however , one bad thing about this is that after using it for a while , the drive gets hot and kinda melts the rubbers ; leaving rubber marks on my beautiful shiny drive if they could fix this problem , it would be awesome ! ! ! one more thing , like previous buyers , this doesnt fit the # tb well , way too tight for it
for all of those wondering : while the case is n't designed to fit for the my passport # tb , it fits perfectly just be sure you switch out the inside stickers with the ones they provide to make it fit better anyway , i love this case while the price was a little steep , i needed something that could handle my on-the-go video editing lifestyle without my having to worry about protecting my data
i like the fact that this case protects your hard drive from falls and bumps it 's a great and rugged case the only thing i do n't like is that it does n't have a place to put your usb cable if it did , i would give it # stars
this case is the ultimate - durable , <unk> and very hard to <unk> i feel good knowing that my wd drive is safely housed inside of it that having been said , my one and only complaint is that this case lacks a good spot to clip the usb cable this drive requires a set of clips on the outside , a small area to house the cable inside - anything would be good , as i prefer to carry the cable and drive as one unit even better would be some kind of retractable cable to which the drive could connect internally , but that would certainly add cost all in all , i am very pleased with the extra security this case provides
the case worked out great but is a little large some complain about the lack of cable storage but if you think about it , you do n't want to be opening the case in a harsh climate anyway buy an extra cable and keep it in your bag
i am happy to buy this unfortunately , the usb hdd which i purchased along with this from wd was total waste but wd nomad rugged case is good quality and worth money never buy wd my passport external usb
it 's a great product i think it 's very durable and reliable the only complaint that i have is that it is hard to put the cable connection when the external drive is inside the case and when it is closed you have to find your way to plug in the connection
i rated this product # stars but i would 've rated this # . # i liked this case a lot , i mean it really protects your external hard drive from <unk> its just that there can be space left to put the usb cable in instead of being tied outside i would greatly recommend this
bought this for the # tb external for use in afghanistan saved the hard drive from a lot of banging around and traveling wish the cable would fit somewhere or have a pouch outside to hold it
this certainly feels very strong and protective it has a very hard outer shell which seals well - and the inside offers some softer contact points to cushion the hdd on the downside , it is a bit larger and quite a bit heavier than i had anticipated it is significantly bigger than the drive it contains if it does the job of protecting my data , i guess this will be a price worth paying
this is a great product it is well built , and rugged what the product description fails to tell you , is that this case is not compatible with usb # . # tb my passport drives when you buy it , the box clearly says it is not compatible however , if you pop off the plastic bases with the rubber bumpers , the drive fits perfectly fine you do n't even need to install the # nd set of bumpers because the drive fits snugly without them if you install the # nd set , it fits , but it leaves a small orange strip , not as much with the plastic bases on , but you can still see orange so , yes , this does work with # tb versions the other problem , there is nowhere to store the usb cable other than that , this would be a # star product
i see a lot of reviews about this that talk about there not being anywhere to store the usb cord i find this to be a minute matter as this case is awesome for keeping your hard drive safe and secure i have young children who are not the easiest on technology and i have yet to have a problem with leaving my hard drive in this case in their hands on trips its the best because they get entertainment -lrb- <unk> shows -rrb- to watch while not burning up any of my mobile data was a wonderful purchase also the people talking about no storage for the cord do n't you put this in with your laptop in its bag ?
twice the storage of a lacie rugged , just as protected , half the price very happy with the case & the ultra that fits inside ca n't see any reason to spend so much more on the lacie
anyone who has an external hard drive should get this case ! its super tough and the best part is , you never have to take it out of the case once it 's in theres a tab that pulls open which you can insert your usb # cable and you 're good to
got this for my travels in afghanistan and it 's been thrown in a duffel bag and those get thrown around a lot i take it out of the bag and plug it in and it 's still working without any issues great buy and good investment
i lost all my data of my previous hard drive spent lot of money with wd trying yo <unk> it this case protects perfectly my hard drive i strong recommend for users that need to transport data all the time
should have bought two paid $ # for the first ... $ # for the second keep the passport drives well protected if you 're worried about heat , keep the cove opened
i have seen both <unk> on the question : does the my passport # tb fit this case yes , yes it does i just received the delivery of my nomad case & i like it already i do not plan to test the drop distance any actual & # # ; test & # # ; will be accidental so , the & # # ; # & # # ; goes in nice , the lid will close although it is tight and a very narrow seam of the <unk> edge sealing material is visible with gentle pressure you can eliminate the seam 's visibility , which can only mean , i will now attach the thinner fittings supplied , as the <unk> fittings are the thicker of the two i may just & # # ; go # it & # # ; & attach a carabiner to the ring and call it <unk> !
this is a very well made product with safety and protection in mind i feel safe knowing this rugged case is protecting my external hard drive and its contents from outside elements i definitely recommend this case to anyone
you can use it without ever taking it out of the case the best case have purchased never take the drive out of the protective case . it has a place to connect usb externally through the case
this package arrived on time i really like the case i am using it with the wd my passport for mac # tb external hd i thought that it was going to be easier to open but actually i like the design on the inside there are foam pads with adhesive that can be placed on the inside case walls the pads completely eliminated shaking of the hd within another thing i like is that the case has an opening located in the same place as the hd usb port so the cord can be connected without opening the case for this reason i do n't ever really plan on taking the hard drive out this i am sure will keep my hd in perfect condition for many years to come and i think the case looks really cool
i have one of the newer # tb my passport portable harddrives this is a little bit more tick than normal ones it almost doesnt fit but you can remove some cushions and then it will fit ok it really serves it purpose
this is an absolute necessary accessory for the passport external drive to the point that the passport should not be sold without it with the size of drives getting bigger and bigger the impact of drive failure is becoming greater this rugged case will at least give you a chance of real protection should the drive fall i have seen many persons go to the repair store in a desperate attempt to get someone to repair a drive that fell this is one case where prevention is far better than a cure
these work great they are a little expensive but i think worth it the only thing that is wrong is the drive led is not visible once installed there is no storage for the usb # . # cable so the cable must be left in or carried separate it does make the drive a little large due to the protection surrounding it but i think it is worth it i have some of the zippered cases and those are fine but they just ca n't protect the drive from accidents like this one
i give this product # stars i now own # of these the keep my hdd from the dents and dings that items in a tactical backpack would dish out i have dropped , banged , tossed , and tightly packed this case and my hdd always boots up the first one i owned i did a serious stress test on it to my amazement and liking , over time i bought more when you are on the move like i am , this is the protective case to buy hdd does not overheat after # hrs <unk> solid use buy one and see for yourself
using it for last couple of months and it is strong like a rock must have with the wd hdd i have # tb hdd and this goes quite well with it and case has got an attitude too
i bought this case for wd my passport # tb usb # . # the case fits perfect and keeps my external hdd safe worth spend some cash for the case
it is a little bit heavy but very strong material that they use for it i always carry this in my bag now i feel safer to carry it out
this case was a great investment it does protect up to the listed height if dropped purposely poured water to see if it protected my external hard drive buried it in the garden for a week and then removed to see if any dirt or dust was on the inside it protects the way it say it will
i love the wd my passport drive for external storage i have a handful of them i recently bought this case to put my & # # ; time capsule & # # ; version of one of them in my go bag so i made sure that my critical data safe regardless of what happens
the hard drive this case is meant for fits perfectly in this case i travelled all over the world with this in my backpack with it getting pretty roughed up at times and there has n't been any damage to the drive inside you do n't even need to open it to use the drive the only downside is that there is nowhere to store the usb cable
i picked this up in the hope that it would not be bulky or overheat the # tb wd my passport drive that i bought at the same time the case is very well constructed with zero vibration , zero heating , and good sealing against dust and minor moisture i highly recommend this small extra footprint to give excellent protection to your data , especially if you travel with it in a backpack as i do
this item is the complement of wd my passport portable external hard drive storage , it 's so necessary to have it to protect your portable hard drive i recommend this item , is easy to use it , you will not lose your money , it 's guaranteed !
i carry my external drive with me everywhere this is the first hard case i 've found that was n't really expensive it 's nice and compact , as is the drive the case is really sturdy and i do n't worry about my drive getting damaged anymore the drive and case are n't very heavy either , which is nice when you 're carrying things around
this case fits the passport well and looks like it will protect the drive when i inevitably drop it it would be nice if the case would fit the usb cord , but then the case would be need to be bigger i do like the size and fit
bought this for my husband , needed something with the waterproof capability due to his job living on a boat its lightweight and fits perfectly over his # tb hard drive might get one for myself
using # of these as offsite backups for small business by rotating out daily , rubber piece covering port is not a long term daily use item but not unexpected <unk> . left on porch # <unk> dogs put to the test , just left a couple of teeth scratches and indents happy with product
i bought each of my sons the # tb my passport hard drives and each one of these rugged cases hopefully , it will prevent accidents like my younger son 's previous portable hard drive being dropped and crashed during his move this is a great idea and the case is very sturdy looking and not overly huge or bulky
i too have a # tb passport drive and it fits nicely into the wd nomad case when the lower profile inserts remove the existing black <unk> inserts and insert the low profile inserts which are supplied the only downside is there isnt much room to store the cable inside
very well built , solid case for your drive very easy to use and install it seems to dissipate heat from the drive very well have not tested it 's sealing ability , but it looks to be decent
this case is <unk> the case you need to buy to protect your wd my passport # tb portable external usb # . # hard drive it solid , hard protective case with a hole which you can open the lid to plug your usb cable without opening the case
rugged and well-built , this case is perfect for heavy-duty situations or just throwing in your brief case just make sure your hd has the appropriate physical dimensions for a proper fit -lrb- if your <unk> model number does n't show up in the nomad 's compatible drive list , try viewing the various nomad reviews on youtube and compare their <unk> to yours .
straight dropped it wit my # tb passport in it same day i opened it all up and put it in the case for the first time passport is still good and my essential # gb passport fits in it too well done western digital
once you put your passport into this case , there 's no need to ever remove it again there 's a hole in the bottom of the case to access the port for the cable i highly recommend you buy this case
for its price this case is a great idea for anyone who ever moves their hard drive , even if its just across the room my personal drive has been knocked off a table or the couch a few times and i think this has protected it from real damage i keep the case in my backpack pretty often and i tend to be pretty rough with my bag ive had some hard drives crash and it can hurt a lot to lose all your data if you buy a passport , buy this case and always backup your stuff
this is a very good product , i saw some videos about and test by my self his quality xd , very useful for me that work around dust and am not a very good <unk>
seams very well built , but would just want to suggest opening the case or take the drive out if you plan on using for an extended period of time or plan on transferring a lot of data the drive will get hot with no ventilation but love the case
best accessory found this case is stylish it is also very useful it seems waterproof , bomb proof , bullet proof and destruction proof i wish it was waterproof but it definitely protects my portable drive recommend to everyone
this was an awesome product , but i did not get to use it and had to return it because it was for a different model than what i purchased amazon was great about the return fast , did not charge me any extra
i love this nomad rugged case it fits my passport perfectly and i do n't have to panic if i bang this around a little loved the fact that you can plug into your computer right through the case always a good idea to protect an expensive computer item with something like this you wo n't do wrong to buy this
we have yet to really <unk> this case , but so far , so good we bought it for a my passport drive and the hd fits snugly into the case so snugly that it takes a little bit of effort in getting the drive out
this case protects my western digital <unk> # tb hard drive with a tight fit it 'll fit surely just adjust how the rubber stoppers are aligned inside the case i 've dropped this more than # times on concrete floors on different occasions -lrb- whenever i 'm in the field backing raw files of what i shoot -rrb- just consider this case an investment it 's cheaper to protect a hard drive than have it repaired or recovered you will , yes you will eventually drop your hard drive at least twice or <unk> in it 's lifetime so better safe than never ;
i loved my case , the hard drive fits perfectly ! my only problem is that there is no place to store the usb cable ! ! i don ; t know were to store it so i do n't loose it , but other that i love ot ! !
was expecting a typical external wd drive case got more than i expected this is an actual enclosure and it is pretty solid there 's an opening for the usb connection so the <unk> does n't even have to be opened i really like this little solid <unk> drive sits securely inside
bought this to go with a wd # tb drive the drive fits very snug in the case i never have to take it out of the case due to the opening for the usb cord
this case rocks . make sure you order the right one to properly fit your external hard drive i 've had mine for # months with heavy usage and it is a solid case to keep around worth every penny
this is the best thing ive bought in a very long time i drop this case with my hard drive so many times havent had any issues yet it really works
i bought this and <unk> digital my passport # tb usb # . # portable hard drive - <unk> # <unk> -lrb- black -rrb- while i was waiting for my drive and case to arrive , i read on the wd site that the drive was not compatible with the # tb drive since it was thicker to my surprise , the case has two removable spacers with some rubber fingers on them you can snap out the spacers and <unk> the rubber fingers , over the location where the spacers were installed the drive will fit in the case and close with minimal effort it does not feel like you are forcing it and if it were any easier to close , the drive would be lose and i would be concerned it would bounce around if it were to fall
the ultimate in protection for your wd passport portable hard drive got ta have it if you hike or do anything outdoors great product but bulky , so i will only use it when travelling or outdoors
this western digital external hard drive fits perfectly the case is hard , strong , well made and easy to use there is a little hole on one end , with a rubber plug , to allow the usb cable to attach to the drive -lrb- through the side of the case -rrb- this allows the use of the drive while it is still in the case
<unk> protege <unk> <unk> <unk> western digital <unk> <unk> <unk> un material <unk> y con una <unk> muy <unk> es la una buena <unk> de <unk> la <unk> de el <unk> <unk>
this case is what everyone who travel or tend to drop thing at time or just wan na be on the safe side should have the best thing about this product i love it you do n't even have to open the case to plug it and access you file i wish they have that for the two # tb
such a hardcore case ! ! i love it perfect fit for my # tb wd passport i try to leave the case open when i 'm running my external hard drive in it , though , because i 'm afraid of overheating nothing wrong with this case imho
first i thought that this would be an accessory that i would never test i was wrong , in the first week of use , i dropped it from my computer table , and was glad that i had put this case definitely recommend to those <unk> moments
i got this along with my wd my passport # . # tb portable hard drive this little case is compact and keeps my wd passport well protected from the occasional bump and dents it also is compact adding very little extra weight to my drive and keeps the size to a minimum its not bullet proof and i would n't try <unk> it but for carrying it around in my back pack its perfect i wish it had a compartment to store the cord inside to so i can keep it with my drive at all times but other than that i like this case its a good combination of compact and durable
i do n't purchase a wd my passport without purchasing one of these cases as well if you want to ensure that your hd lasts and you do n't lose data , get one of these
nice <unk> tight fit i have no fear of dropping it and i can plug directly into the drive without removing it from the case -lrb- nice flap access -rrb- the flap could be little sturdier but it is n't like i 'm going to be dropping it water either i owned previous wd cases for the passports and i think this is by far the best
had this case to protect my hard drive while i was deployed and this case protected my hard drive despite all the moving around or when i dropped my hard drive i also like the fact that you can access the hard drive while its still in the case
i really like this case my # tb drive fits perfectly i was a little worried that the drive would get too warm inside , but it has n't been a problem at all ... have n't taken the drive out since i first put it in # weeks ago it seems very well made ... rugged plastic and looks cool too a small price to pay to protect an expensive hard drive
everyone should buy it , well people who import your information . the case is a very durable and lightweight , but the best thing is that you do not have to open it to connect
this case is cheap relative to the protection it offers as one who is clumsy , and travels by backpack daily , the rugged case keeps my # tb wd passport safe from spilled coffee , drops , <unk> <unk> and dust
i was a little confused when the cable did n't fit in the case but then found the hole that the cable goes through , so you keep the hard drive in the case all the time
my western digital external hard drive # tb fits perfectly the case is hard , strong , well made and easy to use there is a little hole on one end , with a rubber plug , to allow the usb cable to attach to the drive -lrb- through the side of the case -rrb- this allows the use of the drive while it is still in the case the inside is lined with a soft <unk> material to securely hold the hard drive in place the hard case snaps tightly closed for a sealed fit too , providing moisture protection this case far exceeded my expectations approx . # . # l x # . # `` w x # . # `` d - product of
