it fits perfect and looks great it does n't make the yoga bulky do n't expect it to protect your yoga from a major drop it will protect from normal wear and tear
this bag is cute , but omg this thing stinks i tried everything , i washed it several times , but still smells terribly bad i would n't recommend people to buy it , unless you are willing to live with this
the product arrived earlier than expected which is sadly the only good thing the backpack is cute and everything but the colors are nothing like the one in the picture & # #
used this bag for probably a semester and i still is pretty nice , although the straps i did have to super glue not ment for lots of things so now i use it for when i go places over night or a beach bag the strap that you tie to shut it is very cheap bags nice i give it #
this bag came in earlier than i expected i love the bows and you can fit a long in it it 's also pretty sturdy the color is a bit off from the picture -lrb- why i gave it # stars instead of # -rrb- it 's not black , it 's more of a <unk> black kind of fabric
my daughter wanted a small bag to use for summer <unk> field trips and when she goes to her friends i told her to look here on amazon , and for something that was `` prime `` eligible so a few days ago , she saw this and we ordered it when it came , while it did n't exactly look as she thought it would have , she was perfectly happy with it since so many people are talking about the differences between what they got and what it looks like , i decided to snap some pictures and show you what ours looks like seems pretty solid , and light lots of little pockets too
love the color , but the top half falls right off bottom fits fine , but not as snug as it should makes me so sad because i loved the color so much
i really liked the color of this case , but that did little to help the fact that it did n't fit i carefully read the model number before placing my order the bottom of the case fits snugly , but the top relies on # very small ridges to attach to the laptop the case is slightly too big -lrb- or <unk> the ridges are slightly too small -rrb- for it to clip on , so it just falls off also , for something that is described as & # # ; rubberized & # # ; , i was expecting a little more rubber sending it back
the case barely fits and it does not stay on at all i had it on for about two days when it started to fall off every time i move it
this simply does not fit the laptop it does n't click in and it smudges so easily i want to return it but i do n't know if they 'll accept it since i removed it out of the package
unfortunately the bottom part does not fit my laptop , the upper one does it looks pretty , but is completely useless and i really need protection for my mac asap i 'm not sure if i can return it or only have the correct bottom part sent
there 's a reason some things are cheap this case is junk cheap plastic with tabs that break , does n't cover the back edge of the computer , falls off if you 're going to put a case on an expensive macbook pro , it 's worth the few extra dollars to get one of the many -lrb- better -rrb- versions of the same thing of course it 's under $ # ... it 's crap
i have the new mbp # inch retina , exactly as described , matched the description perfectly but it did not fit the bottom part is too small , leaving about # inch or more exposed if you really have the newest version , this is not the case for you
top did not fit , it was loose and fell off every time i opened the laptop lid the bottom fit just fine sent back and will order another brand :
the top portion of the case comes off when you open up the macbook it was a sorry excuse for a macbook case , even when taking into account the low price point
i just opened this and put it on my mac pro retina and it does fit the bottom , however the top piece will not stay on at all i am disappointed as i planned to use this case for a trip that i am planning within about # days
i chose this rating because this case does not fit my laptop i matched up the number on the back of my laptop , and although this said it fits my model , it does n't it 's well-made from what i can tell , but it does n't latch on to my screen or the base , and slides off if it 's not used on a flat surface
ordered two of these for my daughters the hot blue one was to loose the bottom kept falling off obviously a manufacturer defect . i would not recommend this color . try the others as the pink one fits perfectly lastly the hot pink one is more see through -lrb- apple logo -rrb- than the hot blue one
purchased this item for the a # newest model retina display and the top does not fit the bottom of the case fit snuggly and the top did not stay on it just set on top of the mac -lrb- clips were not very big so did not clip into the top -rrb- and fell off every time it was opened believe the reviews that say it does not fit , b/c it does n't
the case did not fit my macbook the model number was correct ; however , the bottom portion of the case did not fit even with some pressure other reviews said the case fit fine , so i am unsure if they send me the wrong case or if there is another reason for the error
i usually purchase speck covers but after reading the reviews , well i took the plunge and landed into the shallow end of the pool the cover went on without a problem snaps on nicely but the fingerprints are horrible the fingerprints almost appear like an indentation i bought the mint color it looks horrible and the cover does wipe clean now i know why i always purchase speck products for my expensive macbook pro
this case did n't fit my macbook a # at all i had to hold the bottom piece on when picking my computer up or the case would fall off i did n't like the color it also had an edge on the front that dug in to my wrists as i typed i returned it and ordered the ipearl hard shell case
i have only had the case for about # months and the feet have already begun to fall off , which is very frustrating i have had other cases for a much longer time without any issues
when i purchased this i believed it would be see through but its not the color is completely solid so if that 's what you 're looking for then this is it but if you want one transparent keep looking
the bottom part of this unit does not snap into place i am not sure if it is a defective piece or not but the bottom part will not stay on the top half stays on just fine also , tabs by the wrist area are a bit of an annoyance color and feel are as described if it stayed on the macbook it would be a nice product
it fits my retina mbp fine however , it has a slightly raised edge that you feel while you type or use the trackpad i find this very annoying it also gets smudged easily when i pick up the closed laptop and looks quite unpleasant i have somewhat sweaty hands , but the extent of smudging should not be that bad
initially , i loved this case then my bottom rubbers started coming off one by one later the case cracked the color i got seems to attract lots of stains and finger prints . i do n't know what happened
loved the color , and it shipped fast , but the bottom portion did n't really fit my macbook pro with retina display very well -- it was too loose i had to return this product
was extremely excited to get it in the mail and absolutely loved color -lrb- that 's why i give it two stars -rrb- however , the bottom case does not fit as well as it could , it falls off every time i lift up my macbook and does not snap on extremely disappointed with it
this is not deep purple it 's fuchsia or magenta the bottom does n't snap on securely when i grab the bottom , say to move it from one side of the table to another , it detaches it 's a quick <unk> kind of thing , but it leaves me uneasy i do n't like the way the back of the bottom is uncovered either just looks odd i have a speck case that covers the entire mbp
nice rubberized case that fits my mac perfectly snaps on and gives you easy access to every single port love the bright color dislike that it seems cheaply made ... one of the rubber feet fell off while other one is about to become undone : -lrb- i have owned for less than a month and is already going back i will have to purchase another brand so sad because it fits my laptop so well
but the color is more like light lavender being a <unk> ' fan , i wanted their purple , which is closer to the pic in the ad although it is a sold color , the lit apple can be seen through it
i purchased this case for my macbook pro retina -lrb- # . # & # # ; -rrb- , and when i started clipping it to the computer , only the <unk> of the case snapped into place the lower half of the shell is too loose , and does n't fit correctly i am contacting customer service about it , and might return it
the item fits alright i have been using it for several weeks now and # of the rubber pads on the bottom of the case have already fallen off the bottom of the case also comes undone very easily
i wrote a # star review for this product once i received it , but now that i have been using it for a few weeks , i noticed that some of the edges are a bit sharp when i went to pick up my laptop today , the back bottom of the case -lrb- the side by the apple logo -rrb- <unk> into my thumb it was like an extremely bad <unk> i will have to sand the edges down by myself to make sure that does n't happen again if you are thinking of buying this for a child or older adult , i would advise a case that is softer and has more rounded edges
i was really impressed with this case when i first put it on really great colors and the apple logo really shines through once i got it on and started using it , i noticed that the color comes off pretty easily it 's almost as if your skin takes the finish off kind of hard to explain but , i thought it would be a little better quality then that also when you are typing , the little clips on the bottom seem to stick out past the laptop and catch your hand if you are typing not a big deal just annoying
it arrived on time and it is much cheaper than a speck case ; however it was not the color i anticipated i ordered the purple case and expected a bright vibrant purple like the picture , but when i got the case it was a very light purple instead
for it 's price , it 's okay it does the job however it is very difficult to take off your laptop also it made a few lines on my brand-new laptop after # weeks of using it : -lrb- almost as if someone took a needle and carved on my laptop on the edges its barely noticeable but still , id rather not have happened
the bottom part does not fit , it leaves like a mm . of space , but i love the color and how the top fits ... if only the bottom had fit well i do recommend it if can deal with how it does n't fit that well
so upset , i absolutely love the color of the case but the bottom part of the case does not snap on because its too big i ordered it because it said it was for the model of laptop that i have the top fits perfectly but the bottom did not fit it was probably a defect i dont know but the color i got is a really nice blue
the case fits the mac book pro pretty well , but the color is not accurate it looks more like a magenta although somewhat pretty , i definitely wanted the deep purple retina # inch rubberized hard case proves to me that if you want a specific color of something you are better off buying it in person
it 's not as hard as i thought it would be but then it 's not a griffin or otterbox it snaps on easily to the laptop but i always feel like it might come off just as easily
i bought the one in gold the color looks like the picture but more opaque you can not really see the apple logo with the case on the product is not neatly made it will protect your macbook from scratches , but probably wo n't protect it from shocks price is slightly higher than what i used to buy for my <unk> macbook will find something else next time
i opened this case and absolutely loved it the color is perfect and the perfect amount of sheer however , the bottom place does not snap on the top does wonderfully , i do n't know if mine is defected or something it stays on but i can take it off with great ease , i am very disappointed
i loved this macbook cover until the rubber feet started falling off one i was able to stick back on , but then it fell off again and was lost then another came loose and keeps falling off and i am sure it will disappear sometime soon now my laptop is out of balance and rocks while i use it , which is super annoying otherwise , all ports that i have needed are accessible , the case snaps on cleanly and looks nice and is unobtrusive i do find that the edge of the case that hits my wrists does irritate somewhat , so if the feet had not fallen off i would have given # stars , only <unk> for that reason also , fingerprints become visible over time , but i do n't mind that so much it does a good job protecting the surface of my laptop i do n't think it would do much to protect it from an impact , but it does a good job for scratches i have the light green and love the color
the case looks and feels nice , but the bottom part does n't attach as well as it should when i type sometimes my wrists touch the case and it sort of pops off , making a little clicking sound its annoying , but not enough to get rid of the case however , i could n't get rid of it if i wanted to because the top will not come off i suppose one could consider that a good thing , since you do n't want your case to fall off like i said , for the price - i 'm satisfied but i would n't order another one i 'd spend the extra cash to get something of higher quality
pros : fits i did n't know if the dimensions were identical for the a # and the new a # model but took a chance did n't come damaged like a lot the cheaper macbook covers cons : the bottom half does n't have any clips on the back side to hold the piece to the macbook on all # sides the bottom piece also creates a tiny lip that rubs your wrist when you type all in all , its just pretty & # # ; meh . & # # ; i was n't thrilled with it , but i was n't disappointed
i loved the color and thought it would be perfect for protecting my brand new macbook pro the instructions were easy to follow in order to put it on correctly , but i believe mine is defective some how the top part does not stay on no matter which way i put it on it always falls off and has been marks in my brand new macbook however , the bottom stays on wonderfully and has not fallen off once i definitely will not purchase again from this company because not only does the top not stay on but it also scratched very easily when i first put it on and looks terrible now
ca n't really complain considering you get what you pay for obviously , the more expensive cases are definitely better - there 's no doubt about it but this case still does what it 's supposed to do : protects from scratches , adds personal style , etc . it does make the apple logo a little cloudy but who cares
love the color , which is the main reason i bought the cover it stays in place for the most part , it has come partly undone on top if i hit the wrong way for some reason mine has gotten lots of finger prints , and things that dont seem to want to wipe away
i ordered this for the purpose of protecting my brand new macbook pro # . # & # # ; retina i was n't looking for something that would protect falls , just protect the exterior of the computer without adding undue bulk it attaches easily , without needed force , a little more delicate of a process to remove it has a nice tactile feels , sleek but not slick , it feels secure in my hand the fit is good a minor complaint is that the tabs that secure the bottom section in where your wrists sit while typing can poke a little , but thus far has not proved overly bothersome i have plans to get wrist pads for longer sessions anyway , as the edges of the mac itself can get uncomfortable after a while anyway
long story short this case snapped right on , fits perfect , nice finish , and adds no bulk for the price you ca n't beat it but then again you get what you pay for
this is just what i wanted . its kind of like a <unk> finish which is so sleek and clean . does n't need constant cleaning . perfect for my retina . only time will tell its
this is my first review of anything here on amazon and i must say it 's a great case recently switched from windows to mac and immediately purchased a case i always read reviews of items before i buy and this was no exception so many people talking about how great a case this is and not one is lying also figured i 'd be getting a keyboard cover in addition to the case like so many others that purchased from amazon i did not receive a keyboard cover which i 'm a little upset about because that was half of the reason i decided to go with this one
just received my new pink laptop case fits my retina mac pro well true to color as the picture shows still getting used to plastic keyboard cover i type about # wpm and it 's <unk> my roll down to # wpm . . trying to figure out if this is because it does n't fit well or user error the bottom layer of the cover is giving my wrists a little bit of a <unk> ... the lip of it sticks minimally higher than the keyboard , just enough to irritate my skin not terrible though and this would probably be the case with any cover i read this in another review before i purchased the product and did n't think anything of it , but now i see exactly what they mean
this is a hard , plastic case with a matted look and a rubber , non-slip feel attaching and removing it is not too difficult it offers adequate protection , looks nice and is reasonably priced one drawback is that it does add a little weight to the laptop when your laptop is so light , anything you add to it would be noticeable , and when you add this case to it , you will notice the difference if you do n't mind the added weight and like the peace of mind of having the extra protection , go for it
i like the color of the case a lot , and the bottom half of it fits well however , the top part of the case is a little bit hollow on the front , but that 's not a major issue the case came in shrink wrap and has no cosmetic damage whatsoever all in all , its a good product for how much you pay
i love the color of it , the fit is n't bad and i feel like the <unk> of my mac are covered enough the case is fairly thin , so do n't expect anything to protect it from drops , but it works well enough and it was a great price for the aesthetic color
i liked the case for the most part the texture of it was nice however the top part did not fit and i had to send it back makes me kind of nervous about purchasing another case due to the fact that it may not fit but over all a great case
i really like this case because it fits my computer so well i was expecting that i can see the apple logo when i put it on , but the color of this case is so solid and i can only see the logo when the light around is not that bright anyway , i still love this case because i love this color so much it pretty nice if you do n't care if you can see the logo or not
i like this cover much better than the original plastic one i had it cracked after less than three weeks this one however , is made with a more durable rubber that will last
it fits and has a clean sleek look but the product came with a scratch on it which is disappointing , there should 've been better quality control it also makes my macbook pro a lot heavier
product fits my computer right now , however , i see in my near future the poor quality to affect how it fits on my computer . pay extra for a better quality , longer lasting product
i bought this mainly to protect my laptop but also because the color is so cute the case does its job my laptop has fallen from the couch to a floor a couple of times and it 's still in perfect condition only thing is that the bottom piece does n't securely snap on in the front and allows dust to collect in it
was looking for something like most others described - protect from scratches , etc . without bulking up too much and i 'm not about to pay $ # for the big name that reviews say cracked i 've only had the case for a few days , but so far no cracks and i do n't think it will as another reviewer said , the edge on the bottom does rub my wrists a bit , but nothing too terrible and depending on how i pick it up or have it propped , the bottom tries to pop off a little like the rubberized finish and pink color i think its just slightly brighter than the pic appears , or at least on my computer but i still like it
honestly i was skeptical about this product but it is really pretty i love the way the red looks and how the apple lights up to shine its brilliance in the room
love the speck brand of cases , but they are a little too pricey for a <unk> student this is a fabulous alternative for a fraction of the price it looks great , protects great and saved a lot of money
i actually first purchased this case in the aqua blue color , but it was a bit brighter than i thought and not really what i wanted for use at the office i contacted the seller about returning the item and since i was n't satisfied , he sent me this blue case instead which is a bit darker and exactly what i wanted i was so impressed with how kind he was it also came to me in the mail very quickly as for the case itself , i love it great fit and the texture is nice too =-rrb- i definitely recommend it
the product is exactly what i was hoping for and it was shipped promptly and have never received an online order so quickly i gave it to my brother as a gift and he loves it so much the cover and the keyboard cover fit perfectly and seem to be durable products i highly recommend this product the pricing is also a plus in comparison to the price of sale of about $ # at an apple retail store
i love this case and it arrived just in time for my big trip i am a web <unk> and just got a brand spanking new rmbp i 'm very excited to take it out but was cautious because i do n't want a scratch on my brand new investment low and behold i found these guys who had amazing prices and the case was shipped out asap and in my hands just in time quality case , great prices , give them your biz ! & # #
i got the new macbook pro with retina display for as a christmas gift and of course i really wanted to take care of my baby but i 'm a poor college student so i did n't want to pay the $ # + price that apple offered for there covers so i took to amazon in search for the perfect one sadly the first few places that i tried to purchase from on here sent me cases that did n't fit the new model so i was a little <unk> about this product here but it shipped faster than planned plus came with a matching keyboard cover best of all , it was a perfect fit ! and the color is beautiful defiantly a happy person
this case is perfect . especially the beautiful colour , and it is rubberized matte feeling very soft at an amazing price ! my brother bought the other brand expensive case , but quality is same as mosiso i like mosiso case and suggest others must buy it , if you wan na protect your macbook
this hard cover case worked perfectly with my laptop and has provided quite a bit of extra protection around my kids i often get comments on it - people asking where to get it personally , i love it
i was using my laptop at the apple store with this affordable cover -lrb- sitting right next to apple 's display of covers twice as expensive -rrb- and i got two compliments on mine very good purchase
i like case very well , it is very unique design fashionable , protecting my macbook very well from water and dust , <unk> i can see apple logo through the case very clearly . so nice gift for myself
this is a hard case that snapped onto my macbook pro w / retina display perfectly , took me like # minute or less to put it on i got the purple color and it looks better than i thought it would it will protect the outside of the computer from scratches , while adding a touch of personalization -lrb- my favorite color ! -rrb- i think it 's definitely worth the price i like that the bottom is also ventilated to help <unk> the heat the <unk> at the apple store told me that some of these cases will trap heat in , so i 'm glad this one is n't like that
the quality is great with the reasonable price i was not expecting the color to be exact the same as i saw online but when i got the case , the color looks exactly the same as it appears online now i 'm thinking to buy a blue one as backup btw , mine is mbp a #
this computer case is great it fits the macbook pro # inch with retina display computer perfectly it snaps on easily and protects the computer completely i am very satisfied with my purchase and would recommend this case to others
case fits like a glove on my new macbook pro with retina display it 's a hard shell with soft rubberized finish on the outside this allows it to keep still on slick surfaces it is not a rubber case though , it is a hard case as described
this is one of the amazing experience i had at amazon i had ordered a hard case cover , and i also received a free keyboard cover in addition , i love the color ! ! it is the amazing experience
this is an excellent case to protect your macbook pro # & # # ; retina laptop it took me about # seconds to secure it to the laptop with no issues at all great look and feel and protection to boot you cant go wrong
the case fits the macbook perfectly it does n't interfere with the laptop closing all the way at all the edge of the case on the bottom where you rest your wrists is also comfortable some reviewers for other cases said their case dug into their wrists as they typed , but this one does n't have that issue it 's also a beautiful color and looks very similar to the picture
i have the mbp retina display model that just came out this past october # , and this laptop case fits perfectly the texture is more matte than glossy , which was exactly what i was looking for the color of the case looks like the one shown in the picture the only parts that i do n't like very much are the four circular grips at the bottom of the case they are made out of a cheap white foam material , but other than that , i love the case that i just received
feels great and best of all looks absolutely <unk> ! ! ! ! ! love how others could see the glowing apple through the case when my mac is turned on color is exactly what i was looking for a true bright yellow i get compliments everywhere i go ! ! !
product is as expected do n't spend your money on case covers that cost you $ # + i do n't see any difference between this cover and the speck cover i bought for more than $ # + for my daughter 's macbook pro
its a good product , for a great price i 'm happy with my purchase the color is accurate the texture is nice it is easy to put on and it makes my macbook pro -lrb- rd -rrb- look even nicer
just received this week and it is quality for an inexpensive laptop case searched all over and reviewed different cases , this fits my new macbook perfectly i purchased the & # # ; hot blue & # # ; which looks like tiffany blue , its a great color it is an inexpensive way to protect and keep that expensive macbook in good shape
i ordered one of these and was <unk> i loved how it looked and i hated how it fit one of the rubber `` feet `` immediately came off , and the bottom did n't click in properly i was close to deciding it was a <unk> product and to just live with it , and then decided i should return the thing so worth it now <unk> the way it looks , and it works great so , if you get a defective one , it 's not the product , it 's just defective great price and works great too
for the price , this is a great case it fits like a glove and the rubberized feel makes me feel a lot safer about carrying this thing around very happy with the purchase
case fits like a glove on my new macbook pro with retina display it 's a hard shell with soft rubberized finish on the outside this allows it to keep still on slick surfaces it is not a rubber case though , it is a hard case as described the color is also fantastic
pretty good case as far as looks go but as far as protection i would not consider this a durable case i have my macbook in a hard shell case with this over it and it works well but i would not recommend using this case without a shell on you
i love it , but it 's very hard to get the clasps to meet when you close it not a terrible problem , just leave it open it just irks me a bit
bought this sleeve as i wanted a cool but low key way to transport my ms surface pro whose dimensions are pretty close to a macbook air # item is constructed of a nice weight and thick felt with smooth finishing and leatherette bottom grip and side expansion the magnetic clasp is sometimes a little hard to find via touch only the sleeve leaves about # inch on each side of the surface and close to a full inch towards the top that leaves room for the stylus but not much else but alas it 's not a form fitting fit for the surface but it also was n't made for that to be fair overall , i 'm happy with the quality of the item
shipping took <unk> the material is a very thick felt , but it is n't super heavy duty i wish the metallic button was a little more ... magnetic it slips from the clasp a bit easy still , for the price it definitely does the job
i really love this macbook air case it is incredibly attractive and i have received several complements on it has a very professional look without the traditional dull look of a simple slip cover the felt is nice to the touch as well as the leather i will say that this is n't the kind of case in my opinion that can really be treated very rough its durability has n't been tested yet by myself but i do have a feeling that it could become rather worn looking fast if treated as such for this price and my <unk> with it thus far i would definitely buy it again even if it does show wear after several months ! i say buy ! & # #
i bought it for my # & # # ; mba and does n't really have a problem closing -lrb- like what people said -rrb- yes , i bought it despite people having mentioned that and my friends love it too seller is rather nice too -lrb- : thumbs up
the case is exactly as pictured and indeed sports genuine leather and felt - i think it looks even better in person i ordered it for my hp chromebook # and it fits perfectly
this case looks great and for the price , it is worth purchasing i use it to carry the microsoft rt surface tablet because it is intended for the mac book air of # inches , there is about an inch of extra space but i put this case in my book bag and so the extra space does n't really bother me sometimes i place a really thin notebook or some <unk> from school in the case it is minimalistic so you get what you pay for , one large compartment but so far i enjoy using it i think i will provide more of an extensive review on its wear and tear in a couple of months but i do n't treat it roughly so i do n't know if the leather at the bottom scratches easily as such
i always get <unk> on this case its chic and looks like a clutch when its really a laptop bag best purchase thus far . the felt material is thick and i use it all the time with no issues
i love this felt case it 's super classy and macbook air # & # # ; fits perfectly it did take about two weeks to arrive , so be forewarned if you need a case to arrive <unk> two days but , if not in a rush , it 's definitely worth the wait
