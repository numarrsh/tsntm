this case was purchased for my granddaughter and she was <unk> with delight her favorite color is pink which is exactly what this case is , perfect for girls quality of the case is very good and appears that it will outlast the user i think it will serve it 's purpose and obviously protect the dvd player i would n't hesitate to recommend this item it is also available in black for those who hate pink
nice and firm bag it meets standard to be an everyday backpack to school , and travel backpack too but , this has warning that it used material which maybe possible of cancer , so minus two stars
solid upper <unk> bottom laptop <unk> exterior <unk> back <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> interior <unk> placement of gear <unk> <unk> bag is of decent quality , but nowhere near the discontinued leather samsonite backpack i was trying to replace the inside is <unk> with thin , rough material -lrb- it looks silky in the picture , which it is not -rrb- the straps are of just average quality the interior compartments are only separate by a thin layer of material rather than padding my guess is that if you are a fan of samsonite products you will be surprised by the lack of quality in this particular product that said , for the price , it is likely a good value i 'd go see it in a store before purchase
bag on shown in the advertisement looked larger that the real thing when it arrived i was disappointed with it 's size it was too small my teenagers did not want it either ended by giving it to a friend 's grandson as a gift it is a nice strong bag , but way too small may i shall look for a larger size of the same brand did not contact the seller
got this for my wife and she loves it she has a # `` laptop and it fits nicely and also knowing how careless she is , just the bottom padding itself is worth the money the handle is stiff unlike other bags and good to hold the material looks built to last overall a good product at a great price
its design for laptop is an huge attraction for student it protects your laptop from usual collision , like you place it carelessly on the ground but it can not contain too many books and its maximum size for laptop is # inch it can not contain your # inch macbook pro though few people would like to choose this size overall , very good backpack
i am very satisfied with this bag it has all what i need for my <unk> business trips only problem is that it does not stand up by itself , will fall over good quality , nice looking
this is a heavy duty bag looks nice and is very versatile i particularly like the very sturdy hand on top of the bag its more of a piece of luggage than a flimsy backpack
this is an outstanding backpack with plenty of room for travel and the tsa checkpoint works perfectly the tsa checkpoint is smartly designed as it folds open from the bottom this allows you after <unk> tsa to grab the top handle and walk away - you can zip later the downside of the bag and the deal breaker for me are the shoulder straps they are poorly padded with a laptop and some other minor items in the bag , it just was not a comfortable fit had the straps included more padding , this would be a # star bag but due to the lightly padded strap , i give this a # star
i got this bag around july and it started to fall apart within # months now the stitches inside the bag have come out completely i expected more quality from caselogic it 's either a fake or low quality product fyi , i only carried macbook air # `` laptop and it couldnt even withstand the weight of it i recommend not to buy this
i purchase equipment for my company 's sales force i bought # of these bags for our road warriors love the design of the bag . works really well for airport security . unfortunately , zipper quality is sub par . all # bags have had multiple zippers fail on the main compartments . stay away from this one
i love the idea of this bag but on the first day it was already falling apart the zipper on the computer section was not working properly it did n't move smoothly and if moved quickly it would zip with gaps on the plus side it did have room for my large dell studio # it just did n't leave room in the other pockets for much i have since returned the product and asked for a refund i would n't suggest it to anyone who is planning on doing any real traveling it would n't last a week
i 'm a frequent business traveler -lrb- # days on <unk> -rrb- and decided i wanted to switch from my tom bihn `` <unk> <unk> `` briefcase to a business backpack the bihn briefcase has been virtually bombproof for # years of heavy use i did send it in for zipper repair two years ago -lrb- which they did for free and shipped back -rrb- , but other than that i have been very satisfied and it still looks great i wanted to switch to a backpack design primarily for better ergonomics -lrb- was getting tired of schlepping the bag on one shoulder or another -rrb- and the ability to use the checkout friendly feature i found this case logic backpack well featured <unk> , and reasonably nice looking for a backpack the checkout friendly feature has worked well -lrb- i love not having to take my laptop out of the bag -rrb- and i 've definitely enjoyed faster <unk> through airport security however , my big complaint is that i 've only had this backpack for # . # months -lrb- about # trips -rrb- and already i 've seen some fraying of the nylon above the front pocket i think this is from shoving the bag underneath the airplane seat but it should absolutely not wear this fast in summary , good : looks , pockets for organizing , checkout friendly feature bad : poor durability and workmanship , shoulder straps could have better padding
i love this briefcase very light weight and easy to use i am student and this allows for me to keep notebooks and a computer in a small compact area i am rough on computer bags , but this was able to get me through the last few years of college
this backpack works great for getting through the tsa checkpoints finally i do n't have to take up # extra bins just for the laptop and bag it holds a lot , and seems durable however , a big gripe i have with it is there are no , that is , zero interior zippers all interior pockets are open it seems like all the other packs and bags i 've used in the past had at least # or # interior zippers the designers apparently thought the bag would always be full , and always be vertical i travel with any number of little items -lrb- like usb keys -rrb- that should be in enclosed spaces , and this bag has no enclosed pockets
initially i thought this was a great bag after one week of use on the road , i found two problems with this bag : the zippers get stuck around the corners and the shoulder strap <unk> a compartment this last one is difficult to explain but it makes impossible to open one the of inner compartments in one <unk> this is all unfortunate as all the compartments and the padding in the laptop section makes this a nice bag for my thinkpad t #
the case is very well made and a very convenient size i used it for my lenovo t # s , which has a # & # # ; screen the negative is the security friendly feature -- the shoulder straps have one d-ring on each side of the center opening this might make the case open nicely for airport security but for normal use its a pain the straps are constantly in the way when you try to open and remove the laptop the second drawback is that the inside lining came apart on the top of the section with the laptop inside and finally the zipper came apart on the side because when the bag is loaded down with all my accessories it put too much pressure on the zipper and it came apart just above the bottom so would i buy it again no not this style but most likely another case logic
i 've used the bag for about # weeks now and i like the bag my only complaint is that wearing for an extended period of time can be a bit uncomfortable as the shoulder straps are n't as beefy as they could be
its a really good bag i bought it for my brother for his new thinkpad e # it perfectly fits and i like the features like , when it is unzipped in the middle it can lay flat on the security checking it is very well worth the price , compared to other bags listed in amazon for the
before i bought this backpack i was looking for other brand names i compared the prices and the functions , then decided to choose this # -inch backpack it fits perfectly for my height -lrb- # -rrb- after the first time using for a business trip i like this backpack even more it 's very easy to organize and access my laptop & documents there are many pockets inside for my cell phone , notebook , gps , pens , etc . in addition , there is more room for my clothing it is great for a weekend trip
this is a nice compact bag designed for smaller laptops i have a # . # inch display sony vaio and it fits perfect decent quality and expected good durability definately a bonus that it is airline friendly has good amount of additional storage without it being too bulky it could use a bit more or more firm padding in my opinion , but is certainly better protection than a sleeve would be
i bought this bag because it was supposed to make the trip through airport security easier the bag opens like a clam shell to reveal you laptop closed it stores your laptop securely however , i find that tsa agents still require i separate my ipad & laptop from the bag nonetheless , it is a well thought out bag , with everything you need to store you electronics on proviso , be sure your # & # # ; laptop will fit inside not all do it has a a velcro strap that makes <unk> with your roller bag easy
the case logic <unk> # is just the right size for my # -inch laptop and has plenty of room to pack meeting materials it also makes traveling through <unk> check points at airports a lot less of a hassle good value for the price
the bag is great for what i use it for which is mostly light use between the <unk> and on a short weekend the only downfall when i got the bag is one of the zippers would n't zip open a certain way it would always zip incorrectly , so you would have to you use the other zipper to shut the bag
this is a really nice case that fits my # `` laptop perfectly it is very well-designed with just the right compartments setting it up with the computer in the security friendly pocket works very well and it makes getting through security a breeze it may be my favorite laptop case , and i 've got a lot of them
the backpack is very spacious and surprisingly fits everything that i was hoping it would the laptop compartment is also very great as it is able <unk> - hold my # `` laptop or a textbook and binder the construction seems solid and its very clean and professional looking great backpack for lugging around everything around campus
this laptop case fits my lenovo t # very well , and i believe it would still fit if i had the # -cell battery the bag itself and the zippers are very durable , and the pockets and built-in organizers make sense
i was looking a case for my # inch laptop , not too bulky and with compartments this is a very good product for my needs : light , simple , discrete and with room enough for few notebooks and laptop accessories
this case is better than i expected for the $ $ spent it is very well made , and appears to be of high quality it arrived on time , and was well packaged i am surprised at the amount of stuff it will hold now i can keep all of my note book related accessories in one place , and take them with me where ever i need to go would recommend this product if you need a good case for your laptop/netbook
laptop bag far exceed my expectations , only wish i had discovered it years earlier have traveled weekly for the past # years via airplane and this bag makes it so easy going through security the bag has plenty of storage <unk> for just about anything that you will need i would definitely recommend this as one of frequent <unk> buddies did for me
i love this case ; i do n't know whether tsa will love it it 's kind of a plain black case , but it holds all the various bits one needs with one 's laptop i just wish it had a bit more room -- enough for my portfolio of papers
it is light and protection padding is good enough to protect my toshiba # . # `` labtop i love it and carrying my notebook in this bag all the times for travel purpose
it 's not just for netbooks ; it 's a nice size that allowed me to take my old ibm tablet along with its power supply , etc . happily , it 's got an accessories compartment that expands outward , rather than those silly zipped ones that bulge inwards since it 's for small stuff , the shoulder and hand straps should last quite a while unless you decide to carry lead <unk> in it , it should be durable enough for its intended purposes it 's also good that it has three `` main `` compartments -lrb- although the middle one is for <unk> the case at the airport -rrb- you could take a couple of laptops , documents , and/or your ipad or <unk> reader all in all , a good man-purse for any geek
<unk> generally makes good to very good camera bags and other accessories the <unk> cable management # is not one of their better products the term management is misused here , all the various accessories go into a zippered pouch the small amount of management comes in the form of elastic cord in the end , its just a pricey zippered pouch with a transparent insert there are better accessory bags available here on amazon do some research and come to your own <unk>
here you truly are paying for the think tank name it 's nice that you can see inside the pouch , but except for the bungee cords , ther is no organization factor the bag is also very small smaller than i thought it would be
i bought this bag to store cables , adapters and various other small usb devices i put in my rolling laptop case and the handle is nice to quickly pull out the bag when needed the window in the front is nice so you can see whats in the bag construction is good and included cable ties are nice the price is a little high for a bag , but overall it 's a pretty good value as this is a well constructed and sized bag
for years i 've <unk> trying to keep cables and small computer accessories under control as i travel this little bag is the simple , effective solution you can see what 's in it without having to open it , and with the cable ties , everything stays neat and <unk> no more having to spend time <unk> the <unk> <unk> also , no more pulling on one cable and getting a whole handful of them it 's a pretty simple design , but it works like a charm you wo n't be sorry you purchased this item
to state that this case is for the samsung dvd writer is like stating that my kitchen <unk> is designed to hold my <unk> i would never have ordered this for this product if is was even close in size it would not have been & # # ; treating the truth carelessly . & # #
this is a nice case , well built , but obviously not designed specifically for the samsung dvd burner it is almost double the size of the burner , allowing for too much movement it looks like they made these cases and try to sell them for whatever will fit inside
this case fits the samsung portable dvd + / - usb external drive but it is longer than it needs to be it still works well but unless the design was to include a very long usb cord with the drive there is room to spare it works as intended just not as compact as i had
the title of this device says it 's specifically for a dvd writer , but this case is far too large and is obviously not designed for it it is much to floppy inside and i imagine this is a generic case for generic electronics , but the title is to get more people to purchase it the pouch itself is quite cushioning , but i ca n't give it # stars , especially since the product name is misleading
the case has a nice feel and a convenient compartment for cables the downside is , it 's two inches longer than needed for the samsung portable dvd drive not a <unk> flaw and considering the low cost , not enough to make me return it , but disappointing in that it was presented as a mate to the samsung drive
fits fine unless there is a case about the ipad well made , and well designed i would prefer a larger case allowing extra space for a case , but most ipad owners i know do not prefer cases
the case is a little bit large for the dvd writer , but it should keep it from getting scratched it seems nice and there is room for its usb cord
i scoured amazon for days looking for a case for my samsung external slim blu-ray burner i carry it in my backpack -lrb- which functions as a mobile editing suite -rrb- so to avoid it getting all scratched up and nasty looking i really wanted a case for it this is the only one they recommend on this site so i figured , screw it , i 'll give it a shot , it 's cheap and it works it leaves about # inches of space in the bag , which means it 's not really made for this thing , but it 's fine the pocket is roomy enough for me to stuff a usb cable for the drive , as well as keep a <unk> for test burns with it at all times and it 's soft and suede-like i 'd recommend it even though it does n't fit perfectly it completely accomplishes the goal i had for it
it was part of a package deal for samsung usb # . # ultra portable external dvd writer model <unk> # cb / <unk> i put my hard drive in it when it 's not in use
everyone who commented that this rectangular case has extra space for a square external optical drive is correct it works , the quality is good , and i could n't find any better alternative for the price and if i end up not using this case for my external optical drive , then i can use it for my kindle
i little big for the dvd player but works good . has a <unk> zip pocket on the outside for cord and other accessories most of the other ones i looked at were not big enough for it
after looking for while i got a good price for this one -lrb- most others were in the $ # - $ # range -rrb- it 's got plenty of room for the dvd writer and i can put the cables in the zippered pocket once you put your portable writer in this case it 's safe from scratches and dings due to the padding
this was exactly what i was looking for it has room to store my samsung usb # . # ultra portable external dvd writer and <unk> external usb # . # mb # x floppy disk drive in zippered compartments that prevent anything from getting misplaced i use for my it consulting business the craftsmanship is excellent and i recommend it to anyone who needs a quality case that can be used to store any number of small to medium sized flat electronic or photographic gadgets
i do n't know for which device it was designed but my mini bluetooth hid wireless keyboard for motorola xoom fits into it perfectly it 's light , enough durable -lrb- as suede imitation may be -rrb- , lined with water-resistant plastic , opens wide - easy take out and put in fast shipping , product exactly as described , price is just <unk> very pleased and happy with this purchase
the samsung external slim dvd writer fits nicely in here with lots of room it has good protection with a sturdy zipper the outside pocket is a nice size as well for extra cables , etc . i 'm glad i bought it
this is a well padded sleeve that opens # around so you can insert dvd writer or an e reader -lrb- # & # # ; size -rrb- i have used this for both i like the outer pocket for the cords / earphones i store also the faux suede look is very nice touch compared to the nylon ones out there
i love the material , the shape and even i can use it to storage my tablet great purchase the material is really strong and the little <unk> in the outside is perfect to put things in
slim and compact attached to my surface pro ii worked like a charm right out of the box too bad computer manufacturers make a person additional hardware instead of building it into the computer
i 'm very happy with this purchase some people have complained about the extra length but i find that length to nicely accommodate the cable in a way that allows the pouch to remain flat -lrb- unlike the freebie case that came with the drive -rrb- nice strong construction
case fits my samsung <unk> writer / player very well enough free space for the player and cable the case is well padded and external materials are of nice quality
made of good material keeps dust out , use it for storage of my asus dvd drive when not in use but i though it was the size for my <unk>
the casecrown case is nicely made the soft-sided padding is sufficient to protect the contents from run of the mill minor bumps and jostling the listing here , as if it were specially sized for an asus external optical drive is a bit misleading -lrb- or just creative marketing -rrb- the case as delivered is labeled `` <unk> reader case `` on the attached manufacturer 's tag , and is essentially a generic product for <unk> electronics in fact , if you track down the product number on the casecrown website , you 'll find this listed as a kindle case the case is relatively snug around the optical drive , though there are about # inches of empty space at the top if you put the usb cord there , instead of in the outside zipper pocket , things fit pretty well
i bought this for my asus external slim <unk> and the dvd drive , along with the cords , fits perfectly in this case also , quality of case seems to be excellent
for those of you on the go , this case is ideal for holding an optical drive as well as a small hard drive such as a western digital <unk> the optical drive and all the usb cords for both devices fit into the main pouch and the hard drive fits into the zippered external pouch the pouch is padded enough to protect both devices i have a netbook computer that has it 's own case and this case allows me to travel with just two small cases perfect for <unk> baggage
i bought this along with the asus # pe <unk> as added protection the case is well made and looks like it is well designed i have over # years experience putting things together and this looked like a snap there were no instructions , really , just a small note saying to make sure the bottom back tabs are in first it looks pretty self-explanatory i did get the back bottom on , but when i did , the front could not be pulled all the way up i tried a number of times and finally gave up and am returning it to amazon it looks like a great design and a great price but just does not fit as easily as it should too bad because i want some protection for the netbook
having read the other reviews carefully before purchasing , i was surprised that this item was as fragile as it has proved to be i 've owned it for a month , and removed it this week to access my ram ; the base would n't snap back on after removal it 's a shame , because i 've come to really like the stand aspect of this item , but it 's not substantial enough to be worth purchasing
i tried to place the cover on my asus eee # ha as indicated in the instructions on the sticker and the cover did not fit apparently the back corners are too narrow and do n't allow the bottom cover to stay in place
i purchased this item for my # pe it arrived promptly and the package was labeled for # ha no matter how hard i tried i could not get the bottom to snap on the top fit perfectly i did not return the item because it was not worth the hassle when i <unk> the company in my review they emailed me with two tips : take the battery out before installing and push gently on the bottom cover while installing this did not work i informed them of this result and have heard nothing back from the company i have been using computer accessories since home computers became available this cover does not work
this was a pricey item and i convinced myself to like it until everyone and their dad said that it looked really cheap once i took it off , they thought the netbook itself was beautiful and could do without it the case snaps on weirdly to the asus and the feet really do n't do a good job of holding up the netbook it started to wobble after a while and then one of the feet snapped off completely the bottom cover was also weirdly and cheaply shaped this model is supposed to look sleek and thin but the case made it look chunky it does its job of protecting the netbook from scratches but at the expense of your netbook looking extremely cheap , wobbling , and getting bulkier a bag or sleeve is a much better investment
it truly protects my laptop , but it does n't fit right in fact when i put in on it created a crack in the computer where it latched on so if i were to take it off , my computer has a crack in it it did however take all the scratches and abuse from being dropped etc , so it works fine in that way
the case is made of good plastic when i open my netbook to use it the top cover is a little bit heavy , it make my netbook tilted to the back the front of my bottom netbook is lifted almost # `` i have to hold it down with my left hand & type with my right hand that is the problem the one i have on my mac book pro does not have this problem because the mac is bigger in size & the bottom part is heavier
the cover is for my new asus netbook # pe mu # and it fits perfectly i felt the previous reviews i read gave me the necessary information to know what i was getting and how to properly attach it to my netbook my friends at work were impressed and i would certainly reccomend the same to others thank you for a nice product
i was a little concerned about other peoples reviews regarding fitment , but decided then to try it myself i followed the instructions and the case fits perfectly there are # little plastic tabs in the rear -lrb- bottom of case -rrb- which go into the opening between the screen hinges and the bottom of the notebook # little plastic tabs are in the front and are suppose to be on top of the palm rest this is a bit tricky as they first snap into the little gap between the bottom case of the notebook and the <unk> so you have to pry them out -lrb- carefully -rrb- and move them on top the top lid has a frosty shaped frame , it is not all clear plastic the pictures on the listing do not show this at all
i bought the clear cover for my # pe , so that i could have a design showing through back it worked like a charm , snapping in perfectly i 'm not going to lie to y ' all the plastic is cheap and is not going to last very long the feet wiggle a little bit and in time they are prolly going to break but it serves its purpose and for the time being i do n't have to worry about scratches on my new little machine
i had the screen crack on my eee and felt i needed some reinforcement to prevent it from happening again honestly i 'm not sure if the eee is susceptible to cracked screens , but i 'm not taking the chance and bought this protector the fit is first rate it tightly hugs the eee and does n't look bad the only gripe is what another user mentioned : with the protector on , the eee wants to rock backward it 's annoying , but better than a broken eee
this fit my asus eee # ha without any problems one of the front snaps popped off the edge of the netbook a couple of times , until i noticed that i had n't gotten a bottom foot hole quite lined up and snug around one foot you have to line the whole thing up carefully in the back before pulling forward and up to snap the front snaps into place the fold out plastic <unk> do not seem sturdy , so i 've tried not to use them however , the shell makes my netbook a bit <unk> , so that without the feet , it tries to tip over backwards and roll off its cooling pad i put a strip of <unk> under the back feet , since i do n't trust those plastic <unk> to hold up to much use at some point , i 'm going to paint the inside of this shell i 've done this before , for people with apples who have seen my <unk> <unk> at shows this shell is a fine value for the reasonable price
i like this plastic cover . . the feet on it come in very handy to angle my netbook when on a hard surface the only issue is that it was hard to get on and the little tabs on the bottom kept going right into the seam of my netbook instead of over it i had to try # or # times to get it right one tab has since come unhooked and i cant be bothered trying to get the stupid thing off to fix it all in in for the money , its worth it keeps scratches away and fingerprints to a minimum too
i purchased this cover about a two months ago and i must say that this product is exactly what i needed for my netbook easy to put on , great construction and a perfect fit also a price that is very affordable to protect your investment
it looks cute and i somehow got the top piece on but the bottom half is just the wrong shape there 's no way to make it fit on my stock eee pc # ha
if you 're buying this for an asus eee pc -lrb- mine 's # series , as listed in the product <unk> -rrb- , do n't get your hopes up the top half is a tiny bit too narrow , but that tiny bit makes it impossible to snap on both sides -lrb- almost broke it trying -rrb- , and the bottom half is just # % <unk> it does n't come close to fitting oh , well looked too good to be true , for the price
i was hoping this would fit the netbook , but the bottom is useless however , the top fits nicely so i give it # stars for that if the bottom fit it would be # stars because it has little feet that you can use elevate the back when it is on a table overall , the product does not meet expectations
i got this at the same time as my # ha netbook the netbook is super <unk> and seems like it would scratch really easily so i was looking for something that i could use to protect it while i was using it the case itself is kind of fragile when it is n't on the netbook but , once it is on , it is perfect i was a bit nervous at first because i have the version of this netbook with the largest battery but the case is open over the battery so it fits perfectly there is almost no bulk added to the device and it still fits perfectly into the little neoprene sleeve that came with it , so there is no need to worry about a different carrying case if you get this i also think it actually makes it a little easier to open the screen because of the small gap between the two covers when the netbook is closed the colors are kind of fun and the price really ca n't be beat i am going to look into what this company has for ipod , too
my dog <unk> up one of the top corners on my eee pc . i called asus and they dont sell covers so i found this on amazon and it covers it perfectly ! easy to put on
i bought the mcover purple hard shell sleeve carring case for asus eee pc # series netbook - <unk> with # ha / # pe / # p the top fits perfect , but the bottom would not latch on tightly every time you picked it up the bottom would fall off i had several people try to put it on , it just would n't latch on i still use he top for it though although , i would not recommend this or buy another one
i have an asus blue # . # `` eee pc # <unk> # x and the bottoms of these covers do not fit this netbook the tops fit fine , but the bottom covers do not snap on and they do n't look like they are made for this netbook the plastic looks like it will break easily and the bottom flippers are loose , so even if the bottom attached the loose flippers would not work i contacted the seller ipearl-inc and was told i did n't follow their simple directions for attaching the bottom i always read directions first and the bottom does not attach to my netbook period the response from the seller was assuming and <unk>
it 's more like a stand it can be propped up with the bottom does not stay attached you most definitly can not use it as a carrying case now , maybe mine was defective but i just couldnt see where it was possible that the bottom snapped on as the top does someone please correct me on this if i 'm wrong , i 'll return it if that 's the case
the product is sturdy and looks good the only issue i have is that the bottom piece will not fit and stay on the top fit great and i use it i had to toss the bottom becuase it would not stay on the cost to send it back would have been more than the purchase price so we decided to keep the top and toss the bottom
the top snaps on great and is a great protector to the computer unfortunately , the bottom i never could get to go on when i contacted the company about it , they assumed that it was my fault and i had broken the casing , which i had not they said if i wanted a new piece -lrb- maybe mine was broken or wrong ? -rrb- then i would have to pay shipping to have it returned or purchase a new bottom for the case needless to say , i was less than pleased as i as mostly concerned about scratching all over the top of my case , i simply kept that piece and did n't bother replacing the other
this case is ok for basic protection , but it is not a tight fit i think the marketing is wrong given the acer stock model number gives the <unk> that this case was made to fit the noted acer i am keeping it to protect my acer when i put it in my carry all bag but i will keep an eye out for a better fitting case
i bought this cover along my acer netbook because i wanted to solve the protection issue right away , not having to look for another cover somewhere else the sleeve is nice but overall i found it too thin i do n't feel it protects much this is one item that probably i would not buy if i felt that on my hands but i was looking for something a little better however , it can be used with no problem is if you will keep the netbook inside your bag for transportation
i bought this sleeve for a # . # inch gateway the laptop fits perfectly with the foam insert in the sleeve , but without it it is much too big i would have preferred no foam insert , as it 's clumsy and looks like it should be something you would send along just for the sleeve to maintain its shape -lrb- which is may be ? -rrb- if anything , the padding should be sown into the fabric of the sleeve
figured it would fit my new airbook and it is too big it 's especially too wide other than that , it was exactly what i hoped i 'll still use it
needed a sleeve for my alienware m # x went for this one fit is nice and snug sleeve had strong chemical smell for the first week or so , which slowly faded away got ta love chinese products off-gassing strange toxic fumes the seem where the flap connects on the sides is starting to fray , but it still holds and protects the laptop well
this is a great <unk> protective case that we use while traveling , both in the car and on airlines it gives great protection is tacky enough to eliminate dropping our nook color with it 's slippery plastic hard case it fits inside our carry-on through check-in or my wife 's purse quite easily prevents storage scratches and direct sun damage while in a car best protection of it 's type for the price , anywhere amazon recommended and delivered promptly and securely
the reason i bought this sleeve is <unk> , i purchased acer <unk> laptop , it fits well and i love the design and color . it matches my <unk> # in laptop
my mom absolutely loved this sleeve i was a little jealous that i did n't buy one for me however , it was a little snug for the hp # . # laptop and it does n't have a zipper
the postage was very quick and there are no real faults with this product the only thing is that it is a little larger than # inch , which i would prefer a more snug fit for my laptop
i bought this to protect my macbook pro # `` it fits , barely , but it does offer a buffer to the <unk> of travel like other reviewers i 'd give this sleeve a higher rating if it included a zipper or handle if your looking for something reasonably price to protect your laptop this might work for you
i really love the look of this sleeve case cover my only complaint is that it is a tad too tight need about # inch more on all sides i did manage to squeeze my laptop in -lrb- acer -rrb- hopefully it will stretch a little over time with repeated use
i had a laptop that went to computer heaven had to replace it this is the case i bought because i wanted something fun and easy to deal with it 's perfect and if you want something to rest the computer on that wo n't cause it to overheat this is a good one of course i picked out a girly print and color that 's just who i am they have traditional boring practical colors too
