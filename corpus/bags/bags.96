the case snaps on and stays on very securely finger prints do stay on the case a lot but its not a problem for me the keyboard cover is a huge bonus and i love it ! you do n't have to worry about dust or anything getting your keyboard dirty it feels a little different when you first type with it and its a little harder to type but you will get used to it and learn to love it overall great buy i highly recommend this
i bought this item <unk> on only using the case not the keyboard cover way more than i expected the keyboard cover fits like a glove i like the fact that the apple logo shines through the cover worth the $ #
when i got this the packing was ripped up it the case felt like cardboard so i contact the deal and they told me that i would have to pay for shipping and a new pack and <unk> would get my refund <unk> ** t. . i will never buy off that deal
this was too big for my # . # `` laptop i could barely fit it into my backpack which is supposed to hold a # `` the sides do n't really have any padding at all so it sliding around in the case worries me a little bit but its better than my laptop sliding around my backpack alone the color is nice , the honeycomb idea is pretty neat , and i did manage to make it fit in my backpack , so i guess it 'll do
the honeycomb design is great , and it feels very sturdy the only problem is that there 's a little too much room around my # . # `` acer aspire v # , so it 's gon na bounce around the case a little bit
it works great i just wish it had a little padding or cushion in the inside just to better protect the laptop other then that i really like it it hard shell protects my laptop form scratches
i love this laptop sleeve totally a great deal considering most laptop sleeves are at least $ # my # . # in toshiba satellite fits inside -lrb- i was worried it would n't -rrb- with about an inch of extra room the color is really more `` plum `` or `` eggplant `` , not neon purple as pictured although the laptop is n't `` snug `` inside the case , the sleeve itself has the honeycomb shape which gives a nice cushion , but not a ton of padding so i am giving a # overall a great looking case for a great price and i 'm very happy with the purchase
the product is nice , a little too big , but great for protecting your laptop , but no carrying it in your backpack the picture is misleading , it does n't include the little chain that goes in the zipper
when this case arrived , i was absolutely delighted yellow is my favorite color and this case is beautiful within three days of using this case i noticed that the little pieces of plastic that attached the bottom part of the case to the back of the computer had broken and slightly damaged the computer i contacted the seller and they were wonderful to work with the replacement they sent was wrong so i contacted them again and they requested pictures after the pictures , they sent the correct replacement case and to my dismay , the bottom case 's little plastic pieces broke again it is a beautiful case from a cooperative seller but i 'm afraid the case just is n't made properly
this was not described as well as could be the keyboard cover fit fine , but as i have an older mac , the hard case did not fit my computer and i had to return this product
item doesnt specify which white mac book it went with and when i contacted the seller he wanted me to pay to have it sent back when it was wrong in the first place
i ordered my purple computer case for a macbook # inches i guess there was some sort of <unk> because i was sent a case for a macbook pro there was no paper work or information on how to do a refund or exchange i ended up gifting it to a friend with a new macbook pro but , i still have no computer case
nice colour and looks good on the white macbook , but snapped as soon as i put it on with no pressure applied i 'm really upset about this and i 'm hoping the seller will send me a replacement also , it is advertised as coming with a robin 's egg blue keyboard cover to match , and it came with a clear one : -lrb- i 'm hoping that they can send me a replacement
was not the right fit . . , there was not a phone number or card where i could return the item it was suppose to fit the macbook and it 's about # & # # ; too big
very dissatisfied with this product a complete waste of money it does not stay on the computer securely so it has no protection value and is just a hassle because it just falls off
no keypad cover and no lcd screen cover just the hard shell top and bottom wit mouse pad i dont use a mouse for this computer charged full price sent half the goods bad business ! ! ! ! !
i did n't even get my keyboard cover i only got the hard case and a mouse pad . i was pretty upset i did n't get the pink keyboard cover because it was suppose to match the
the case did not fit it kept falling off the keyboard cover was great but the case did not work i really wanted my money back but i got no response
i read the reviews and that this would be a good buy , but nope they sent me the wrong colour not even another shade of purple , but green that is not what it says in the description and i am very unsatisfied with topcase right now they better send me the right colour right away or they will be dealing with a very angry customer
it has nice color options but since it 's plastic , it broke easily i really liked it when i first got it , but the next day the back broke off some of the characters in the keyboard keys are incorrect
it did n't fit my computer i was so excited to receive it , just to find out that it was a hair too big i love the keyboard cover i am making use of the keyboard cover
after receiving the package i installed the hard case in my mac and unfortunately it does not fit properly to catch the edges the rubber keyboard cover does not fit the enter key of the macbook model i have the advertisement says for macbook white unibody and does not work
after much research with the model number and serial number to make sure we were buying a case to fit our late model macbook , this did not fit the case and keyboard are of no use for us and need to return it the early model macbooks with the plastic shell do not appear to have any hard case options
i bought the case cover in january # and it fit , but it did not last for # year i am very careful with my computer , but the case parts started breaking off little by little until i finally took it off so that i would not cut myself i do not recommend this case
not very pleased with my new laptop case it did not fit and it was cracked when i first got it the keyboard is nice but , the case is low quality plastic was not satisfied with the total outcome
if your computer had rubber in the bottom and it 's warped this case wo n't fit , the rubber keyboard cover was a little stretched out but this item is definitely true to
both the cover and the keyboard cover are really good quality and fits my # in white macbook however the color is off the macbook cover is a blue aqua and the keyboard cover is green both are nice colors but they do n't match if you want both items the same color then do n't get it i 'm keeping it since they do the job
most of the case is very snug which i like , but in one corner of the case it has no hold whatsoever i looked to see if it was broken but it does n't look like anything has come off it 's not a huge deal but if that one issue were fixed this would be an amazing case for its price got what i paid for , not too disappointed keyboard cover works really well case is true to its color
i was happy to received the product but unfortunately it did not fit i order the correct item for my mac book # in white which was the correct item at this time i ` am unable to return the item since i misplace the return shipping label any information you can assist me with would be greatly appreciated thank you <unk>
i was so excited to get this in the mail i 'd seen them all over and was super excited when it came in however , the bottom piece of the case does n't fit very well and can scratch easily when it 's on your lap i ended up leaving the top part on ; it fits well and protects the keyboard protector is a nice plus
my case fit and was the correct color , and shipped quickly however it had # pink spots on the keyboard cover , about the size of a pencil eraser and i have n't been able to remove i expect when something is labeled as & # # ; new & # # ; for it to not have things like this
i love my case , but some of the plastic that locks it in has already broken off -lrb- location - bottom , back lip -rrb- it has n't messed up the grip to the laptop yet , but it is a bit sharp where it broke
i ordered this for the model of laptop specified and the bottom case does not fit perfectly and falls of when lifted unless i clamp onto it but the top case and keyboard cover fit great and overall it looks really cute
i love my case arrived quick and was very easy to install on my lap top it provides the protection i need and the color i desired it was worth the low price
super easy to put on and such a beautiful color i put the keyboard skin on and it 's a little weird but i think it is just because i am not used to it i love the cover and think its a good product i am planning to buy some decals and more colors so i can change it up if i get bored
she was issued one of those old white plastic macbooks for work it was a little dirty and <unk> , this case and keyboard cover dressed it up nicely i would recommend it to anyone
i do n't have any complaints the quality of the product is incredibly good and the shipping too however the top part of the cover does not perfectly fit my white # inch macbook which i found it understandable because of the price and the fact that is truly protects my computer
this product did exactly what it promised it protects my late # white macbook and the keyboard from scratches , lint , etc . installing it took about # minutes , it 's pretty easy and both come off with about as much time too , if you want it to the only thing that i could possibly complain about is the vent holes they put on the bottom snag when i pull my laptop out of my back-pack like the edge is too sharp so i just took my nail file and rounded the edges out and that was that it 's a nice robin 's <unk> blue color that i 've got compliments on so like i said , no complaints
the color is exactly what i expected could have done with the tacky mouse pad way to go advertising giving us ugly things one purchase at a time
this very cute pink laptop hard case cover does exactly what you expect it 's not fancy and is not made out of the best plastic but will do the job i had no problem fitting the keyboard cover or the hard case around my # & # # ; macbook i 've been reading other reviews and please do n't mistake this cover for a # & # # ; macbook pro , i think it only fits the older generation white macbook i am completely satisfied with this product and will definitely buy it again in the future when i need a replacement my only complaint about this cover is that the little rubber holding grips on the bottom came off quite easily , i only have one left now and am left with my laptop sliding around sometimes other than that , fit perfect absolutely love the pink
this case was everything that i wanted it to be very cool looking and keeps my macbook safe on campus . only thing is that when trying papers the keyboard cover can get pretty annoying , other than that i love it
very nice looking case and love the colour would have given a # star rating if the back clasps did n't break within days of getting it -lrb- case still stays on pretty well though -rrb- overall i am happy with the purchase
i like it , so far the keyboard cover sits on and i can hold it upside down without it falling off the top was easy , but the bottom took twice to snap in place , placing the back on then the front it is a bit bulkier , the computer , but to protect it im willing to accept it
well the case is beautiful and my mac looks amazing would have been better if keyboard cover come in blue instead of transparent white in the picture it shows blue but the one which i have recieved is <unk> white regards , <unk>
like it a lot but when the case gets a little drop of water on it it 's <unk> looking other than that it 's great they keyboard cover fits perfectly and is easy to type with as well
came very fast and fits my computer perfect giving # stars because the keyboard is n't right by the power button is covering the eject button but i still love
pretty lavender color and would have been perfect , if it fit i should have read the description more carefully it 's for newer mac 's i have an older one and it did n't fit however , the company was kind enough to accept the return
i really wondered if i would like this set for one thing , i wondered if typing on the key cover would be difficult it is not in fact , i love that i can type on it quietly , especially in the classroom when the kids are taking a test or reading <unk> and they can hardly hear me i also love that when i want to clean my laptop , i just pull off the key cover , wash and dry it , and put it back in place no longer do i have to use a <unk> to get between the keys , etc . when i remove the key cover and the laptop case , i just wipe down my laptop and it is <unk> and span again - no more wondering if i got it clean i highly recommend this set and am planning on buying another set again when this one wears out -lrb- i have had this set over a year now , and i practically live on my laptop , and the only sign of wear is the e key has a tear in the cover considering i have long nails and used to use this laptop for teaching in an online school , i consider that to be pretty darn good life span of a piece of thin rubber . -rrb- :
my new or should i say my girlfriends new topcase arrived , she 's the one who uses the computer , and instantly she fell in love with it the color is beautiful and protects the machine wonderfully the purple keyboard cover is yet another reason that the new top case is awesome they keyboard cover stays in place even without the help adhesive and protects the keyboard from the normal abuse a keyboard takes ill never go without a topcase cover on any computer i , or again should i say we , own
fits the mac book perfect a total make over makes the mac look new again people are always asking about it , some think it came like that and we have to tell them it 's a cover
this fits my older white mac book very cute and nice i love it i was worried it would n't fit , but it fits like a glove ! the only problem i have with it is that the small white protectors fall off
i have purchased <unk> cover for # other macs great cover and great value fits without issues only draw back it adds weight to the top small <unk> to pay for
i bought this product to update the look of my # year old macbook computer what a change ! the fit is just perfect , it looks like a million dollar this is a great product , great value for the dollar
i love this case because it 's almost tiffany turquoise , it was inexpensive , and because my mac case was looking pretty sad it now looks great , and my keys are protected with the plastic covering a great way to give your mac a new look . it 's very durable and allows for all mac functions
this fit my white unibody mac perfectly i was told to make sure the serial numbers matched up before i purchased a new case for my laptop it looks great and makes me feel like i have a new computer
i used to have speck cover similar to this , but since this macbook is so old , they discontinued it this is a suitable replacement almost as good but the extras give it a boost the keyboard cover , albeit just a <unk> , really works and makes the key <unk> a little better than the bare keyboard , the <unk> cover protects the unit overall a buy
this case is perfect it fit my macbook late # model a # perfectly i saw ratings of the same topcase cover that said it did n't fit and that it was advertised for the wrong model it makes me wonder if they were putting it on the wrong mac or did n't know how to put it at all
i received my case a little late due to mailing issues on my part but when i did receive it i was so happy with the product it fits perfectly and it looks stunning ! !
i am really impressed with the quality of this cover i honestly bought it because i thought it would make my computer look & # # ; prettier & # # ; but the case is very hard and it really protects my computer a lot more than i would have ever thought the keyboard cover takes time to get use to , but it makes writing papers much more fun it 's something bright to look at ! -lrb-
at first i thought the case was broken since packaging did n't look that great , then i tried to put it on my macbook and the bottom piece did n't fit at first then i noticed i put the case on not properly but after the hassle this case is really nice and you ca n't go wrong with price . i would recommend this case to
it came on time : -rrb- -lrb- about a week -rrb- the case came packaged nicely when i put it on my mid # white macbook it fit perfectly the bottom part snapped on to and the case is not cheaply made this also came with a rubberized keyboard protector and it works really well if you want to preserve your precious macbook i would defiantly go for this case :
a must have for anyone who has a mac it protects my computer and looks great at the same time love the matching keyboard cover because it keeps pet fur , dust and dirt out of the keyboard
thank you so much i 'm so happy to have found a case cover that actually fits my macbook the beautiful robin egg blue makes my laptop look so stylish and chic i will be ordering more colors ! thank you again
arrived earlier than promised fits my macbook -lrb- white older one -rrb- perfectly well made and everything promised even keyboard cover fits like a glove i thought the apple logo was going to be cut out on the cover but it actually covers it and is slightly transparent when comp is on to see the apple logo
this was a very good purchase , i absolutely love it a friend bought one online @ amazon , but she used a different vendor and was not as pleased as i was
i was really looking for a case for an older macbook since it was scratched considerably case fits perfect and the keyboard covers feels great and stays put apple logo glows through the case and overall this combo <unk> enough new life into it that i 'm no longer looking at new laptops
well i love the product <unk> well i bought the computer recieved the cover before the computer and to make things short i bought the wrong size cover but its really pretty
perfect for # yo computer i appreciated the details included about finding our computer 's model number so i could be sure case would fit properly the key cover works surprisingly well & looks great this case also solved a problem : the rubber backing on the bottom of our computer was starting to come off this case now covers the area so not only is this problem hidden but it 's also protected so it does not <unk>
i am always hesitant when buying things online , this was worth the money i paid for it the case fit perfectly and there is a lot more protection than my old case i purchased from the apple store itself the keyboard cover fits perfectly as well also just a reminder before you buy this though , check your model number because the case is for the unibody macbook and any older version will not be compatible
love the color of the case the rubber keypad makes it a little weird to type on but its manageable i actually ordered the wrong one for my laptop , but the shipper made it extremely easy to exchange
i wad in desperate need for a case my laptop was falling apart i 'm glad it was affordable number # , but also it was durable and just what i needed it fits great , looks great , and feels great
fits my laptop perfectly ! ! the key pad fits nicely too my previous key pad cover was too squishy and moved a lot this one lays perfectly on my keyboard do your research and make sure you have the newer macbook -lrb- even though it 's now discontinued -rrb- the older model is <unk> <unk> and may not fit this case
i absolutely love the rubberized case keeps my macbook clean and looking great absolutely love it i 've even been asked if i got a new laptop for my coworkers and friends
this was perfect the case snapped on easily and looks exactly as depicted the keypad i was a little skeptical on however it works great it 's one solid piece that sits on top of the keys i was worried it would move around a lot or be difficult to work with it works absolutely perfect and makes it so easy to dust off and put back on i clean it off almost daily that 's how easy it is !
i noticed there are some mixed reviews on this product , so please read this before you purchase this case my case fit perfectly , everything snapped in and the color is excellent -lrb- the apple logo shines through still -rrb- make sure you read the product description i have a white macbook unibody -lrb- the later model -rrb- and it has the more rounded corners this wo n't fit a macbook pro or the more square white macbook . it 's a great product so if you have the right laptop for this case i highly recommend it
i bought this for my daughter , who is rough and tough on anything she stopped by the house and still had this shield on her laptop after two weeks no more needs to be said
fits white macbook purchased in # texture is awesome and the color is a gorgeous tiffany blue shipping was incredibly fast worth every penny ! # nd time buying after the first one got stained with ink ! love this product
fits my white macbook perfectly , the color looks just like in the picture and the key guard looks amazing amazing quality super cute and key guard feels great many of the reviews said it did not fit their laptop and it was the wrong size i think that they had the old mac book which has a more squared corners however the new macbook has rounded edges it this case is for the new macbook which it says in the description if you have the old white mac book this will not fit your laptop , if you have the new white macbook this will fit your laptop and i definitely recommend it to you
fits snugly to the keyboard and laptop the outer shell occasionally unsnaps i ordered the pink and love it it is a cute and fun way to keep your laptop clean
i was surprised at the quality and design of this bag it more than met my expectations . it is a gift that i know the <unk> is going to love i would definetly order from this company again
i have been awaiting this bag and was thrilled when it arrived everything is absolutely perfect it arrived quite fast considering it came from asia this bag has lots of room , lots of pockets , and has an adjustable strap i was happy to see that it has a shoulder pad for comfort when you are carrying heavy items the cover is attached by a zipper and can come off -lrb- for if you would like to <unk> new cover . i am a huge fan of <unk> <unk> and love that this bag has so many of my favorite <unk> overall , it 's great quality and i would recommend it for sure
i ordered this bag when it was on sale , and it has provided me with plenty of storage space on the go i 'm a gamer with many handheld systems and the bag makes it a simple task to lug them all around tough , durable , awesome design and speedy delivery #
the quality of the bag is very good , it can hold lots of books and i use it for school the strap seemed a bit weak at first but it was <unk> enough you can also change the cover , you can unzip the cover and replace it with another if you wish i would recommend this
i was very surprised with the size of this bag i was expecting like a purse , however it is like a <unk> much more than i expected my granddaughter is going to love it
my daughter is really into this <unk> stage so seeing her face when it arrived just gave me a sense of joy : -rrb- she uses it as her bookbag on a daily basis
the bag worked pretty well . . for about six month then the actual material began to tear first the handle ripped straight from the `` canvas `` material then the actual strap this was n't tearing at the seams , the actual material failed to maintain its structure it could n't be repaired by stitching it the zipper also broke from regular use i would n't get this bag unless you do n't want something to last more than a year
looks great and has a good design , but is not well constructed - has fallen apart twice altego replaced one bag and the # nd bag fell apart in the same short amount of time this company is not responsive -- does not return emails and has no phone number for customer service i will not be buying from altego again
i nearly forgot i purchased this messenger bag i mean all in all , it lasted two weeks at most the stitching was poorly done , and to be honest , all the materials aside from the thread in the stitches , it was a very nice bag , and had very high quality materials so it is a shame that the stitching was just so <unk> s *** ty
i have only had this bag about two weeks now but i can tell you that i am so happy that i purchased this one it protects all of my gadgets , macbook pro # and is great i have been trying to find the right bag and i finally found it the great part is based on the reviews and feedback , i have confidence knowing this is a company that will stand behind the product updated review - may # , # unfortunately , i have to report that i am greatly disappointed i really love this bag but the cool system to keep the flap closed is falling apart i have only had this bag for # months i have tried to reach the company and have not received a call or email response or anything i had really high hopes for this
i had high hopes for this bag i am disappointed to say that the closure system that keeps the flap down has failed after only # day i used the closure system maybe # times and now the self turning clasps wo n't self turn anymore the bag seems pretty nice , but since the closure system does n't work , it makes it very difficult to keep the contents of the bag , in the bag other than the faulty closure system , the bag seems nice and pretty well made i guess you get what you pay for
the bag itself has a great design and the strap was especially soft and comfortable , but the strap has started to come apart where it connects to the bag itself biggest design flaw is that the strap is connected directly to the bag so you cant replace the strap
i enjoy the look and feel of this bag with its unique clasps . but after less then a half year with it , the area where the strap attaches to the bag has a rip from regular use tried to contact altego with no response , will be <unk> them again update : received email from company offering to replace the broken bag
# year old picked this out to be his middle school book bag and was pleased when it arrives has a padded back side that keeps the lap cool if you want to work o your laptop he would recommend it . :
my daughter loves this backpack it seems very roomy and i like the fact that since it is black it wo n't be looking nasty anytime soon we have not had it very long so i can review durability but it appears very well made
quite happy when i got the bag and the color looks really awesome a little disappointed with the mould found on some parts of the bag though it was packed in a plastic wrap they were quite easily cleaned off with a damp cloth but who knows if it 'll grow again when left in a cool and <unk> place well , the laptop compartment is quite nicely padded but it seems that the bag does not come with too many compartments to sort out my stuff from the previous targus bag that i was using i had read some of the reviews saying the same thing but i thought those were just words from people who used to have a larger bag although all my stuff can be put inside the bag , there 're just all <unk> into the middle compartment this bag is good for travelling and perhaps people who carry simple stuff to work overall feel of the bag is quite nicely made although the shoulder straps could have been thicker
there are many smart touches to this bag i particularly like the way that it can be expanded by use the zipper that start on the opposite side of the bag there are well placed storage compartments that are easily accessed too the thing that really caught my eye was the use of a bright blue accent color used through the backpack the only real complaint that i have is that the handle that would be used when carrying the backpack in hand could be more sturdy in summary i do n't se how i could have bought a better looking backpack without spending considerably more money
i love using this back pack especially like the fact that the lap tops compartment is underneath the back straps with plenty of cushion i 've never had to worry about my lap top getting smashed
this bag is amazing quality and looks just as awesome in real life as it does in its photos also something i really liked was that in its pictures it doesnt show all the pockets , therefore there are even more pockets on the inside shown another this is that when i went to put my ipad in , it with without the case but it also does fit with the case on and closed that make me extremely happy meaning that i wont have to take the case off every time i want to put my <unk> in the ipad pocket . huge plus on the matter on the laptop compartment . you have to lift the strips over to get to it , but that means it would be harder to steal your computer that was also a plus for me overall , amazing bag and sooooo worth the money it doesnt even cost that much , but i honestly would have paid even more for this , because its that great hope this helped
i bought this bag to help myself through the airport and i fell in love with it it 's comfy , has a lot of space in it and protects my laptop properly i 'd recommend it
i purchased this backpack for school i was previously using a laptop case but found it did n't hold all of my notebooks , laptop , charger , etc . this backpack has everything i need and even more room the pouch in the back for your laptop is very well protected and easy to access the main storage area is in a double zippered , <unk> over to give more room , plus the flap covers the zippers it is very useful , stores my binder , books , calculator , charger , laptop , and accessories cons : straps could be longer / larger
