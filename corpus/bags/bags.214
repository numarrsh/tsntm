this is a wonderful product the cover snapped onto my macbook pro w/retina display very easily and looks great i received the cover in just two days and am very satisfied i highly recommend it for anyone looking for protection for their beautiful # . # inch mac pro w/retina display
i had a hard cover case similar to this for my old macbook and loved it , but was nervous about getting the right one for my new retina it arrived and is a beautiful color and snapped on easily and looks great i do n't understand why more people do n't buy these for their macbooks
absolutely love the cover ; fits perfectly , beautiful slightly transparent color of blue feels like it is absolutely part of the computer i do n't use the keyboard cover it makes the keys awkward to use
i 've been using this case for a few weeks now and it 's great my biggest problem with my old macbook was that i would accidentally drop it on the ground and ruin the housing -lrb- call me clumsy if you will ! -rrb- this case eliminates the need for a soft case and protects the computer super well the casing is easy to install , and the blue looks great apple does shine through as advertised , and the kickstands are great on a desk vents on the bottom seem to work well - guess time will tell the mcover for your keyboard is maybe the only negative aspect i continue to use it , but it sometimes will stick to my screen when closed - but it 's a sacrifice you make in order to keep liquids and dirt out of the keyboard it also is n't as nice of a feel as the naked keyboard without the cover - but it 's up to you to use it or not overall i would recommend getting this as it does exactly what you think it would do - go for it
it even comes with a keyboard cover i do n't know what to say it is great it fits well i 'm gon na write another one in about one month to see if it last long
massive chip on the side , under the cd drive , one of the most important places to be protected very , very frustrating & annoying otherwise , i would recommend ! obviously not everyone 's is going to arrive with a chip , and it does a wonderful job protecting your macbook
the feel of the black casing that protects the laptop is quite nice & soft to the touch it was a little difficult to get it on properly at first because of the super tight fit still , it looks nice & the apple logo does shine thru when the computer is on still not accustomed to the keyboard cover sure it does its job really well by protecting the keys from dirt , dust , food & liquid spills but it makes typing a chore also at night i 've had to pull it off a couple times as it does n't allow the backlight thru so as to see the letters properly and finally , the screen protector is completely useless - will be finding its way into the garbage
case is really nice the keyboard protector would be better if it was clear but it 's worth having on there for spills it 's a little awkward to type on and it does n't let enough of the back lighting through to really see the letters on the keypad in the dark screen protector was useless would n't go on without air bubbles and everytime i tried to pull it up and smooth it out it would just pick up dust , hair , grit , etc that would n't come off threw it away
very good product , the case is working exceptionally well for me i have n't used the key board cover as much as i should but the case makes it worth while
its a tight fit on my late # macbook pro -lrb- aluminum -rrb- but it looks great . one down side is the clips stick down a little too far so the lid does n't close completely love the key board cover tho very nice fit screen protector is great easiest way to apply it is too first stick and align it at the top and then use a credit card to apply the rest of it and work out all the air bubbles as you go
was expecting that there should be a hole for the apple logo to show clearly but anyway , the product is really nice was n't able to <unk> the screen protector properly so it ended up having lots of bubbles overall i still like the product
the black cover is great i love it the rubberized keyboard pad is not good i threw it away the keys are so sticky -lrb- silicone -rrb- and makes typing cumbersome and difficult
its really an amazing product i 'm a huge fan of the cover and the screen protector but not so into the keyboard cover i thought the keyboard cover would be more set to a place but it moves around a lot so thats the only con for the product but besides that , its worth the money
i recently got my macbook pro # . # `` and the case fits perfectly the keyboard cover is a little thick and does n't stay in place perfectly , but you get for what you pay for and it does the job finally , the screen protector is stupid and immediately took it off i suggest you buy it right now before it goes back up in price
i was skeptical given the low price , but i honestly love this case it fits my macbook pro # & # # ; perfectly , and i mean perfectly and looks fantastic -lrb- black -rrb- i prefer it to a case i bought at the apple store a year ago , which was three times the price -lrb- almost -rrb- the keyboard cover is great , and exactly what i hoped for some reviews say it 's difficult to type and i can understand where they 're coming from , but its what i 'd expected ... not difficult , just different i 've also been <unk> the temperature of my macbook as i 'd heard that keyboard covers can hinder cooling , but it 's never gone above an average temp with prolonged use i ended up not using the screen protector , <unk> it 's a little difficult to mount without <unk> air , i gave up no biggie , for me
it 's good product , using it for more than # year . laptop cover has some cracks around it now . screen protector had some bubble but keyboard cover and laptop cover were best
this is great backpack where you can put almost everything you can imagine inside the only problem is that it may result a little bit too big the first time i wore it i looked like a ninja turtle but it brings a lot of straps that may help you to reduce the size not enough in my
i bought this backpack to replace a rolling case i use for work everything fit but i had to take some things out to reduce weight the backpack can hold a lot of stuff my only complaint is the zipper for the front small compartment sometimes comes apart when you zip it up it does n't get stuck and if zipped correctly it stays closed it 's just if you zip it up fast it will miss a tooth and be open behind the zipper update : the extra support on the strap gave way after a few weeks the backpack is still usable , but one strap is holding by the elastic `` shock absorber `` only
i have searched hi and low for a backpack that would accommodate my hp # . # -inch laptop this rosewill fulfills that need and then some you could fit a # & # # ; laptop in it and still have extra room i currently carry the laptop , a <unk> projector , extra speakers , extra tripods , a portable scanner -lrb- flip <unk> -rrb- , my books and all the cables and accessories and i still have room for a few change of clothes there are so many pockets i have n't filled them all the only drawback is how much weight do you want to carry well worth the money
but if you need to carry one -lrb- or even two -rrb- # inch laptops , this is a solid and <unk> economical backback very roomy , my son is very happy with it and will be using it for everything when going to school , including his large laptop
i could not believe that my # . # inch laptop fits in this backpack and it still has a huge amount of room for everything else i have to carry in a day
one of the largest bags you can find pretty sturdy too this thing can eat up a # & # # ; laptop -lrb- padded compartment -rrb- and a <unk> of college books for everyday use great for travel too as you can pack in a lot of stuff
just used it for carrying two laptops -lrb- a # <unk> samsung and a # . # -inch hp -rrb- as well as # textbooks and a # -ring binder on a trip to visit family for christmas the backpack was very heavy -lrb- obviously -rrb- but held everything , with room for power cords , date book , pens & pencils , etc . just received it a few days before christmas and have n't used it on a daily basis for school yet , so i ca n't comment on its durability only complaint so far is that all the storage spaces are either huge compartments or very small pockets not much of a complaint really
my # & # # ; laptop fits with ease , with tons of extra space for books and gear appears to be very well made nice convenience features like cell phone case on shoulder strap , mp # compartment with headphone wire port , key chain clip and extra pockets reasonably priced for the <unk>
this backpack is amazingly ample , plenty of zippered compartments of all sizes for all sorts of things from water bottles to heavy textbooks plus electronic media sturdy , strong shoulder straps , equally strong , steel cable -lrb- plastic covered -rrb- handle for hand carrying well worth the money compared to other specialized backpacks good job for rosewill
i like the separate compartments and sturdy straps the backpack has no problem holding my laptop and i have room for multiple books and other supplies i have already recommended it to my friends
i spent most of my high school years searching for backpack that would hold my honor 's load of books and i 'm sorry to say i did n't find this one until too late i did use this bag to pack when i went to college and i was able to fit a week 's worth of essentials inside to last me while the rest of my things shipped down the only downside i can think of is the bag may be cumbersome to some at # ' # & # # ; and # lbs i 'm probably not the best judge of this
i know a lot of people did n't like the size of this backpack . it 's for a # & # # ; laptop , it 's got ta have some size to it i like the fact that i could take my laptop and some clothes and fit everything in for a weekend trip , including a spare pair of running shoes
pros : there is a lot of space in this bag lots of compartments this bag is made very well and a good price point the straps seem very solid and the carry handle actually has a cable in it cons : it 's very big and it does n't carry itself i really like this backpack a lot however , it is very large it works as a computer bag and a weekend bag if i need to use it that way considering how well it 's made , how large it is and the price , it is a great value , in my opinion
this really is huge there are all kinds of compartments in it for storing your repair kits , tools , etc . compared to other backpacks , seems to be a good value for the price
i can not believe how much storage space this <unk> backpack has i have a # & # # ; laptop , # & # # ; dvd player and # & # # ; tablet power cords , cables and other accessories fit into this bag with room to spare
this thing is big , holds easily my # `` macbookpro in the laptop compartment with plenty of room to spare -lrb- one could easily fit two # `` macbookpros in that compartment alone -rrb- plus there is tons of space in the other compartments feels very sturdy and well-constructed as well , which adds a bit to the weight , but that 's not a problem for me only had it for a month or so , but so far it gets # stars from me , especially considering the price is in the $ # s range , which makes it an excellent buy in my opinion btw , the mesh on each side easily holds a # ml water bottle each -lrb- will add pic -rrb-
this bag is sweet it fits my asus g # with no problem snug but not tight it 's a large bag but that 's what you get when you have a # & # # ; laptop if i could change anything on it , i would ask rosewill to add a water resistant bottom and maybe a shallow pocket all the zipper compartments go to the bottom of the bag making them very deep and if you have lots of items in it , you may get lost . : p overall , great bag and great price if needed , i would definitely buy this bag again
the backpack is amazing spacious , well constructed and distributes the weight of contents evenly making everything comfortable to carry plenty of room for my large laptop , tablet and accessories ; even books
it works for my hp # . # inch laptop and has all kinds of storage and straps for mp # player , phone and water bottles we will see how it holds up on the trip
my beloved # year old back pack bit the dust tried to find something comparable and i 'm happy with this purchase although still too new to tell , it looks like it will stand up to the rigors of the road
it 's <unk> very well made like the other buyer said it can fit multiple laptops with room to spare i 'm # ft # in and , i still find it big but it was the only bag that will fit my dell m # . # inch work laptop
it actually came out to be quite a bit bigger than i expected laptop compartment is separate from the main compartment easily fits a large laptop , charger , lunch , # liter bottle , gym <unk> comfortable on my back
i use this bag for travel fits almost all my needs be it laptops , shoes , # sets of dresses , tablet , chargers , gps , and more , still lt have space to fit my food stuff & water bottle rigid handle , easy strap , zipper , side pockets etc . .
this is listed as for a dell xps # well guess what it fits , but you can not access the home button , the volume control , either one of the cameras , headphone <unk> and it really is not well designed it will fit # inch tablets that do not have special
it seems like it would be a great case for the dell xps , especially since there are not many out there for sale , but it was terrible when the case was on , i could not click the buttons , so i had to keep taking it in and out of the case it also does not protect the tablet in case of any bumps or dropping it
i was n't too happy with this cover it did n't fit very good and when you folded it back to set it up it falls out so i wo n't be using it at all
in the product title it is referenced as a `` <unk> folio case with folding stand design for dell xps # windows rt `` this is not the case , it is not designed specifically for the dell xps # , but is a generic folio designed for the standard # . # inch tablets the sleeve covers the edges of the screen that make some hand <unk> difficult , like closing an app in addition , the sleeve does cover the start button , but you can access this function by a swipe from the right otherwise , the case has a nice look , constructed with tough nylon , and does what i bought it for - keeping the tablet safe from scratches and the occasional accidental drop
as a protective covering , the case is ok however , with the case on the tablet , neither camera works , they are covered the start button is covered and hard to <unk> <unk> from any edge of the tablet will not <unk> the desired function , even when using a <unk> stylus i take the tablet out from the case to use it
the cover is nice , i wish it were better made to fit however it does serve it purpose the position for a stand could be better too all in all it works
i had a hard time find a case for my dell <unk> tablet but this fit perfectly and it did n't come out of the edges like some of the universal covers i found at best buy it 's sturdy enough and looks good too the only thing that bothers me at times is that the edges get in the way of the home button and its hard to slide to the previous screen on the tablet , but not impossible
the xps # is so new that it is hard to find a case this one is great it fits well and is a great coverage for my new dell xps # the price is great and i like it very much
arrived quickly , was just what i was looking for the lap top fits great in the case , the only bad point is that there is no cut out for the bottom button
i carried the s # in the rain -lrb- heavy but not <unk> -rrb- for # minutes i was using my umbrella but it was n't big enough to cover the entire backpack the inside of the laptop case was dry the top flap that covers the main compartment was wet but the underside of it was dry , indicating that this top flap is water resistant however , the bottom of the documents that i stored in the main compartment was wet it turned out that rain water <unk> through the zipper of the ipad case and traveled from the ipad case to the main compartment one design flaw makes the backpack useless in the rain if you need water protection for not just your notebook but also the other stuff that you carry in your backpack , the s # is not the right choice for you
my dell xps # slid around inside the compartment no matter my use of the pads if i used the thinner ones it slid , if i used the thicker ones , i am sure eventually it would have damaged my screen from the pressure very solid construction and great protection , especially for airline travel that said , i missed all of the pockets on my old tired and true ogio metro the flap at the top is just that , merely a flap over with very , very tough to <unk> clips all in all , a perfect case for a frequent traveler who has a macbook pro , as it fits perfectly
it is heavy and is not comfortable to wear for any length of time but i bought it to protect my laptops from harsh climate and travel conditions to get me into those climates
i am currently a law student i wanted a pelican bag to protect my # in macbook while riding my bike to and from school i decided to go with the s # because i was n't sure the u # would fit as many textbooks the s # will fit three of my textbooks in the main compartment the handle is excellent because i can easily grab it and not worry about tearing fabric due to the weight of the bag it is n't the most comfortable pack i wish the shoulder straps were beefier and the hip strap was more substantial , but the pack does what i need it to do
this bag is legit , built like a tank , i used for traveling -lrb- airport to airport -rrb- it can be a little heavy but the carry handle makes up for extra weight not to bad when carrying on your back , little stiff but was n't uncomfortable and it 's def made for a slim computer the easy open was perfect for security at airport , opens and closes in a <unk> lots of room in bag itself but lacks different compartments
my only disappointment was my dell xps # is a little too thick to fit in the compartment it just fits shut but is not likely waterproof i wish they had published the thickness allowed i might have to buy a new laptop to fit the bag ... everything else is better than
lots of compartments and accessories the only negative thing is that the backpack does n't have a zipper on the top it just has a flap that covers the top of the backpack
i fly upwards of a hundred segments a year if the price fits your budget , then i 'd recommend this backpack without <unk> except that on some commuter flights , you are n't going to squish this thing down to make it fit in the overhead bins the fabric is heavier ballistic nylon than i 'm used to seeing , and the buckles are solid the walls of the hard case are n't as thick as on pelican 's suitcases , but it 's definitely the right thickness for this application
i was looking for a backpack that could travel in the worst conditions and protect my macbook pro totally it has ample space for all the extras , including my ipad and some dry clothes for a day in the wild while taking photos or bouncing around on a small boat going to remote and sometimes rainy locations pelican makes great products , from their dry boxes to this fine backpack , and i would highly recommend to anyone who really wants the best protection for a # inch thin notebook
the rubber feet on the bottom came off almost immediately ; i replaced them with the ones in the photos the fit initially seemed super snug but actually the bottom piece did n't fit the computer correctly and never snapped in place over time the bottom case cracked and chipped at the front and front corner -lrb- see photos
the case is what i expected from the description the fit is excellent but after a few weeks both front corners of the bottom case have cracked this will impact the ability of the bottom section to stay in place
i did n't expect much since the price was very cheap but the result is very disappointing the bottom case does n't fit my computer perfectly it 's uber annoying because it comes off so easily and makes me feel anxious that when my computer falls it wo n't protect the bottom also , the top cover is exactly the opposite it 's <unk> hard to take it off i think my computer is almost bent when i was trying to take it off on top of that , it 's very easy to make the case dirty i accidentally had a piece of lead on top of it , and it left long lasting mark that even when i <unk> it , it looks dirty i am so sad :
the case itself is great , it easily snaps on and stays on securely the issue i have is that fingerprints are constantly left behind they are easily <unk> away with a damp cloth , but obviously this material hangs onto oils a color other than black also might help with this
cover is not rubbery , but does not bother me it is more of a soft plastic like a <unk> container for the price , it is still a great cover also there is a fraction of a millimeter lip on the front edge where the cover comes up over the <unk> edge -lrb- looking directly at the laptop , the front edge where your <unk> rest -rrb- this is a small annoyance , barely noticeable but as long as you are properly typing , your wrists do n't touch it anyway overall still ca n't beat the price
i ordered this product not knowing the difference between a retina macbook pro and a normal macbook pro so to my surprise it did n't fit my machine when i got it definitely know what you need before you buy it this was an expensive mistake on my part other than that the plastic is of a good quality and i have no doubt it 'd be great if it fit my machine
very pretty bag got lots of compliments the bag it 's very heavy without the laptop in it with the laptop it is definitely too heavy the piece that wraps around the on the hooks came off within # days of me having the bag
the bag on it 's own is heavy , and when i add papers to grade or a textbook , forget about it then one handle slit in two and is now ripping open i bought this for work but it 's just not enough for what i do
i purchased less than # months ago and loved it even with a flaw originally one handle had # spot not well stitched it was n't a big spot and did n't compromise integrity of handle i loved the look and structure now the wrapping near the bag on one handle has become <unk> , and the stitching under that has come undone as well i 'm disappointed it has n't held up better
this bag is way too heavy to carry around it looks good but it is killing my shoulders so i am not able to use i am so sorry i live outside of the us or i would have sent it back now i am stuck with this heavy bag
it was a bit larger than i thought it would be , but my wife liked it because it had room for her usual stuff plus an ipad # in case <unk> she uses it almost daily now it seems well made and i guess time will tell on that update : # / # up until yesterday this was her daily bag it handled her usual stuff plus an ipad but sad to say one of the handles broke off -lrb- not the clamp - just after it -rrb- , and now she is in the process off switching bags again i thought i 'd got this one right , but i guess i was incorrect , so i 've <unk> the rating down to # -stars -lrb- ours may be a fluke -rrb- , but we 're both disappointed
item arrived on time , but i did not care for it at all once i saw it in person handles are very very stiff and hence , akward looking <unk> the whole appearance of the item verses how it looks in the picture
good looking bag that weighs a ton before you put anything in it in addition , the magnetic clasp pulled away from leather in the first week of use i went back to using my old bag that is falling apart
i enjoy the bag but as soon as i used it the # st time during travel , the black covering on # of the handles started to unravel and were hanging down as i was traveling i 've had to resort to applying black electrical tape to fix the problem
i tried using this to carry my laptop to work and i did not like it because the straps were so hard and uncomfortable i very quickly went back to using my backpack to carry belongings to and from work
i had to return this bag because it arrived with all sorts of scratches and scuffs which is not surprising once you see the cheap material the bag is made from i could only imagine it getting much worse
this bag looked fabulous in the online photo the description said high gloss ; in reality , the finish is matte so i 'm very disappointed in its appearance i should have paid more attention to the bag 's dimensions as it 's larger than i need and therefore more cumbersome to carry
this is not a laptop bag but a business tote the <unk> is wrong -lrb- check out the mcklein website -rrb- which makes the picture of the inside deceiving the center compartment is not meant to hold a laptop it 's just a zippered compartment that 's too small to hold a laptop -lrb- mine is # inches and still did n't fit . there is no area to protect your laptop that said , it looks like a lovely tote i returned mine because i need a laptop bag did not want to leave a rating as i returned mine but ca n't leave a review without one
this women 's briefcase is just ok i do not like the handles that are stiff faux leather , do not bend at all and which actually end up hurting your shoulder also the bag is so stiff the the little magnet closure that holds the two sides of the bag together does not stay closed and pops open exposing the potential for items to fall out it 's ok for the price but the two issues above will cause me to not purchase this item again i do get a lot of compliments on its looks though and it does hold my standard laptop and other legal size files for court
i 'm quite happy with this one reviewer called this bag too big ; i read that review and immediately dropped this in my cart i spend most of my day in meetings , and because i need to carry the essentials of my work day with me , i need a big bag this one is a good blend of form and function i 've gotten a couple requests for the link to where it can be purchased , and it suits my needs perfectly i carry an ipad in it instead of a laptop the laptop , along with the physical files , note pad , and miscellany , would likely make the bag too heavy
even though i did not use the middle zipper to put my laptop in there , the bag is big enough to put my laptop on the sides i even fit two chargers , my work laptop and my mac in there ... this was great purchase
i bought if for my macbook and office bag but it 's huge the bag looks nice and has tons of room but my laptop kind of <unk> around inside unless i put other files in with it will make do because overall its a great option and i like having all that space
would give it five stars if the magnet worked on the tab that pulls bag closed holds all my stuff and although heavier than i thought , it is not cumbersome when worn as a shoulder bag carries my tablet , wallet , lunch and essentials preferable to my old habit of juggling a tote bag , purse , and lunch bag lots of compliments , and i do n't mention the worthless magnet on top i love the sturdiness and that it stands up without <unk> or falling over all in all , i would re-order
this is a nice bag it is much bigger than i expected , but is well made the posting for the bag said & # # ; glossy finish & # # ; however it is more of a matte finish overall i like the bag
ths bag looks great and is a good size it is a little taller and stiffer than i expected i would prefer if it closed completely for traveling , and a tether for keys would also be nice i would buy this bag again
holds everything i need including a larger size laptop and the shoulder straps are rounded and comfortable i use it # days a week and it has help up like a champ
it holds my lap top , my ipad , and a whole lot more , but what i like most is how it looks it appears to be far more expensive than it is <unk> the material is a flat red shade with just the right amount of <unk> , which is silver and minimalist in its not <unk> metallic fashion there are pockets inside for phones , shades , and middle spot for stuff you will need zipped up it can be heavy and cumbersome so plan your trips well maybe this bag for <unk> stuff and a smaller one for the immediate <unk> of wallets , <unk> , cell and so on i think this bag is one of the best deals i have found on amazon
i am quite happy with my purchase i was looking for a professional work and school bag that could hold a laptop and books , as well as pass of as a purse , and it has exceeded my expectations this is a smart purchase
i wish i could return it it 's definitely not for constant use i 'm a college student and even though it 's spacious , it 's not sturdy the patch or buckle on the pockets fell off on the first week <unk> up the front pockets its time consuming and awkward the buckle also fell off on the second wee and the zipper gets stuck i would n't recommend it
very nice looking for my son at <unk> nice and wide bottom for books ... lost # star for latches on front pockets -lrb- rather <unk> -rrb- and lost # star for laptop compartment -lrb- could have thicker padding
it was a lot bigger than i expected and some of the things ripped off ... ii 've only had it for almost a month other than that , it 's been holding up very well and i love the bag i carry around school and it looks sturdy -lrb-
i bought another bag from the same company for my younger daughter , and it 's proven to be a piece of junk that i 've wasted my money on this one , however , seems to be in much better shape and the craftsmanship is much better nice bag , perfect for older teens that carry everything from class to class
it 's perfect size for a laptop or in this case for a new high school student who has to carry lots of books my bf 's # year old daughter loved it because it was cute and fit everything she needs
i really really love it excellent materials , the dimensions are perfect , the color is the same as the picture and has a very good quality really i recommend this bag , has a lot of sections , for my laptop , hard disk , books , <unk> notepad , for my ipad , etc . i love it
this product is a couple of centimeters to short for the cover the keyboard does n't fit properly and it took forever to be shipped to me i am not very happy with this product also everything smells like rubber and it 's very strong
the case did not fit my new macbook pro which is # inches , when i got the case i tried to put it on and the case was too small
i asked for a <unk> - paid return label . but it was refused they said i ordered the wrong size for my model the ordering process was not very clear as far as the model type
when i received this , i notified the sender that the case they sent was the wrong size i sent it back several weeks ago and am still waiting for its ' replacement at this point , i am sure they are not sending me a new one . :
the bottom case has a very fragile piece of plastic that breaks very easy i was able to continue to use the case but the piece that broke would get snagged on things very easily so i finally had to stop using it
the case was the wrong size for my mac , even though i checked the specifications i returned before i had any true experience with it i did notice that the sleeve was cheaply made , but the keyboard cover seemed to work
the quality is not the best of course , you are paying only # for this whole set however , the case is very protective since it is rubberized , much better than the speck from best buy i am happy with it , and the colors are completely accurate
everything was great except the hard case it was too small and would n't fit even though i have the macbook # in so i 'll have to order another hard case other than that i love the color and the mouse is super cute
the screen protector was slightly too big so i was n't able to use it unless i cut off about # mm but i should n't have to also the mouse is cheaply made and broke while in my bag that only had my pro and <unk> stick in it other than those two problems everything else works and fits just fine
