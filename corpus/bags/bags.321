i love the unique shape , it fits my # inch macbook perfectly - and snug with just enough padding i love the color and bottom line , the price on amazon beat out everywhere else
the cover is great for my macbook pro # `` laptop the color was a bit darker than the picture shows , but it 's still a gorgeous color at first i thought the design was to quirky for my tastes , but i find that it 's really helpful in <unk> my laptop overall , great purchase
the product was not the size advertised on amazon it was advertised as large enough for a netbook when in fact it is the size for a # & # # ; tablet i think it would work fine for a tablet but that is not what i bought it for it was not worth the cost and effort of returning it since it came from china
this sleeve is nice , but it is truly not child resistant my children got mine dirty and now it has a hole in it as well need something more child resistant because this tablet is for the children
the pictures make it appear that there is a red lining , making the sleeve reversible either way it is black with a little red piping the fit on a # inch <unk> with a six cell battery is tight with a nine cell it is impossible however , for less than $ # , which includes shipping , it is ok
it 's much too big for an acer iconia tab # . # a # , and too big to fit a # `` netbook but it fits an # . # `` acer netbook just perfect this one was bought from blue mall
my husband had to wash it three times and hang it outside on the porch it fits great , but <unk> the fumes were terribly <unk> the one i bought from a local store needed no such handling you need a gas <unk> for this one that came from <unk> ! lol
it did not fit my lenovo s # s netbook but i gave it to my dad since it fit his # inch tablet the quality is actually nice for the price but the only flaw is that there is no clip or velcro to keep the flap close
it 's kind of small , however , it does add protection to my # . # `` netbook no room for the cord either i do n't know how a # . # `` would fit i have a lenovo and the back is bulky this may make a difference no zippers so you have stretch it to insert the netbook
they sent me a sleeve without the red lining what i received is not what they have pictured barely fits my asus transformer with charging dock ... should 've spent more on a sleeve that has a zipper
it 's nice and it fits my tablet has a very strong rubber scent , and it came in the package folded in half - so now my sleeve has a line across the middle otherwise , nice and cheap
like the concept of this case bought this for my nook hd + not a totally snug fit the case is about an inch too big on the narrower dimension provides a moderate level of protection for the nook around the home and office
pretty good quality for such a low price i would give # stars if only it had a place to put a usb flash drive , other than that , it 's perfect . i highly recommend
it talks about it being reversible for a different look well mine could be reversed but it is the same black with red trim i thought it would be red with black on the other side no new look but can be reversed it is high quality and fits the # . # `` very well i am pleased with quality and size but the reversible part of description it misleading
item came by mail from hong kong in about a week it is fits snug on a # . # `` gateway overall , i got what i wanted and it was delivered in a timely fashion
i bought this for my toshiba netbook it keeps <unk> and dust off my netbook great but you do have to <unk> the flap a little to get it on but it makes for a snug fit
i fly internationally quite regularly and i travel very light i use an asus netbook as i prefer a real keyboard and it is fast enough for me to do just about any project , watch a video , and check things out online with this case i feel like my netbook is safe in my <unk> bag it also makes airport security easy as i do n't have to remove it from this pouch one buckle opened on my <unk> bag , the laptop goes in the tray , and i 'm on my way
pretty much a perfect fit for the new asus transformer prime with the dock the tablet alone fits inside , with a little wiggle room with the dock is a snug fit i just got the new transformer prime with the keyboard dock needed some protection for it , thought i would try this since it 's pretty cheap after seeing some reviews for it i thought it would be too big , but it 's an almost exact fit it 's a slight stretch to get the top flap over
i bought this along with my tablet months ago the red lining has started to come off at this point , but the rest of it is holding up very well it retains a bit of heat , so my tablet stays warm -lrb- especially when charging -rrb- i take it out and lay it on top of the sleeve to prevent overheating
i bought this for my husband 's ipad the original # st generation it has a cover n this fits perfectly in his sleeve for travel he uses the red
this macbeth laptop sleeve -lrb- <unk> <unk> design -rrb- does n't look as nice as pictured i was very disappointed , as the green is actually this neon yellow-green and it looks terrible with the white there is also no light blue on it as pictured the sleeve decently protects my laptop , but the design looks very cheap because of the coloring i would not have purchased it if the product pictures were actually accurate
design is super cute i wish there were more padding and that it was a tighter fit i feel like my laptop slides around in the sleeve and that it is n't protected well enough good for the price
i have a asus vivobook , it 's # & # # ; screen which means the laptop is # . # & # # ; the fit was pretty tight at first , a struggle to get the zipper shut over the corners but that has improved a little with use though i do tend to find myself leaving it unzippered
i 'm disappointed because there is a flaw in the fabric the pink has <unk> across the cover it looks cheap and horrible it would have been fine had there been some quality control in not selling defective cases
the measurements are more like around # by # inches a little too big for my # . # dell laptop but the pattern is really cute , i got the leopard and pink one
bought this thinking it would be little more heavy , but it still protects my laptop i would n't use this if i transported my laptop a lot there 's no place to keep the power charger
my # . # inch lenovo yoga notebook would not fit in this case plus , the padding is really light , which means that you ca n't carry put it in your backpack without the possibility of the laptop getting banged up by other books and day to day travel otherwise , the colors were nice and vibrant , and for someone who travels with a laptop <unk> or does not carry much stuff , this would be a good case
i ordered this sleeve for my work laptop this sleeve is way bigger than expected i can put my # & # # ; laptop in it and there is still room i would recommend getting something smaller if you have a # & # # ; laptop i gave it three stars because it is cute
i love colour , its fun to own one , but i accidentally bought the sleeve i was planning to buy a laptop acer , but put the sleeve on my wishlist so now i owned a nice sleeve without laptop the next step a laptop but it fun to look at it
i like this little bag if you will , idk what to call it , not really a carrying case but a nice little zip up storage to protect my laptop . perhaps a jacket ? and its very cute
brightly colored and affordable , this is a nice little case it has a decent zipper and fits my laptop well as advertised the padding is a bit thin so i left the styrofoam that shipped with the laptop inside the case
i bought this for my gateway laptop , which though it is a # . # inch , is really longer than a usual # . # this sleeve fits my laptop perfectly and thus far has prevented damage very well i 've used it in backpacks and duffle bags without issue the quality is the same as when i bought it , except from where a friends cat took an interest
its a little bit too big for my macbook pro # & # # ; , just for anyone who reads reviews about the product before they buy them i allows room for you to carry some things with it a couple of junk drives , cds , or dvd 's , even a notebook or calendar the product looks exactly like the picture not too thick , but enough , especially if you are going to carry it within another bag , like a book bag
very fair price for what you get i wish the fabric was thicker so it 'd protect more , but its still good and does it 's job good quality , all the stitching seems really strong the colours are a little more <unk> and <unk> as opposed to shades of brown , but i like it that way good piece , would be hard to find a better deal
this is a nice cover for my daughter 's lap top she needed something to protect her laptop while <unk> it in her backpack for college it fits the bill and is also fashionable
i bought this for my toshiba # . # & # # ; laptop and it fits perfectly i 'm not sure if there is enough space to hold all the cords , but it can at least hold a mouse and mouse pad i love the pattern , it is super bright and fun it had a weird <unk> smell when i first got it , but it faded after a few days i would recommend this case for anyone who has a widescreen laptop
i purchased this sleeve for my hp laptop -lrb- knowing that it was a bit larger than i needed -rrb- , but it matched the sleeve that i have for my ipad # so it worked the description reads `` <unk> <unk> `` by the product i received was of the `` macbeth collection `` ; which , again , did n't bother me since i have the macbeth collection for my ipad # overall , i would recommend this product for its style and lightness given the opportunity , i can say with <unk> that i would once again purchase this <unk> just wish that the description would have been correct from the <unk> so i could have purchased it sooner
i got this today and i love it fits my # . # inch hp perfectly the only thing is that it looks more blue and green on the screen , but it 's more blue and yellow-green in person
i am highly satisfied with this product it works perfect for a # . # `` computer , it still have a little more room so your computer is not squished in it also it is a bright color and i love it :
perfect fit to my laptop and the feature picture matches the actual design cushion is of a good thickness , however , there is little structure to the sleeve if that 's what you are looking for i am very pleased with it and think it is perfect if you plan to place it in another carrier for transport due to the extra protection additional structure would provide no room for any wires or accessories if that 's what you also expect i am very pleased all around - my expectation of a stylish sleeve with decent cushioning was met
decent case for the price it 's a little brighter than it looks in the picture , but it looks good the neoprene is nice and think and will definitely keep a laptop dry if you spill on it or something in a bag zipper is also fairly substantial i 've been using this for about a month and i 'm really happy with it ... especially for the price
love the <unk> print , which has caught some attention around the office would be good if it fit my # . # inch dell a little tighter but seems a good sturdy item which should offer some extra protection for my laptop while it travels around inside my shoulder bag and backpack
this case looks awesome , but it 's super thin and doesnt actually provide much padding it 's fine for just basically <unk> your computer from getting dusty but it certainly wouldnt be travel worthy if you just want a fun funky case this is very nice looking , but dont buy this for <unk>
this is a cute way to carry my lenovo laptop it 's a simple yet functional design i recommend this product the only things i would improve would be if the zipper was a little larger - the teeth are fairly small and i am concerned about their wearing out over time it would be nice if this had a small outside pocket , but that is n't a standard feature on a sleeve
fit my laptop very well is very cute and protects my computer from getting scratched in my backpack i wish there was a little more padding on the case
this sleeve is exactly what i was looking for the colors are true to the picture shown it is not really padded , so it definitely will not protect from a serious fall but if your like me and just needed some light protection to slip into my backpack for college , it 's perfect it fits my hp <unk> # . # inch well there is no extra room for a charger , just my laptop it does stretch some overall , just what i wanted for a much cheaper price
this is a really cute case fits my # inch laptop perfectly with a little room to spare , but not too much keeps my laptop protected i have had to run out to my car from class several times in the pouring rain and it never got wet ! ! ! great case , highly reccommend
i just love the color , the length is perfect for my laptop , it came in timely manner and i just really like the selections they carry i would recommend this product if you want to spice up your armor for your electronic products
looked better than pictured in the image , and i was pleased at the quality of the laptop sleeve i 'm very happy with it the # . # inch fits the macbook perfectly and will even fit if you have additional rubber casing around your laptop
item arrived fast and is nice quality for the money i am buying a second one as a gift it keeps my lap top safe when i travel or just for storage
this is the prettiest laptop sleeve there is it is a little small , so i only recommend it if you have a skinny laptop i have a samsung series # and the sleeve fits beautifully i love the material , which seems to be protecting my laptop really well , the zippers work perfectly , and the design is exactly as the picture i highly recommend it
i needed a simple sleeve , with just a little color to it , for my laptop this one delivered it 's made very well , the padding is plush enough that i feel secure having my laptop inside , and it 's gorgeous i 've gotten lots of compliments on it and i highly recommend it
i brought this item for college to put my dell inspiron # in it i was of course unsure of it fitting but it is the perfect size and do gorgeous and vivid the picture does it no justice i love it
love this case , bought it for my # `` # inch compaq presario cq # laptop , its just a little lose but not a big deal and it looks just like the
the laptop sleeve is not only stylish but protects my laptop from getting scratched it 's even got a cleaning cloth <unk> which is pretty handy if wanting to clean you screen
this macbeth collection laptop sleeve was exactly what i was looking for it was the perfect size to fit my laptop and such a great price for the nice design it was
i like it it definitely keeps my laptop dry when it rains and in my backpack i like leopard prints and a hot pink that looks purple to me . purple is my fave color so this is ideal for me in terms of style and print as well as protecting my laptop from getting wet it is a good way for me to protect and <unk> my laptop in style good price for i received i would recommend it i only have had it in my possession for a month and i used it once to head outdoors with laptop so far
i was definitely looking for a sleeve that was pretty and durable and i think this means my requirements and can fit my macbook with the case protector in it
this sleeve is great if you do n't need a strong case for complete protection i bought this for extra cushion in my book bag i just needed to protect from scuffs and shuffling it around in my bag , not to protect from drops or dings the macbeth sleeve is perfect for what i need , and the colors are vibrant and stylish also , the neoprene is cushion enough for my needs it came with a <unk> piece inside the sleeve for shipping , i kept this inside to provide extra cushion
this sleeve is both cute and fashionable it is a perfect fit for my moms hp laptop i got her for christmas she loves it it protects her laptop from getting marks from scratches and dings
i love love love this ! i decided to buy # and the colors and materials are so beautiful ... just great ... the leopard design brings a tiny little fabric -lrb- i do n't know the real name -rrb- for cleaning your laptop
so soft and pretty ! : -rrb- i bought this sleeve to fit my # . # `` dell laptop , and it fits perfectly it does n't provide extra padding , but it 'll help prevent scratches for sure so i recommend using this along with a padded laptop <unk>
a # . # laptop such as a lenovo y # will not fit into the side compartment as pictured it will -lrb- barely -rrb- fit into the main compartment the product seems fine otherwise , but i would recommend it only for laptops smaller than # . # inches
i received my brenthaven in a timely fashion there is a pouch for everything you need my macbook pro # & # # ; fits like a baby with soft fur <unk> it inside there 's space for my ipad , mouse , power supply , pens , my iphone and even my external cd drive the only thing is i do n't like is i think everything fits a little too snug i would have like it if they had made it just a little wider but maybe i 'm just pushing for perfection that 's why i gave it # stars all in all it 's made of high quality stuff and i would definitely recommend this to anyone
excellent product : good construction , extremely light ; however , not as protective as the prostyle <unk> not too much available space , but good enough to carry your laptop , power adapter , tablet , mouse , some other small items excellent choice for light traveling with style and a good level of protection for your computer
good looking bag , excellent quality easily holds a small laptop and a tablet at the same time while still having room for a writing pad , pen , papers , business cards , etc . i especially like the super soft material that <unk> the separate compartments for the tablet and the laptop with some more small pockets for better organization this case would have earned # stars
a very good product i am quite happy with this product , i purchased it for my husband for his laptop and he too is very pleased with it , but bulky and looks very professional
the brenthaven prostyle lite # is an excellent buy detailed craftsmanship , with structural elegance this is my third brenthaven briefcase only because my laptop keeps getting smaller the two prior purchases are still in use by family or friend
this is a great case and deserves the top rating i would highly recommend it to anyone who wants to wants to carry a laptop , ipad , and papers all in one case
i used to have a the metro # backpack and was hoping that this would be a replacement however this one is slightly narrower and the pockets may not be as useful as before
a good backpack though not of the same quality as the previous ogio metro i own materials seem less substantial , zippers flimsier and only one <unk> exterior pockets not as large as before still a good unit but ogio took a step backwards and made some obvious cost savings design changes to the metro ii compared to the original metro
very well made , lived up to expectations , material quality - excellent seller was exceptional as well in use now by freshman year college student outstanding room , but not at all bulky and hard to handle
this replaced a ogio metro backpack that withstood daily use for years there was no other choice for me but to purchase another ogio metro and am very pleased and looking forward to another great long-term
very good quality backpack with many pockets . . beautiful and confortable i had just one problem with one <unk> but just push i little bit and it was ok .
the large back compartment easily fits my # & # # ; laptop , it feels well cushioned and it seems to be constructed so that bulky things do n't push onto the screen of the laptop i find it comfortable to wear and it has room for tons fo stuff when i travel i use it as my only carry
every pocket has a purpose and is very useful not just there to be there it also fits well in the overhead in an airplane i really like the soft interior for electronics
i bought this for my husband as a contemporary replacement for his samsonite work bags it is pretty slim so does n't hold more than a book and some newspapers but it looks clean and streamlined it 's held up well for # months so far
i would n't use this on campus for my books or anything heavy but for running around the city it 's perfect enough room for reading material , gadgets , change of clothes etc to get you through the next # hours i 've worn it around a few times and no scratches or damage to the material so far and it looks nicer than some of my more casual canvas messenger bags the only complaint is it 's a little stiff ; a little more flexibility when i 'm moving around would have made this perfect
i needed a new day bag for everyday use and got this <unk> <unk> one because i like the <unk> style my prior one had a ton of pockets so i 'm used to <unk> all the items this is the only drawback with the bag there 's one main compartment with one small zippered pocket inside for important papers , and one outside pocket with no zipper because the outside pocket has no zipper i do n't use that one but it holds basic daily necessities ie . ipod , smartphone , lunch , paperwork and a sweater no prob fact is if you 're buying this bag it 's because you prefer style over functionality so i 'm very pleased with it dudes with <unk> bags mainly look like dorks roll into the office with this one and you 're looking good
i am not even exaggerating when i say that this is the perfect bag i have a <unk> <unk> one about the same size , but i prefer this <unk> <unk> one now because of the material , sturdiness , and compartments inside
this item did not fit my mac airbook as promised it will cost # % of the purchase price to return it i feel it is <unk> to back for the return shipping when the product is not the size as advertised
i ordered this case for my # in macbook air and it was far too large and a darker pink than the one shown in the photo , i regret purchasing this product
i really liked this when i first got it it seemed durable and it looked really nice i 've had it for about # months now and the plastic is starting to crack and break i suggest investing your money in something that is a little better quality
i 'm using the product , but when i close my macbook air , the lid does n't close completely it can be held shut with gentle pressure and has n't presented a real problem for me it 's about # inch space between the lid can the bottom half of the laptop
it 's not the best cover in the world , but i do like the look it kind of gets loose every once in a while and you have to snap it back on
the price is amazing , but the finish is n't really smooth there 's a rough touch to it , but the color is beautiful and it was only $ # ; ca n't really go wrong with that it 's a good buy if you just want to <unk> <unk> a different color for your air
the top part fits perfectly and stays in place the bottom piece fits everywhere except one side of the keyboard it does not snap onto that side i 'm not sure if this case was designed for the newest macbook air or not , so that could be the problem on the bottom piece other than that , i love the case ! the color is really pretty and i like that you can see the apple lit up
i 've had this cover for almost # months i just noticed a tiny crack in the side already it was a bit difficult to get it on i would have preferred a darker purple , but this was all i could find
i have been looking for a clear cover for my air but i could only find frosted covers this cover is a beautiful crystal clear cover that lets the beautiful aluminum of my air show i also have a decal on the back which shows through nicely compared to the frosted cover i had before this one snaps on nice and tight i was a little leery of getting the clear cover as i was n't sure how slick it would be i have no problem carrying it and it does n't easily slip out from my hands
this case is amazing the color is a bit brighter than pictured , but i love it fits good -lrb- i have macbook air # `` mid # -rrb- and i 've ordered a similar case from other seller , twice as expensive , but it looks exactly the same it 's definitely the same product , difference is only in color -lrb- the more expensive one is orange -rrb- the only cons i should mention - a little piece of fastening was broken off when i got the package but it 's <unk> , everything looks and fits good the same problem was with the second case , though both were wrapped in a bubble wrap maybe , i 'm unlucky
this case fitted perfectly my airbook when i received the product it had a little scratch , but i would scratch it myself soon or later , that 's why i did n't return the product back to the case , it comes with both the cover and the bottom parts at first , it was kinda difficult to realize which is the front side and the back side , by starting with the cover but if you start installing the bottom part , the job will be easier moreover , suggest you to clip on the cover firstly by the back side , then the front part this should help you making a perfect install after i did this , the case has been so perfectly fitted to my airbook that now it seems like impossible to be <unk> again well , i wo n't do it anyway i really liked this case
ultimately , i was looking for a backpack that would fit my small frame and this does a good job of it i have received compliments on the style not too bulky and carries my laptop , files , and other essentials the front pocket zipper was broken when it arrived which is a disappointment i can live without it , but it would be nice to use since it 's there
overall it 's a very nice , comfortable backpack amazon wont let me return it , though , and i do n't know why so it looks like i 'm keeping the sky blue one i would definitely rather have my chosen color than have this company choose it for me
i use it as a brief case to take <unk> papers on public transportation daily compute i works fine it looks fine if you do n't look too closely ok value for the money
i like the bag a lot it is compact and holds two big textbooks and two # & # # ; binders with paper . i will say that if i want to transport my laptop i will have to carry the binders . . but thats no sweat off my <unk> and all happy <unk> my
i thought it would be made out of leather but it is just made out of regular backpack material the buckles are made out of leather though because it is not leather the style sort of goes away and it is too simple for me however it seems sturdy and big enough to fit everything i 'll need for school it would be fine for someone who likes plain and simple things but that 's not me so i 'm returning it
i had intended to use it for school but it is a bit too big , it should be very useful for short weekend trips though or as a large carry on on an airplane
i 'm updating a previous review i wrote at first when i got it the backpack the zipper in the front was broken the seller immediately emailed me and helped me figure out how to fix it the backpack is really cute and fits my shoulders perfectly , which is hard to find for a petite lady like myself now that the zipper is fixed i 'm really excited to be able to use it again ca n't emphasize enough how nice the seller was about it , even giving me a percentage refunded to my account for my troubles
i love this backpack ! ! i bought it for school , as i start college in the fall i 've not yet put it to use , but i did a test run by filling it with some of my heaviest books it has quite a bit of room in it my only concern is that i question if the straps will stay strong enough to last me my days lugging around heavy textbooks , they seem a bit thin but as a laptop bag i know it will be perfect stylish and prompt shipping are major bonuses !
i bought the navy blue and brown one and i love it i have only been using it for about a month now , but it is holding up great it has plenty of room and i feel like my laptop is safe
