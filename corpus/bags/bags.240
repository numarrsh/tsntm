bought this for my net book i travel as a flight attendant and broke my previous net book you do not have to take laptop out at airport security and thats a plus just yank the case out of your bag toss it in a bin and send it through i am <unk> rough with my flight bag and so far this has kept my netbook <unk> along i also like it because i can pull it out of my backpack and stuff it under the car seat if i do n't want to take it with me
perfect design , it is the best protection for the asus # love it , a must have accessory ! ! it does look like a purse though when it is zipped up does n't bother me but it might bother some
i 'm a graduate student and i got this bag , because i wanted something professional looking and decently sized because i carry around a lot of stuff including a # . # inch laptop and charger it fits my computer without a case plus a textbook , my planner and a notebook i can put my phone in the side pocket i wish it was just a little but bigger because i still usually end up carrying something in my arms it is absolutely beautiful in the <unk> and i get compliments on it from a lot of the girls in my
i got this bag as an upgrade to my canvas tote i had used for about # years <unk> styled , it goes with every outfit and i get compliments on this tote almost daily it 's large enough -lrb- but not overwhelming -rrb- for my toshiba portege r # -lrb- # & # # ; -rrb- , power cord , wallet , mouse , keys , and a couple of note books i love the side and interior pockets for glasses , badges , pens , etc . the leather is firm but not <unk> so it seems extremely durable so far i just do n't have anything negative to say about this bag it 's met all of my expectations and more
fits my laptop and other work related items straps are long and fits great over my shoulder bag is roomier than i thought , and has great compartments and straight attractive lines
this bag is advertised as leather but when it arrived just days before it was to make its <unk> as a christmas gift , it was patent leather i was <unk> it looks like something from a five and dime
this is a nice item , and the built in padded laptop case is good the tote is structured and it will keep it shape over time , i believe unfortunately , the padded case does not fit a <unk> laptop i have a # . # & # # ; ultra book -- which is a small laptop by most standards -- and it does not fit the padded case it will fit down one side but that 's not padded and not intended for a device the padded case does fit my surface & my netbook though , but neither of these devices are considered laptops what good is a laptop case that does n't fit a laptop this tote does double as a ladies briefcase or professional tote , if you 're looking for something along those lines
the bag arrived looking exactly as promised , both my personal laptop and my work laptop fit inside nicely it manages to hold several folders and a legal pad in addition to the laptop i wish it were a bit more flexible so i could stuff more into it , but it does exactly what i need it to
i love this bag it 's professional and made quite well it 's disappointing that i and others have pointed out that it does n't fit a # . # `` laptop in the middle padded sleeve as advertised it may only fit a # `` if that one design flaw could be fixed it would be an excellent laptop bag as a work around i have to put my laptop in the other side area it still works but does n't function as advertised do n't let that deter you if you are looking for a classy bag nothing beats the look the function could be better around the inner laptop section is the only non-functional piece
i was in the market for a laptop tote i wanted to have a polished look for my new job i am out in the field most of the time , and i am doing a lot of traveling on airplanes this tote is almost perfect for what i need it for my only issue is i wish it was a tad bit bigger i would like it to hold a bit more , but i can fit my macbook air , a binder , files , a small wallet , and all my chords the other thing i wish this had is more compartments for the chords i have them all stuffed in the side zippered compartment , and it would be useful if i could organize them , so i 'm not always digging for the correct chord all in all , i really like this bag , and am happy with my purchase so far i have been using it steadily for a month now
wish it was lighter darker than pictured and i got it in the sand color hoping to match a coach purse and my phone case it appears to be <unk> in the picture but it is darker fits my laptop which is # & # # ;
my laptop and my files for work fit great in this bag padding offers great protection for computer it 's easy to carry with nice pockets good quality and color is true to picture have received many compliments
having just bought the # `` macbook pro , i really wanted to find a stylish bag to carry it in that turned out to be a lot harder than i expected according to <unk> 's description , my macbook pro # `` would be too large for this bag however , i took a gamble , and ordered it anyways my macbook fits in the <unk> like a glove the bag is made of high quality leather , and looks very professional
this is a beautifully constructed bag and the leather is wonderful and it appears to be able to withstand some wear and tear however the four stars instead of five is really due to my <unk> because it was too small for my laptop i would have kept it but i had to send it back in exchange for something i could use i definitely would have kept it if my laptop had fit though because it is a well-made and sharp looking bag
the bag is very light i have room for my laptop , <unk> and the front pocket is good for your phone , wallet etc . i travel weekly and the bag has kept up
this bag is great for a commuter , it has two large pocket in front and plenty of room on the inside , also fits my mini laptop with ease only downfall iit us a bit heavy because it is leather , but has handles & long enough strap to wear <unk> across chest
purchased for my wife who is a professor at a university very professional and very classy leather bag very well made and very functional my wife loves it and people ask her about the bag all the time
this briefcase style purse is gorgeous and is very well made i have the sand colored patent leather one it is roomy without being too huge i am an attorney and it does fit legal size documents various outside pouches for easy access i think that this brand is the more `` <unk> `` branch of mcklein
i bought this to give as a gift it is a very beautiful bag . buyers be aware that there are different sizes and check them before you buy sad that they do n't have the interior organizer pockets anymore but outer pocket has organizer pockets , which will do good very stylish and good quality
nice bag with the perfect amount of space fit my macbook , ipad , # folders , and a book front pocket is great too slots for pens , a pocket which i used for phone , <unk> , and charger , and more space for misc the large bag that was sent by mistake was too big but the medium is perfect i use the shoulder strap and it has a nice grip so that it that does n't slide love the red
i purchased this sleeve to add some extra protection for my # . # `` mbp when stowing it in my timbuk # messenger bag the timbuk # leaves a bit to be desired when it comes to padding in the notebook compartment , so i felt this to be cheap insurance against any <unk> the sleeve is well-constructed and feels nice to the touch with the microfiber inner and outer surfaces the interior elastic provides added assurance that the sleeve will not <unk> ways from the notebook accidentally , and definitely prevents the notebook from slipping out when handling the case while unzipped the fitment is very tight , which is good for protection , but also leaves the possibility of the zippers marring up the surface of your notebook you 'll just need to be a bit more careful of the zippers when <unk> your computer there is n't a ton of padding on this sleeve , so if you are looking for something as a primary mode of transport for your notebook , you should consider other options overall i 'm happy with the purchase , and definitely recommend this sleeve for anyone considering something extra for their timbuk # bag - the fitment in the bag 's notebook compartment is perfect
great addition for a macbook what else can be said about this product if you like your notebook in a zippered sleeve with a protector that folds over the notebook and protects your computer from the zipper than this is the product for you i should not have to write a # words long review for a product that works
i ordered this item a while back -- with my first mbp i think i thought i 'd lost it so i was just about to order another , when the first showed up the cover fits snugly and adds very little weight the zippers are kept away from the aluminum by a fabric covered seam -lrb- does not snag . it also has a great elastic cover on the inside to stop the unit from slipping out i put this in my shoulder bag to carry to work each day and when i travel -lrb- a lot . the microfiber holds the unit in the bag as it is lined with corduroy and does not easily slip out a great item
i ordered this bag but they sent a different one from the picture it was the same make but did n't have the pockets and storage the one in the picture has they gave me a refund but i would have liked to have the bag in the picture they still have the wrong picture up
ok , so there is another review pointing out that what they ship does n't match what is in the picture , which is true there are only two pockets on the front , not three , so there is n't quite as much storage room my biggest complaint is that the bag is very narrow , so it does n't stand up when you put it down there also does n't appear to be any room for files inside i have n't used it yet , the quality looks good , there are a lot of pockets , but where do you put your files or note pad zipping it open and putting it on the belt at the tsa checkpoint looks like a nice feature , but i 'm not sure how much time it will realy save it just saves you from having to grab another bin and taking it out of the case will be <unk> it over the next few weeks , i 'll be on # differnt flights
i was actually looking for a bag suited for my # `` netbook and ended up buying this instead the difference came down to quality , the netbook tsa bags cost half as much and there was always something off about them the <unk> is with the lengths the manufacturers go to be tsa friendly , you end with not much additional cargo space because the pouches do n't overlap also the velcro strap is wide enough to secure my # `` netbook from sliding out the side of the pouch i now have a great tsa friendly bag that can carry my # `` thinkpad or my # `` acer <unk> and securely
i purchased this check-point friendly bag for a recent trip to mexico i was able to unzip it , flip it open like a book , place it on the scanner belt and go right through without removing the laptop i had no problems at security in either country i do n't know if it really saved me that much time , but it was easier , felt more organized and i had less concern about not getting my computer back on the other side the bag is nicely made and looks like it will last a long while the `` <unk> `` strap was more comfortable than i had expected the only negative is that i could have used a little more storage space
i 'm a fan of case logic for its durable and <unk> products but i was a little bit disappointed by this item while the bag itself was well crafted , the strap 's edge were rough that it left scratch marks on my clothing e.g . , <unk> , wool jackets another thing that i <unk> is that the velcro inside the side pocket of the bag were not well stitched the stitching eventually broke from normal use i have a case logic messenger bag which i 've been using for # years now and the velcro stitching in it does n't show signs of breakage unlike this item
bought this for my new asus # ha # . # `` netbook if i were to only carry the netbook and its power supply -lrb- along with accessories such as cell phone , biz cards , etc -rrb- , this case would be fine - very nice size & lightweight yes , the strap is a bit cheesy , but not a real problem however , if i include my cordless mouse , the bag bulges i had also wanted to carry my new slim-line <unk> drive in this bag , but , again , the bag bulges so much that its compactness & ergonomics are <unk> my netbook came with its own <unk> sleeve , which i 'd like to use for added protection however , the netbook wo n't fit in this bag if i keep it in its sleeve the bag itself is nice , i just should 've have bought the next size up
i got this bag for my ipad and it 's been perfect i have a very slim case on my device and the bag zips around it perfectly those with large padded leather cases may find it too tight i was able to get my kindle dx in it but had to remove my <unk> leather case
this could have been the perfect bag except my asus eee pc # ha -lrb- # inch netbook -rrb- just barely fits especially with the sleeve on there is n't a great deal of padding so i wanted the extra protection with the sleeve but as far as pockets and its design it is the best bag i have ever come across they call this the mid size -lrb- ? -rrb- unfortunately the next size up -lrb- or any other bag they make -rrb- is completely different it has a shoulder strap but does n't have a handle which i find i use quite often i think they realized that at the last minute and tried to add one to the strap - sorry that just does n't cut it it really is a great bag - just wish it were about # to # larger
bought this bag for my asus eee pc # overall it 's a great bag for travel - like its vertical design , light weight - easily fits power adapter , and other small gadgets like cellphone , ipod , mobile harddrive - # outside pockets , one with velcro closure , one with magnet , and one with zipper - the strap looks a bit weird but it works - wo n't fit if you put the netbook in the sleeve that came with asus without the sleeve it 's a perfect fit - the main compartment could use more padding and smoother interior material if it 's meant for a netbook without using a sleeve
i purchased this bag for my husband after reading hundreds of reviews , i decided on this one my husband is old school and still carries a daytimer not yet into the blackberry it was a <unk> day gift , and at first he did not like it thought it was too big , not fitting him right etc . but after a few days he <unk> up to it and loves it has taken it on two business trips , so all his important essentials fit in the bag i gave it a # star because he said he wishes the shorter handle was easier to get his hand in to carry because many times he <unk> ' t use the long strap other than that it is a great man bag , and now i see more men with bags then ever i think it would be a great bag for a woman as well
i bought this case for my ipad and it works great nice padded compartment and a few compartments for the charger , cleaning cloth , pens etc . it is small and easy to tote around and the price is much lower than some of the `` made for ipad `` bags there is some room for the ipad to move so when i get the otterbox defender case , it should fit perfectly in this bag also the case is simple and does n't scream `` i 'm carrying a valuable ipad in here `` the quality of the bag is very good as well
i use this bag for my netbook it works great , carries a lot of stuff and makes carry on through the airport easy it packs small and holds lots of stuff never a second look through security it fits either my dell mini # or dell mini # , a travel mouse , power adapters , and misc cables , adapters , etc . . built quality seems suspect i 've had two of these bags , one had an inside zippered pocket the other did n't it 's a great travel bag for a netbook and a space to keep you boarding pass , tickets , and loose papers tsa does n't make you take out laptop computers under # `` , so this just goes straight through xray without even a second look great for <unk> travel , i can fit a weeks work of clothes , plus this bag inside my <unk> <unk> and carry-on a single piece of lugged for an entire week trip
i had the big <unk> bag and i bought this one as a substitute and love both but as soon as the new one dies it will be the end of the <unk> <unk> they do not produce them anymore they are roomy yet compact lots of special well fitted pockets and a good durable design
i use this case for my ipad , canon g # and assorted attachments the case is structurally sound , looks and feels good while i 'm walking around and seems to be the perfect <unk> case for many uses
we recently purchased a dell mini- # `` <unk> computer , and wanted a good case to protect it and make it easily <unk> there are n't many out , and while this case was a little pricey , the price , as it has been said - is forgotten long after the quality is remembered it 's a perfect size for these computers , has a pocket for accessories -lrb- wireless mouse -rrb- and the strap is perfect in execution i simply love this case
purchased this bag to carry my ipad it is perfect for that purpose plus holds a lot more items such as pens , notepads , keys , cell phone , etc . keeps everything organized and it it 's proper place does not look like a girls bag
i ordered this bag # months ago and i 'm really happy with it my ipad fits perfectly and is well protected inside the bag has plenty of useful compartments to store a small hard drive , your iphone , pens and some business cards the strap is comfortable and long giving the bag a cool <unk> look
this ` case ' has no handles or shoulder straps it 's more of a <unk> cushioned liner than a case you 'll have to buy another case if you want to carry it anywhere , so what 's the point
i bought this cover as an accessory to my purchase of a sony vaio aw laptop , which is the monster size laptop in their offering it is pretty functional in providing lightweight protection do n't believe that this cover is a replacement for a carry case ; it is n't typically a carry case will be thicker and provide handles and a strap given that the aw series is really a desktop replacement and not intended to be a real lightweight pc , this cover works as long as you intend to keep the laptop at home the power cable case is also useful and you can fit a mouse in there as well overall , a decent case , but make sure you know what you are buying it for
basic and useful used as an extra liner when put in a traditional notebook case , provides additional layer of bump and scratch protection to a big hardware , software and data investment my pc pretty well fills this sideways edge to edge , but does n't quite fill this <unk> , which turns out to be useful , given the layout of the targus <unk> # case i use the bit of extra fabric is useful for grabbing and pulling the machine out of <unk> opening without risk of fumbling and dropping it back down into the slot or scratching it on the case 's zippers if the pc is n't being used for a while , protects from dust , fingerprints , spills a good product
fits my aw like a glove laptop dropped once -lrb- not my doing -rrb- and the case withstood most of the blow and barely got a scratch on it too bad the adapter case isnt attached to the laptop case , makes it slightly annoying to carry around , but the aw isnt really a laptop to be carried around anyway very good price as well
... it turns out that these basic strapless sleeves are kinda useful i use it to protect my huge acer laptop while i schlep it around in a large laptop backpack it keeps the laptop separate from all of the other items -lrb- peripherals and the like -rrb- in the same pocket in the backpack
i bought an # . # `` acer # -lrb- a $ # bargain , btw -rrb- and found me trying to find a case for it the acer is about a quarter inch longer and wider than the comparable vaio this is the only case i found on amazon that has a chance i took the chance and it fits the acer perfectly the accessory pouch fits acer 's power <unk> as well it might <unk> a little weird to pull out an acer from a vaio case a much smaller # `` belkin case -lrb- without accessory pouch -rrb- was selling for the same price the choice was clear for me
case arrived two days early with all listed components included i ordered this case with the sony simply to keep the surfaces as clean and scratch free as possible however , for travel you will need a much more substantial and rugged
i bought this because it said it would fit a # `` laptop mine measures # `` diagonal , # `` in width the computer laptop compartment will not accept my laptop this is false advertising it will fit in the pack , however it wo n't be protected , like it would if it was in the laptop compartment <unk> this would be a great pack
we purchased this for a friend for christmas it was so much better priced than the ones on post our friend loves it , and has had several requests for the same bag from his coworkers !
this is my second of this type laptop case it has pockets for my backup hard drive , iphone , all my cables and my # `` pavilion fits perfect with # `` x # `` files i had my first for two years and it was awesome i ordered another so i would have a replacement for my old one incase a zipper or something breaks the new one seems to be made of lighter material in some places that leads me to think it may be a chinese `` knock-off `` . at # the price of my first one , i still recommend it hopefully , it will last
i bought this for my son for high school at his school they all have # `` mac books and this fits perfectly also in any # quarter he has # large thick text books so far there has n't been any noticeable wear only # stars because it does n't have a chest strap for even more support there are also several useful pockets and
i bought a fancy $ # laptop computer recently and it lasted me about # months before the straps broke i purchased this bag from best buy way back and i was happy so purchased again
i bought a very large targus notebook backpack for something like a # or # inch notebook and it seemed too big for daily use i bought this one next and its perfect it hauls my work notebook back and forth every day , and is n't too big or bulky comfortable even when i have to through walk downtown and catch a bus home
this is actually my # nd one as i wore the first one out after about # years of heavy use in that time it carried everything from laptops , electronics , and clothes to heavy groceries when the last one died i tried several others as none of my local stores carried this backpack but they could n't compare to the targus so back they went i 've had the new one for around # months and all is good if history <unk> it self i have another # and a half years left of good use and knowing me it will get every bit of use possible out of it in that time
targus is a brand i trust , and i was sad to replace my last targus bag after # years it got me through high school , college and new <unk> , and i 'm sure this one will do just as well
this backpack is great i had it for a year now and this backpack has not rip not one bit this backpack has plenty of pockets where you can place numerous of things i have no complaint nor wishes it 's a great backpack and worth the money , you wo n't regret this buy ! !
first , the order came in very fast and second the bag works perfect when traveling at the security check point at the airport , my laptop could stay in the bag , no more taking it out all the pockets inside are very handy too <unk> : i love this bag
this is a great bag looking forward to using it on my upcoming trip plenty of room , great quality construction . the title says `` roller `` , but there are n't any wheels , so if you want a wheeled bag , this is n't it i really like the strap on the back to slip over your luggage handle
i am a heavy business traveler always running through airports and tossing this bag <unk> of rental cars , constantly this bag has held up great it 's been rained on , <unk> on , slammed into airplane bins and had luggage slammed onto it
if there were no stars i 'd give it a <unk> this bag ripped the first time i used it the seam on one side of the zipper panel and the bag was n't crammed full very poor quality i 'd like to return it , but it seems way to hard to do
i bought this handbag because it gets # stars i gave it # star because it is too heavy it weighs # . # lbs by itself also the exterior was made of black heavy denim and the cell phone case is too small it is too expensive , $ # . # value looks like $
really liked the durability of this bag , although it was a bit on the heavy side returned it as the only pockets on this thing are in the two in the front these two pockets are very deep , but the access to them is not flexible so it is hard to do anything but reach your hand in a fish around i need more organization in a bag , and was disappointed that there were no internal pockets to work with <unk> for eco-friendly , large interior , and durability , but i need the bag to fit my organizational needs too
i should have read the description better i take a lot of stuff and do n't need the bag itself to weigh almost four pounds the straps are sturdy but very stiff i 'm probably going to resell it i did n't ask for a return , it was my own fault
it did n't work out for me the bag was quite heavy and difficult to get in and out of the computer sleeve took too much room on the inside i like the overall look no issue with price , seller , or service
i ordered this bag because the reviews said that it could fit a # inch macbook pro and yes , it did it does have wonderful pockets and compartments i bought this because i knew i had to lug around my macbook the whole summer on campus , from one library to another to finish my <unk> while it fit my stuff , i suffered shoulder aches because the bag actually weighs a lot i wish they would upgrade the bag by using lighter materials that would be a # star for me
i really <unk> the roominess of this bag and the pockets on the front however , i purchased the bag in black and it picks up lint like nobody 's business so if you have pets , beware , the fabric is a blessing and a curse while it is durable , it 's not very attractive in darker colors as it attracts every speck of dust , lint , pet hair , etc . it comes in contact with
i do like my bag the only problem i have is that the small pocket zipper is spoiled and considering the bag is new that is surprising but otherwise i like it
i like the product because it is great for storage ... but i used it for a convention and had some notebooks in it and it got so heavy and i didnt have anything really with weight in it by itself it is too heavy for my liking so i am going to be selling it . also the straps are too
this bag is made of a denim like material it is very heavy and very sturdy it is cute and stylish but i find that it is too heavy for long trips
i was expecting a bigger handbag what i got was a bag bigger than my torso it might be good for weekend trips but for everyday no way ... needless to say i returned it
i needed a new computer bag to use when traveling for work i wanted one that also allowed me to store my ipad and other things i need when flying plus still fit under the seat in front of me this one is plenty big enough and fits my computer , ipad and lots of other things a really nice sized bag the only disadvantage to this bag is the appearance it 's not as professional looking as i would have liked and does look a little like a diaper bag -lrb- comments from another review -rrb-
i have a test called the elbow test if i can hold the handles and put my <unk> through the hole to put it up around my shoulder , it passes this one certainly does there is a good amount of room and there is padding on the bottom of the laptop slot which i like the only downside is the fabric it 's made out of : it can attract <unk> it seems pretty sturdy from how much i have used it so far i 'm hoping it will keep it up for the long haul
<unk> , i like and appreciate this tote it is designed well and structurally sound to protect a laptop and tablet it is <unk> spacious to include a couple of folders , computer cables , point and shoot camera , cell phone , and relevant chargers my objection is to the design of the handles which are not adjustable and have limited flexibility these limitations negatively impact the ease of carrying the tote comfortably , especially for a person of relatively small to average stature please consider adjustable handles in the next version
everyone comments on how pretty it is it is roomy and fits my laptop and supplies nicely my only negative comment is that it is heavy even before you put anything in it but it is sturdy and will last a long time
this bag is very well-made and sturdy , with adequate protection for my laptop , and enough space to also carry books and school things however , it was delivered in a beaten box that was torn in a few spots there was lots of tape wrapped around the box , obviously to try to hold it together during shipment the bag was unharmed , but i have never seen such sloppy packaging
prior to purchasing this item i of course read as many reviews as possible , from multiple <unk> and checked out all the available colours to my dismay the <unk> brown is no longer available ... anywhere please make these again ! or other dual colour combinations seems well made , and its perfect for carting around all of my things for work i <unk> only time will tell its true functionality and durability yes it is `` heavy `` but for those complaining about shoulder pain ... wear a backpack ? how 's that for a novel idea or get a carry-on sort of bag on wheels , different bags for different functions , simple this i love for the unassuming appearance and versatility . - more colours please : -rrb- would definitely recommend to others , and its a right sight cheaper than other similar products out there
this is a very roomy bag that fits my laptop and cords well i can put my phone , kindle hd and kindle paperwhite in with no difficulty it will be great for traveling with cushioned dividers
the bag is more beautiful in person that it looks in the picture my # . # `` dell studio fits in with more space to spare . very feminine and yet sturdy this is huge and heavy as mentioned in the other reviews but sturdy enough to hold the weight of the laptop i have not had it long enough to review about its <unk> , but so far . . it is good just go for it ! you will love it
the quality seems very good , but the bag is much larger than i expected i would have loved this as a student when i needed to carry my laptop plus notebooks and textbooks , etc . its a bit much now that i 'm only carrying my laptop , keys and wallet however , its stylish and it looks durable , so i 'm going to hang onto it you ca n't see it in the photo , but there 's a really nice pocket for carrying a water bottle that may come in handy i 've already removed the cell phone clip its far too small for a modern smartphone
i love the bag , the compartments , the feet on the bottom and it is sturdy but now i remember why i had a backpack before the bag itself -lrb- empty -rrb- is a little heavy and then filled and carrying it all on one shoulder requires balancing
there is tons of room in here for my laptop and all accouterments it is a bit bulky , but i did not choose a sleek cover on purpose , so there you go
i really like this bag it 's a bit bigger than i expected but still very nice my # `` laptop fit perfectly inside the cell phone holder is a bit small - my blackberry in a sleeve wo n't fit in there but i do like how it attaches to the bag it will fit if the phone is n't inside its sleeve i have gotten lots of compliments and most people notice the breast cancer ribbon charm right away
based on the dimensions provided , i was concerned that my oversized laptop may not fit but it fit perfectly i love , love , love this tote it 's not hard to carry i think it 's as heavy as any other tote if my laptop is in it it has enough pockets for my needs i 'm just so pleased that my laptop fits in the padded section which i was n't able to do with my previous tote which appeared to be a big tote but was n't
i love this bag it 's exactly what i was looking for it has lots of room for all my work stuff and it even fits my # `` laptop perfectly only down side is it attracts lint and hair like a magnet but i can deal with that
i purchased this bag in jan. so , i 've had it for about # months now i really love it it is , like a lot of people have said , pretty heavy , even by itself i have a mac book pro and it is also pretty heavy too , but i 'm a pretty tough chick this bag feels very well made and some of the <unk> go to a good cause one of the things that i noticed in the pictures before purchasing , was that it looks like there were different shades of pink , and that is true once i got the bag it is not a problem at all , the bag is still very cute so , all in all , it is very heavy , but also well made i keep my computer in this bag at all times
i had read from a few other reviewers that this bag is a bit heavy and it is , but at the same time , it feels extremely sturdy i love how broad the straps are and they seem to have a bit of padding in them so they are very comfortable very much worth it
we go to work every day and there are some things we need that just does n't fit in a purse i want a bag that will hold my lunch and shoes -lrb- who walks in their good <unk> -rrb- i have purchased many bags before finding this one the two front pockets are perfect for eyeglasses , pens and other small items the inside -lrb- without removable the laptop sleeve -rrb- holds my extra items without being too heavy i found this little tiny pocket on the side and could n't understand until i found the fold-out water bottle holder the inside is pink and white stripes which looks great
great bag , water bottle holder , just right amount of large space and pockets for high schooler to take everything for the day very attractive color combo looks to be something that can endure a teen for awhile too
this bag is pretty great i had to take out the internal padded pockets to get my behemoth # . # ' laptop in there , but it got in there in addition , i am able to carry an external hard drive , the power brick for this monster , as well as a tablet and various power cords the shoulder straps are wide which <unk> into carrying comfort the bag is well made , and the materials are strong plus , it 's cute
this is <unk> the best bag i have ever purchased the quality of the materials and workmanship is outstanding this bag holds my ipad -lrb- plenty of room for a laptop -rrb- plus all my other stuff ... and i do mean all five stars are n't enough this is the first time in all my years of purchasing online that i 've written a review ; that 's how wonderful i think this bag is
there is nothing really to say this bag is amazing , it can hold my # . # inches laptop and my <unk> book at the same time and there is still more room i really do n't regret buying it
this is a gorgeous bag the quality is fantastic the features are great i have a smaller size laptop and the bag could have been a little smaller and still fit the laptop it holds some much stuff that it can get alittle heavy all in all though it is great
this bag is everything we were looking for and more the styling is great , the quality is impeccable , and the stitching is quite nicely done as well the inside is separated by two padded walls for laptops ; it will fit a macbook pro , or any # in laptop very easily good looking to boot
love this laptop case , glad that a portion of the <unk> went to a great cause very durable , its been put through some abuse and travel love the hot pink and black too shipping was quick , thank you
i love this bag , has several pockets i use this for work , however , when it is loaded including my laptop , it is kind of heavy otherwise , it is a sturdy attractive bag
i was looking at the bag and noticed that the handle was ripped off i thought `` well that can be fixed `` , and flipped the bag over only to find that the leather was ripped all the way down the side of the briefcase it did n't include the shoulder strap either , which is why i chose this bag do yourself a favor and do n't buy
i was expecting to be able to at least pull the two sides open , but the bag is so rigid and so narrow that its impossible to fit even a mac book also , the handles are rigid in a bad way , they move around but only like <unk> and the strap is useless because the clips are on opposite ends of each side could not use it even once ! ! !
i read all of the reviews and compared this bag to many others i was looking forward to receiving and using the bag i paid for faux leather , so i was not expecting a leather bag - this looked like a child 's toy purse not a & # # ; real & # # ; look at <unk> nothing similar to what i would usually carry i had planned on using the shoulder strap , but the handles did look nice in the picture however , when the bag is not being carried , the handles just fall to the sides and stick out from the bag it does not look right i sent the bag back
i bought this bag for my wife and she only used for # month , then the handle became loose and broken down eventually she also does not like the material and think it looks cheap anyway , it was not a good purchase
i bought this bag to be able to carry files and other misc items to and from work the bag is very pretty but after only # weeks the pin that holds the handle to the bag came loose i tightened it once but eventually it came loose again and fell out it is very tiny and was lost in a parking lot
