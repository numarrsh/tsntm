item arrived promptly and was of high quality lots of compartments it gave my husband and i the option to bring a computer on our trip , but more important it also provided us with place to store valuables , ids , and a change of clothes this was important since we have traveled before and the airline lost our luggage i would have preferred a bit larger compartment for clothing this was a great purchase
good quality and ok for a quick overnight business trip but not much more once you add a laptop and any notepads etc it becomes too tight for clothes etc .
i 've owned this pack for several months and have really come to like this for travel great handle to pick it up and resists tearing comfortable shoulder straps , love taking this through the airport security <unk> i do n't have to remove anything enough pockets for all my tech goodies
i love this laptop backpack it is very light weight and has several compartments that are great for laptops and accessories also room to take any required documents for travel
i love this bag for its simple use to get through the airport but once i started using it for every day use it began to fall apart my shoulder strap came <unk> and frayed but with a low cost i am not too worried to replace it
though i still had to remove my computer from the actual backpack itself through every airport i have visited so far , this is still way more convenient that a briefcase type bag or the luggage with the computer compartment it even holds more and will fit easily under the plane seat in front you this backpack makes packing all my computer <unk> fast and easy the backpack straps are as comfortable as most and the different color zipper handles for the computer slot is an added bonus that actually came in handy at first i was worried about the `` cushion `` for the laptop being sufficient , but it has proven well designed
i flown over # miles with this backpack on my business trips and could not be happier with it it is so easy going through security here in the u.s. however , in europe , they still require you to remove your laptop from the backpack
this is good value , and holds significantly more than the checkpoint-friendly laptop bag i purchased before my only complaint in comparison to the victorinox backpack i otherwise use -lrb- which does not have the <unk> ability -rrb- is the lack of small internal pockets of a <unk> size to hold useful items it would be good to have more inside pockets with more of them able to be zipped shut
but the rest is staying together holds a lot i got it for two laptops , and it was pretty heavy so i 'm glad i downsized to just one laptop no complaints , it does the trick
fits my # . # & # # ; hp perfectly it has plenty of extra pockets and is very comfortable to carry around the only issue is the strap <unk> tore a little after slight use ... but has n't gotten any worse great fir the price my girlfriend has the same one <unk> and never
i bought this for the many airplane trips i take with my # month old and growing i work from home , so the laptop compartment is essential the security flap is very handy , since it is one last thing i have to take out when i am taking out liquids or snacks for my child -lrb- <unk> -rrb- good use of pockets , but i do wish i had one more larger compartment for files or anything other than children things good pack - will use more as i travel !
i purchased this pack because i fly once or twice a month and wanted something to get me past the tsa without removing my laptop from the pack this pack is great for that purpose ! i have flown several times and i have never been asked to remove my laptop , yet the only negative thing i can say about this pack is that the pocket for the books and other items is somewhat small and will only hold about two of my law school books the computer pouch is large enough to fit my # . # inch widescreen dell xps laptop without any problem overall this is a good pack and i have not had any rips or tears in all of my travels and the straps have held up well under the stress of daily use the only reason i gave it four stars is because the one pouch is smaller than i would like it to be
bought it for my new laptop that has kind of a <unk> top cover the separate compartments are great at keeping the laptop safe everything else is great except there is n't much space left after putting in the laptop it works for me now because as a grad student , i rarely take more than # classes per semester , but i can see it can be a struggle if i had to carry more stuff
this backpack helped me ease through airport security - did not have to take my laptop out lightweight , but well-made , fits easily under the airline seat also holds more stuff then you might think
i 'm not one who often <unk> reviews , but this deserves another # star rating like others , my laptop took a beating going through airport security this bag is well padded , sturdy , and roomy enough for work files and other things i like to have handy during the flight i was surprised when , several times , tsa agents made positive comments to me for having a checkpoint-friendly case , with one agent telling me that these cases are easier for them , too it makes going through security just a little bit quicker and a little less painful
i travel every week for work and this backpack makes getting through the tsa line a breeze no more taking out my laptop , just unzip and it butterflies open onto the <unk> belt zips back up quickly and slides over the handle of my suitcase on the plane , it fits easily under the seat in front of me
i 've been using this for well over a year now i can honestly say that it 's one of the best things i 've bought if i had any complaint it 's that many airports -lrb- especially down under -rrb- still insist on pulling out your laptop to pass it through the x-ray this of course completely <unk> the design of the bag and the reason why i purchased it i nearly got <unk> at one checkpoint trying to <unk> the security guy that it was n't necessary to extract my laptop -lrb- what a <unk> -rrb- in short a great piece of luggage but it wo n't solve your checkpoint problems until airport security update their procedures to the # st century
exactly what i was looking for and could n't find locally good price loads of extra smart compartments in addition to the main split middle laptop feature i will order from this company
i have been using this backpack daily for bicycle commuting and for carrying -lrb- heavy -rrb- text books and a pretty heavy # `` computer this bag is comfortable on my shoulders and has held up great over the year of high use and abuse the pockets are conveniently laid out the key clip is great getting my keys from the bag is so easy and fast with no <unk> around at all the airport pocket for the laptop works perfectly - you will not need to remove your laptop while going through airport security the drink pockets are perfect the fabric is holding together extremely well despite me rubbing against a brick wall while trying to carry my pack and bike out the front door great pack ! ! !
i have n't had the opportunity to use it yet i bought it because it 's small , has plenty of pockets and once we get our two ipads will certainly be useful when we travel it seems sturdy and well made so far , i 'm happy with this purchase
and the seller was fantastic to deal with , when the first one arrived with some unraveling part on the strap holds my laptop , and my tablet , and the power supply , and so much more in one very easy to handle case best part - unzip the middle , lay it flat , and push it through the airport xray no <unk> with getting the laptop in and out you still have to take out the tablet though , but that 's just # lb , not # like the laptop i like this case so much that i 'd give it # stars if i could
just got this backpack and love it it is extremely well organized and the compartments are easy to access the shoulder straps are padded , making it comfortable to wear with a nice leather handle i like the zipped sections and nice to have the split option for airport viewing i will be using this on a daily basis , so happy that it has clean professional looking lines zippers are high quality and nice padding throughout highly recommend this well organized backpack
my laptop fit along with other stuff and i was able to just unzip and cruise right thru security at the airport it was padded and very comfortable to carry on your back , over one shoulder or by the handle i would absolutely recommend it to anyone whether they are traveling or not i also put my bag of liquids between the two halves so when i unzipped it for scanning , i just put those into a tray very easy and convenient
did n't know how this bag would work out b/c i thought it was inexpensive - turns out it 's great i 've been using it for over a month now and where ever i go , it ' goes i 'd recommend highly
i bought my son this backpack for college in # it 's very roomy and he loves the feature for airport security as he generally flies back and forth to school he just spent # weeks in europe for school with it he had the option of taking other backpacks instead but this is the one he wanted for the trip it came back in perfect condition and served him well a great product a great value as well
i love the bag - it exceeded my expectations i use the bag for my laptop , books , and light travel the laptop compartment is <unk> and padded , which gives it additional protection this bag has a myriad of useful pockets that can help in organization of bits and ends , not to talk of its very sturdy build it holds more than it appears able to hold , a feature that i totally admire i highly recommend the targus
i purchased this laptop case specifically for overseas travel its clamshell construction and backpack styling make it efficient for a traveller with limited luggage capacity i keep finding pockets , and have not filled it to capacity yet i am very pleased with this case both for long trips as well as for heading across town to work
this bag is great lots of space for all my textbooks and my laptop really nice because they have lots of litle pockets for miscellaneous items too oh and two water bottle holders on the side . : d the order was processed and shipped immediately overall very sturdy bag with nice padding in the shoulders and lower back , lots of room for laptop , textbooks and little items
i purchased this bag to carry my laptop and work when traveling it does n't look that big when you get it but you are able to fit quite of alot in it i really like all the compartments and the side drink holder is very handy i am now using this as my everyday work bag i have had no issues with the straps fraying or ripping as indicated in other reviews i am very happy with my purchase and would recommend this bag great bag at a great price
after trying a backpack style laptop case i decided to purchase one and this one is great plenty of room for essentials and more easy to access , easy to wear , very durable and nice padding to protect items inside i would recommend this bag to
this is really great bag for traveling with a laptop it fits a lot and expands quite a bit , but the width is great for smaller people -lrb- i.e . younger ppl or women -rrb- because it does n't rub the arms the interior pockets fit whatever you need to take with you and so far the bag has been durable this also works well going through airport security opening it and laying it flat is fine ; you do n't need to take out your laptop i 've gone through # airports with it -lrb- including <unk> and <unk> -rrb- with no problems
i have had this backpack for over # years now not a tear or weak spot on it i 've used it for traveling , overnight stays , school bag ... even borrowed it to a friend to use while she was in college she gave it back to me because she said there was so much room she started moving into it ! lol basically , there is so much space and pockets you can place everything but the kitchen sink in there the padding is more than adequate to protect your laptop when you accidentally toss the bag when getting in from a long day it could use some padding along the bottom , but you just have to be careful and not just drop the bag down great purchase and would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a versatile backpack
nice and handy , i am able to put everything i need in the backpack i use it for everyday business to and from work it carries all my daily business products , cell phone , water bottle , computer
i got this backpack specifically for traveling via airplane being checkpoint friendly , allowing me to get through security without actually removing the laptop was a big plus the other reviewer 's tip about putting your # qt ziplock back of fluids in the middle compartment worked perfectly there is plenty of room in the bag for all my gear the bose qc headphones fit like a glove in the front pocket , and everything is easy to get at once on the plane the <unk> slips easily over the rolling bag handle of luggage making it easy to tote from baggage claim to the rental car shuttle or home after a few trips , i began to appreciate the comfort of the backpack straps , the durable construction , and even the leather covered handle zippers are strong and work well i decided to use it as my everyday bag the middle `` checkpoint friendly `` compartment can be used for additional storage -lrb- files or books -rrb-
i orginally purchased this bag in december of # for a trip i was planning on taking , and have since found it to be invaluable it 's been great for tsa checkpoints , and has stood up to daily use for nearly two years it is my main school bag , so i routinely carry my # `` widescreen laptop , # to # pounds of textbooks , and various other things in it all at the same time the only problem i have ever had with this bag is its tendency to for the `` <unk> `` portion to <unk> by itself when the bag is overloaded other than that , its been wonderful , and i would highly recommend it both for flying and for everyday use
i 've not traveled on an airline with this bag , so i do n't know if they will actually allow me to go through security with the split design however , it 's a nice feature even without it , it 's a well built bag that wears well and has plenty of room for the essentials and a few other things not a <unk> bag , so not a lot of spare space , but plenty for everything you need very well designed , and very well built
recently purchased this bag it fit our laptop -lrb- dell inspiron # -rrb- and <unk> perfectly as well as other items i wanted to carry on the plane i still had to take the laptop out for airport security once we were on vacation , i used the backpack everyday - to go to the <unk> with our <unk> . and when we went shopping -lrb- instead of a purse and to pack my <unk> -rrb- i recommend it lots of compartments - i did think i lost my cell phone because i could n't find it so it takes some getting used to plenty of room for laptop and more comfortable as back pack or to carry on shoulder
it would appear that the quality of this bag has gone downhill in the last few years based on # reviews which is really sad because this bag is <unk> i have had zero issues with the straps so hopefully targus goes back to quality materials when i need to use this bag i have to take a laptop , a wacom tablet , usually a small external hard drive and on top of that some toiletries , clothes and shoes this bag makes it so i do n't have to have multiple bags when traveling for short periods i can fit an extra pair of shoes in the drink pockets on the side , my clothes can roll up into the middle pocket and the toiletries fit nicely on top of said clothes then i can have the front pocket for my wallet and other on the go essentials everything i take certainly weighs this thing down so it 's a good thing it 's light overall i seriously love this thing and would recommend to others ** if ** they fix the strap issue for the newest versions
i 've had this product for # years traveling all over the world it 's still in great shape - very durable great time saver at airports and opens and closes quickly and easily it 's been the perfect backpack for me
perfect size to fit my # `` laptop and it has plenty of space for the rest of the stuff i have to carry around with it it has a place for two water bottles on the side , too the only thing that would make it better would be a side pocket or pouch , but not a big deal
the zipped sections and pockets are great my company laptop is probably the heaviest one since most other laptops are far lighter than mine still it feels very light and comfortable to carry on my back the actual size is a little larger than the specs described still very neat this carries my laptop , notepads , heavy sweater , water bottles , phone , mp # , mouse and power cords very neatly
if you turn the macbook so the front is facing up -lrb- as it would be in a carrying case -rrb- , the macbook will not magnetically seal with this cover on it this makes it totally useless it looks very nice , but if it wont stay shut , whats the purpose customer service was bad email responses were barely in <unk> english and had an <unk> tone in the end i returned the item and just ordered the speck this was a bad experience and its a shame macally wont make a product that actually fits the macbook
i like the design and material used for this item , and your macbook pro will look exceptional with this on however , i ran into some really bad problems with this product i noticed that whenever i close my laptop the black bar in the back that holds the screen to the base of the laptop keeps getting caught and would create a popping noise this was a big problem and i noticed that the screen was getting loose <unk> i took the cover off , which was painfully difficult , and brought my laptop to the genius bar to have them look at the hinge because it felt more lose than when i first bought it the person who looked at my laptop did notice that there was something wrong , and took it inside for a minute to look at the inside the <unk> was that all the screws were loose and had to be tightened up , which took about # mins he told me that this usually happens with people using a skin cover case over the laptop -lrb- he did n't know i use one since i took it off beforehand -rrb- i stopped using the products right then , which was a shame because i really like the look and protection it provided
i 'm updating my review after receiving a new macbook power supply , with the slim connector -lrb- cable comes out the top of the mac when connected , not the side -rrb- , it is <unk> with this case on the magsafe connector is blocked by the case i put a speck case on instead and it does n't have this problem so this case is unusable with apple 's newest configuration
when i received the cover it easily snapped on nice snug fit and looks good on not real leather but its looks good and gives good grip my problems is with the addition weight on the lid it makes it pretty heavy and the macs hinge is n't strong enough to support the additional weight in some positions my main problem when the lid is full opened it blocks the vent in back of the unit and causes the computer to overheat you can hear the fan really struggling to keep it <unk> something i never noticed before because macbook pros are normally extremely quite overall im not to happy about it and i plan on returning cover looks good on but not worth overheating your unit
it is made out of <unk> leather , not & # # ; leather & # # ; as it is advertised it would be better if it was just plastic and therefore would not fray and flake off due to normal wear
i agree with everything that has been written about this cover it is gorgeous , feels very executive , and totally hides the apple logo , which i like alot -- i just feel safer and less of a <unk> it definitely provides good protection , but five minutes after putting it on , i heard the fan come on and it has not gone off the back of the macbook is literally hot i never had this happen before , in the week that i have <unk> my mac it 's a shame , because otherwise , i really like the cover ** update : two years later , i still love this cover no additional problems with overheating , as i continue to monitor background <unk> and keep my macbook off of soft surfaces like <unk> the cover has held up nicely with minimal wear -lrb- i carry it to work daily -rrb- , and i have received numerous compliments i would definitely buy again
more secure grip when carrying mac no heat issues noticed remains attached , but can be removed for cleaning the only con is the wired network port can not be used when the charger is connected
one of the reviews for this item mention that it prevent the magnetic lid of the <unk> to close properly that is true only if you install the top part of the case with the `` macally `` logo towards the rear of the laptop , otherwise it works just perfect really trendy and pretty unique around
the cover snaps on and fits very well it looks nice and , so far , has been rather durable the only thing that i am concerned about is that when i open the computer , the wide hinge in the back snaps over the cover 's attachment points i am afraid that a couple months of opening and closing will cause the cover material to tear at this point , and this will probably spread quickly but there is no sign of this happening yet
i received macally bookshell # today and it snapped on just fine on my new # -inch macbook pro looks solid , and no worries about sharp plastic parts scratching the computer however , the shell covers security slot on the right side and sleep indicator light in front i do n't want to try cutting out the shell to have access to these two and have n't decided <unk> i will keep the shell or not other than that , it would have worked just fine
this cover is perfect and must have for macbooks they fit perfectly i thought it was one piece but they are # pieces one for the lid and another for the bottom they are really nice fit and protects my mac from scratches only complaint is i ca n't see the beautiful backlit apple icon anymore i wish they had a see thru for apple icon in the front otherwise i strongly recommend this for any macbook user
i bought this cover because i did n't want fingerprints and scratches all over my macbook i wanted an option that was sleek and stylish , and disliked the look of skins and the lint attracting <unk> of silicone covers it fits perfectly on my # `` macbook purchased in # the bookshell is slightly padded , but does n't add too much bulk to the sleek macbook it snaps on firmly and is held on by tension and a few strategic tabs that barely extend over the inner edge of the laptop i can access all the ports , including the battery charge indicator on my laptop it does make it a bit harder to slide in and out of my bag , because there is more resistance against the leather surface than the aluminum , but it is n't enough to detract from the product i am not sure this product is leather ; considering the cost and feel ; it is very likely that it is imitation leather or inexpensive <unk> leather again , not a deal breaker for me
i love this case it protects my macbook well and while i 'm using it in my lap , the leather surface grips my leg or my pants so i do n't have to worry about it flying off my lap while on the bus lightweight and does n't add too much bulk to the laptop only gripe is it the computer can get hot when that happens , i just remove the bottom half and let it cool off does n't happen often , but it does
this case looks amazing ; very classy and protects well a nice alternative to all the other plastic cases the only drawback was that the sleep light is covered not a major issue though love the ` leather ' exterior texture and the suede inner lining would highly recommend this case
the macally bookshell provides great protection and attractive style for my # `` macbook pro i 'm happy with the traction while i 'm working with the laptop it does n't slide anywhere because of the soft leather exterior the case snaps on easily and it is a precise fit ; the edges are flush with the edge of the computer , so you do n't feel them as a separate ridge the only thing it does n't have , which would make it perfect , is a window to show the apple logo lit up on the front however , that was n't a deterrent for me it 's more important to have protection and traction -lrb- rather than those slippery plastic ones -rrb- i 'd rather have that than have the apple showing you should buy this product it 's great
they may have <unk> the case for the new # `` macbook pro now the lock port and the sleep light are all visible and accessible however , there is one problem i blame apple for their bad design on the new `` l `` shaped magsafe power port because the power line now runs parallel to the side of the mac , it blocks the access to the network and the firewire ports to avoid , i use to let the power line the other way to the back side of the notebook but , with the cover on , you no longer can do that with the cover on and using the power line , you ca n't use the network port and firewire ports other than that , i like the cover
i was very anxious for this item to arrive and when it did , i was not disappointed my only concern is overheating since it does n't give any breathing space on the bottom cover , but so far it has n't been an issue the case does cover the apple logo and i like it better that way very cool case for the $ you pay
i recently purchased a macbook pro , after a few minor scratches it was time for a protective cover i tried a more expensive <unk> cover yet did n't like the way it fit so thought i 'd give macally a try i 'm happy with my purchase it does add a little bulk and the seems could be a bit smoother where my wrist rests yet overall it worth the money i would recommend it if you like a more subdued look
love the case , it does make the laptop noticeably heavier though after reading a few of the previous review , it seems the cover has been updated , because the cd slot is accessible and there is a space for air to circulate from the laptop fan , thus preventing overheating it 's a great case
if you are looking for a case that is going to do it 's job -lrb- protect your mac -rrb- the bookshell # is the one reliable , durable and good price i wish they could have more color options though but over all awesome product ! !
this case fits the macbook pro # perfectly it is exactly what i was hoping it would be feels kinda padded and leathery fit and finish are superb very easy to install should be long lasting very conservative looking
this shell looks really nice , simple , and discreet not as flashy as a lot of macbook cases , and you almost ca n't tell it 's a macbook inside when you have this shell on it , but i do n't mind that one bit
i recently purchased a macbook pro # `` and looked all over trying to find a nice protective case this case is perfect the only problem is that the power plug wo n't plug in facing backwards , but if you flip the plug with the cord facing forward it works perfectly
i bought this for my # `` macbook pro it has an elegant look , better than the plastic cases i fits good , no <unk> for me comparing to previous usage without the cover i recommend this product for everyone as aluminium casing scratches easy
i adore this case my brother and i both have the same exact case for our different sized mac books i love that it 's padded and that i do n't have to worry about damaging my macbook when i 'm transporting it with me everywhere my brother has had his for over # years now and it still looks brand new we both recently took the case off to inspect underneath and everything looked great no damage or dirt really accumulated which was a nice surprise i highly recommend this to anyone looking to protect their macbook
for the price of the case , i was truly expecting a dog i was pleasantly surprised the case went on easy , the leather has not <unk> off or bunched up i take my mac with me everywhere , to work , gigs and even camping a few times this case is an excellent buy for the money , my money was not wasted
i looked for weeks for the perfect shell for my new laptop i even considered spending <unk> more for similar products , but i thought for $ # , i 'll take a chance i could n't be more pleased it 's true that you ca n't lay the display flat , but i have n't needed to and i have n't noticed any problems with the laptop getting too hot i probably would n't watch dvds all day with this case on , but for transporting my laptop in my backpack and carrying it around the office this is exactly what i was looking for
after having dented my daughters mac , we purchased one of these covers to prevent this from happening again i was concerned about how thick it might make the computer however , the product has a great fit with a high grade of leather it does not make the mac too thick it supplies the protection we were looking for and is a good-looking cover
great finish , and most of all protects from inside the inside part of this item is soft and paded , so protects what matters , the computer surface others are solid inside surface , bringing not clear protection in case a grain get inside and scratch the aluminium surface i already have bought # of these , with time <unk> off , but can be easily be restored by a leather <unk>
how i 've managed to keep my macbook in decent shape without this cover is a <unk> the soft inside is ideal for keeping my laptop free of scratches and the faux-leather outside is easy to grip and does n't add much bulk heat <unk> has n't been a problem , and the cover protects my legs from the <unk> a macbook can become after long use my only complaint is the lack of color options , but this gives a professional appearance
as soon as i slipped this case on my # macbook pro i was in love it 's smooth , classy , does not cause the fans to go into <unk> -lrb- the <unk> feels like leather -lrb- it 's not -rrb- but it <unk> very well i was tired of the plastic case that became full of bits and bobs of dirt and covered with scratches and smears -- plus it was difficult to remove this case is easy to remove , has a sleek appearance , reduces the macbook pro 's <unk> to slide around on smooth surfaces i 'd love to see this case available in different color choices , however i 'd suggest a nice brown , blue and purple for future <unk> i would buy a brown case if it were available this case is just as heavy as my plastic case and i do not notice the weight as well the only drawback that i 've experienced while using this case is that the screen can not be tilted as far back as usual i have not noticed my cpu 's temperature rising during everyday use
bought this for an hp netbook that crapped out shortly after i bought this . zipper broke quickly if your looking for a cheap sleeve , this is of you . would not buy
for traveling outside the home it works fine - i do n't use it in the home - i 'll use it when i go to book club as i downloaded a book on it to read for the
i was thrilled with the speed in which i received this product , but was disappointed in the item itself i had just gotten an hp mini and when i put it in it barely fits am afraid the zipper will split at any time
the case itself i think is very stylish and decently padded however it has no extra storage it only has the pouch for the netbook so in hindsight i think i would shop around and look for another option for more storage especially if you plan on taking accessories with you
quick summary : it fits the hp mini # with the oversized , # -cell , extended battery , but there is no carrying strap that would make it easier to <unk> with your netbook in hand along with my hp mini # with the extended battery , i bought this protective notebook sleeve to keep this little netbook safe from the bumps and scratches of daily use while i like the <unk> and padding when my mini # is inside this `` notebook sleeve , `` i was disappointed that it does n't come with a <unk> strap to easily and safely transport your hp mini netbook instead , you have to curl your fingers around the bottom edge of the netbook sleeve , rather than grasping a carrying strap a <unk> strap would make it easier to carry around your netbook , and it 's harder to drop a netbook holding a strap than grasping the entire , padded netbook in your hand without a carrying strap , i can not really recommend this product to you
i purchased this cover for an hp # nr netbook the padding on the cover is about # `` thick and provides good protection from scratches and bumps the sleeve is fitted such that the netbook will not slide around inside , but this means you 'll need to carry your ac adapter elsewhere the pattern on the outside of the sleeve matches nicely with that on the netbook the quality of the fabric and the double zippers is good i 've had no problems with the zippers catching overall , this is a great fitting sleeve for basic protection without storage
it 's a neoprene case , with the <unk> pattern that matches a number of hp netbooks including my hp mini # <unk> pc -lrb- part of the hp mini # line -rrb- it 's a sleeve , it 's only a sleeve , and that 's about it no pouches or space for carrying accessories -lrb- dock it a point for that -rrb- if all you want is a sleeve to protect it while in a bigger bag , this is great if you want to bring your accessories along , this sucks -lrb- no room to spare for power brick , external optical drive , etc . -rrb- not much else to say
this fits my netbook like it was <unk> it provides a nice amount of padding , and has an understated design , solid zipper and a very soft interior no handles ; it is basic protection for taking it out into the world i did not expect to find storage in something that is called a sleeve so no disappointment there do note that an acer d # with a larger battery will probably not fit in this meanwhile , i 'm happy and it is a really good value
i bought a hp netbook for my daughter for her birthday and decided to add a sleeve for her to be able to carry it with her it seemed to fit very nicely and protects it with good foam padding it was delivered quickly and i was very happy with my purchase
i like this , i use it daily only complaint i have is that with the power cord wrapped up and stored inside with the notebook along with an optical wireless mouse i use , makes the <unk> somewhat snug they all fit , but a little more room or a separate pocket for things like a mouse or power cord would be welcome but having said that , i would buy this again if i needed another one
i read most of the reviews for this product and certainly was the deciding factor in purchasing the item it is a sleeve and nothing more , but very well made and accommodates the extended battery -lrb- # cell -rrb- as for the pattern on the outside , its a nice touch would have liked inside pockets for usb drives it is worth the price
i really liked this sleeve , its perfect for the hp mini # . # `` screen . the design is somehow weird it was a gift anyway ! gave # stare cuz it have no pockets to put the power cable , other than that it good :
since my mini frequently travels in my purse , a sleeve was necessary this sleeve fits perfectly and i like the double zipper opening i gave it only # stars for aesthetics - i did n't like the white graphic on the black case i took a black sharpie to the design , and now it looks exactly like the mini 's case
holds the computer snugly and gives some protection could be a little larger since the computer with the battery pack makes for a snug fit but , over all it 's nice looking and does the job
i love the sleeve , it has a neat design , but it is a tight fight for the mini # i usually put the computer and the sleeve together it is possible to do that with this case , but not the easiest
i 've used this case on an hp mini # and hp mini # and it works great for both -lrb- the # is a little bit deeper than the # -rrb- its good quality , has a strong zipper and the pattern is cool a must have if you want to carry around a netbook without a backpack or attache
i own the hp mini <unk> <unk> edition -lrb- in red -rrb- and i bought this case because i wanted to protect the cover design and the computer overall the mini originally came with a red satin sleeve , but it had no padding whatsoever , and was kinda a pain to take on and off i bought this hp mini compatible sleeve and i love it it 's not too bulky , but it 's padded enough for me to feel like my comp is secure and protected the cute white <unk> on the <unk> also make it look better than just a plain black case if anyone is looking for a lightweight , but durable laptop case/sleeve , then this is a great option my only complaint is that it 's bulky when i add the adapter/charger - but at least it fits inside
this is the perfect sleeve for my hp mini it fits well and protects it from scratches , without being too bulky the little design on top gives it more personality also , the quality of the material is good
there are two words that i can use for this review : elegant and great for protection these two important things were what i was looking for my hp mini and keeping it without scratches
i do n't have an hp mini , but an # . # `` asus eee pc i love this sleeve with a <unk> it 's quality is excellent and wonderfully stretchy , so you can put in some other things like chargers , if you do n't mind the <unk> look it is very durable and goes back to its original configuration even if you stuff with your computer and charger nice thick protection
i bought this to <unk> my hp mini # -lrb- see my review , if you 're on the fence ! -rrb- , specifically against the warnings of some reviewers here i 'm quite glad i did - i was expecting a ragged , <unk> nylon bag , but actually was pleasantly surprised it 's <unk> than one might expect , and it fits the # -cell battery on my mini # without a terribly <unk> bulge personally , i like the bubbles - they remind me of the <unk> of <unk> : wind <unk> 's style that might be a selling point for some , while i 'm sure that has little bearing for others either way , it serves its purpose , and carries your netbook well at $ # , it 's a low price for a good-quality item
this sleeve works perfect for my hp mini -lrb- netbook -rrb- it is well padded and provides just the level of protection i was looking for when i slip the netbook in my carry on or in my larger carrying case the sleeve only holds the netbook , so if you are looking for something to carry cords and accessories as well this will not do that it is also great for protecting it at home since it keeps the dust off and does n't take up extra space i like that the design matches the design on the hp netbook
i was doing a lot of searching for a good low cost sleeve for the apple ipad so i looked into netbook cases/sleeves i did n't want to fall into the trap of paying # x more on a case just because it was `` made for ipad `` fortunately i found this case as well as the previous owner 's review of it with an ipad to sum it up , you wo n't find a better , cheaper , and well fitting case for the ipad anywhere else the sleeve looks and feels like it was made for the dimensions of the ipad , it does n't swim inside the sleeve i am very happy with it and highly recommend this case for other ipad owners that do n't want to pay ridiculous prices for a `` made for ipad `` case
i purchased an hp netbook for travel this case is absolutely a perfect fit , it fits snuggly enough so that the netbook does not slide around and it is well padded to protect price , quality and shipping were excellent i highly recommend this product and seller
i own the hp mini # it matches the ` <unk> ' design perfectly and it fits the sleeve almost perfectly i do n't believe in putting the power cord in the sleeve so it 's just a tad big with the laptop , but i would most definitely recommend it i 've had it for a year , and i take it to school everyday , and for something to last two semesters with any <unk> high school student means it 's built pretty well it still looks new , has n't lost any of it 's luster so basically if you own the hp mini # , with the <unk> design , i 'd recommend it , it 's prolly the best fit for your netbook
i bought my sleeve at wal-mart for twice as much as it is selling on amazon shame on me the sleeve is well made and covers the mini with # cell battery i like the design else i would have purchased something else i have carried the mini in the sleeve in a <unk> with the cords , mouse , instructions , etc . the sleeve still looks like new july # <unk> to add : i have taken my mini through airport security , by itself , in this sleeve , several times without having to remove it from the sleeve
i just purchased a brand new apple ipad and i was planning on purchasing apple 's ipad case for $ # and then i found this hp case the apple ipad fits perfectly in this hp case the case can be purchsed from amazon 's warehouse deals for $ # and you can get free shipping too so at $ # compared to $ # for apple 's ipad case this is a no brainer the case has two zippers and appears to be well made the inside material and padding are more than sufficient to protect your ipad but you should still avoid dropping it even if it is in the case it is made of glass after all <unk> <unk> sells this case for $ # . # so do yourself a favor and save # % and order it from amazon instead three thumbs up for design , functionality and cost factor ! product number : <unk> #
i have had this case for two years and it is still in great condition there are no signs of wear and tear , my netbook is nearly mint condition because of the protection of this case this case is light and does not add too much weight to the netbook . -rsb- the interior padding is plush and provides the best protection against accidental drops i love the detail that the designers put into this product such as the hidden zipper track and matching graphics -lrb- for the hp # nr -rrb- my netbook even fits in this case with the extended battery installed as one reviewer mentioned , this sleeve perfectly fits my ipad -lrb- # st generation -rrb- this is a great purchase , especially for the price -lsb- -lsb- asin b # <unk> hp mini sleeve
