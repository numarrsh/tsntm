the rubberized cover feels really smooth and nice , and i especially love the color the laptop cover case provides the protection my mac needs however , i probably have to glue one of the little black supporting legs soon , which becomes kinds loose after a little while this is a case worth buying nonetheless ! !
i love it : : : its exactly what i wanted : if your looking for a great deal and a cool hard case : : then this is the one you want : ; very satified with ordering and arriving on my doorstep : yes buy it :
i love the color it seems more of a deep pink with a hint of purple i love it it stays on very well and was easy to put on it keep my mac from getting scratched
i think i like my old clear cover better as far as color , but i also knew that this one would have a little frost to it and for what it is ... it 's great ! ! they did n't have a & # # ; clear & # # ; cover so this color was as close as could get and it 's perfect just as described
i bought this laptop case for my daughter 's new macbook pro -lrb- the oldest model still sold in stores , does n't have retina display , has cd drive -rrb- and it fits perfectly the apple logo shines through when the computer is on and the tiffany teal blue is exactly as pictured delivery was fast and easy my daughter could n't be happier i highly recommend this product
the product is exactly what i was hoping for and it was shipped promptly the cover fits perfectly and seem to be durable products i highly recommend this product the pricing is also a plus in comparison to the price of sale of about $ # at an apple retail store
the case fit perfectly and looks great the color is true to what is shown and the rubberized feel is soft i like it very very much ! it is good deal for me
just fyi -- the top of the back cover can be a little loose but i would n't pick it up that way anyway it is just the protection i wanted i like the rubberized finish , it 's easy to pick up , hold on to , and it feels good
a very nice an not too expensive sleeve the thickness was indicated as # . # & # # ; , but that is not true : it fits up to # . # & # # ; the big drawback : this item has an unbearable <unk> initially , it could not be briefly <unk> still , after a month , i keep it overnight on the porch obviously , these <unk> <unk> are highly toxic -lrb- i 'm a lab <unk> -rrb-
i liked the idea of this case and it was okay upon receipt except for the smell i could have lived with the smell -lrb- or left it outside for while -rrb- , but it just was n't stiff enough to protect my tablet
good size , good color , and i like the handles that slide away but this case is toxic smells like the inside of a new tire it 's basically off-gassing in my office ... still , two weeks later i would not buy again or recommend this i wish i 'd listened to the other review that said it smells and he keeps it outdoors when not in use
no as happy with the product as i thought i would be one of the zipper pulls broke off on first use the fabric looks great , but gets dirty very easily i keep it in a tote bag and it still looks like i have had it for a year the outside & # # ; pockets & # # ; are not really pockets , they are just big enough to stick the handles back in and nothing else padding is great though , t
i only have one negative and it 's really small the pockets are a little weird the velcro is so strong i have to put my hand in there to hold the sides apart or else it feels like i 'll rip the pockets right
the bag is really nice but it just about fits my lap top it says # . # but i have a hard time getting it in and out if you have a smaller lap top it would be perfect i was going to return it but i do n't use the bag that much so i kept it that is the only reason i gave it # stars , otherwise the sleeve is fine
this case in nice-looking , bright color and i like the handles but what i do not like - its strong smell , like resin or some synthetic i still have this case on my <unk> - waiting for the smell to go away i did not return it because or return shipping price - it does not worth it
the color is not the same as on the <unk> , but it still a very nice blue just a deeper blue not as bright as it seems on the picture , but nice color , i like it ;
ordered this laptop case for my # -inch laptop and it fits perfectly two side pockets with velcro closures are nice to have and they hold a lot of stuff -lrb- power cord , mouse , portable hard drive , etc . -rrb- the openings to the pockets are a little small so its a little challenging to get your stuff out but overall it works just fine
i very happy with this product ... its cushioned and is good quality i would say if your laptop is # . # inch get the # inch bag . thats what i did and its a perfect fit . its also a great color . delivery was super
the product does not smell like & # # ; chemicals & # # ; as was posted by others , it smells like any other & # # ; new & # # ; product it definitely has enough room for the laptop in the main component and for the charger on the outside components it 's not a fancy bag but it is definitely worth the price i 'm completely happy with my little carrying bag
i love that the handles can be used or hidden i did not have the bad smell that others complained about , it just smelled like new plastic for a little , but not overwhelming it lost a star because with my laptop case on , it is a tight fit but it still fits and works fine
very cute case , it 's a great color and the handles are really nice it does n't look like it will provide much protection against <unk> , but as a simple carrying case , it works very well
love how silk and thin it is , however it really smells bad even after months of leaving it to dry , it still smells and if you start using it from the beginning , your laptop will def . catch the smell
i bought my laptop with travel and ease of carrying in mind this cover protects my laptop very well and adds almost no additional bulk or weight to my suitcase i have had it for about # months and i am pleased with it so far
the case is a little tight if you 're going to go by exact measurements perhaps go up an inch or two to make it easier to zip and get out other than that it 's a great product
works great if you just need to carry a laptop -lrb- macbook pro in my case -rrb- and not a big bag or backpack my only wish is that this case also had an optional shoulder strap
the bag we bought for the new computer is perfect nicely padded , handles slip away into side pockets , and there is room for power cord just right and the price was right
this product is like a thick wet suit material , and has pockets that the handles slide down into , you can put your mouse and other things in there safely i thought i needed a product with pockets , but this one works just great
this case is exactly what i needed it is light yet still strong enough to offer moderate protection for my laptop so far , i have been very happy with this purchase
i have an older laptop , a dell e # this case fits very well , it is very stretchy and the side pockets hold everything i need , including my power supply and my mouse
works well with my # inch dell laptop i 'm pleased that the case can accommodate power cord and mouse in the side pockets -lrb- where handles are stored -rrb- material is thick and is protective
the case came as promised and fits the macbook air # & # # ; what is really nice about the case is that bc it is soft , i was able to have my daughter 's name embroidered on it we are very satisfied
first thing i did was stick my laptop in it and i didnt even want to take it out , it looks so good in it 's new cover the only thing is the gray is darker than the picture show but i actually like the darker grey then handles are great and fold nicely away so that you can just use it as a cover i can not recommend it enough
i love the feel of this bag it is very sturdy and it fits my mbp retina very snugly and i love it also , the handles can be hidden when you have a larger bag to carry it i travel quite a bit and the side pockets can be used to hold your boarding pass a perfect bag for a perfect laptop
a simple laptop bag that offers some cushion and room to carry the charger i wanted something compact and not very heavy the build quality of the bag seems nice and durable
product arrived # days earlier than anticipated it came <unk> in a medium-sized box with air cushions -- a little excessive if you ask me , but it got here in perfect condition my laptop is # . # in by # . # in and about the thickness of a dvd case , and it fit in the case with a lot of extra room , even on the sides the sleeve does n't provide a lot of fall protection , but the inside is smooth material with no sharp anything , so it wo n't scratch your computer
i have the macbook pro retina # . # a # and this fits very good there 's a slight allowance in the upper area -lrb- zipper area -rrb- approximately an inch , when the laptop is inside the bag but it is n't a big deal to me the sides are okay the most important part is that my laptop still fits even when it has its hardshell case on i also like the secret handles , they come in handy the foam has the right amount of thickness , feels safe it 's a very simple laptop bag but it 's totally worth it
this is the perfect everyday sleeve for my # & # # ; retina macbook pro it seems like good quality , the color is vibrant , my rmbp fits perfectly , and the pockets for the handles are great for tucking in a bunch of peripherals will be my go-to bag for carrying my laptop between work and home
bought this for my daughter 's hp chromebook # and it 's perfect the fit is great and love that she can use the handles to carry ... or push the handles back in so it can fit nicely in her backpack
this was one of the more expensive laptop cases on amazon , but i picked it because of the color and handles it 's well padded and the blue is true to color the handles are useful , and the case has pockets on both sides to put items in i put my charger and mouse in them
i needed this to protect my laptop from <unk> ending up being magnetized in the connection for the power brick i love the color - it 's exactly as pictured and just what i needed shipped very quickly
light and comfortable ! love this bag , easily fits in my bag with my school books just fine . holds every accessory for my phone as well and tends to get a little bulky but nothing
this is a great sleeve the hidden handles , and it is roomy enough for both my computer and the power cord the only negative is that it has a weird smell to it , but i am sure that will go away with time i really am happy with my purchase and have already used it
this case is a little smelly upon first arrival as some other reviews have said however , after i turned the case inside out and let it air out a few <unk> the smell is mostly gone that aside , this case is perfect for my macbook pro w / retina display i have a mosiso case on my mac and it was a perfect snug fit in this briefcase bag ; the laptop does n't slide around at all the material for this briefcase bag is pretty thick , so it produce much cushion for the laptop the dual zippers are also very convenient and made of good quality the handles are convenient if you are not carrying your laptop in a backpack , otherwise they can be flipped down and <unk> in the outside pockets there is also room enough for you to fit your charger and some other things like your phone or pens in the outside pockets -lrb- pockets have velcro closures
the case is a perfect fit for my macbook air # inch computer with a protective sleeve on it the outside pockets <unk> the handles are stretchy enough to carry small parts such as a mouse , an external drive and its cord
this pouch fits my mac air perfectly it is tight so it does n't move around but i can also fit a pad of paper in with the computer the handles come out of the # pouches and i can fit my cords in those pouches along with a few pens and some post-its the handles also push inside the pouches if you do n't want them in the way
i bought this for my # . # inch hp laptop , it fits perfectly not too loose and not too small it has extra material around the corners which protects your laptop just in case you happen to bump it in to something i bought it in the blue color , it is exactly the tone of blue that the picture shows the handle is very convenient , the pocket in the front is spacious enough to fit the charger and wireless mouse
exactly as advertised and fits my dell perfectly i just did n't think about a place for power cord -- it fits into outside pocket area but makes an unsightly bulge
it 's a tight fit for my # . # & # # ; laptop but i love the case with it 's handles and pocket it 's well constructed and seems like it will last a long time
i bought this laptop case for an overnight trip i was n't expecting much because it 's fabric and was so inexpensive however , i was pleasantly surprised to find what a great case this turned out to be it has two side pockets that can fit chargers and such in it while the actual opening to the outside pockets is n't very big , i was still able to fit my kindle , it 's charger , my cell phone charger , and my laptop charger in them i recall seeing some comments about a smell when the product first arrived while there was a bit of an odor to it that first night i took it out of it 's package , the smell was gone by the time i went on my trip the following day
from the add when i purchased it , this seems like a # however , i got it for a friend and i do n't know if he has even used it yet
it 's compact but cushioned i can slip little items into the handle pockets for convenience it has a good zipper and looks professional it 's protected my mac laptop quite well
this case is perfect for what i was looking for for my lenovo u # touch very easy to use , handles tuck away when i do n't want them i wish i had found a similar case in the past some people complain about the neoprene smell - the odor is very strong when you get it - it 's brand new however , have using it actively for a week , the smell is almost gone to even smell it , i have to put my nose right up to the case i can live with this easily
i bought this to carry my mac to work and school and it is perfect for that it has outside side pockets to put the charger in as well i really like the blue color i bought
after alot of bad experiences trying to find a hard case , i am very pleased with this one it fit very <unk> the handles are nice wish there was alittle more room for accessories
this is my favorite color the bag is sleek and smooth the pockets fit quite a bit mine holds my charger in one side and my mouse and pad in the other and does n't protrude too badly i have a # . # inch laptop and it fits a little snug , but i can zip it after a little wiggling
it is a very nice pouch i only wish i bought the black one as the grey is a bit darker than on the picture it is a perfect size and very comfortable
a neoprene sleeve , with <unk> handles , with additional pocket areas when you need it very well made , surprisingly inexpensive anything not fairly small and flat will cause a bulge in the otherwise sleek little case
great snug fit for my # . # macbook it is sleek and it slips right over it and then i slip it into my briefcase nice material , looks great , and seems well <unk>
i have n't had this case for that long nor do i use it <unk> a few of the teeth fell off of the zipper track so the zipper does n't connect anymore and now i ca n't even zip the thing back up i really like the print , but for having this less than two months i am very disappointed
cute design but material is thin and <unk> that it fits a # . # computer is misleading laptop sleeves are supposed to be fitted to the computer for protection and so that it fits into backpacks and bags this case does anything but that my # & # # ; macbook pro slides with a bulky extra couple of inches of space very unhappy with it will definitly be returning disappointed that the the selling line claims that it 's for a # . # laptop
the case came in the mail and i loved the pattern although people on other reviews were saying that the pattern is brighter than the picture it 's not it was dull but pretty and i still loved it a couple of my friends from school told me it looks like it came from <unk> it worked really well with padding inside and there was this soft fur inside it was a very snug fit and i was satisfied with the product the only reason i could n't give this more stars is because in less than a month teeth started falling off the zipper on both of the corners eventually i could n't even use the zipper so there was n't too much point to using the case if my laptop would slide out this made me really sad because of how much i loved it
the colors were darker than expected but still a beautiful design i had to return the case because it was ripped at the bottom there was also a very strong plastic -lrb- ? -rrb- stench when i opened the box
i am very pleased with how the sleeve looks and it was the right size however , the zipper broke within a week of purchasing it the zipper was not used roughly and can only be fixed by replacing the zipper completely unfortunately the quality was not satisfactory
first off think about what you want in a laptop sleeve it 's just a cover thats soft on the inside to keep it from getting scratched up this is exactly a cover thats soft on the inside to keep it from getting scratched up what do you want
the case looks much more <unk> here on site than it does in real i still like the patterns , but would have liked the case better if the colours were stronger i ordered this case for my macbook pro # & # # ; retina , and it is slightly large , about an inch the fit is not as snug as i would have liked it
i ordered one size up based on the actual measurements of my netbook i am glad i did as it is an excellent fit i like the fabric , but did have a bit of an odor problem coming from the interior i aired it out in my garage and in a few days the odor was gone the seller said the odor was from the glue and would dissipate which it did if it were n't for the initial odor i would have rated it a five star
it did meet my expectations as far as color and quality the inside is very soft which is good for my computer i do however wish it was a little larger so i could got my charger in as well
very <unk> cover ... nice quality , strong zipper and cool design i liked it so much i bought two the only thing i did not like was it smelled terribly when first opened i had to air it outside overnight but once that was done , i consider it perfect
i love the design , and the quality is great my laptop fits perfectly , and the inside is super soft and protective unfortunately , i was hoping for some pockets or something to hold my charger and mouse i ended up purchasing a laptop bag as well that is easier to carry , i still use the cover for extra protection if you are just looking for a case , this product is perfect , but for convenience , expect to purchase another bag to hold those extra needed items
looks just like it does in the picture very nice and it 's soft on the inside the one downside is it does n't seem to offer that much protection since the case is pretty thin
great quality , fits my macbook perfectly with a bit of cushion love the pattern , got so many compliments on it already the only thing is that it took about a month to get here no bad smell like the others my only suggestion is that it needs a pocket in the front
i picked out this cover because i liked the idea that ugly wallpaper would make a very nice laptop cover - and i was right it nicely protects my laptop while still making it look like it 's in a <unk> <unk> <unk> short story
i have an # & # # ; asus and it 's a squeeze to get it in there , but otherwise it looks great also , the colors are brighter than i expected . more salmon , less orange
looks exactly as it did online fit my apple airbook perfectly unfortunately , it smelled very & # # ; chemically & # # ; when i opened the package it has since dissipated , but do not like the fact that it is probably all full of chemicals
this carrying case is pretty much what you would expect it 's very pretty and unique i 've had many a compliment on this case even on the inside it has this soft , gold velvet that is pleasant but i would n't recommend buying this case for protection value it 's really very thin and has virtually no padding if you throw your laptop around a lot , this is not the case for you but if you just need a cute sleeve to keep your laptop from being jumbled with your books in your messenger bag , then it 's perfect just be careful that people know what 's in this sleeve my sister almost sat on my laptop thinking it was a pillow
the product not only looks great -lrb- everyone asks me where i got such an interested cover -rrb- but it has a soft suede like material on the inside that protects the computer i would recommend this product
i love this , but i only gave it # stars because it came smelling strongly of chemicals . it looks exactly like the picture , and i received it on time which was great . great quality
i purchased two of these nifty little cases for two new mac laptops for my wife and daughter they are awesome my daughter preferred one that was snug fitting around the laptop while my wife wanted something allowing a little extra room to put stuff i told her it was n't a purse , but she <unk> with , & # # ; it 'll be perfect to add my schoolwork . & # # ; as always , my wife knows best the fact that these cases come in various sizes and colors is simply brilliant you will not be let down
it 's exactly as it looks in the picture like other reviews said , it does have a strong odor to it but over the last couple days it has started to go away i 'm personally not bothered by it the case does it 's purpose and looks great the smell will fade over time
my asus q # la fits perfectly in here and it 's so soft from the inside the design is really nice too it kind of had a strange smell at first but then it went away
more than pleased - fits well - not a lot of extra space - just snug enough , but yet not so loose as it 's baggy - i can still fit charger in bag as well and the colors and material make it look not just like any other computer cover - i love that it stands out - have gotten many compliments on it and i 've had it only a week
i am always bringing my laptop everywhere , so i figured it was about time i get a cool protective sleeve that will easily let me access my laptop anywhere and at anytime this did it plus it is cute college students could appreciate this product , and really anyone
i love the colors it is a super cute case and the inside is super soft it is perfect for all ages it can hold my # . # inch laptop and wall charger and fits like a glove
i love this sleeve it fits my laptop perfectly i love the soft interior of the case ; it really helps keep the laptop from being scratched or damaged in addition , i get compliments on this sleeve all the time although the colors are not quite as bright as the picture would have you believe , it is still very beautiful i never leave home without it
i love this thing . the lining for my laptop will make sure it never gets scratched or messed up , unless i put something in the case that will do it also , the photo does not do the sleeve justice , it is
i love the colors and the durability of the case i 've gotten <unk> compliments on it i also like that it does n't even look like a computer case
very nice and <unk> seems sturdy and well made but i have only had it for a week my # & # # ; macbook air and my ipad mini fit in with a little room to spare only macbook air fits if it 's in its hard
this fits my laptop perfectly and looks great , it is a little lighter in person the inside is great and soft i spilled chocolate milk on it once while it was in my backpack and it did get on the laptop but was ok seeing as it was a substantial amount of milk it cleaned up well with <unk> wipes and no longer smells of chocolate milk
i love this case so much the colors are vibrant and perfect the inside material is very soft and creates a good amount of padding for my # & # # ; mac some people are complaining that their case was too big so you have to make sure you choose the right size before you order
i love this thing the outside feels of thick canvas , the inside is beyond smooth , and the zipper is nice and thick nothing about this feels cheap and it fits my # & # # ; macbook air wonderfully .
the color and design are great and the case quality is also really nice i was n't expecting the case to be this nice since it was only $ # but it is actually great
love this cute and well made computer cover bought for my daughter in college and all of her friends love it too got it right away and the quality is just what she needed
i definitely recommend this laptop sleeve the colors are accurate to the image and the zipper is very strong the laptop sleeve is thick and the interior of it prevents my laptop from moving around very much inside of it this is a perfect product and i 'm glad i chose this one
i 'm using it for macbook pro # `` and i like it - the colors and the material it seems protective + not slippery maybe it could be smaller for macbook pro # `` , but now you can fit your charger into the bag which could be taken as an advantage
the inside is fluffy and i think it will help to protect my razor blade even more i was searching online for sooo many cases this one stands out because of the color and the inside material i saw a guy using the same case i got this is popular
nice slim little case got this for my wife and she loves it fits her style very much we have a # . # inch hp pavilion sleek book and fits great nice padding not to bulky . soft fabric on the inside that almost gives the laptop a shine <unk> when you pull it out
the product is serving its purpose well and has protected my macbook well when i put it in my purse or bag the quality of the material is great and it is well worth the price happy with this product
i love this style and pattern and i 'm definitely satisfied my macbook pro # retina already has its plastic cover and with it it fits perfectly in this one it looks exactly like in picture and inside it is nice and soft and will definitely keep your laptop from unwanted scratches outside is nice and sturdy
my fianc & eacute ; bought me a netbook and i wanted to protect it while traveling this is perfect it has a very soft inside , like fur , a rough outside to ward off spills , falls , and provides a good grip when your carrying it it has a very sturdy zipper and a beautiful boho design i absolutely love if especially for the price
this case is exactly what i was hoping for it looks exactly like the picture and fits my # & # # ; macbook pro perfectly it is very soft on the inside and will not scratch your computer i could n't have asked for anything better
