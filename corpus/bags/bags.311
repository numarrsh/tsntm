when i opened the package , it was beautiful and i was quite excited i ordered the sapphire <unk> however , my ipad mini did not feel secure and the frame that <unk> my screen was not cut right so it kind of hid part of my screen i was trying to <unk> those things but worst of all , the tab on the side to close the cover was stitched crooked and it did not snap close properly the case that i purchased was not made well i was not happy with it so i returned it
i am returning this case , although it is so cute , it does n't fit correctly on the i pad it covers up the sides of the screen and you can see or select anything on the screen if its in the corners huge pain in the butt , i tried it for # days and hated it if this fit correctly then i would have loved the case , great material and design , just not made correctly i wish i had read the reviews before i bought this because all of the other reviews stated that this would happen and i did n't take the time to read the reviews so unless they fix the issue , do n't order this case for your i pad mini
love my new mini ipad and my new cover , but it 's a tad too small i have to lift the edges of the cover to push some of the icons on the edges of the screen hoping it will stretch some over time cause it 's annoying
i was a little disappointed , the cover was stiff and hard to <unk> my ipad into it the surrounding frame covers some of the buttons where i have to lift it up to x out of some things or see the time or battery life and it does n't stand up high enough either design was really pretty though
this case is absolutely gorgeous , although it does not fit the screen right on my ipad mini to be specific it over extends the left and right side of screen about # cm on each side at times it is not a big deal and other times it can be frustrating because it can be hard to control what is going on with ipad
i love this case i mostly read books on my i-pad and this is a pleasure to hold i like the suede inside , when you fold it back it stays put on your lap i 'm very happy with my purchase
this is a very beautiful and <unk> piece of art all in an ipad mini cover ! there is a charity for each design , which i think is so wonderful . there 's a matching iphone case , which i will be ordering next ! you have to check this company out , they are great !
initially this product was great i was very pleased with my purchase the met my needs for a slim line computer case and was easy and comfortable to carry -lrb- in two ways even -rrb- the only thing i put in the bag is my macbook pro i have used the bag for two months and it is already ripping where the shoulder strap meets the lining of the bag , so much that i will not longer be able to use the bag i am not able to return this item b/c the return window is over , so i am very disappointed i would not purchase this product if you are hoping for something that will last
less than three months after i purchased this laptop case , the zipper as well as the long strap have broken look elsewhere for a sleek yet sturdy case that can better withstand weekly commutes and the occasional trip
aesthetically pleasing bag -- nice design , lovely color <unk> , not so pleasing i bought this bag a while ago and just recently returned it the reason being was that , after a couple weeks of using it , my laptop suffered its first drop due to the strap breaking it would have been understandable had i been carry a ton of items in the bag , but in my case , i only had my laptop and charger i am very displeased and am once again on the look out for another laptop bag/case
very disappointed because it was almost a good product the basic design is perfect for my needs : light weight , thin , nicely padded , pits my laptop and cable with room for couple pens , paper the problem is the construction both the handle and the shoulder straps eyes are just single stitched into the seams i can tell just by looking at it that those seams will blow out and the bag will become trash ... it would not have added much to manufacturing costs to reinforce the seams that will bear weight my advice : spend $ # more and get a bag that will
this is much too big for the # -inch macbook pro -lrb- retina display -rrb- if there were a velcro strap inside to hold it in place , it might be ok , but as is , there is so much space that it moves around when you walk i was disappointed
i was so disappointed when i tried to use the bag i got it on time and it looked just as described - very attractive it was delivered on time and i was ready to give it a # -star rating but somehow , i did n't use it until about a month after i bought it from amazon two days after i started using it , the bag broke and spilled all my stuff in the middle of the road i was shocked other than my macbook pro and power supply , i only had my cellphone and a composition notebook with a couple of pens inside it it 's pretty to look at , but is not worth it if you want something to sling over your shoulder and now the amazon return center says my return window has expired , so i 'm stuck with the useless bag it will work as a laptop <unk> , so i might just use it as that even though that 's not what i <unk> for
i purchased this bag in advance of receiving a # & # # ; macbook pro for work after receiving it i returned it , unused , because it seemed rather thin to carry around for work i 'm uncertain of the protective aspects of this bag , but the padding was light , and i was n't convinced i would be able to carry all my work paraphernalia in this bag . namely the power cord <unk> i really liked it i just did n't think i could haul a mouse , the power adapter , and various accessories that i use regularly for work
i like the look and the size after a week the shoulder strap came out of the seam i had it sewed back in and it now has been fine for several months
i really like the bag , but in the picture it shows a lighter gray when i received mine yesterday i thought they sent me the wrong color , because it is definitely brown it 's a lighter grey brown i suppose , but definitely not the grey in the picture
this is a good looking bag i gifted it to my friend for his macbook pro and he loves it . # inch mbp fits fine and bag is easy to carry
bought it for my # & # # ; slim toshiba protege after browsing through hundreds of similar products the price was reasonable it 's a little larger than i had wanted , but nice to have that extra room for the power cord to fit in without making the bag too <unk> up the online image appeared to be grey , but the product is green in reality , which was a bit of a surprise , but the color is nice enough for me to like it the side compartments are nice , but my favorite feature is the side handle so i can easily pick up the laptop <unk> just wish there 's a bit more firmness to the padding the bag does n't appear bent when i wear it on my shoulder , even though my laptop is pretty light i am pretty pleased with this buy
this case fits my # . # inch laptop perfectly , is very lightweight and looks great the shoulder strap , however , feels weak as the clips are made of plastic like many other bags i recommend replacing the plastic clips and loops with something stronger . other than that , i have no complaints and this is definitely worth the price
this a slim , lightweight and simple case well padded and does the trick if you do n't plan on rough handling i 'd prefer a nicer looking strap , but for the light weigh , ease of use and price i 'm very pleased
this was exactly what i expected fits my laptop very well and keeps it protected the only reason i gave it # stars instead of # is because i wish the handle was on the long side instead of the short side because it is hard to grasp when its hanging on your shoulder
looks good , slim and stylish easy to carry with blue color is cool . cons not sure of quality and longevity of product lets see how long it will last the phone and other front pocket pouches i saw in the previous photos is missing shoulder strap seems to be poor planning to go ahead with this product , as i might carry it in back pack and add another layer of protection
i love it i just received it and it 's exactly what i was looking for all i needed was a lightweight case to tote my dell xps # <unk> around i can fit my power cord and perhaps a compact mouse , battery or storage that 's all i need ! love the color -lrb- grey -rrb- and fabric too
i really like the quality of this sleeve , and the fact that it has both a handle and a shoulder strap -lrb- which i do not use -rrb- bonus , i can fit my ipad in the pocket and bring documents with me and leave the laptop home it fits my new hp ultrabook like a glove , but it is still very easy to insert and remove it solid value too
great product , communication with seller is spectacular , my only concern is that the color i expected did not match the picture the bag seems to be a bit greenish grey rather than a light grey like the picture displayed
very lightweight and my laptop fits in nice and snug there 's enough room in the front pouch to fit the charger and my cellphone charger as well without it becoming super bulky
oh my gosh i can not say enough about how much i love this laptop envelope i just went on a road trip and never worried for a moment about my macbook pro or my new kindlefire , which were both protected perfectly in this padded envelope case of course , i love the color , but more than that , i love that the inside of this envelop case is padded for extra protection of my precious macbook pro the front zippered pouch held my # . # inch kindlefire easily , which made it great for me that they were both easy to get to and were perfectly protected
this is the perfect fit for my # & # # ; laptop the side handle is what really sells it i wanted something to keep it safe and free from dust around the house and yet could travel
this is exactly what i needed the fabric has a bit of a green tinge to it , but it still looks fine i got it in a few days and tried it out on my laptop it does work for # . # i have an hp envy # t the fabric feels real -lrb- rather than the fake foam kind of sleeves -rrb- and is high quality the extra pockets are perfect for usb drives , small cords , and possibly a charger this is a great deal for protecting your laptop :
this laptop shoulder bag is a great travel companion arrived on time and was exactly as described adorable envelope theme , sufficient padding material and highly convenient compartments for charger , notebooks , pens etc . great price for this high quality product
i have a # . # inch laptop and it fits perfectly in this bag -- not too tight or anything if you have a # in . it might be a little roomy in there i love the side carrying handle and that it comes with a shoulder strap as well the envelope pocket on the side is just big enough for my charger i ca n't really fit anything else in it but i do n't need to so far it is holding up well time will tell if it stays in good condition and holds up i travel often and needed a good bag for my laptop i would recommend this bag though because the price is good and it looks great
i bought this for my # & # # ; wacom drawing tablet to protect , carry and store it though it 's not made for this <unk> , it does wonderfully it is well designed with lots of space to put cords , stylus , etc . it 's moderately thick and softly padded -- more protective than a neoprene sleeve but of course less protective than a full blown laptop case it 's also stylish -- i got the gray color and it looks great
my toshiba satellite fits perfectly into it with a little room compact and enough space for <unk> and charger and i like the option of the handle i read the reviews before purchasing the bag and someone stated it was green but several nice people wrote that it was n't green and it was the exact color as shown on amazons screen i would not have purchased the bag if it was green
bag is really functional classy cushions and holds my dell # inch laptop well and the pocket has just enough room for a spiral notebook and pen i 'm not sure about carrying a charger because the it looks nice as sleek , a charger would leave an awkward bulge
i love the handle at the end and the strap to change it up if i want to it fits my # . # laptop to a & # # ; t & # # ; and the side pocket holds my charger with no problem it is a fun color and size i like that made well , true color , i would buy another one
this is exactly what i was looking for to carry my work laptop to and from work love the area to put extra papers and pens for the additional things i need to bring home with me
very handy , big enough to fit xtra things in love the extra zipper pocket on the back & the fold on the front wish they came in more colors recommend for everyone
love the fit of my computer in this bag i have the # inch macpro with retina display laptop it fits in with the hard case cover -lrb- mosiso -rrb- and the neoprene sleeve -lrb- incase -rrb- , which is a plus -lrb- like that i can add extra protection -rrb- love that the envelope velcro pocket can easily fit three of my accessories - charger , superdrive , and <unk> <unk> -lrb- stand used to lift computer up to keep it cool -rrb- in it the design and color is as advertised the bag has a beautiful sleek design that does n't add bulk and has space to carry extra items
we are very happy with our new laptop case it is exactly what we wanted it is padded on the inside and perfect for our laptop the size is just right this is a great deal for the money
i 've been toting a huge laptop bag for months for my ultrabook and had been actively searching for a replacement this <unk> case was the perfect fit fit my lenovo thinkpad carbon perfectly with just enough room left over for the occasional printed report pocket for my phones and key drives and such so thin and being able to carry it in a folio format is so much easier to manage on the <unk> <unk>
i needed something compact , lightweight and easy to carry plus , i wanted a color i could find in a hurry i do not know how waterproof or repellant it is , have n't put to the test in a storm but i expect it will shed all but the heaviest , prolonged rain since it is nylon i like the zippered top and side pockets it fits my needs
the price was right , and i now use it everyday to take my # inch mac and ipad back and forth to work quality of materials is fine not well padded but that is why it is light
it was just what i was looking for i wanted something to carry my laptop that looked somewhat professional but still casual i like the top carrying handle ; i do n't use the strap and just removed it i carry a laptop around from meeting to meeting , and it saves me from having to hold it in my hand all the time and provides some additional protection i use it with a ~ # in hp laptop , and there is plenty of room to spare i do wish the sleeve was a little bit smaller so that i could fit it into my main work bag more easily so far , it is holding up well
my first order was lost by amazon or the shipper but finally it was replaced and i am quite happy much smaller looking since their is no wasted space nice since i try to have a low carryon profile for foreign travel
this laptop case fits my macbook pro retina -lrb- # -inch -rrb- perfectly i get so many complements on it at work and everyone wants to know where i got it this is very handy for times when i 'm at work and need to take my laptop to a meeting i found it so cumbersome to try to carry my laptop , coffee , and then badge into doors all at the same time this is no longer a problem for me
this is a glorified dust cover it was too big for the macbook with retina display -lrb- no disk drive -rrb- and was too thin to provide anything other than scratch <unk> it was very cute though
this was somewhat roomy for the macbook pro # inch i thought this would have the same exterior as incase or case logic it is not entirely soft to the touch i did not appreciate the <unk> feeling of the bag the interior appeared to be ok i had to return it because it was not exactly what i was looking for
looks so cute in the picture , but the fleece lining is a gross mustard yellow and the plastic outside smells like a new <unk> it 's too big for my macbook pro # inch retina laptop too
four months later and the zipper is dead two months into using the product , the zipper began to pull at the material and little by little , the zipper has <unk> now it gets completely stuck and i need to purchase a new one come to think of it , i think the zipper has always been a serious issue but i forced myself to not think about it too much because of the adorable print if i could go back in time , i would not <unk> it a bit of a waste now
i bought this specifically for my wife 's # . # & # # ; mbp -lrb- late # -rrb- and while the fabric inside and out is nice , the fit is rather poor even though the title says # . # & # # ; , i was n't expecting there to be such a wide gap inside
my laptop is a # . # inch , and the other reviews said it fit those comfortably it does not fit and i ca n't zip it other than that , the product is nice
the sleeve is made from good-quality material and fits my # & # # ; laptop nicely my only note would be that it does n't look as nice as it does in the picture so i was a little disappointed when i first saw it but i 've grown to like it and am happy i made the purchase
i love the print , the construction is solid , the padding and soft inside lining are great just keep in mind that the macbook air fits , but it 's not snug
i gave only four stars , because the material of the out surface is not as expected , it was a little sticky when i first opened it , and also smelled a little weird , something like rubber but the inside is great , fluffy , and good for protecting laptop from scratching i also love the color and the the pattern , which is bright and so cute
the case fits my laptop perfectly and the pattern is beautiful , but the case smells strongly of tires -lrb- like the kind you have on your car -rrb- i think this will fade with time , but it put me off at first you may want to let it air out for a few days before you use it
loved my sleeve for my mac the fabric outside was a little rougher than i though , but the inside is nice and soft and i think it 'll protect my mac nicely :
i really liked the design and i was n't let down by how beautiful it was the inside keeps my mac from getting scratched , which is what i wanted since i 'm having to constantly take it back and forth to school i was expecting the inside to be a bit thicker and it 's obvious it wo n't protect the laptop if it 's dropped , though maybe there 'll be a little less damage my mac fits perfectly in it , though overall , i was satisfied by how quickly it arrived and i love it . :
i choose it because of the outside appearance the appearance is nice as i expected and the quality is great however , it may be a little heavier than i thought it would be
have n't used this in the rain yet but the touch and feel of it is really good the inside comes with soft fur - i was surprised because i did n't remember reading it in the product description the zipper is both strong and smooth functioning i 'd definitely recommend this product however , i give a # -star rating since it 's only been a month or so since i bought this , and like i said , i have n't tested it in rain yet
fits my sony vaio fit # perfectly and the design is adorable the color is n't as bright in real life and it smells a bit but its not a big
it 's great the outside is <unk> , the inside is soft and the whole case is flexible i use it for my macbook air and it fits well , although there 's a little bit of wiggle room since the air is so thin
i really like this case cute and protective the only thing i would change suggest is to include a removable shoulder strap it would be nice to have that option at times
i was looking for a fun case to protect my laptop when i took it to work and this did the trick unfortunately , it seems to be designed for the # & # # ; macbook pro i have a # & # # ; macbook and it does seem a little too large for it
love this neoprene sleeve / case for my new apple laptop , plenty of room since it is a # in air , computer slips easily in and out , zippered top for security -lrb- ca n't fall out -rrb- fits easily into larger bag for transport pleasing pink and pattern high quality , highly recommend
got this for my wife to go with her new macbook air and she absolutely loved it perfect fit with a super soft interior the outside texture is smooth & not too squishy and <unk> like some neoprene sleeves this thing is a steal at $ #
i received the case and it is the same as the picture it fits mac air perfectly , and i am sure it will fit all # . # inch laptop it is a high quality bag , and does n't smell
i was so hesitant to purchase this case for my laptop because the inside looked like a really cheap foam but it is actually a really soft fur the outside is so durable , not to mention completely adorable the zipper is great quality and all around i am just so happy i chose this case you wo n't regret it either
this case is cute , lightweight , and did i mention cute i love it i bought this after buying a new macbook air i found myself getting paranoid every time i took it out somewhere because i was scared that i 'd drop or scratch it so i bought this case and i do not regret it this case keeps my mac safe , and looking cute at the same time the inside is soft so it wo n't scratch the outside of the computer , which is a huge pet peeve of mine i can not stand scratches i bought this with a pink snap on shell to match the only thing i wish this case had was some kind of handle to make it easier for carrying it around when it 's not in a purse or bag
i was hesitant to buy this case at first after reading negative reviews about the case being too big thankfully i ordered it and it 's perfect it fits my macbook pro # . # in perfectly very fast shipping and a study laptop case
wanted a laptop bag that will protect my laptop while in my backpack that would n't be too bulky love the design and the quality appears to be great the outside grips any surface well and the inside is very soft my lenovo ideapad # . # & # # ; laptop fits perfectly snug zipper appears to be quality
the case fits snuggly around my # . # & # # ; dell computer the design is cute , and despite what other reviewers said about a & # # ; smell & # # ; , there was nothing being <unk> from my case good buy , satisfied with purchase
i received this case the day after i ordered it i bought it for my macbook air a # and it is beautiful i was n't expecting the texture that it is , but i absolutely love the texture it 's nice and thick and fits my macbook air perfectly while it has a case on i 'll definitely be using this next year when i start commuting to college
i love this case , still i 've had it for over a year and it 's held up great it is a little roomy for my laptop but it 's an awkward size so i was expecting that the inside is super soft if you are prone to dropping your things , though , you might want something with a little more bulk i have no complaints though
this is a great laptop protective cover it is well insulated and provides adequate room for your lap top the outside layer is tough and the zippers are high quality i am very pleased with this purchase
totally happy with this item it is lined inside with a soft <unk> fabric and fits my computer nicely i think the color scheme is really close to what i saw on the computer , so i was pleased with that company sent a follow-up email after a little time to make sure i was satisfied with the item who does that anymore
arrived on time as expected the sleeve perfectly fit my yoga # pro # -inch laptop the padding inside kept my laptop cushioned and the outside material prevented it from getting wet from the rain recently serves its purpose
very well made and thick padding to protect your computer , so you can place it in any type of bag you want to carry or carry it as it is
the <unk> on this sleeve is really cute ; i 've gotten several compliments on it it is not the most padded laptop sleeve , but it 's plenty for me and i like the suede like lining inside which protects the laptop
the inside of this case is super soft and the outside is similar to a thick leather texture , i do not believe the outer cover i 'd leather , not sure what the material is it seems to be of good quality i havent had any issues with it
i was pleased with this item it actually seems a little better quality than i expected the outside appears to be water resistant and the inside has a nice plush lining
i was debating on getting this vs. a speck case of a similar style , and i was happy i went with this one the vinyl cover has protected my macbook pro from many spills and the soft inside protects my computer well the case has a tiny bit of wiggle room , perfect if you have a hardshell case on your mac
my wife loves this it protects her laptop without being bulky , and she gets tons of compliments on it everyone who sees hers wants their own the only downside is the nasty <unk> smell upon first opening the smell goes away after a month or so , though
my # & # # ; macbook fits perfectly , even with a shell on it i really like the exterior design and the material that it 's made from i 'm not a fan of the color on the inside , but it 's really soft
i got this as a gift for my fiancee and she absolutely loved it the pictures dont show you that the inside is made of <unk> golden velvet , which feels very nice and provides a good cushion for your laptop
the pictures of this laptop case look so pretty the real item is very stiff and the colors are really flat they do n't look like the pictures at all will send back asap
the product information states that this case will hold a macbook air i have the smallest macbook air on the market , and the case is about an inch too small to hold it i ca n't get it in there at all it 's a cute case and i wish it would fit , but it does not and i 'm disappointed
this was specifically described as the correct bag for an # . # inch netbook/laptop i have an # . # inch , very slim , laptop i could barely slide it into the case , but could not zip it without scratching the corners of the machine i was very disappointed , because i really liked the look of the bag glad amazon makes returns easy
we loved how this looked and felt but within two weeks -- despite very little actual use and no traveling -- some of the stitching has started to come undone and a couple of teeth from the zipper are broken they are great about returns though
this item states it fits # . # & # # ; laptops but it does not fit my new # . # & # # ; lenovo yoga # the problem is that the corners of the sleeve are too rounded and my laptop has <unk> corners so i 'm unable to get the corners of the fabric over the corners of the computer also even if it had fit , the outside fabric is very rough , i guess i expected it to be smooth
this is a nice protective case , but is relatively slippery and easy to drop it would be perfect if it had a light duty clip-on shoulder strap or a clip on handle that could be removed if not wanted
it was the right size to fit my # inch macbook pro it does n't have the most protective inside , but i figure it works just fine for what i need it is a nice pattern i would recommend it
the product is really cute , and the padding it thick enough that i 'm confident my computer is protected from minor bumps however , i have an # . # inch laptop and it 's a very tight fit i honestly was n't able to get my laptop in at first i had to <unk> it out for a day i can get it in now , but it 's still not with ease i 'm hoping that over time it 'll stretch out more
it does not fit my # . # & # # ; notebook i will need a bigger size and not as happy with the color as i thought i would be -lrb- but that is a personel preference
we got it ... a bit small for our laptop not bad though the main complaint is the smell it has an extremely chemically smell at first its been about a week and its still a little rough once it airs out it is super cute and perfect
i purchased this sleeve to protect my # inch macbook air so far it 's doing what it 's supposed to do my computer fits perfectly inside and it seems to be well made ; no frayed ends or loose threads upon first glance i noticed that the colors are a little darker than they appear in the picture , but this was fine with me i also noticed that there are some subtle differences between the patterns printed on the photo , and the patterns printed on the sleeve that i purchased the inside is very soft and seems to do well in protecting my computer from scratches overall , i think its adorable , i 'm happy with this purchase , and i think you would be too
i get so many compliments on the laptop case the pattern is exactly as it was depicted in the image i like the thickness and also it leaves a little room around the edges of my laptop
i am really happy with the way the case looks , but width , length , and height are all just a little too big for the # in macbook air it 's nice being able to easily slide the computer in and out of the case , but i would prefer it if the case were just a little smaller the pattern is adorable though ! !
good price for a very nice looking sleeve a bit of a tight fit for my # . # & # # ; asus laptop , but should fit a macbook and any other laptop without a bulky battery very well
fits my laptop well and holds the power cord i was nervous since there was a lot of <unk> that it did n't fit other laptops i have a # . # inch toshiba satellite c # -a it 's nice and and keeps my laptop safe , plus it 's cute only downfall is the color is n't as bright as it appears in the picture good deal all around
i just both an mac air and of course wanted to protect it i love the color and pattern on it the inside is soft and protective the only improvement would be to have a strap or handles
