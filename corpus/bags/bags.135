i purchased this hardshell case for my daughter 's computer a few months ago she has always wanted something to protect her computer from scratches and this seemed as if it would do the trick when we received it , we found it very simple to install the case is made very well and the retractable legs come in handy if you want to elevate your computer a bit for easy use since it comes in so many different colors , you can really customize your computer my daughter selected a color that matched the color scheme of her bedroom since that is where she keeps her computer since the cover is not too thick , it still keeps the computer slim but yet protects it at the same time i would definitely recommend this item if you have a # `` macbook please be aware that this particular cover should be purchased only if you have the model # macbook
my son is taking a two year old macbook to college next year we learned from various ipods <unk> ect . that he needs a hard protective case for his electronics i was thrilled to find mcover still makes a hard cover for the old style macbook it fits perfectly , looks cool and will help my son both protect his laptop and identify it just what we needed
i ordered this case for my wife 's macbook , as soon she saw her computer loved it perfect fit , fashion look excellent color variety , could match your mood i 'm planning to buy more colors product greatly recommended
best case ever i love that it has the ability to stand up to help keep the computer cooler i have not had a problem with this case and would highly recommend it
love the way it protects and keeps it stylish all at the same time the `` feet `` in the back help keep my hand position comfortable for those long periods of time
i was a bit worried it would n't fit my # white macbook because it is a fairly old model and not many accessories are available for it anymore but it fit like a glove i got the package pretty fast considering i 'm overseas -lrb- took a week to get to the uk -rrb- now i 'm happy i <unk> my mac , cleaned it up and it 's now protected in fashion :
the seller shipped quickly and the case was exactly as described i love the purple color it came with a keyboard cover , which was awesome , and the retractable feet are really helpful as my mac overheats easily i def . recommend it
due to the expensive prices of macs , it is <unk> that you protect your mac with a cover this one is less expensive than the ones from the apple store , and arrive very quickly in the mail if i had known of these hard covers before , i would not have broken my last mac which was just # years old the hard shell protects your mac from scratches , especially when traveling the keyboard cover protects your keys from moisture damage which is the reason why i had to replace my last mac you quickly get used to typing on a cover once water damages a mac keyboard , it is not <unk> at mac so , it 's definitely a small investment in extending the life of your mac , and <unk> it 's looks the colors are a fun way to dress up your lap top , especially since lap tops have become an accessory with their portability
bought this for my wife 's laptop which had become somewhat dingy looking over the years put this shell case on -lsb- which fit perfectly , by the way -rsb- and it really <unk> up the looks of the computer it 's actually beautiful now she 's happy and i 'm happy <unk> well ! !
i love it ! the shipping was really fast i bought this cover # month go and it is very useful this cover is great to protect your mack and also the color it is really beautiful i really recommend it
i am very happy with this very reasonably priced computer case it keeps my computer safe and there is such a variety of vibrant colors that choosing one made my computer look very individual i also like the `` legs `` that keep my macbook from overheating in addition the hard plastic case arrived in a clear , soft plastic carrying case that i find very useful when i travel
i bought this strap because the really comfortable elastic strap that came with my computer bag had worn out the <unk> strap is a joke compared to my old strap it may look cool , but is pretty much useless it has almost no <unk> to <unk> weight , and the air pocket design is nowhere near as good as a neoprene pad
if you are looking for a heavy-duty laptop strap , the <unk> <unk> strap is for you unfortunately , i was looking for a much simpler strap this strap feels almost as heavy as my laptop case and is very bulky the `` <unk> `` logo also really stands out it reminds me of those huge , fat laptop cases that i see people carrying that are so full they ca n't even zip any of the compartments
this strap is `` heavy duty `` in its construction , and handsome in its appearance i used it to replace the lame stock strap on my tumi attache the first few times i used it , it was comfortable enough , but only marginally effective at <unk> the load the bungee did n't seem to have enough `` give `` . i 've have since manually stretched it out to help brake it in , and that has helped works best under the heaviest loads excellent product , which i hope will improve as it ages
very comfortable , very sturdy and high quality bought it for a caselogic dslr camera bag , makes it feel as light as air a bit large and a little inflexible which makes it stick out in front of and behind my shoulders , but this is not an issue if you wear the strap across your chest overall i would
this is actually my second one i have purchased the first one lasted about # years until a tear in the strap since i liked the comfort and price , i figured why not order the same one the new one is actually a <unk> version of the original one of # years ago the stitching and material have been upgraded its still a very comfortable strap i highly recommend it
this is a very heavy duty shoulder strap , and would likely support # ~ # lbs the suspension system is also quite nice , and makes the strap feel like it 's not there the attachment clips are metal , and heavy duty as well the only downside to this is that i am a tall guy , and the strap is just a bit short fully extended , the strap is about # `` long if it were # ~ # `` long , it would have been perfect
this is the best made laptop strap out there the clips , shoulder pad and strap are all very high quality the shoulder pad does not float on the strap , instead you adjust the strap on either side to keep it centered the material under the shoulder pad prevents the strap from slipping off your shoulder which is really nice if you have a nice bag , but the strap is iffy , or need a new strap , give this one a look
first of all i did n't like the color , i was expecting olive green the design to me is very ugly and the material seems to me not durable and even <unk> it is totally different to the picture i 'm disappointed
i did n't have the bag for a week before the female snap tore off the picture is also misleading , i thought the laptop might slide in <unk> but no it is a normal shaped case
not to crazy about it but i guess it was # . # because of it 's ugly color over all i would recommend this product to a friend if <unk> would need a bag that can not really feet in the other bag safe case for your laptop i got it for mac book # ``
the built laptop sleeve was just what i needed to protect my pc from scratches or other possible damages while on travel the strap is very ergonomic as well i saved up to $ # compared to the original price from the built website thank you amazon for <unk> me with finding a great deal
i 've been hunting some time for messenger styled bags for my # inch macbook and had been considering dropping a hundred bucks on a timbuk # boy am i glad i took a chance on this $ # bag it fits my computer perfectly and is a <unk> green color with a comfortable shoulder strap it 's true that the photo is slightly misleading as my computer fits horizontally , not vertically , but i do n't mind and the color is a tad brighter green than the olive it suggests , but i do n't mind that , either it 's a solid bag that can go with a funky dress style as i ride my bike to the local coffee shop , just as easily as it can be made to look stylish with a more conservative look it comes with an inner foam core , just to retain its shape during shipping , but i 've decided to keep it as extra protection next to the laptop if you 're someone who wants slightly off beat but very practical , pull the trigger it 's worth the money
i wanted a neoprene case to protect my laptop while traveling , something that would fit into a larger bag or could be carried alone this bag is perfect in addition to having a place for the laptop , there is a pouch where you could put your charger , ear buds , etc . also , love the green
this carrying case is fun and functional i got it for my # `` macbook pro and it fits nicely with some room to spare i love that there is an outside pocket for the cord and any other small things i might want to carry with me the handles and shoulder strap are very comfortable and seem to be durable i have no complaints and i love the <unk> color
well i got ta admit it , i purchased this bag planning to buy a # `` or bigger <unk> , and ended up buying a netbook -lrb- but that 's another story -rrb- pros * protective place , room , compartiment , whatever is called for the laptop * lots of pockets -lrb- more than # i guess * a # `` laptop can fit inside this <unk> 's all i remember ... : <unk> * the belt 's rings are made of plastic -lrb- i bought it thinking they were metallic * looks huge while carrying it * it 's huge recomended if you have a normal laptop or if you are big
i bought this thinking that i can use it as `` messenger bag `` as advertised boy was i <unk> when i <unk> box ! it 's huge and not well made it 's bigger than my carry on be careful putting anything in outside pocket , it opens side way i <unk> that this thing is really swiss it 's made in china , again cheap and very big it 's only for tall people -lrb- # feet -rrb- and taller not anything like in picture on amazon site
in my opinion , i think the bag is worth it it 's very convenient for students because it is spacious on the inside , extra small pockets for your coins and stationary , and it has a laptop section what more do you need
this is a nice backpack , but i 'm disappointed because i was looking for a laptop backpack and this does not have a compartment to protect a laptop it is titled incorrectly , hence just the # star as i have to now return it and look for another one
amazon should <unk> to promote this backpack as laptop backpack did they -lrb- amazon -rrb- check about the function of this backpack i had wenger laptop backpack and it 's far apart from this one mine have a sleeve inside of the backpack to protect the laptop not like this one this is only ordinary backpack , so if you looking for laptop backpack look somewhere
the way its advertised and the sale price they have on it really puts you off its not a laptop bag , there is no sleeve for it and i dont think its as big as it looks in the pics at this website except that it is good and decent and has the pretty features which are described about the product anyway bottom line - needed backpack for laptop and books this <unk> fulfill my
as others have reported , this is not built specifically for laptops there 's nothing on the manufacturer 's tags that say laptop there 's no reason why amazon should be calling it this it 's a sturdy backpack , but nothing about it indicates it 's designed for laptops
this is simply a backpack and not for laptops as advertised it is a nice looking and sturdy backpack , but does not have any built in pockets or support for a laptop therefore , i am disappointed with the backpack and how it was described on amazon
i 'm disappointed the bag 's advertised as a laptop bag but there is no protective cushioned compartment that i expected it is a great and sturdy backpack but it 's not for <unk> around a laptop without a neoprene sleeve if this would come with a notebook sleeve , i would have given it a # stars
i bought this for my son to use as a school backpack and we 're very satisfied with the construction , looks and durability it has a few compartments for different supplies , a sturdy handle if you do n't want to wear it on the back and comfortable on the back
this is an excellent case i own a macbook , bought this case and i 'm <unk> with it it has a soft material inside that protects your mac from scratches and dirt , the front pockets are specifically design for the mighty mouse and the charger of the mac i recommend this product without hesitation buy it , you wo n't regret
when i just want the essentials for my macbook , this is what i reach for the quality construction and portability make it the perfect choice it 's light enough to not add bulk , but it does a great job of protecting its contents it 's three pockets are enough to hold a few papers , a charger , and an ipod or camera the shoulder strap is <unk> which gives even more carrying options . the handles tuck in so they are n't in the way the first time i used it , i knew the construction was high quality and would n't fall apart it fits snugly on my macbook and is perfect for just the essentials . all in all , a great buy for the money
the macbook pro is supposed to use its aluminum case to cool down with this attached your are protecting the exterior from watch and <unk> scuffs and scratches , but you are also reducing the ability of the macbook to cool properly i could definitely tell the difference on mine after a couple of weeks , the glue seemed to start giving up any way and the corners began to peel up i really do like how the touchpad protector feels and works
purchased this for my macbook pro i 've been using the same the protection pack for couple years and love it looks real nice with the older silver keyboard -lrb- newer models have black keyboard -rrb- it fits pretty nice and it holds up to everyday use it has a thin padding to it , so it 's very comfortable on the palms of your hands it also includes a micro cloth like screen <unk> cover which is kind of useless it 's hard to close the lid with the cloth in between it 's just a tad bit too thick and will not latch unless you press down hard on the lid just take the time to apply the pad cause the adhesive is strong best to start around the track pad first and then work your way towards outward
marware protection pack for macbook pro # `` pricey but a very good product i have been using this to keep the oil from my fingers off my monitor on three different macbooks over the past # years
i am addicted to my macbook pro only when you tend to use the computer for that many hours that i do then it can hurt a bit on your wrists when they rest on the edge of the computer with this protective package you <unk> this problem on top of that it prevents smudges getting on your computers it is a small price for maintaining your computer that i can recommend to
just put mine on today , and i must say , it makes for a much better comfort experience of course , you lose out on the clean look of the interior of the macbook pro , but if you are working hours on your macbook pro , it 's definitely functional i also want to prevent staining on my system as my last laptop had the <unk> worn away due to my sweaty palms , and this meets the need just fine plus , with the new macbook pro 's out , you can get these for cheap nowadays
the marware protection pack goes on pretty easy and do n't worry if you mess it up the first time , it peels right back off , without leaving a sticky residue and goes right back on the track pad protector is a bit tricky to get use to the new feel of but will save your computer from getting as dirty or scratched
when i had my powerbook i discovered my hands had eaten a little into the metal casing where i often rested my wrists -lrb- too much gaming i guess -rrb- i was determined not to do the same to my macbook pro and picked up this product its fantastic ! nice soft pads that are easy to clean i also like the touchpad cover , i was really surprised that it did n't cut down on the speed or response at all i was n't so interested in the button cover it fit well but i like the <unk> touch of the non protected one too much to use it
this case is as sleek and beautiful as it is presented on-line however , it is not very durable and in fact it is of such poor quality that it has already cracked in three places this was rather disappointing considering that i do n't move around with my lap top a lot i use it primarily at home so there is no other explanation for it falling apart except that it is poorly made my advice -- do n't get <unk> in by the case 's beauty save yourself the trouble and just do n't order it
i got a new macbook air for christmas and ordered this case to protect it i love the cover and the color but it does not fit the new air - you cant plug in the power cord with the case on it i am going to have to return it :
my wife 's macbook air had been getting scratched and she even bent one corner when she dropped it , -lrb- just one corner of the lid -rrb- , even though she had a soft sleeve to carry it around the problem was when the computer came out of the sleeve with this hard case , it never comes off and the case takes the abuse , not the computer my wife loves the red color and because it is translucent , the apple light and the computer surface can still be viewed the case actually hides the majority of <unk> that were <unk> before we installed it unfortunatly , the case is taking all the abuse now , and yes , it has a lot of scuffs and scratches now but it is holding up very well and has no cracks or chips we are very happy with this hard case and i recommend it to even those who use a soft carry case or back pack to keep the unit safe and scratch free
i looked around and this is the only macbook air case that appealed to me i was looking for a fashionable , removable case to protect the unit from scratches and smudges , so this fit the bill unlike other reviews , i have no problems with the fit -lrb- it snapped on and fit like a glove -rrb- or removal for cleaning the color really pops -- although described as cranberry , it 's more like a glossy candy apple red color i was torn between this color and the purple one ... and opted with cranberry and it looks so much better in person than on this picture it shows fingerprints , but it comes with a microfiber cloth that works wonders after each use -- which is a good habit anyway all ports are accessible extra weight is added , but for me , it 's negligible as another reviewer mentioned , i have the solid state drive , so the case 's effects on operating temperatures is also negligible i love it as my rating implies
this is a well constructed bag but has a fatal design flaw the shoulder strap can not be adjusted more than a few inches as it is based on a velcro strap design which is not designed to be adjustable at all
the case itself is basically functional , a slightly tight fit for my # . # `` asus , but my real issue is that the red pattern that i was assuming was printed is actually a very shiny plastic
this bag was nice and lightweight however , i wish it had more pockets , specifically an external one that can be accessed without going under the flap aside from the padded laptop sleeve , it only has two pockets , both of which are under the the flap if you are a woman who <unk> to use this bag as a combo <unk> , these pockets are really not large enough for smaller items + things that require easy access -lrb- like wallet and cellphone -rrb- the other thing that is not clear from the description is the material used for the red design -- it is a plastic-y overlay which may not appeal to everyone i did n't mind it too much -lrb- after all it is a very casual bag -rrb- and the bright color scheme got a lot of complements
for a # foot # gal i found the bag to be a bit bulky it was hard to fit my lunch in the bag along with a computer but for those who want protection there 's a lot of padding it is really cute though
first of all , i 'd like to be clear that this bag is very good quality the fabric is thick and <unk> , and there is a mountain of padding in it so that you can put your laptop in there without a <unk> cover and have no worries the stitching seems like it will hold for years to come and the design of the pockets is functional and generous what one may not be prepared for , however , is how big the bag truly is all of the padding makes it full-sized even when it 's not carrying any items the bag is a very deep bag to begin with , and the padding just takes away any `` <unk> `` that you could <unk> by keeping the bag mostly empty as for the material , it 's durable , but it sort of feels like a raincoat because it 's a little <unk> the strap had enough adjustment range for me , but the velcro worries me a little if you 're wearing a sweater and have your strap adjusted , the velcro will be exposed and will easily snag your clothes since there is no cover provided for the velcro the bag is definitely durable enough to handle heavy loads , i just wish it did n't look like it was carrying a heavy load when it 's practically empty
i love my bag the shoulder strap is comfortable and it has compartments for most of my stuff the only thing is that i can fit my computer , the plugs and maybe a notebook into my back , but i wish i had more room so that i do n't have to carry two bags
bought this for my girlfriend and she loves it it is well made for it 's price and i do n't mean it is cheap i would expect this quality from a `` higher priced company that starts with tim and ends with <unk> . it has double stitching in stress areas and the material is heavy cordura type , and able to provide the usage required from this type of product flap closes with velcro and the strap adjusts with velcro a previous reviewer had knocked it for the velcro catching on her sweater , but i think it can be easily avoided by placing a piece of blank backed velcro in the place of the exposed area the pockets are of a good size and location , and the laptop pocket is padded as compared to other bags this is a very nice bag
when i saw this bag it jumped out at me i really liked how it was so bright in colors and how it had lots of little compartments i had just bought a new laptop so i was searching for a bag i decided on this one and it fits perfectly ! the only downside of this bag is it 's really big and bulky even when my laptop was n't in it one time i was carrying it inside the store and a worker asked me if i had packed my room in there ! ! so just a heads up if your thinking of buying this it 's kinda big : -rrb- . i also carry it around sometimes without my laptop in it because there is so much space in it i really like everything about this except the <unk> ! so i think this would be a great bag for a student or employee who needs to have papers and workbooks with them including their laptop because there really is space for that
i wanted a laptop bag that did n't need an additional sleeve and this one is perfect i 've traveled a lot this summer and have been able to carry my wallet , glasses , wireless mouse , etc . easily the front pockets kept my boarding pass easy to access , as well as my lip gloss , gum , pens , mobile phone , room for lots of stuff plus it 's a <unk> bag , received loads of compliments
this is an awesome bag it 's very bright , which is the way i wanted it , with a soft interior for your laptop it 's very spacious , with plenty of room for your laptop , cooling pad , cords , a mouse , and much more there are # interior pockets plus # smaller pockets in front one of the front pockets it <unk> off too keep fragile items from bumping into each other
i have to carry my # `` laptop everyday and i 'm glad i found this bag into the big second compartment would also fit a ring binder or e.g . lunch and a water bottle the shoulder strap is big enough and comfortable , the fabric is strong and well processed the manufacturer says you can not wash it , but i removed <unk> some staining with a normal sponge and <unk> water and besides ... the color gives me always a smile
i bought this laptop bag as a gift for my mother her response was thank you soo much for the bag for my computer it is perfect i love the colors and all the pockets my computer fits perfectly in it it is very cool thank you , thank you , thank you
i love this bag ! i got it for my dell latitude d # laptop and it fits perfectly ... stays secure with the inner velcro closure and drawstring i can also fit several other things in it as well such as books , folders , my phone , pda , pens , etc . . it is made of very durable material and i know it will last me a long time it is absolutely beautiful and really stands out from the drab <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> of most laptop bags i would recommend this # % !
i bought this bag because the review were great and the color looked awesome , but was worried because there were not many pictures on any site of the inside of the bag it is perfect it fits my laptop and a a fairly large textbook as well as my wallet and cord and such i could not be more pleased i get lots of great comments , and the price was super good too
this bag is fantastic the color is so vibrant , and the bag is the perfect size to carry laptop and all the cords , surge protectors , mouse , etc . very comfortable strap if you like color , you 'll love it
i wanted a case that made me smile every time i had to pull my computer out for grad school work and this fit the bill perfectly it 's kind of silly and bright but it makes me happy , and other people like it too i do n't carry my laptop around a ton , so i did n't need something super heavy duty - this worked well for my needs it fit my computer well , and still looks good a couple of years later
vibrant color , durable and unique the gold color has started to fade in the corners but considering i 've had this for a few years already , i 'd say it 's normal wear and tear
such a beautiful pattern , it reminds me of a <unk> fish i would recommend this to everyone who wants a stylish sleeve for their macbook you wo n't want to hide it in your bookbag
i love this laptop case it fit 's my laptop nice and snug , as it should the gold is more <unk> than in the picture to me , the picture looks more sunny yellow it is in fact closer to <unk> orange at first i was turned off but it has grown on me and i feel proud when i pull out my macbook never seen another one like it happy with the quality so far
not only is the case stylish , it also does a heck of a job protecting my macbook i get compliments all the time about it my only gripe is that the white zipper trim has gotten stained and dirty over time , and i 'm not sure how to clean it -- i do n't want to mess it up and , as other reviewers have noted , you have to be careful zipping around the corners , because the tighter fit can mean you accidentally nick your computer i 've done it a few times myself , whilst hurriedly zipping up to run for the train just remember to pull the zipper slightly away from the computer as you zip , and you 'll be fine updated to note ... a year and a half after the original purchase the sleeve was still going strong , but some of the zipper teeth separated , meaning i could not longer close it all the way i contacted <unk> <unk> customer service , and within a day they responded by sending me a brand new sleeve , no charge i am over the <unk> and now an even bigger fan . : d it 's not often you find a company this responsive major kudos , <unk> <unk> ! !
i purchased this bag as a gold box special when i needed to replace a # -year-old leather bag the layout of the swissgear bag is fine and and i was very pleased for the <unk> six weeks until one of the handles ripped off i know that swissgear has a reputation for durability and value but this bag is simply too light-duty for anyone who travels a lot or carries more than a laptop and a few papers
knowing the reputation of swiss , i purchased # for gifts imagine my <unk> i noticed my husbands was frayed and falling apart he then told <unk> the zipper broke almost immediately , and the handles did n't fall <unk> a couple of months ! ! ! ! i finally called swiss and they said <unk> , bring it in we will fix it or replace it it looks like it was put together by <unk> children in some no water <unk> and not up to swiss standards i will leave an <unk> i have taken it to swiss
bag is less than a month old and is already falling apart zipper broken , and hardly used , handle is coming off already i 'm starting to wonder if this is a cheap chinese knockoff and i got this for $ # not even worth that
this is a bag that gets an `` a `` for looks and organization , but do n't expect much in terms of quality the handle is already fraying on mine , and it has n't seen any heavy duty beyond being transported to and from work daily i plan to contact the manufacturer on their warranty for it
an interesting case first one of the pocket zippers seperated which i managed to <unk> and then one of the handles just seperated clean away from the bag and this was after i had only been using it for four weeks and six weeks after i bought it maybe <unk> this purchase
it 's a great quality padded briefcase unfortunately when i read the size it stated it could fit a # `` laptop , this was incorrect it wo n't fit in the laptop slot , but it does in fit in the bag the good thing is that its padded all over , i feel much more comfortable if it did fit where it is intended to be stored over all a very nice , compact and very neat bag the strap is not incredibly padded but i guess that would not matter much if it was a smaller laptop i really wanted to give it a great review , but it does not fit my main use at this time when i get a smaller laptop i will revise this review
the bag is a pretty nice size for people that do n't like to carry their entire lives with them as other reviewers have noted , a # `` screen laptop does n't really fit macbook pro users beware despite one review that claims it will fit , it does not i have a new unibody macbook pro and if you work at it and cram it in you can make it fit but the stitching on the sleeve is so stressed i do n't think it would last long i even tried my older macbook pro -lrb- which is not quite as wide -rrb- and while it was closer to fitting i still think it would fail however , if you have a # `` macbook , this might be the perfect case for you
this is a great bag for the price just wish my laptop fit in the sleeve i could n't find anything that said the maximum laptop size that would fit , so i went by the bag width of # `` , thinking the laptop sleeve would go from one side to the other well , it 's quite a bit smaller , and my # . # `` widescreen acer wo n't fit the built in sleeve the laptop is # . # `` wide , the sleeve will accept up to # . # `` wide which is about as small as you could make a # . # `` widescreen laptop i can still put it outside the sleeve , just would have been nice to know before hand , so beware
overall its a very good bag i like how it looks and i like all the compartments that it provides for storage of stuff however , the bag i got had a problem with the main compartment zipper as it would skip and come out on one side but it did not do that on the other side my # . # inch laptop fits a little snugly but it is fine as it does not wobble inside i got the back thinking it would look good on a business trip and that it does , but i was also thinking that i could have gotten a backpack version for the same price and it would had been more comfortable to carry around as i do
i purchased this as a gift for my husband as a lawyer , he needed something that was n't too loud or <unk> , but as a <unk> , he also did n't want anything that was leather i looked for a long time , and finally found this bag which fit all of his needs it is very well-made and obviously well-thought out there are several small compartments to allow for his various gadgets -lrb- blackberry , ipod , cell phone , etc . -rrb- and a padded compartment for his laptop he also appreciated the file organizer compartment which was large enough to hold all of his other items we got it on sale through amazon and it was a incredible bargain at the price we got
this is a great compact compter bag for the money i just went on an overseas trip and this bag was just the right <unk> along with my carry on luggage i have a # `` notebook which is the maximum size i would recommend with this bag
i bought this for my husband for christmas <unk> he did n't need a new bag he was <unk> with quality and thrilled to get it he now loves it and <unk> it was a great gift
low price for a well made computer messenger bag will hold your computer , a notebook , medium file folders , papers as well as pens and pencils and even you water bottle and mp # player the price is amazingly low for such great quality
i bought two swiss gear bags and this was the # st one it is good for light weight use once in a while but it can not take heavy books the seam started to come off the right strap after a while not recommended for heavy / regular use
this product breaks really easily i had the backpack about a week and it started to rip at the handles on the top it is also really large and hard to carry places
i 've never used a product i was so close to rating five stars before settling on two before this one the bag is great in a lot of ways the construction makes carrying heavy loads easy on your back there 's a lot of storage room and a variety of pockets ranging in sizes , including the handy <unk> pouch for mp # players however , after a week , i discovered that the bottom of the bag ruins cotton shirts because the mesh back there causes the shirt to pill and become rough it looks like the bag would eventually wear the shirt <unk> how swissgear does n't test for this sort of thing is mind <unk>
i was initially very happy with the design and look of the bag it looked very sturdy however , after # month 's usage , i discovered the right strap 's thread is starting to come off from the seam moreover , it 's not the usual strap that i normally used to carry the bag i used to carry a file and notebook i 'm truly disappointed as i had high regards for swiss gear 's product i initially thought of buying another smaller version but i do n't think so anymore - truly disappointed
i needed a bag to carry a thin laptop and a rather large binder the bag has a bunch of sections for small items , but not a really big section for big stuff i heard others say they put a bunch of textbooks in it , but i do n't know where the biggest section is no bigger than # or # inches the bag is listed as # inches thick , but half of that is padding i can fit my laptop and one # inch binder and that 's about it i think the part where the laptop goes is great , nice padding , it 's the back so it rests against your back if you wear it the shoulder straps a little too wide and are n't comfortable to wear really , i 'll end up carrying it like a piece of luggage using the top strap instead i was n't really interested in a phone or sunglasses holder so i guess those are good features if you need those
i have had this backpack for about a month and its <unk> pretty well i use it mostly for hauling my # . # `` studio # laptop couple notepads it has array of well labelled pockets for nick <unk> , but lacks in a proper bottle holder i sorely miss the bottle holder and the laptop fits just right , i do n't think this backpack will hold a even # `` laptop pros : compact size , lots of pockets and holders cons : i can see some threads coming from one one of the shoulder straps where it <unk> the backpack on top its alarming cause i had an idea that <unk> are rugged , no water bottle holder value for money : i bought backpack in red colour for -lsb- ... -rsb- bucks and its gorgeous to look and very comfortable so , its # star <unk>
i like this my laptop is a netbook , so perhaps i do n't need something quite so big , but i like it anyway i bought this for vacations , so it 's nice to have room for a couple of real books and a few other essentials ii 's a little odd that the phone pocket is inside the backpack instead of in an outside pocket , but that 's not a big deal there are plenty of pockets and zippers all over this thing there 's a <unk> hook and a keychain that hooks into the back pocket it 's well padded considering all the space and the padding , it 's not <unk> and it 's real red , not <unk> at $ # , the price is n't bad either
this is a very well made pack but it is quite large it is overkill unless you need a very large pack if you need large it 's nearly as good as it gets unless you need a <unk> pack with a frame they make a smaller bag with the same quality
this product looks really pretty . . with all the ultra cool swiss gear logos and zippers looks wise this bag is # on # functionality - big drawback is that it does not have a water bottle carrier even though they say it has the pockets on the side which are visible in the picture are on both side and theres no way one can put a bottle in that without it falling off . # on # here space wise it is good , but not a huge amount of space like what i had expected . # on # here durability - it looks as durable as durable can be : -rrb- # on # here overall i would give it a rating of # on #
very solid backpack for thinkpad i love separate storage for ipod only concern is , i used to carry laptop and slr in my old backpack but this does not help me to keep slr :
it 's been about four years since i bought this backpack and all i can say is that i 'm glad that i made that decision it has a tiny bit of wear and tear now , but that 's totally understandable the only issue that i have with the item is the plastic clasp that secures the computer compartment inside it broke within the first couple of weeks of using it -lrb- the main reason this is a # -star review instead of a # -star -rrb- besides that minor defect , this backpack has more than fulfilled my needs swissgear makes some good stuff
this bag is very well designed for a regular <unk> student with so many different pockets -lrb- with labels ! ! ! -rrb- for everything you can possibly think of , this bag is really useful looks good , feels great . very comfortable the capacity is also very decent till now i ` v had a really good experience with this bag it deserves # stars
this bag surprised me . the construction and durability are outstanding . plenty of pockets for everything from computer to snacks . heavy padding ensures safety for your computer from damage . very
this bag had me at hello it 's swiss and it 's red , the two big sellers also , living in the city , i really liked how the zippers are up high enough to deter pickpockets plus , i work in a school with <unk> and did not want to bring any home ... so the lack of holes were appealing also it 's a wonderfully sturdy bag and it 's cute too
i bought this bag to use for college and i love it extremely durable , looks cool and got it for a great price on amazon the only negative thing is the inside pockets that hold pens , pencils ... is very thin and ripped only after a couple of weeks still worth it and still deserves # stars
i 've had this for # days and one of the shoulder straps is separating from the body not thrilled and am worried what will be damaged when it comes completely apart
i got a great price on this and was initially very excited about this backpack it fits well , has a lot of useful pockets , space for # laptops , and there are a lot of bells and whistles that i like but within # weeks after i bought it i started to notice that the bag smells -- like socks that someone has worn for a couple of days not horribly funky but unpleasant i 've never kept anything except books and papers in it , have n't spilled anything , and <unk> have never made it into the bag has anybody else noticed this it 's in the interior of the bag , and it 's in all the compartments which makes me think it must be that the cloth they use to make the interior has a funky smell i 'm embarrassed to sit in class with it open because it really stinks ... so i keep my backpack zipped up whenever others are near i wonder if they will accept <unk> for such a strange reason , surely i am not the only one to notice it
overall , this is a nicely made backpack my two issues with it - # -rrb- the side pockets are too big for water bottles so if you know you 'll be carrying a water bottle around , this backpack is not for you # -rrb- the backpack appears to be quite large , but there is n't that much space inside i was able to fit a laptop + # <unk> notebooks , and fitting an extra textbook was a stretch
the price was good and the quality appears to be ok but i am returning this because # -rrb- i have both a # `` and a # . # `` notebook computer there is practically no protection for the top corners of either computer in the backpack this design seems to be quite common for many backpacks i really do not understand why a person may feel safe to put their valuable computer inside a backpack with similar design # -rrb- the shoulder straps are too wide for me it is not comfortable and i do not feel the backpack is secured <unk> on my shoulder i am <unk> ; this backpack may work better for a person bigger than me
