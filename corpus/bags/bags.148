my daughter likes that it fits her hp laptop snuggly and the extra pocket on the outside is nice for the cord and extras excellent quality and could n't beat the price
this is the perfect size for an ultrabook i love that it has a pocket for the charger but it 's still thin & light enough to carry around everywhere it has good padded protection which keeps my computer save i would recommend this product
this one can contain # `` laptop with a bit more space the outside looks clean and neat , and the inside feels soft and comfortable it is suitable for girls and for every occasion i think it is worth a nice reputation as well as its nice name
i 'm very disappointed by this sleeve when i first received it i believed it was a reasonably well padded case and was pleased with the design , however , the padding was a foam insert upon removing the foam insert i realized that the case is essentially two pieces of fabric sewn together with no padding i wo n't be using this on my macbook because it offers nothing beyond scratch protection this case is not worth
it fit my macbook pro perfectly love the print expect since it is faux fur i had horizontal <unk> that ran all over the outside even if i brushed it out or tried to smooth it out , it wo n't go to how it is suppose to be
i do n't regret buying this , but it 's not what i expected it 's not anywhere near as plush as the photo makes it look , but it is faux fur on the outside it 's more for a fashion statement than actual protection of your computer it has zero padding inside , and i mean zero it 's just faux fur and <unk> lining it is very cute , and looks good in my bedroom i only use it to store my laptop if i 'm not going to use it for a while , i would n't use it for traveling
i like it , it 's okay but i do n't trust it for my macbook pro it does n't have much padding to it maybe for a dell i would worry less but i payed far too much for my macbook to use this im getting a bookbook and my cat keeps laying on it ! how annoying
it looks just like the picture , but i was expecting a longer <unk> plush surrounding , but it is actually a short fuzz all around it but it still works well and fit my macbook pro with a case around it
it 's okay theres no padding in it to really protect the laptop but it 's really cute i like it , but i just wish it had more padding in it but i 'll get over it
i love this sleeve for my macbook it 's cute , adorable , and soft i get compliments from it all the time the only complaint i have is that it does n't have a padding inside to protect the computer -lrb- all my previous sleeves do -rrb- but if you want to make a fashion statement , this is it
i found that it came in a timely manner and was just what i was looking for reasonable price as well for a computer case and it came just as promised i am very satisfied with what i ordered
this little computer sleeve is great ! not only does it look awesome , it really protects my computer from scuffs and scratches it slips on and off quickly because of the long zipper
i 've looked for a perfect sleeve ever since i purchased my macbook and this one has definitely satisfied all of my requirements it 's stylish , works perfectly and is easy to clean there is nothing i could add to make it better
i just have received this sleeve yesterday i was wondering if it will fit my macbook pro . but it perfectly did even if am using skin for the laptop i am so satisfied with it , cute , good material , nice color and the most important thing that it protects the laptop because of the padding inside it add to that good price comparing to other sleeves , and fast shipping
i am absolutely in love with the case it 's super protective and well worth the money i wish it was a little bigger ... but it does exactly what it is suppose to
i got this along with my cheetah case , and it is so cute its just as the picture shows defiantly worth the buy price is a little expensive . <unk> its really cute
i originally bought if for my daughter and she did not want it i then used it for my laptop when she saw it she changed her mind and wanted the zebra print case back she loves it and <unk> a lot of compliments on it shipping was <unk> and a day early thank you , thank you , thank you for the great product and excellent service
cool that you do n't have to take your laptop out at airport security but the little air pockets <unk> pretty quickly which renders it next to useless as far as protecting your laptop goes
i travel quite a bit and have a laptop case that fits a # `` computer mine is a # `` -lrb- dell latitude e # -rrb- the <unk> fits it perfectly getting through tsa -lrb- thousands standing around -rrb- is pretty easy just remove the <unk> -lrb- with the laptop inside -rrb- and put it on the belt it does a good job of protecting the unit from <unk> ... both tsa 's and mine it is also handy if you want to take the laptop to another room and do n't want to pack it up in its carrying case we also have one of my wife 's netbook
a great sleeve i feel like the air cushioning -- because it is thicker -- provides better protection than the comparable neoprene sleeves the air pockets , however , are only on one side so if you 're not using this sleeve on the interior of a laptop bag , you may want to invest in something thicker for its purpose , though , it 's great as added protection in a bag and you do n't have to remove it at the airport
i really wanted to like this bag , but i had to return it after the clasp holding the strap broke before it broke , it would often simply come apart and fall right off my shoulder you ca n't have that happening when carrying around a laptop it 's a bummer , too -- i really wanted to like this case , but in the end it was so cheaply made that i just could n't justify ever buying one again
i bought two of these bags for my wife and son 's laptops they will do the job but not much more they are ok to put your computer and a few accessories the quality is ok but i do n't expect them to last long
first of all let me <unk> with the cons ... the straps are connected to plastic rings which broke on the second use of the bag i had to replace them with metal rings that i purchased at home depot i only had my laptop in the bag the stiching is ok ... not heavy duty the pros . i like the compartments and feel of the bag it has room for a laptop and folders with some room left over the bag works fine for me since i replaced the rings i would n't recommend this bag for that reason alone
not a fabulous item but certainly functional biggest plus is that it comfortably fits my # . # laptop sure miss my eddie bauer laptop bag it was perfectly designed and ruggedly built just could n't force the bigger computer into it i hope that this laptop bag holds up as well
i bought this to replace the everki commute as the laptop compartment is larger it did fit my alienware m # x r # a lot better than did the commute the build quality is just very poor and the accessory pocket does n't really fit the power supply for this laptop i returned this item , too
i 'm using this to carry my dell precision m # around plenty of space for the laptop itself and power supply not recommended to those who wish to carry a lot -lrb- other than the laptop & powersupply -rrb- with just one bag
use this to take around a # & # # ; <unk> photo frame and it is well padded and have ample compartments to carry power cords and other devices do n't have to worry about my gear getting damage anymore whilst travelling from one event to the other
i know there were some bad reviews about the plastic rings , but mine seem solid enough and i wonder if the ones that broke may have been isolated defects it 's even bigger than advertized i have an # . # inch laptop and it fits in with at least an inch of extra space on each side i can fit the gear i need to into the pockets the price was very attractive for a bag this size
large enough for my # & # # ; laptop mine has metal on metal hooks not plastic i would have liked two extra zippered pockets instead of one for accessories love the orange inside
so , like many others , i was trying to get a hold on a case that could fit my asus g # laptop -lrb- it 's # inch , but is about # inches thick at one point -rrb- the bag works great , does what it should do -lrb- holds my laptop and charger -rrb- though i do wish it was a bit more waterproof anyway , the point being is that the strap just does n't cut it for such a heavy laptop it will work for about # months , but soon after the strap 's links will start to grind and slip i stopped using the strap entirely at one point , so i could save myself the trouble of it letting go somewhere the strap just was n't built to hold that much otherwise the product is great
my husband loves this bag he was using a tote bag that has no padding before i gave him this bag now he loves that it has a padded shoulder strap also for comfortable shoulder bag
it was difficult for me to find a briefcase that would accommodate my # . # & # # ; tablet computer this case did the trick and was far less costly than other ones i looked into the case is well made and i think it will hold up well
i bought a # in computer and it is roomy and spacious it is sturdy and have different compartments i can put my mouse and power cable so i can carry it anywhere
it fits my # . # inch alienware m # x laptop just fine however , the front pocket is just a little bit too small , it barely fits my power supply in there , because it was n't designed for high power gaming laptops with giant power supplies still , it fits , and it 's a heck of a lot better than buying the alienware brand <unk> case for $ # more
this bag is more about the storage and less about the show it 's not one of those bags where someone compliments on how well it looks , however it does store a lot of items
the bag is perfect for my dell xps # tablet now if the tablet did n't have this one little design flaw the power button is easily depressed when inside the bag and gets turned on and really heats up
this bag is a good product however , while my alienware # fits ok , the power supply does not fit properly in the side pocket if you do n't need to carry the power supply you are ok
ordered this bag for my toshiba satellite p # , with # . # & # # ; display , and it fit perfectly wish it had more padding , and that the extra pocket opened the full length of the bag
i used this with a # . # `` toshiba laptop and had plenty of room the front compartment is very spacious and easily holds my mouse , charging cable , earbuds , phone , and phone charger my only complaint is that it feels very cheaply made , but that is to be expected with the price
not many choices for big laptop bags , so this works out great for me as it provides good <unk> and is not too expensive the only issue is that it does not have much more room for anything else beside your laptop and its charger adaptor / cable
this would be five star if it was n't for the side pocket it includes no & # # ; depth & # # ; , so the velcro becomes difficult to use as soon as any items are put into it besides this small issue it is a very nice bag , well made , and worth the money
its ok bag one of the clips broke first day but other then the cheap clips great bag i like the orange on the inside of bag makes things easy to find . would recommend to friends
the bag fits my asus laptop perfectly & has sufficient space for most of my laptop accessories like power cord , mouse , phone & ipod chargers etc . it 's perfect for day to day use when only carrying day to day laptop accessories
i 'd have given this item five stars if not for the front section , which has just one velcro patch to keep it closed a longer one would have been fine , a zip even better had a hard time finding a case for my # . # & # # ; toshiba & # # ; <unk> & # # ; and rejected most of those i came across because they were $ # <unk> had to carry the laptop to england , and this bag saved the day -lrb- and probably the computer too -rrb-
exactly as described , lightweight , plenty of pockets and sleeves holds everything i need without too much weight or bulk highly recommend - a great value for the price
i take my xps # on the road with me every week and this bag lets me take along all the extra accessories i use as well external keyboard , mouse , hard drive , dvd burner , cables and whatever fill every pocket in this bag without it being bulky whether i 'm carrying it by the handles or using the shoulder strap , both are very sturdy this is n't a flimsy bag i 'm happy with this purchase and would highly recommend it
perfect fit for my alienware # & # # ; which is n't the lightest laptop around extra pockets for my external hd , cables , and stuff easy access for airport security checks low price had me a little concerned but the quality is excellent i ca n't tell you how long it will last i wo n't be moving it around much , probably only during <unk> <unk> , is i expect long life from it
this is a really well built case that fits large tablets , without attempting to & # # ; jam & # # ; it in i would and have told everyone that i come across to check this case out , it it s that great
fits my <unk> <unk> <unk> # <unk> # & # # ; gaming laptop perfectly including it 's power brick and a mouse that 's all i carry in it along with a few usb flash drives i was originally looking for a backpack that would fit this laptop , but most are close to $ # seems fairly well padded & durable for the occasional bump into a door or hand rail no regrets at all
this bag delivers an experience that is in line with how it is described the pictures are accurate as well i use it with confidence also , the strap connectors are metal in case you are wondering
i got this case for my new asus computer which is kind of large the case it nice ; fits the computer great ; the strap is comfortable and the thing was not a ridiculous price like some of them out there in the stores very happy with purchase
i was n't sure if this would fit my computer , but it 's a great bag with lots of space it fit my laptop -lrb- which is an asus g # sx -rrb- as well as my cooling pad , mouse , cords , usbs , and pens and papers
every bag that i 've seen does n't fit the monster laptop but i 'm so glad i ordered this one there is just enough extra pocket room for my charger , headphones , mouse , and my controller for gaming perfect fit , tons of padding and its pretty comfortable also recommended especially if you 're looking for a bag to fit the asus g #
i read a review about one of the side pulls or something being plastic they must have changed it , cause none are plastic on mine i highly recommend this bag it holds everything i need
i really ` love ' this bag it comfortably holds my electronic daily needs without shoulder overload it 's roomier than it looks daily i carry a # -inch laptop , power cord , camcorder , digital camera , digital recorder , electronic pointer , all the necessary cords and small portable speakers it 's holding its own pretty well
i bought this as a gift for my daughter at christmas she is so grateful that i did she works from home where we have a pc and now she has a laptop that she carries wherever she goes
i bought this bag to fit my # . # inch alienware laptop and it fits perfectly in this i 'm very satisfied with it and i think you will be too the extra pockets -lrb- of which there are plenty -rrb- for storing writing utensils , calculators , etc , are just an added bonus
item is durable and well made , with plenty of space for any extra accessories i have an alienware <unk> # -lrb- not a light laptop to say the least -rrb- and i can comfortably carry it across campus all day with no worries padding in the laptop compartment is very good and makes me feel very secure about carrying my expensive cargo definitely a great buy i will be looking to everki in the future for my carrying case needs
i love this bag i bought it to carry my laptop on a week long conference it is small which is wonderful when travelling it has a front pocket to hold a few extra things , like a wallet and cell phone , but do n't expect to put a bunch of extra stuff in here i ended up carrying my tablet , which was completely fine with me the pads on the shoulder strap are great and the bag is really comfortable even after waiting in long lines
this bag holds my husbands toshiba qosmio # & # # ; laptop perfectly and has lots of compartments he can put other stuff comfortably without overstuffing the bag and having it bulge out the straps have also held up nicely to the weight of the
this bag is spacious and was received as described the material seems durable because i handle in a rough manner sometimes and it absorbs the hits shipping was fast , i will definitely recommend this bag
i have had other laptop bags before this product is spacious and i actually have space left over after putting all my accessories and cables in it it is holding up very well and does not show wear yet
this bag was just the perfect size for my xps # dell computer it also has pockets for my keyboard , mouse , and power supply i would recommend this bag for a laptop size computer
my previous carrying case had flimsy plastic clips for the shoulder strap and zippers that were cheap this one has high quality parts that work seamlessly the bag is very roomy and easily accepted my # . # inch laptop
minimum features but is what you want since the laptop itself is already very heavy and you will not want to stuff other items into the pockets the handle could be beefier
it 's amazing it fits my laptop perfect , and the quality is amazing i got the free shipping and got it within two days so i 'm happy i can now finally bring my laptop everywhere
this bag is very professional and great quality , especially when you consider the low price the extra front pocket is very helpful and the adjustable strap works well
the most wonderful case ever i love how my laptop fits down in it my laptop is # & # # ; and this case was <unk> it is very professional looking i recommend this bag for anyone who wants a <unk> fit has plenty of room for your charger , phone and wireless mouse and other stuff
i like this bag because it is light weight and vegan . i just wish it had a paper pocket on the back , oh well it is a great bag and still deserves a # star review
if you are looking to find a laptop case for your asus g # or even a g # or g # , it fits perfect mine holds my g # , power supply , razer <unk> mouse , and my # dollar gaming headset just fine with hardly a bulge at all the hooks . for . the shoulder strap are metal , not cheap plastic i am very pleased with this bag
i ordered this as a gift to fit a # in macbook pro , as advertised the actual case came in way too big for the laptop so it was useless i returned it immediately for a full refund
if i could give it # stars , i would first of all , it does not fit the # -inch macbook pro so do n't waste your time ordering this i sent it back to the seller and he claims he never got it back , so therefore i have not received a refund
i saw the one review on this site for incase designs corp case and <unk> relied upon that to make this purchase upon receiving this rather flimsy `` shell `` i discovered that though it snapped onto my # `` macbook pro , the connector holes did not line up with the cutout holes in the shell i sent the product back and after some days was informed i would receive a credit minus the money i spent on shipping it back they refused to pay my postage again after i <unk> incase designs corp on the matter this product is not only cheaply made , does not fit a # `` macbook pro , but is also sold by this rather <unk> , indifferent company , incase designs <unk>
i ordered the case not aware of this fact and it did not fit . . had i been aware that there was two different sizes i would have investigated which mac i had and ordered appropriate case i unfortunately was not aware that in # to # , mac is considered a second generation i do n't know if the seller is aware of this fact , but they failed to make <unk> aware of this fact as well as the consumer disappointed ! !
great protection for your mac , i 've had this thing for two weeks , and i have to say , its great protection , and it looks fantastic the translucent red really makes it pop , the apple logo lights up in red , people tell how cool it looks it takes punishment well , and its scratch proof , works really well , opens and closes without a problem i love it five stars without a doubt
my probook is # inches so i needed a bag to fit it i must admit the bag is a little too big for the laptop tho , but the extra space and compartments are an added feature also very comfortable on the shoulder
this bag is a beast it 's roomy , protective , well made it 's also got a few little pockets in the front compartment , ideal for flashdrives and such the price is great , and speed of delivery was too
this product is exceptional after searching and searching for a bag for the # inch laptop this was great i could not believe the price and when my son got a # inch laptop i had to go back and get another one great deal ! ! !
excellent case and my # `` laptop fits perfectly room for other items in pockets inside the case heavy duty and durable you can take it on a plane but best to go in the overhead compartment
i really like this backpack for its ' space and ability to protect and hold my laptop i have a smaller laptop and i am a small woman -lrb- # ' # `` -rrb- the back pack is a little too long and does n't sit above my hips i just wanted to let other <unk> know that if they are on the smaller side , the back pack may hang lower than they are expecting this causes some discomfort in my back as it is trying to compensate on the placement of the back pack i am trying to figure out a way to shorten the straps even more
i just ordered another one because i loved the first one so much i 'm a college senior <unk> in nursing and i used my previous backpack for over # years before the zipper broke this backpack can carry a # inch laptop , multiple , huge science books , my lunch or snacks , # water bottles and even has an organizer for pencils and things the straps are designed to carry heavy weights and the backpack keeps my back from hurting after a long day walking all over campus i highly recommend it !
i love this backpack there are lots of pockets to stay organized and it can fit everything i need during the day for school -lrb- i 'm a sophomore in college -rrb- it is also very comfortable even with my mac , a giant <unk> <unk> book , and some notebooks , it does n't feel too heavy i really like the separate computer pocket so my mac is protected , but if i do n't have my computer it is out of the way i thought that the cooler pocket would be wasted space for me , but it 's a really nice , deep pocket that i use for carrying fruit , computer cable , or any other little things i have used it for one semester and it seems very sturdy - i 'm sure it will last a long time
great pack , well made , just love dakine their customer service is quick and helpful i purchased this pack on amazon from <unk> also , wonderful people and fast customer service i received the pack in just a few days and i 'm very happy with it and <unk> !
i was unsatisfied with my <unk> weekday bag because it was too small for my needs so i shopped for a bigger bag i bought this because of the dimensions when it came , i <unk> the construction and workmanship with care this bag will last for years and years , i think but it was n't practical for me , because of it 's size -lrb- ironic , i know -rrb- no good for me as a weekday workday bag , but great for those that need to carry a lot of gear and i mean a lot several <unk> could use this as a waterproof tent on camping trips
nicely made , solid laptop bag i carry a lot of crap in it however , i do wish that it had better pocket design and layout there are some small pockets inside the front pouch , but they ar n't really good for much the main pouch has webbing that can separate some stuff overall a very good value
exactly as described and reviewed by others it is large enough to hold lots of extra stuff and and tough enough to last as long and likely longer than your laptop i suspect it will have other uses that i have n't even thought of yet but once i do i will let you know ... a great price and the best bag around !
my wife 's # `` toshiba fits perfectly , not tight , not loose , just perfect padding front , back , side , bottom , and top room for accessories , power brick , etc . nice adjustable strap with sholder pad appears well made , only time will tell but see no defect or problems buy it , you 'll love it , my wife does
i just started digital scrapbooking and i was looking for a bag large enough to hold my # `` laptop i take my laptop with me to scrapbooking events so i also wanted my bag to have padding i also wanted a bag that was a different color than black and had a shoulder strap that was adjustable too this bag was everything i wanted my friend saw my bag and ordered one for herself in navy
my # in monster hp laptop fits great in this bag the bag is stylish , very sturdy and overall a great buy i even use it without the laptop as a bag to go to and from work it fits a lot -lrb- purse , lunch , planner , folders -rrb- without the laptop in there
oh though i do do n't want to test the water resistant part , i just do n't believe it it 's super thin material i had push my laptop in the case , barley fit
bought it for my # . # laptop because thats what it was supposed to fit & it did not was to small was a waste of money to me after leaving review was sent another case that was to big . so was wondering if you even carry one for # . # as you can see in picture one is a # & one an # neither work but thank you for trying
first , before you order this item , be aware that it ships from the uk ! ! i was not aware of this i ordered it # weeks ago and it just shipped yesterday ! then in the email , it said allow # days for delivery ! i call that horrible service if i had known it would be shipped from overseas i would have never ordered it ! ! stay away unless you live in the uk or dont mind waiting months for your order
it did not fit my # inch lap top , not worth the price with shipping costs i use it to store papers in , did not return due to shipping costs it was a waste of money it would have had a good review if my laptop fit in it
it 's not too bulky which is what i was looking for , and the fabric is almost like a foam i love the color and it helps with protecting my laptop when i drag it around
took a while to get this item but it was coming from uk , i believe i love the fabric on it but the size is a little bigger than it had said , its a little big for my # `` laptop , thats why i give it # stars
i looked for a while before purchasing this item through amazon.com i discovered that most of the same items , regardless of brand was at least $ # . # i am on a budget and ordered this item hoping it met my expectations it more than met my expectations . it was considerably lower in price compared to the name brand products and it is well worth the money it does exactly what i need it to do and it fits into my `` poor college student budget `` very well excellent product !
i ordered this item a long time ago and have already paid for it received email from dealer stating that they did not have the color i originally wanted and told them to send me any of other two colors they wrote back saying that i would receive a pink cover and to this day i have received nothing and no response to my emails will never again purchase anything from this company would appreciate my money back
the fit was loose from the <unk> for my dell mini # v putting it on was very difficult even with instructions , which were almost too small to read then , the last time i took it out of my backpack -lrb- and i did n't have a slipcover on it , so that did n't force it off -rrb- the casing for the lid fell off somewhere i do n't even know where it went i 'd had it on for hardly a month definitely a waste of money
a good case that fits the top and bottom of my dell mini i was really happy with my purchase but after a while the leg stands started to get stuck and it would take a strong pull to kick them out i would always be afraid of snapping the plastic legs and breaking them the wear and tear is the only complaint i have as of now and the fact that its plastic makes it susceptible to cracking
i bought this a while ago , in pink the bottom fits perfectly but the top was always a little loose the other day i noticed it was very loose checking it i realized the side tabs on one side had somehow broken off so , i 'm trying another one and hope for better results
