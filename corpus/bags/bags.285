could have had a side pocket with small internal compartment - to hold charging cable and smaller compartment for my wifi adapter and thumbdrive and maybe also for my credit card , little cash ect could have detachable sling so i can carry it isolated when needed -lrb- which is seldom -rrb- i usually put it in my <unk>
this is a great case for my macbook air it is a really snug fit , but not so tight that you have to fight to get it in and out good protection against dings and dents my only complaint is that it uses velcro to secure it i would have preferred magnets or something else after a while the sound starts to <unk> that is of course a minor complaint in what is generally a very good laptop case
i bought this case for my hp envy x # and i have to say that it fits perfectly ... not too lose not too tight the quality of material seems to be very good for this price range
i have had this for quite a while now and it has worked extremely well for me i can even put this in another computer case that i have -lrb- with handles -rrb- for longer trips
i recently bought a dell venue # pro i # and have very a really hard time finding a case to fit ; finally , i found this one it 's a great sleeve for the venue and is professional looking for work i 'm still anxious for a folio type case for my venue , but in the meantime , this sleeve will be great well made and very durable
my # -inch macbook air fits snugly inside the velcro closure is tight , and there is almost no gap in the top of the envelope the pouch is slim enough that i can slip it into my briefcase or backpack
i grabbed this on a lighting deal -lrb- $ # -rrb- for my asus t # & # # ; and it works very well even at the higher price -lrb- ~ $ # -rrb- , i still think it is well worth the money the sleeve is very slim , looks good , and provides excellent protection it closes nice & tight with the velcro cover yes & # # ; i recommend it
i bought this bag for my mac book pro # inch my macbook had to be squeezed in and would barely zip up it will scratch the corners its so tight i could not get the plugs into the zipper pouches on the outside either , much less a mouse or any other accessories the handles that the bag has are inside the bag so if you want to use them you can not zip the bag up all the way
too small but the product is a good idea nice color but i regret buying it , i thought it was for macbook pro but for macbook air i still think it should fit better but oh well -lrb- you live and you learn -rrb-
using this with a macbook air # & # # ; the quality of material and color are just fine what i did n't like about it was that the zippers are very tight around the corners with no padding to protect the laptop if you were to bang a corner against something it would be the same as if there was no case all it also seems like the zipper might end up scratching the computer if you were n't careful i also did n't like the fact that the handles can only be used if the zipper is n't closed all the way all in all , not a great product in my opinion
it fits my mac pro # `` as advertised , really fits it 's just that you should be aware that this is not waterproof and since it 's perfect fits , probably not a good idea to use this sleeve while also using hardshell cover it will hardly zipped
looks exactly the same as picture but arrived with one missing zipper , on left pocket smells strange like a factory smell if you have a hard case on your # & # # ; air very tight squeeze to zipper this shut but it just makes it
the seams are a little <unk> , and it has a sort of tacky hand but it is certainly passable and i will use it i bought one a couple years ago for my notebook and that one is nicer
it was a nice color and i loved the pockets the only problem that i had was the size i have a macbook pro # inch and it was a little small
i honestly thought the case was going to be a bit bigger , but it fit my computer a bit to snug . i can just about close it . other than that i like it fast shipping too , everything was brand new
i use my macbook pro mainly for school and needed a soft case to protect it while i carried it around in my back pack it does a good job <unk> off scratches and dents also , the two pouches on the front of the cover are very convenient however , the zipper has been somewhat disappointing not three months after purchase one of the main zippers had become <unk> , and the teeth that go around the corners have started coming loose , making it very hard to zip up with the remaining zipper it functionally still serves my purposes , and i do not regret purchasing it i only wish the zipper was of higher quality
best deal i could find , but the quality of the case is n't the best i was n't expecting the fluffy material inside that being said , it 's the cheapest case with pockets i found
this fits the # `` macbook pro , but it 's a little tight the handles are sewn inside , so if you plan to carry it , you ca n't zip it all the way and do n't buy this is you have an outer shell on your macbook because it will no longer fit
i loved the brightness of this pink , however it was n't very sturdy i used it daily until if fell apart after a few months i also wish it would have had a shoulder strap
putting the charger in the front pocket is a bit bulky , and the bag does n't zip all the way if the handles are out otherwise , pretty much exactly what i needed
got this as a chosen gift from the seller i want to give it to my son 's girlfriend this case is ultra light and would be very nice for travel where you have to take your notebook out of the case a lot i can see this item being useful for students that do their homework on the bus for example i got it in hot pink , but the material inside the casing is made out of black and a little fussy material that feels like it serves as a padding i would say this case fits the category of protection case because it has a great padding the only thing was the funny sort of new car smell i 've been airing it out for a week and it 's almost gone i also like the compartments on the outside of the case , where you can put in you charger and other accessories i always thought that was a smart addition , where i always have to have an extra bag for such things
when i got in the mail i opened it up and put my computer and it did n't fit perfectly but what i did n't get was <unk> handles were inside you had to zipper it so there was a little opening so the handles could come out but other then that it was awesome
i could n't believe how quick this arrived in the mail i love the color & that it has pockets , the only thing that was strange to me was that the `` handles `` were on the inside the mac fits very snug , no wiggle room at all , and u zip it <unk> of the way up & then the handles can hang out i really wish the handles would 've been on the outside , that way i 'd feel safer about toting it around i guess they 're on the inside so it 'll look <unk> in case u did n't want to use them
like my laptop case . zippers work great and the extra pockets come in handy for the accessories only complaint is the handles are inside the case and you can not zip it all the way shut if you want to use the handles as they are in the way
it seemed like a great item there are extra pouches for your mouse and plugins soft case which is really nice for your computer bright pink is awesome if you really like pink i had to return it because it was the wrong size , but if it was n't i would have kept it my daughter really loved it
just got this in the mail yesterday fits great and is a great price arrived ahead of schedule on standard shipping was very thankful for that fits my macbook pro perfectly and allows enough room for my charger , mouse , and <unk> reader
bought this for my macbook air # `` . it fits really well the air does not move around at all when i have it in the sleeve the pouches are perfect for the charger i will also be placing a portable hard drive in one of the pouches as well one of the pouches also has a little sleeve for a usb thumb drive , which is convenient if you also carry one around with you the one <unk> that i have had with this sleeve so far is the handles i have no idea why they decided to place the handles on the inside of the bag you can not zip up the sleeve and use the handles i will most likely just cut out the handles so i do not have something extra in the sleeve over all i would give this sleeve # out # stars , but i docked one star for the handles
this is a really nice case , its well made and fits our mac book pro great my one complaint is that when you want to use the handles you ca n't fully zip the case up it seems that they should be able to still make handles that go inside but also able to zip up fully
i just received my laptop case in the mail yesterday and i absolutely love it it has two pockets that are just perfect if you have an apple computer because both pieces of the charger would fit perfectly in those pockets in the larger one , there is also a small space to slip in a flash drive , which i though was really convenient the actual zip pocket where the laptop goes has a really nice fuzzy black material that will definitely keep the laptop protected plus the case is already very thick there are also two handles on the inside that you can only use if the case is n't zipped all the way but it is still great i do not think that the laptop would fit if it had a cover on it though i would definitely do business with this seller again because it came in very quickly i would recommend this product to anyone who had a # inch apple macbook pro or air completely worth the money
nice sleeve for a # & # # ; laptop -lrb- mbp -rrb- made of a soft material to prevent scratches pockets are useful even for adapter -lrb- though it feels a bit bulky -rrb- good <unk> ratio
first of all i 'd like to say i am shocked with how fast the delivery was i went with standard shipping and got the product in a few days it 's made well , the computer fits snug inside , materials are fantastic , and its exactly what i was looking for front pockets are a tad small so a little bulky with cables inside i wanted a small case to carry computer to work in and have separate cables there so not a deal breaker at all
so far so good it fits like a glove , just like i wanted perfect to go inside my purse and it keep protected it also great to have the extra # pockets one for the power cord and the other for my headphones
the pink is very pink , just as pictured i love the pockets and there is also a usb holder on the inside of one of the zipped pockets , very convenient inside the pouch there are two handles to carry around with , also very convenient love this pouch , just what i needed
bought my new laptop right before thanksgiving and needed a carrying case for it in order to travel it is light weight and like that the # zipped compartments hold the cord and mouse and it has handles for easy carrying
it is snug but i 'm fine with that because i carry my macbook for the most part in my backpack for grad school and wanted a sleeve to protect it from bumps with my books , etc .
and it shipped faster then expected also , the two little pockets are good for containing the charger and mouse one thing i did n't get is that there are two little stripes inside , i do n't know what 's that for
the velcro fastening holding the sleeve shut pulled loose the very first time i opened the sleeve -- first time out of the box thule likes to claim high quality , but this falls very short i had read reviews mentioning this problem , but i thought they were unlucky or that , at least , thule would have fixed this problem hard to believe they have n't apparently they do not care i am very disappointed do not waste your time and money on this one update : i complained to thule and got a very <unk> reply saying that i must have gotten `` an older version that amazon still had in stock . unlikely , since the first complaint about the velcro was posted more than six months ago these people really do not care
i bought this case because i really like thule products they 're generally well made i bought this for an upcoming trip and thought the water resistant feature would be great i received it and immediately went to test it out the macbook air fits perfectly in there when i <unk> the flap , i noticed that velcro strip ripped right off the case apparently , the velcro is stronger than the tiny strip of glue they used to attach it to the case for something this <unk> , you would think it would last more than one use before falling apart
i have to admit that the fit is excellent -lrb- macbook air # `` - late june # model -rrb- unfortunately the quality is horrible while thule is <unk> `` <unk> , heat welded seams `` they have decided to attach the velcro strap to the sleeve by a piece of photo mounting tape just think for a second - the only thing that prevents the flap from opening and spilling your # lbs $ # laptop on the pavement is a piece of photo mounting tape no surprise that the very first time i was opening the flap the double-sided mounting tape gave up and the velcro fell off of the sleeve i am not going to look for diy solutions like crazy glue after paying fifty dollars so the sleeve is going back to amazon and thule are going off of my trusted manufacturers list
this is my second thule gauntlet in # years the previous one worn out over that period of time given that i put it through some <unk> tests but it served me well and i opted to get another one sure , fits like a glove with ample protection the perfect fit for a macbook air however , i was quite disappointed by this purchase as the velcro strip came off after # days of use that problem only happened to my previous gauntlet after # years upon close inspection , i realised that the strip was attached on by what seems like double-sided tape i ca n't help but wonder whether this was a failed qc
the sleeve itself is great provides excellent protection all around and is thin and light for any macbook air or thin pc -lrb- i have a samsung # ultrabook -rrb- unfortunately the velcro that holds the top fold breaks off very easily it only lasted about # months it is n't a huge deal since the sleeve still works fine without the velcro , but it still reflects poorly on the quality and craftsmanship of the sleeve i would n't pay more than $ # for this due to the poor construction otherwise it would be worth twice that
just received my thule gauntlet case and it fits perfectly with my new macbook pro retina # . # inch slim profile was what i was looking for and this quality case definitely delivers what i expected price was a bargain at $ # compared to other standard sleeves and cases out there for macbook pro retina #
i wanted something that is waterproof , slightly padded without bulking too much and slim the thule <unk> fits the bill some covers are just too thin or overly padded , this is just right i did not have problems with the velcro straps like some user did i like this sleeve alot and is also a nice design to carry it around
this bag allows a ton of pressure to be placed on a laptop if you 're carrying in your back i 've gone through three macbook air screens through apple warranty
if you are under the impression that this bag is soft and floppy , it 's not it feels like a thick <unk> or tent material and you have to almost fold it over to close it instead of just flipping it over and letting it flop down the belt is the same material but thicker and it is slippery on the shoulder there 's no good place for computer cords and the big black box on the cord when you roll it up and slip it into one of the pockets , it bulges out and makes it more difficult to either zip it up or put other things in the compartment in front of it i wish i would have returned it but <unk> over the holidays hopefully the stiffness loosens up as it gets older
the section for the laptop that opens for the tsa throws off the balance of the bag making it uncomfortable it also <unk> the bag in a manner that makes it less practical to use i recommend purchasing the normal bag not the <unk> <unk> bag i appreciate the effort but in my opinion it just does n't
i was so bummed to have to return this bag , it had everything i needed for my long commute to/from work however , i just could n't adjust the strap short enough for my comfort level when the bag is fully loaded in this situation , you will be able to handle the bag weight best if the bag is <unk> up very high on your back similar to a true bike messenger 's bag timbuk # did n't design this model with <unk> in mind , so they included a longer version of their strap i contacted timbuk # and they told me this , and said the only # bags with shorter straps were the only <unk> to <unk> however , those bags do not have the commuters in mind , so you wo n't get all the cool compartments and the tsa-friendly design in the <unk> bags simply selling straps as standalone products in various sizes would fix this problem i would gladly pay extra for a shorter replacement strap so i could use this commute bag , but alas timbuk # does not sell staps in this manner bummer ! !
the bag itself is stylish and roomy the tsa feature works perfectly with my # & # # ; macbook pro in a hard case just unzip , flip it open and send it through the security scanner the laptop is securely held in place with straps the shoulder strap is extremely uncomfortable it 's stiff , not contoured , is n't up to the weight of the loaded bag , and has minimal padding and sharp edges i took it off and replaced it with one from another bag it does n't match and detracts from the appearance
the inner compartments of the bag are large enough to carry all of my materials and the shoulder strap is comfortable and sturdy however , the front , zip key compartment has already ripped even though i do not use it very disappointing for a relatively expensive messenger bag
the bag itself is very well made but there is n't much structure to it if you are looking for a bag that will serve as protective case for your laptop , this is not it i have since bought a hard case and sleeve , and the laptop fits inside the bag with those things on it so that 's fine but i would n't feel safe with my laptop in here by itself also , the notion of it being tsa friendly is somewhat <unk> the compartment that is meant to hold the laptop and fold out for tsa scan is n't the best place in the bag to store the laptop so i end up taking it out of the bag anyway
i purchased this bag based on the recommendation of the <unk> it 's a nice bag , with lots of storage however , i 'm used to a bag with stiffer sides when the bag is only partially loaded , as it usually is for me , it 's too floppy and folds over on itself
i bought this as a gift for my boyfriend , and he loves it the only thing that is a little off is the clip on the strap - it does n't stay well , so it slips often we 're considering using a big safety pin to hold it in place
this is a great laptop bag , perfect size and easy access to the laptop with opening the entire bag i am not a fan of the shoulder strap pad included , but maybe it just need to be broken in as it 's kind of bulky
i travel weekly and have wear through bags frequently -lrb- ogio , targus & case logic -rrb- to name a few i carry a # laptop pc an ipad and various necessary items simply put this bag has a lot of room , some really cool features and it 's tough as nails i am now , a loyal timbuktu customer
this is a great bag and it looks good it is made well and is very sturdy with sturdy stitching the only problem is that it does not have enough padding on the inside to protect my computer
plenty of organization pockets the tsa feature is a beautiful thing even if you do n't travel , because having the <unk> opening allows you easier access when moving between <unk> saved $ # through amazon my only disappointment is that the shoulder strap is n't as good as the strap timbuk # sells on their command model
timbuk # definitely has some nice products , but the pricing is a little steep i have n't put this one through the ringer yet , but for the price , it better hold up nice design , look , but could maybe use a few more internal pockets for storage , otherwise , a nice moderately sized bag -lrb- using with a # & # # ; mac book pro -rrb-
awesome bag ; fits all my essentials for the office and looks good great compartment for computer and accessories looks smaller in person than it did in photo but still great
so i had a large original timbuk # messenger bag and my wife decided she loved it and that i should get another for myself when shopping i noticed the timbuk # commute laptop bag with the special tsa helpful laptop section this & # # ; large & # # ; bag is smaller than the other & # # ; large & # # ; bag i thought that maybe the difference was the pockets but i do n't think so in any event , it looks like it will be perfect for the main function : my commute to work on a <unk> scooter however , it wo n't become a new travel bag since it 's too small even for an overnight the other bag was sufficient for that one other thing : the original has an <unk> cross chest strap to more securely fasten the bag to the person , this does not i really liked that additional strap
for some reason when i pack it with # lbs worth of stuff , i can never actually feel the strain am i getting stronger , or is it the construction of the bag all i know is that it has enough space to fit everything i would say buy velcro silencers with this because they aggressive obnoxious especially when you 're mid class and and you need to grab your pen out of the bag
i was hesitant to buy because i did not know the product this bag replaced a former bag from swiss army that finally wore out after # years the commute bag is at another <unk> of construction and build with the lifetime warranty and the great materials used , i doubt that this bag will ever be retired because it wore out
it is my <unk> bag , sturdy , spacious without been big , water proof i never used this kind of bag until now , my commute is big and i can fit all i need those # hrs commute every day
i ca n't say enough good things about this messenger bag i can easily strap it on while on my <unk> and items are safe and secure rain proof , too zippers and velcro are industrial strength
i bought this bag to replace another one that i was getting bored with and it is the most convenient bag i have used when traveling i do not have to take out my laptop anymore at airport security and it has enough `` pockets `` in all the right places it looks quite sturdy and i suspect i will enjoy this bag for a long time to come good job timbuk # !
i ca n't say enough how pleased i am with this purchase i needed a bag with a little more room that the tumi laptop messenger i was using it had to be travel friendly i also needed something with a <unk> strap to keep it on my back while cycling this fit the bill -lrb- i thought -rrb- and a few friends had only good things to say about the bag and the company when the bag came , it met or exceeded my expectations but did not contain the second strap i called their customer service department and left a message heather called me back from san francisco the next morning and informed me that the commute does n't come with a cross strap , but that she would mail one to me right away i 'd buy another timbuk # bag in a minute
my husband saw this bag in a local store and mentioned he would like one to replace the laptop bag he had at the time i took note and did some research so glad i did amazon 's pricing on this bag could not be beat ... saved a lot compared to our local store the bag has been awesome such great quality very well made my husband 's favorite part is the way it 's made to get through airport security more easily it 's the perfect size ... not too big and not too small i was debating between the small and medium , but am glad i got him the medium to give him more space for items when he is traveling
i was looking for a replacement for my worn out and frayed messenger bags , so i decided to spend a little extra to buy something of quality i liked the reviews on the timbuk # commute laptop bag and decided this was the one for me overall quality and construction is excellent , with waterproofing for taking in rougher weather i bought the small size messenger bag and the external laptop pouch fits my # & # # ; macbook pro exactly , not snug or loose note if you 're carrying your laptop with a separate cover pouch , it may not fit the bag comes <unk> with multiple pockets and compartments , and i could n't be happier even has a strap <unk> mechanism allowing me to carry the bag while riding a bicycle without letting the bag swing around
fits my dell inspiron # touch a little tight unless i unfold it a bit more than i 'd expect love the tablet folds in with the laptop itself tsa definitely did n't give me a hard time with it
bought this as a work bag , but now i use it for everything i do a lot of travel for work so the tsa flap is nice , but i can be as prepared as possible and the person in front of me will still take forever but there really is a compartment for everything and they are all easy to get at , and a surprising amount of space caught in the rain and everything stayed dry -lrb- except me -rrb- which was great only real suggestion , a different strap pad for your shoulder would be nice , this is ok , but after standing with it full on you for a half hour , it
this bag covers all my needs and more also shipping was fast i would highly recommend this seller and the timbuktu bag for anyone that is on the go and has lots of stuff to take to work
perfect bag for someone who needs to carry a lot of stuff and does n't like really bulky bags i can fit an entire days worth of my stuff and not look like a <unk>
i do n't like calling this a messenger bag since the shape and straps are really not designed for use when <unk> -lrb- like timbuk # 's real messenger bags -rrb- as a commuter briefcase , it works great the fabric is very heavy duty and the construction is very high quality there are several small pockets on the inside to keep your business gear organized , as well as one big internal pocket , and a well padded laptop pocket the laptop pocket zips open for tsa airport checks , which is really great for keeping your laptop safe and secure the big internal pocket could easily hold several books or a big pile of papers , though not really bulky items like timbuk # 's regular messenger bags this bag works well for the intended use -lrb- business people commuting by planes , trains , and automobiles -rrb- , so i 'm giving it # stars
i ordered this in large as i carry pc , tablet , books , lunch , clothes , and nursing supplies daily this bag holds all my stuff with room for a small purse as well i am able to carry it messenger style and my back does not hurt -lrb- be sure to read the instructions on how to do that if you are not sure -rrb- the quality of timbuk # bags can not be matched my husband has a bag that is # years old and it still looks brand new you ca n't go wrong if you are looking for a classy , sturdy bag the only thing i would add is a few more small pockets since i carry a lot of small items , but i just use pouches to organize my <unk> supplies
great bag with ample room for my dell laptop and several notepads lots of compartments and/or pouches for keys , change , flash drives or whatever used it this past weekend for the first time at the airport and with its tsa approved pouch did n't have to take it out , only lay it flat
i did n't do enough research and did n't realize the small size is meant for a # `` laptop another review said that they thought most # `` laptops could fit , but it was n't the case for me gorgeous bag though , it looked ready for oregon weather and was well made i did n't order the next size up , but perhaps one day will or maybe i 'll get a macbook or smaller computer someday just to have this bag
great bag , very <unk> the laptop holder shapes it oddly when its in there , but works well also nice in the airport the tsa friendly laptop holder to not have to remove your laptop is great , though unnecessary takes almost as much work to unzip that part and lay it flat as it does to just remove it still , its a nice feature tons of room in this bag , which is great , but makes it easy to get heavy quickly all in all , excellent multi-purpose messenger bag
this was a gift for my husband and i was hoping it would meet his needs i am very pleased that it exceeded his expectations in every way he likes the many pockets , the overall size , the extra long adjustable strap , the durable material it is made of and even the color scheme we highly recommend this messenger bag
so many messenger bags seem to be thrown together without any planning this bag clearly has been carefully designed with commuters ' needs in mind it has an external bottle pocket it has a & # # ; napoleon pocket , & # # ; where i keep my phone and keys so i do n't have to <unk> the bag every time i need something it has convenient inner pockets where i can tuck my umbrella and my headphones it has a super convenient and secure laptop pocket that i can get to without opening the main bag it is waterproof the size is good for my # foot # inch female frame i think it looks sharp and professional thank goodness that , after all my <unk> messenger bag experiences , i have finally found this one
i wanted a messenger style bag that had lots of room , was n't gaudy and could use professionally without looking like a <unk> , <unk> or just a general <unk> this is that bag , i got the medium the back area has room for macbook pro and # sleeves for ipads and the like it unzips fully for tsa handling although <unk> was nit picky about me removing it under flap pouch has a ton of room and i am not lacking for room in this oversize man-purse of mine ... lets be honest , its full of crap , but its crap i need and i get complimented on it all the time very odd , not used to that i mean its a bag is this what women go through with purses and shoes had it # months and its stays clean and wear free even though its been on planes a dozen times , in <unk> , flung about various floors and even been to <unk>
owned a lot of bags that i use for both daily use and travel this bag may be the perfect bag -lrb- for me -rrb- the right size and the right configuration to provide storage and access when you need it
i love this bag it 's stylish and has extremely well thought out compartments the sleeve is the perfect size for most ultrabooks -lrb- lenovo x # carbon in my case -rrb- it also has two perfectly sized sleeves for a couple tablets or another ultrabook or files i hold a samsung galaxy and a kindle in mine there 's plenty of room for the rest of my essentials like notepad , charger , cables , keys , etc and enough room leftover that i 've taken only this bag on several overnight business trips
this holds everything i need for my career on the go on top of that it has held up extremely well and still looks new for great intel on how the bag works , check out the timbuk # site for their videos
excellent for <unk> and for flying when passing security and showing your laptop it is easy to store all of your things but keep them organise at the same time
i was afraid this bag would be too manly but it 's not totally unisex appropriate i love how even when i forget to buckle the flap down , the velcro is so strong that it still keeps the flap down anyways perfect for someone who is accident prone like me
not too big , but still large enough to hold a few books & binders , a laptop and -lrb- most importantly -rrb- my coffee mug the laptop slot on the back is a huge help
i got this for my dad , who ends up being outside somewhat often , carrying a macbook air -lrb- # & # # ; -rrb- and some books and a water bottle the day after he got it , there was heavy rain in his city and he called me when he got inside , thanking me for the wonderful gift it has a lot of pockets tucked away to keep items compartmentalized , but the main sections are big enough that you can just treat it as a <unk> he says it 's comfortable and really likes the hand grip on the top -lrb- you do n't necessarily have to wear it on your shoulder , but can also tote it in your hand -rrb- a really solid bag , tough , does n't look like a typical ~ messenger bag ~ , holds a fair amount of things , reasonably rugged , decent price
storage is incredible and the design , while modest , is great i am able to treat this as a day bag , bringing my laptop , ipad and a change of clothes for the gym and have room to spare i 've also used it as a weekend bag and its storage was great buy this bag , you 'll be happy you
i bought this as a gift for my husband and he raves about it have n't had it long but it seems very sturdy and has plenty of pockets and space inside it goes through security at the airport without having to remove the laptop - my husband loves that feature
i try to write more reviews as i use them a lot to make decisions myself a lot of room and compartments for <unk> items , to include valuables and non highly recommend anything timbuk #
i 've had this bag almost a year and it 's held up well it goes with me to work everyday it 's traveled on numerous plane rides the strap pad does slide around more than i like , but overall , i love this bag
i bought this as a present for a very picky family member he is a graduate student without a car and takes his laptop with him all over town he told me that he likes this messenger bag a lot he had no negative remarks to make and believe me , he would tell me what was wrong with the present i gave him he would complain about the color , the straps , the comfort or discomfort of the bag he has only said that he likes it alot and has absolutely no complaints this is why i can give it # stars this is why i can say without a doubt it 's a good product
i like this sleeve because it can hold my macbook air in the main pocket , plus my kindle paperwhite in the outside pocket my biggest negative is the lack of convenient handle or strap to carry the sleeve it 's also a little big for an air because of how thin the laptop is lastly , the sleeve gets pretty bulky if you attempt to put a charger in the outside
i like being able to carry my rmbp and my ipad # in the same case to better be able to keep up with them during a recent flight , tsa did not <unk> when i left them in the same container as it passed through x-ray this was <unk> and lax . # stars instead of # because the velcro to enclose the ipad is already fraying a tad
i bought this for my # & # # ; mac book air and while a tad big -lrb- my mba shifts around a little -rrb- it works for me there is enough room where i can add an extra notebook or some papers in case i do n't want to lug around my book bag the front pocket is supposed to be for an ipad i think -lrb- at least that is what it was advertised for -rrb- but i use it to store my <unk> it 's soft and plush on the inside of the front pocket i did rig my sleeve by cutting down the foam that came in the sleeve when it was first delivered to make up the difference in height of the bag it 's not the perfect solution but it was an easy way to make sure the padding was the right dimensions
a simple , effective case i really like the vented rear of the case it is a perfect fit with the speck hard shell case i have on my macbook pro
i 've owned many timbuk # products and the build quality on all of them have been excellent although built for the ipad and macbook pro # in . - i use mine for the mini and the air it has just a little extra space but it works well one question i had before purchasing was ; would the full size ipad fit with the smart cover i have no <unk> recommending this product who like to travel light i actually slide the the sleeve right into a timbuk # messenger bag
i ordered this for my daughter who had completely destroyed her college bag and needed a new one for graduate school this bag arrived and exceeded my expectations it is a bit <unk> for an older professional student and had some great features that were not described fully on the item description , padding on backside , interior pocket organization , etc . she was thrilled to continue carrying her things in the same fashion while looking great at the same time
this is a great backpack it looks nice and has lots of pockets it protects the laptop well while traveling and feels like it will hold up for a long time
this is the best work backpack i 've ever owned this backpack is very easy on the back when carrying it around and the extra padding is wonderful i would definitely purchase another if this one wears out someday
i have been using this bag for the last # months and it is really good in terms of space and accessibility the hidden pocket comes in really handy for items that i need quick access to
