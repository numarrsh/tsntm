this cover is both functional and hip i was so excited to dress up my new macbook air and this definitely did the trick i like that it does n't add any bulk to my air yet it feels sturdy enough to protect my new expensive toy i 'm <unk> ' it ! !
i needed to protect my macbook air from scratches and abrasions this product is amazing , it fits perfectly , the kick stand helps when i am typing , so comfortable , the keyboard protector keeps my key board clean , and the apple symbol illuminates through the case , awesome by it , you want regret it . the prices are very reasonable
this hard cover case protects my new macair # inch . so it does n't get scratched or bumped around it fitted very well into my air also i love the colour purple all in all i would recommend this product to anyone who wants your new air protected
i ordered this cover for my daughter 's new macbook air she selected the color from the on-line photos , and she is pleased with the way it looks on her computer i think it is a good match to the way it looks on-line , although it may be a little brighter it was hard to get the top piece on , even sliding it from the back as another reviewer recommended the bottom piece snapped on easily however , once on , the pieces fit extremely well , and there is full access to the ports on either side i would definitely buy this product again , especially given the low price compared to other brands
this case is better than i ever expected the hard case snaps on in a # - # <unk> when trying to put on the computer and the hard case is protective and makes me feel secure that my macbook air will not be ruined and or scratched the bright color is also great and <unk> up my whole computer 's look i would recommend this product to anyone looking for a great notebook case
i love the color at first i was worried i would n't be able to get all of the corners to pop on but with a little pressure it is now tightly on and working great nice and compact , does n't attract dust as much as previous covers like this i have had , stands up well to bumps
the cover arrived on time , no issues with either the cover or the service my favorite kind of transaction my # year old had a bit of trouble getting it on because of the tight fit so we slid on both sides at the same time from the top edge down and it went on like a charm she is very happy with it she looked at the apple ones and did not like them at all for the price of this one it is fantastic and `` the best color ever ! would use this seller again for the simple reason that they performed just like they said they would wow , was that customer service i received definite # star transaction
the purple is really pretty and it has the case is great quality it 's easy to take on and off and it fits perfectly i 've had it for more than # months and have had no problems with it
when i first put this cover on my computer i did n't have it completely flush and really clicked in properly , and i could n't lean the screen back as far as you can without the cover on i almost gave up on it and wrote off the cover i found what had not been properly snapped in and it works perfectly this case is durable , secure , has great venting design on the bottom that is worth the case all by itself so many great colors , i 'm thinking of getting a few i bought the purple cover , and it actually looks much more pink , but i love it i highly recommend this case for the air
holds all my technology goodies lots of very usable pockets slim <unk> form factor is great when i 'm riding the subway quality is top-notch i 'm able to put my # & # # ; macbook air , ipad and apple wireless keyboard , plus all of my adapters mifi cards , cables , keys best backpack i 've ever owned by far
love my new bag ! ! it has all the little compartments i need the really good thing about it is it 's just the right size for my going to and from work without feeling bulky wish the interior comes in blue , but other than that , it 's such an awesome bag ! ! i love it
bought this laptop backpack as my old bag was giving way what caught my eye was the compactness and several and durable zips it had my sony viao <unk> fitted in nicely too ! other than my mouse and adaptor , i could still afford to place a ` raincoat ' for the bag and one for myself , and even my lunchbox it all depends on how you pack your stuff one slight qualm i had was the level of comfort when i first used it it felt stiff and my shoulders began to ache it was later that i realized that , you had to shorten the straps so that the bag fits ergonomically on your back now it sits much better will give a review of the bag again later for now , it gets # stars from me
nice design , not a lot a room for much else , but for a macbook pro it is perfect for my needs i specially like that it does not look like a lap top bag
a friend had this bag and it looked great i got it for my husband and he loves it it 's not bulky and has great ways to stay organized and best if all does not look dorky
a clever design but not well made on the first day of a long overseas trip i was using the string to close the sleeve and it became detached along with the snap from the leather flap i think it is also very possible that the metal snaps might wear through the very thin inner lining and scratch the laptop an <unk> : to the company 's credit someone there contacted me within hours after my review to apologize and offer a replacement that was much appreciated though i had already processed a return
# -rrb- the material is not leather not even close # -rrb- the metal clasp protrudes on the inside and scratches the surface of the notebook # -rrb- the little red string falls off after # days of use
fits my macbook air # `` perfectly yes , it 's made of leather so , yes , it 's going to feel a bit tight , especially the flap but trust me , this will soften up over time and will fit your computer perfectly does n't appear to be cheaply made , seems sturdy , solid , well-constructed <unk> , the red leather strap is more decorative than useful but it 's easily replaced do n't worry about it
this was a gift for my husband he removed it from the box , barely touched the clasp , and it broke in two -lrb- i watched this happen -rrb- now the bag does n't clasp making it silly to try to use the handle at the top to the seller 's credit , we did not attempt to return this bag it 's not worth hassle this was a bummer of a purchase though my suggestion would be , if you 're going to buy a bag from this brand , to order one that can be carried without being latched
one review that i read about this bag mentioned `` tons of pockets ! unfortunately , that was the review that <unk> it for me and i purchased the bag well , in my laptop bag world , # pockets does not cut it the canvas is heavy and durable , the clasp somewhat strange it seems sturdy and big enough , but with my usage , it could break within the year i would put this bag , <unk> , at a $ # . # retail value
i really like the materials used -lrb- canvas and leather -rrb- , and the appearance and feel of the bag is quite nice my favorite features are the leather bottom and leather handle however , the laptop pocket is only padded on the inside wall that <unk> it from the second full-size pocket there is no padding in the outer wall of the bag where it would be most needed there are only two zippered pockets : one small one on the outside that is just tall enough to hold <unk> , and one <unk> pocket inside that i 'm using for adapters , thumb drives , and the like there are two deep , narrow pockets that are open at the top on the front of the bag , under the flap i use those for larger items like the power adapter , that i do n't worry will fall out it will suffice , but i wish it had more pockets that close
i like the color and functionality it does what i want but the strap stitching is coming out i use this one week a month so it does n't get everyday use <unk> with the quality
this bag has been a great bag so far it fits all of my work items perfectly and is easy to carry around the only negative is that the stitching on the should pad on the strap of the bag is starting to unravel
i use this bag almost every day and it is great when i travel it seems sturdy enough , is pretty roomy and fits my brick of an old laptop -lrb- # . # inch -rrb- with all the cables and crap that needs to go with it , with room to spare there are a couple cons though i really wish that the shoulder strap was detachable i also have noticed that the hook that clips on to the ring that keeps the main flap down is starting to tear yes the metal is starting to actually tear granted i load this bag pretty heavy when i travel for work but it is still disappointing that it is not strong enough thankfully i am handy enough to replace it once it finally does go but even then , it is a little disappointing
i bought this for a gift for my husband and we both love it the other reviews were right that the latch does take two hands to open and close , but it really does n't bother us we love it
i got this bag to lug around heavy college books works out great the clasp is sometimes a little bothersome ... its not the easiest to close with one hand other than that ... i really like this bag very happy with purchase
i use this bag all the time for work and i love it it 's durable and has some good organization pockets however , one <unk> are bad for our backs oh well , fashion first
price and quality was okay match missing details that more expensive bag would be nice if it had a better pencil pocket flap hook requires # hands , not a good design this bags works for me on a construction site do not want to buy a $ # bag and leave it in the saw dust
i ordered this and then thought . . & # # ; it looks like a mans messenger bag & # # ; so i received it and i love it it is just what i wanted ... a cross body soft messenger bag that i could fit my ipad and things in ... especially in the warmer weather ... it 's so comfortable to wear . and it has leather around the bottom that will wear with age great purchase ... and a great price yes . . , its good for women it can be for men ... women or teens
the sleeve <unk> with several black pen mark like stains on the <unk> pink . the stitching is uneven and <unk> , and the <unk> is much brighter and cheaper looking than online
i sent this case back whenever i received it the stitching was coming out in # places and the material felt very cheap the colors were also not pretty in person
the case looks amazing but is very , very cheaply and poorly made as soon as i put my laptop in it the handle ripped there was no way that handle could sustain the weight of a computer if it ripped on its own i returned it immediately
not a bad bag , but not made to high standards within a week of light use , the plastic is tearing on the top of the bag by one of the handles if you want something cheap , go ahead , but if you want something of good quality , look at another bag i will probably wait for a few more rips then move on
this & # # ; sleeve & # # ; has more storage possibilities than many laptop & # # ; bags & # # ; , but maintains the slimness of a sleeve when needed to it also has a convenient fabric handle that lies flush against the sleeve when not being used this bag has been great , though i have noticed a spot where stitching is coming loose , though this is likely due to the abuse i have put it though but do consider that it will not be as durable as some of the more expensive sleeves
really good laptop sleeve and perfect for a # inch one with a compartment for charger and usb the only bad thing is that it opens up completely and sometimes i 'm scared that it might open and fall but it is pretty
i can not believe i paid so much for this flimsy piece of junk i could get the same effect from wrapping tin <unk> around my passport i would never recommend this to anyone it is a total waste of money it could not have cost more than a quarter to manufacture and yet they charge about $ # what a rip off
these are good for a short time the paper is tougher than regular paper , kind of a combination of paper and plastic but i can see that they will get worn easily a little pricey considering they are a temporary thing but worth the peace of mind they give
my passport fits perfectly , not too tight , inside these sleeves i also like the fact that the sleeve , with my passport inside , still fits nicely into the pocket designed for my passport in my travel wallet i have n't traveled with it yet so i ca n't speak to how well it holds up , but if it stops someone from stealing my information on the next trip abroad it will be worth it to me
this case is very <unk> molded and the bottom shell does not fit properly it binds against the hinge every time the laptop is opened the plastic is thicker than i would have liked -lrb- especially compared to the feather case from incipio -rrb- and the folding feet , which i did n't plan to use , add bulk and unsightly bulges to the bottom the vents on the bottom are badly molded , with sharp edges that you will feel every time you big up you air
the clips on this broke after just a week i do n't <unk> my laptop so it was n't due to that i ended up just throwing it away do n't buy this
nice ... no instructions but the two plastic shells fit well on the new # air they eventually snap on and the color looks great my issue with the case is that the weight of the lcd cover -lrb- top cover -rrb- is so much that it will open or close the cover if you are holding the laptop at an angle sometimes i like laying in bed looking at the laptop and now with the cover attached , the cover will close on me
i love the case , its got little kick stands to elevate the back so you do n't harm your wrist the color is great , but the only downside to it , it clicks everytime i open the screen ! its pretty annoying , but overall , it is a nice
i 'm happy with half of the product when i snapped on the bottom , it bangs into the top part of the cover at the back hinge and makes an annoying clicking sound , when the # pieces of plastic hit each other i 've read about other people cutting off the part of the base that strikes the lid , but that seems excessive to me overall , it 's ok
from an aesthetic perspective this cover is great it has a nice matte finish and a very tight fit its # `` legs `` in the rear keep the macbook air cool and make typing more enjoyable it comes with a keyboard cover that is pretty darn ugly once you put on , but i guess that people who eat and drink while typing care less about looks -lrb- no pun intended . the flaw is obvious once you open your computer the top cover and the bottom one <unk> at a certain angle , and unfortunately that angle comes before the cover is open wide enough for the macbook air to be used it 's a silly flaw really that i 'm sure could have been avoided i do n't think that the cover is at risk of breaking though , but it bothers me enough to knock a star off this otherwise very nice product
i have brought this casing and installed to my new mba -lrb- brought after # case looks solid and fits perfectly on my # `` mba the only concern that i have is the hinge , it makes squeaky sound every time i open up the laptop at # degree oh , one more thing . my order comes with keyboard cover . nice addition
i purchased this cover in orange snapped on easily , feels smooth , and protects my laptop -lrb- # macbook air -rrb- no problems opening or closing the computer worth the purchase the keyboard cover was n't comfortable for me , so i do n't use it nice that it is included , though
it was ok quality for the price - i get the occasional compliment and i like that it protects the laptop the keyboard took a bit to get used to - but # spilled coffee later i 'm glad i had it
nice cover for the price there was a popping sound but it went away when i cut the back hinges off with a knife other than that ... its nice clean looking and keeps my macbook away from scratches
great pop color hard shell fits snuggly around computer and offers great protection from scratches or spills however , there is a chance , the cover may slip off if not attached correctly
you ca n't beat this case for the price scratch <unk> on <unk> helps with <unk> -lrb- s -rrb- : when new the case would catch and make a click noise when you open it this was solved by not having the bottom piece snapped on in the middle back , it still stays on fine like this after a month of use i snapped it all the way and it does n't make the noise i do n't see this as a real problem
this is a great looking case as with the others , the tabs on the rear of the bottom piece can be removed to stop the clicking noise when you open the lid the bottom case still wont come off i used a sharp knife to remove the pieces easily you need to have a cover like this to protect your macbook air from scratches
i decided to purchase this case after doing some research on the options for the # macbook air it turned out to be a fantastic case it fits snuggly by snapping onto the macbook air , there is no tape or glue required the case has stood up against the numerous amount of sharp object i put in my back pack and has retained its new looks without any scratches i was surprised that the case also came with a keyboard over lay that keeps the keyboard clean and is easy to wipe off i recommend it
i have the newest macbook air , and this cover meets all expectations i did n't think i cared about the free keyboard cover that came with it , but it is a great addition i put it on and have left it on i recommend this without reservations great product for a great price
pretty sturdy shell that looks so polished the apple logo shines right through it easy to snap into place and enjoy fits my # mb air perfectly no issues whatsoever
even after reading review after review about how this case cracks and breaks , i still took the plunge and purchased the speck macbook air # `` cover case after # weeks it was still amazing with no problems at all however , moving into my # th week of use , the case `` arms `` that hold the case to the macbook air started to chip , then break off within # days , # out of the # arms had broken off the base piece and would no longer stay on the shell that goes on the back of the screen is still fine , but the base shell is much more important to me in terms of protection i am very careful with this computer and it does n't run into any excessive wear and tear -lrb- i protect my computer with the speck cover case , a padded sleeve and then a laptop bag -rrb- i 'm really disappointed that speck can not address this issue even after the multitude of identical reviews about this cracking issue all over the internet i even asked speck if this was a common problem and they said `` they are not aware of this being an issue . i 'm now looking for a better solution and it wo n't be a speck product i do not recommend getting this
i had a speck case on my macbook since i got it it accumulated dust and dirt underneath , and scratched the surface of my computer i wo n't trust speck products to protect my expensive items ever again
continues to fall off the bottom , and it scratches up so easily only had a couple weeks and looks a year plus old also it is cracking at the point where you open the macbook air my advise , is to buy the power support macbook air jacket , its ultra thin -lrb- its not a skin like zagg -rrb- but its got virtually all # star reviews
it cracks in # weeks and it is developing very short ! dont waste your money i have had # of these covers in less than # months and they both broke the tabs that hold it in place break off way too easily
i liked the look of this case - perfectly clear and very minimal ; however , in just a couple of weeks the case cracked at the hinge on both sides , and the bottom will not stay on better to look for a case that will last
i 've got nothing new to report that others have n't already said i bought my mother one of these and within a few months , it began the <unk> and then eventually cracked all the way through the plastic to where the case was not usable for this price , that really is n't acceptable so i would advise looking at other brands than speck
i 'm generally a fan of speck cases -lrb- i 've had four of them now -rrb- , but this one is so thin i got the feeling it was only a matter of time til it cracked in fact , it was a matter of two weeks it cracked at the point where your finger pulls up the screen of the computer -lrb- just above the camera -rrb- maybe it needs some reinforcement there
i 've been using speck see thru cases on my notebooks for the past # years i bought my first macbook air when the line was <unk> last june and i <unk> bought a speck case for it the case bottom does not attach solidly to the computer , and one of the tabs at the back corner of the bottom has now broken off i have not dropped or otherwise abused the computer in any way now the whole intent of using a case like this is that it be sacrificed to protect the computer i am <unk> that the case is <unk> on its own that seems to make it more likely that it will fail its primary mission i do n't want to buy a new case every # months if that 's the failure rate - i will find some other way to protect my computer if i must
when this needs replacing , i will look for something else after a couple of weeks , the top cover developed cracks exactly where others said -- in the middle , above the display camera apart from that significant flaw in design and manufacturing , this does what it should do -- protect the computer from scratches and dings
thin , discreet it fits very well on the # nd generation mb air but cracks very easily , just after normal use the little edges that hold the case to the computer also crack and come off i have had this case for less than # month , and i do n't foresee getting more than another month 's use out of it at least it were cheap , i would n't feel bad about replacing it , but cheap it is not horrible product , i do not recommend it
i have had two speck cases one for a macbook pro and one for an air they look great , perform great , and really protect the computer only downside is that both have broken at the back corner of the bottom piece within days of getting them i travel a lot but i do n't throw my computer around i care enough about taking care of it to buy a case for it before i even take it out of the box so , overall i like speck cases because they 're low profile and look good but their durability is pretty much garbage
this case is a great concept , but executed very poorly the case looks nice and feels nice on the mac however , within two weeks , it started to crack , and in less than a month it would n't stay on the mac unless i <unk> it speck exchanged it for a new one , but same problems appeared in roughly the same time i gave up and got the incipio case unfortunately it was not available in see-thru color so i got the black the incipio case has a better quality feel , but too early to tell if the quality is better i ca n't recommend this product
began after a month or so of regular home use , the bottom case edges cracked at corners by # months , the bottom would n't stay attached i 'm going to replace with something else
i 'm typically a huge fan of speck products and have used them <unk> for my macbooks for my new macbook air # `` , i snagged one of the clear versions from a b & m store low and behold , approximately # months later i had several cracks appear above and to the right of the camera those cracks have now turned to small pieces breaking off i 'll continue to use it while i can , but will be looking for something else in the not to <unk> future
i have receive this item and in my opinion its a nice case , really easy to put it on but scratches easily , besides that looks nice as a mac case
i returned that cover as it was so bulky and added so much weight to my macbook air i got the <unk> shield by zagg i am more satisfied with it
i bought a see thru speck case for my new macbook air it snaps on easily , and looks cool , just a shiny layer over the laptop however , my laptop bag fell off a counter once , from about # feet the laptop was protected alright , but the speck case broke on the corner where it landed a small piece chipped off and now the cover does not stay on all the time you could say the case did its job by protecting the laptop , but i do n't think that 's good enough i had heard wonderful things about speck , and am very disappointed now i am looking for a laptop sleeve , and a laptop bag that will provide more protection i 'll probably continue to use the speck case , just because it will provide extra protection when the laptop is out of the sleeve and bag plus , it does look nice
i was looking for transparent cover to show off my mb air . this one did the job perfectly . it has been more than # years now and i think is high time i switch to something new
it works well for the price but because it is so light and thin it is not bullet proof the little clips on the corners are showing stress lines , and one of the corner clips has broken off it looks great on the device , mostly because it does n't add to much bulk update : the case lasted for about # months of use before it was just unusable
i love the top half of this case i use it every day i however do not use the bottom half i caused my macbook to overheat because of the lack of slits for proper cooling i just threw it away
this case fits great but unfortunately after several months has developed multiple cracks in the bottom piece and as a result no longer stays on the computer i will not buy another one of these
pros - good fit - good materials - good protection with rubber shock absorbing base stubs cons - definitely adds weight my gut feeling is about # . # to # lb heavier the weight is the price to pay for protection against nicks and scratches
the clear speck case effectively protects my macbook air from scratches , which is great peace of mind , especially for travelers the case also snaps on and off easily the biggest con about this product is what many reviewers have already mentioned : the case edges can easily chip off , particularly the fastening points otherwise , i am happy with this case
case fits good and does n't compromise the thinness of the macbook air on mine in particular , the bottom is a little loose and has some flex not a dealbreaker for me as it still does the job
looks great , fits well and most importantly it protects my mba well one more thing , used some clear tape to reinforce the plastic in areas were it might crack
i bought this case with high expectations and it definitely delivered it really does not add anymore bulk to the macbook air and it gives a great sense of mind i can put my new macbook air into backpacks with ring notebooks and such and not worry about the aluminum scratching i have not noticed a problem with the case making the laptop heat
sturdy , reliable product upon opening the box , i thought to myself & # # ; i paid $ # for this ? & # # ; but once i put the case on my laptop i realized it 's all i need
i wanted a hard shell for my macbook air and had used a speck case on my macbook pro and it was perfect i have been using this for a few months and the macbook does get moved around a lot and it is still in perfect condition i dont see any signs of cracks and it is still a snug fit on the laptop i would highly recommend this for your macbook
an hour ago , my computer fell out of my hands and landed hard on it 's corner it had this case on it the computer survived without a scratch i 'm so excited that i had to come here and compliment them <unk> -lrb- the corner of my case broke though i can still use it , but i 'll probably buy another one .
i brought this case for my mac book air and i love it the case makes the computer look better and helps protect it i have always been a fan of speck
it was so easy to install and uninstall whenever i need to it gives clean original look to the computer i do not hear any clicking when i open or close the computer i am just very happy with the quality , price , and function
i ordered the macbook air case around # . # years ago thinking speck to be a reputable brand although i have not subjected it to any extreme <unk> , the case is in absolute tatters cracks everywhere , and the snap on tabs are all broken all this in less than a few months of moderate use other people having similar issues with the same product <unk> to me that the failure was in the product rather than in my particular unit i do n't think i will ever buy speck again
case fits beautifully you 'll love it for a few weeks . after that it will start cracking . within a few months it will be useless call speck and they 'll replace it after you <unk> them it 's not a knock-off . the <unk> will crack too after a few months pieces of it are now breaking off the case every few days do n't buy this if you want true protection for your air
i was told at an apple store that this was more durable case in comparison to others eventually i bought this clear speck case on amazon , i immediately noticed the middle keyboard area was too hot i had never experienced this before i was using the <unk> air jacket before i bought this case unless i 'm wrong , i assume it 's the case that creates overheating issues so i 've stopped using it and have gone back to the air jacket
i did n't get this because the country i live in , brazil , returned it from customs i thing the <unk> thought it was some kind of <unk> <unk> , i do n't know ! who knows what goes on their <unk> <unk> yes , i got very angry that such a simple item to be <unk> at customs ! after a while they returned it , i assume , to amazon . i had to buy it here and pay # times what i would have payed through amazon ! third world , go figure
i bought this for protection but due to it 's thinness , it is also fragile i already have a crack in the upper part because it i maybe snapped it on too hard but it does protect my mba from scratches maybe this product should be made with a less brittle plastic
i might have given this a # star rating if the clips under my hands did not irritate the pad at the base of my thumb when keyboarding but then , i 'm the kind that cuts the labels out of clothing for similar reasons
this cover barely seems to be there everyone that touches my mac book air is always surprised that there is a full protection cover on it i am extremely happy with this cover it has never given me any problems staying on or from protecting my air
this item is a perfect cover for the macbook air thin and <unk> few cons though , i dont like the speck logo on the top shield they should 've placed it on the bottom cover the top cover adds weight to the macbook air 's lid which makes it fall back when kept at an angle
the speck seethru is absolutely perfect ! it 's a clear protective thin plastic shell that snaps right on with ease great product , right fit , and apparently apple sells them in stores too highly recommend this product . i do n't even notice it 's attached to the laptop
i 've been using this case for a while , and i always take my macbook air around with me this case looks amazing it 's gorgeous and smooth , and is of great speck quality even though the case itself says `` speck `` on the bottom , it does n't deter from the sleek and cool design of both the case and my mba everyone i know with a mba or macbook wants to get this case as soon as they see and feel mine worth the price in every way
the add that i had looked at was a little misleading the <unk> showed the bag and it looked like it had a carrying strap but when it arrived this was not the case it was described as a carrying bag for a laptop computer , but had -lrb- no -rrb- strap to be able to carry it with ! i would not have bot this bag if i had known it was strapless they did refund my money without any problems tho
first this case is made to a high standard . fasteners all work easily and will hold up under daily usage purchased this to use with my new hp envy <unk> # . # inch laptop it fits just fine with plenty of left over space for battery etc . ... . not totally sure what it is made of . claims to be a leather like substitute sounds like plastic too me but frankly i do not really care it not only holds my laptop but it has a soft thick interior that will help keep my laptop safe and secure i am totally pleased with this product
i searched everywhere to find a sleeve type case for my newly purchased asus there was another case that amazon suggested but when l read the reviews l found that buyers complained it was n't big enough this one is perfect ! it is a little bigger than the asus , so no issue with it accidentally pushing the buttons its also well padded and best of all the large front pocket is perfect for a mouse , bluetooth keyboard or the tablet power adapter this case would also work well for a large laptop
i bought an electronic picture frame to use at <unk> shows for our <unk> display i bought this sleeve cover separately and could n't be more pleased it fits snugly without being difficult to use , protects my new screen , has a side pocket for spare mounting equipment , is well padded and will protect my screen for years to come , i suspect
the item arrived on time it fit perfect will my computer i did not give it # stars because it did not have a zipper on it to secure my computer but item is great
it was cute and functional ... the only thing i would change would be a zip closure rather than a flap , but that 's just a design deal ... it 's a great case
