i bought this case for the # inch macbook pro and it fits perfectly not to tight where its hard to put in , but not to loose where it slides around it protects it enough , i feel safe lightly tossing it on the bed and i constantly lean on the subway doors while its in my book bag , or sit back on it when sitting down on the train if you have a # inch macbook pro i 'd recommend you get this case
i bought this a few months ago for my girlfriend when she bought the new macbook with the aluminum casing it fits like a glove , is durable , and has good storage for the adapter and a usb drive
excellent fit , great protection my carry on with the computer in the sleeve fell from the top of my rolling luggage when the luggage tipped over the macbook was <unk>
my macbook air # `` # is nice and snug slides easily but fits snugly sleeve is a tad bit longer than the mba <unk> to concern me the padding is like a very tough memory foam <unk> imagine might protect a bit better from a hard edge impact than a soft <unk> nevertheless , part of me wishes for a slightly thicker padding , <unk> the edges and particularly at the bottom of the sleeve since i expect <unk> , like me , will slip the sleeve vertically in their backpack <unk> then <unk> from dropping your pack on the ground a bit hard in a <unk> <unk> no spare room for any adapter in there i 'm a big fan of the case logic sleeves , but i got the one for the macbook <unk> my mba was floating in there i much prefer my be-ez sleeve
i have a late # mackbook air and it fits perfect in this sleeve i was little worried after reading <unk> 's review , but decided to buy it anyway and i 'm well pleased with it the material is very good , and the protection level exceeded my expectations
i got this on a whim and really got lucky it 's a great looking case , well made , and the memory <unk> material looks like it will provide good protection fits the # `` mba like a glove snug , but not too tight a fit
this is a really sturdy product that offers great protection for my macbook air i use it when i travel and throw it into my backpack the cushioning is excellent and the quality great
i love this sleeve working at an apple store , i know what sort of sleeves are pretty much available out there and this one of the best high quality , durable , and fits perfectly coupled with a hard shell , i have no concerns for the protection of my computer it 's here for the long haul and that 's partially thanks to be-ez
i read the earlier reviews that raised concerns about the size -lrb- too big -rrb- and the lack of protection from the zipper , so i was a bit worried when i ultimately decided to buy this sleeve there is some extra length to the sleeve , but i do not find it a problem and the width is perfect on my air also , there is ample protection against the zipper the only thing i do n't like is that the computer can slide up and down -lrb- lengthwise -rrb- in the sleeve , since there is a quarter inch too much room but since i keep my sleeve upright in my backpack , this really does n't cause any problems bottom line : this is an excellent sleeve for the money i would recommend buying it unless you will always carry the sleeve horizontal in orientation and you really think some slight sliding will matter it 's hard to imagine that every being a concern
great fit for my macbook air -lrb- # inch -rrb- easy to carry around and lightweight the material provides a nice blend between firm and soft you can even use it as a mat for your mac in areas you do n't want to place it down good purchase for anyone looking to protect their mac
i am not going to repeat all the positives that have been mentioned about this backpack ; they are all there ! the combination of this beautiful , fresh dark gray and black , make it look elegant i bought one from dell -lrb- at # price turned out to be more expensive than the one from amazon -rrb- , and as far as quality , there is no comparison i am only sorry that i did n't think about checking the amazon site earlier
this is my first swiss gear bag and it 's great very sturdy for my heavy gateway # `` laptop there are indeed many pockets i find myself losing things in this bag the laptop stays in the bag very well there is a strap that fastens so it 's like strapping in my baby so it does n't move lol . very good price i 'm very much satisfied with this bag
this is one of the best backpacks i ever seen it has a lot of pockets to get organized and it 's made with a high quality material perfect option for the people who travel a lot and/or want to carry their laptops and more accesories
got this backpack a couple of days ago so we can take our laptop with us on our upcoming trip it has lots of room our # `` laptop fits perfectly in it and our camera in it 's bag very well made i 've never seen so many pockets on a backpack i recommend this backpack
the backpack works well for my needs , with a lot of handy pockets to store my things it fits my # `` laptop just fine , and still does n't look too bulky it is a great buy
i bought this backpack for my wife 's laptop for christmas unfortunately , the laptop turned out to have a defect and we are returning it however , the backpack is very impressive and the construction of it will withstand years of usage we do a lot of traveling and this backpack certainly fits our lifestyle all i can say is - lots of pockets
one of the two rear zipper was not installed correctly the zipper could never make from the bottom to the top , it would get third of way up we returned the product
the handle is not very sturdy like the other swiss backpacks the laptop storage is backwards , the device is to your back verses in padding between you and the pack if i could redo , i would get another model
i have enjoyed using this bag it has plenty of room for books and other big items as well i have had it for about a month now and have had no complaints i travel out of town for school and go thru the airport frequently , this bag is awesome because of its comfort and convenience the side pockets for drinks is also awesome this is a great quality bag the price was not bad either
swissgear normally makes very high quality items and this backpack is no exception all of the pockets , zippers , and straps look like they can last a long time without damage i also like the green color that they used the backpack is a little heavy by itself , but when you actually put things in it and wear it , you do n't feel the full weight of the bag also , you can fit alot into the backpack and it has a lot of room there is also a padded pocket in the back zipper for laptops , which a nice touch the only thing that i do n't like are the dividers in the middle pocket it may be useful for some people , but they get in the way and take up space that could be used for other purposes the dividers are n't detachable either , so if you do n't like them , too bad overall , its a good backpack
having had -lrb- and abused -rrb- this bag for a semester now , i am still very impressed with the durability of the materials and construction my last bag started to deteriorate after a couple months , but this is still like new i love it
i had this backpack for a few months and loved it ... that was until it ripped it appears the zipper cuts through the fabric and in time it inevitably causes a large tear the backpack is great minus that issue and is part of the reason i gave it # stars the other reason i rated it # stars is because they -lrb- manufacturer -rrb- sent me a new backpack after i told them what happened i did n't use the new backpack for more than a week because i got a briefcase the large tear along the side of the zipper also happened to a coworker with the same backpack i would say that makes it an issue
this is a solidly constructed laptop backpack with all the modern <unk> like water bottle pouch , side pockets , carabiner slot , and ipod organizer it is also quite comfortable to wear , even after long periods of carting it around -lrb- airports and to the client site for me -rrb- the cons are that the backpack has no handle/strap that will slide over your rollerboard handle to make carrying easier the backpack is not big by any means and i find myself space <unk> unlike my previous targus backpack additionally , the zipper frequently jams or gets stuck , causing me unnecessary effort in trying to open the pouches one thing i would recommend to any interested buyer is to try this laptop backpack out in person before purchasing
i got this to replace a targus pack it is well built - especially the zipper pulls , which on the targus did not last long for the frequent traveler , though , there are two design flaws first , the carrying handle is placed <unk> rather than toward the front , which makes it very awkward to cradle on the handle of a carry-on suitcase second , the water bottle holders are too shallow to secure anything but a small can of pop , and the straps do very little to secure a nalgene or other large bottle if i could give it another half star , i would , because it is a good pack overall
it 's nice , elegant , yet durable backpack it is not heavy and has so many pockets it gives a good protection for a laptop in addition , amazon gives the best price and service there is only one problem - straps , they are not <unk> , so it does n't feel comfortable i noticed that only in a few days after use , so it was too late to return so check it out right a way when you get it otherwise , it 's a good backpack
easily fits my dell d # plenty of pockets one negative - the separator between the two large compartments is not a full separator it is open at the bottom which mean small items move between the two compartments
this backpack is very nicely designed it has plenty of room ; lots of pockets and storage areas my # `` laptop fits nicely in the laptop pocket it is also pretty comfortable the only negative is that it 's really too big for my needs i carry my laptop everywhere , but rarely with anything else i have a lot of wasted space and it 's a little bulky but , like my title says , i think it would be great for a student with books or for a traveler who could use it as a small carry-on
this backpack seems to have it all -- a sleeve for your laptop , two side sleeves for your bottle of water or coffee <unk> cup , a sleeve for your phone or ipod and several zipper compartments for <unk> it 's sturdy , also , with <unk> shoulder straps i 've <unk> into using the backpack full-time because it holds so much -lrb- including my gym clothes and shoes , my lunch , my book & my winter accessories -- all at the same time ! definitely a good buy thumbs up from me
used this for my freshman year @ college , and i still use it now it looks great , and is incredibly durable and well built it also houses my # . # `` laptop very nicely , keeping it safe from the beating it would take from heavy books in any other backpack recommended to any college student bringing laptop on campus , and anyone looking for a durable bag that can hold plenty of weight
this was the best price around for this brand of backpack it 's well made and lots of pockets and features that are usefull fast shipment from this seller was a plus with school starting
i bought this backpack for my husband for his birthday he had a `` regular `` laptop case that when loaded weighed over # pounds he loaded up this backpack - everything fit , and it came in at # pounds he is very pleased , making me a genius
when i got this backpack i was fully satisfied with its quality appearance and abundance of features my # . # `` hp pavilion laptop fits snugly in there ... would n't put anything bigger than that in there are several pockets and clips , dividers , and little sacks for anything you want to put in them the media pocket is a great size ; perfect for any large mp # player or smart phone like my itouch there is also a pocket for your headphones all of the seams and straps feel extremely secure and i would not worry about pushing the limits of such a well built backpack the carrying handle is well padded as well as the section that rests on your back most of the straps are adjustable as well i would highly reccomend this to anyone who has a bigger laptop and several accesories the price is quite dandy for such a great product , do n't think you 'll be missing out by buying a more expensive brand
i bought this backpack for my boyfriend for christmas he lives in a city and uses public transportation and takes his work laptop everywhere he loves it it works great for daily use holding work items last weekend we went <unk> and he used it on the mountain too -lrb- of course , his laptop was n't in it while on the mountain -rrb- it held up great in the snow the straps are comfortable on your shoulders and there is plenty of little pockets and storage space
this is a durable , lightweight backpack great for long hauls across campus this pack was the first product i have bought from swissgear , but wo n't be the last great combination / location of internal pockets , pouches and slots allow you to pack way more into this bag than you can imagine also , my # `` inspiron # fits perfectly into the well padded laptop slot this is the first online review i have ever written for a product , shows that i am very impressed with the <unk> ratio not to mention i chose amazon 's # day shipping option and recieved the bag in one day
i kept looking for a good backpack here it is the one you might look for it has a well padded provision for placing your laptop . # . # inch laptop can fit in very well comes with a mobile phone , water bottles -lrb- # -rrb- , sunglass , ipod , separate headphones compartment , organizer for keeping your stuffs a light weight backpack i do n't find my laptop heavy while carrying it in my backpack
one of these days when this backpack finally <unk> or a zipper breaks , we will try to come back on amazon and update you right now , it 's in year # or # of active duty it 's been a companion through schools , trips , vacations , libraries , <unk> , etc . it does n't look <unk> or worn , either still looks presentable
i expected a lot given the brand the feel is great it 's a little heavier than thin , cheap backpacks , but using both large thick shoulder pads is great especially when the bag is weighed down with my laptop and books i was a little disappointed that things inside get wet during <unk> , but that 's what happens when there are rivets open to the air i guess it was great , but after # or so months of using it the seam at the top of the shoulder pads started to come apart at both shoulder straps i 'll be contacting the company to see if they 'll send a replacement , but in the mean time i 'm a little bummed about it the mp # player stash inside is great even in the rain where i can cover the bag with a big jacket and then plug my ear buds into the shoulder strap -- excellent design
this backpack is the bomb ! ! i orginally got this for my # `` gateway laptop i purchased , but then upgraded to a # `` hp dv # series , and this does fit a # `` in the assigned pouch in the same compartment , if you put the laptop in the middle , it will then zip up all the way if you do not , and use the assigned laptop pouch , you have to wiggle the zipper and force it to close which i am quite sure is not good for the lid on the laptop overall , the swiss backpack is fantastic ! ! ! ! it very durable , has many many compartments -lrb- including for your mp # player -rrb- and has a # . # headphones plug in on the sleeve so you can go hiking listening to <unk> ! has # small water bottle holders , # on each side , with a strap to hold them in place . # keychain / key holder has plenty of book space and pen holder -lrb- s -rrb- . *** remember that this will not fit a # `` inch comfortably in the bag , unless it is stored on the outside assigned compartment
swissgear makes great products they 're always surprisingly spacious and durable i bought this packback as a gift and found the price to be # % less from this dealer than in-store prices i had <unk> at this would be a great buy for a college student , or a professional who feels comfortable with wearing a backpack to work
this is the third swissgear that i own good quality as promised however , the color shown is not the same as i received the blue is darker and kind of dirty look -lrb- mixed with green ? i think i will give as gift to someone who would like that kind of color
this product is great has plenty of space for things the compartment for your laptop is very well padded it has a spot in the bag where your mp # player plugs into and the adapter to it is on the shoulder strap
i bought this backpack a little over a month ago because it was stylish , had many pockets including a laptop section two weeks ago , i put my lenovo t # laptop and couple of books in the bag and one of the handles came off that day i hope amazon sends me another one :
it is really a nice backpack good look and quality but for me , it does not have enough pockets and the cellphone pocket is not big enough anyway , it is a good choice for my # ' laptop
i received it one week later after i purchased it and it came with good condition i am using it to carry my macbook pro # inch and it fit well before this bag i used another swiss gear backpack so i have known how good it should be so far nothing wrong happens on that just a notice : i do n't think # inch laptop fits , # . # inch is the max
the backpack i received was similar in structure to the one pictured , but not the same colors it has a light , <unk> gray instead of the darker gray and unattractive <unk> accent colors on the bottom and -lrb- where the light gray is pictured -rrb- and on the shoulder straps if my wife does n't like it , i 'm planning on returning it
my # `` thinkpad fits in like a glove the bags feels sturdy and has sufficient space for holding the laptop and quiet a few books the only annoying thing is that the front section is too silky and uncomfortable otherwise a great deal
this is a good bag strong , light but could be a little more spacious the other swissgear bags that i bought before were a little more spacious than this one the laptop compartment can hold a # `` laptop <unk> by an elastic velcro flap there is a small opening for letting the earphones out through the backpack which is cool the sunglass holder is essentially a flap on the straps where you latch the sunglasses on i do n't use it but could be helpful to some there 's a small compartment on the straps for the cellphone too overall , this is a light , compact and a sturdy bag buy this if you are not too concerned about space
this bag makes me want to throw my previous bag away perfect for my # . # ' macbook the color is not navy as shown in the picture but `` dark <unk> gray `` as said in the title , which is better for me because this color goes with everything
no time for a long review here , this will be quick i love this backpack , very comfortable even when heavy pleanty of room for everything , laptop sleeve , pockets for everthing ; pocket knife , sunglasses , cell phone , pencils , papers , cd 's , ipod , cd player , and a hook for your keys also has two water bottle pockets and a headphone port nice padded handles and straps all together a great buy
was not the color i ordered , pieces that should have been obviously stitched on were found inside the bag , certain pockets had been sewn over in truth i was <unk> because it felt like i received a knock off i hope that was not the case , but was n't happy at all i had to go and spend more money to buy another from a different store
i really hate the pictures that are online which show this bag as very large and some of the reviews as well mention this backpack to be very spacious , and that is not true this could be that seller 's fault and i might have got a smaller one other than that the quality is really good and the backpack looks awesome i do n't suggest this one to people who are looking for spacious bag that can hold # or # text books along with a # . # inch laptop and
i 'm giving it a single star only because it says it fits laptops up to # . # inches , and it does not i took the time to measure my laptop , just to be sure , and i was really upset that when it arrived my computer , a new asus , did not fit there are lots of cool pockets to let you be organized , but if you do n't have an ultra thin notebook style laptop , do n't bother with this backpack
i will give it a # star , it does n't fit my # . # asus laptop it can close , but doens ' t mean it fits , because the edge of the bag where the top of the laptop touches is being wearing out i can almost see thru <unk> i need to replace this bag with something else , i only got this for # months and only use it for school , no heavy use at all ... very
i use a backpack as my primary means of bringing my laptop back and forth to the office as well as my carry-on for traveling on short trips swissgear products have been a great purchase in the past , but this was just a disappointment several of the straps began to fray and tear almost after the first month of use given my ` heavy use ' i decided to splurge and get a backpack from everki - best backpack ever - and they have great other products as well if you just need a casual , cheap bag , this will probably suffice , but for a ` road warrior ' , this is not a good bag for you
the pack is well built , except that swissgear used really cheap zippers , all of which have split off the tracks at one point or another , even without much weight or bulk in the compartments i 've been buying swissgear for years , and have never been disappointed with any of their products until now it 's an awful bag , and i unfortunately missed the return window by three days , so now i 'm stuck with it
this backpack is sad one of the elastic straps tore off within a week of use it has progressively gotten worse i 'm still using the backback but it 's both uncomfortable to use and aesthetically <unk> since the entire strap is disintegrating because of the flaw in production of the light gray extra strength strap on the back i thought i was unlucky until i saw someone with the exact problem on the train in addition i found the stitches near the zipper to be poor quality too i have been really displeased with this product and feel like a dakine , timberland or <unk> backpacks i 've had in the past would be a much better alternative
loved this pack until it started fraying in multiple areas most prominent and important place is along the seems where the shoulder straps attach to the pack also having issues with seems fraying and falling apart along the zipper will not recommend purchasing another one thought the brand would have stood for quality lastly , it did no better than a $ # cheap pack i got at wal-mart
my previous wenger laptop backpack gave me over four years of good service before some of the stitching along the zippers started coming apart , so i <unk> around for a replacement it was about a good a design as i could hope for but they do n't make that one anymore then i wound up with this there 's just no comparison the bag will not stand upright with or without the laptop in it - always falling over the compartment for papers is n't designed in a way that supports and protects them , so they 'll be tough to put in and then get all <unk> and wrinkled compartments for odds and end are actually too deep so small items like usb drives get lost way down in them there 's no high edge pocket for little things like earphones , etc . how did i wind up with such a bad bag after such a good one i may possibly buy another wenger bag but will definitely find them in a store and examine closely
everything was perfect about this bag until i opened the box and saw the top strap was ripped i hope they take some time to check the quality of each backpack before they send out the product
warning to those of you giving a swissgear backpack for a gift i was given a bad for christmas last year without the <unk> providing me with the receipt the bags right strap is almost completely unraveled and the top handle is cracked i sent an email and got a very fast and polite email asking for pictures i provided them immediately received another very polite email this morning asking me to call another group below this very polite email was a stodgy form email telling me basically call the recipient and get the receipt or you are out of luck i am out of luck because i am not that <unk> another email was received and no warranty is honored if received as a gift - only original purchaser if you want a copy of the email <unk> i will provide them
it would not fit my # & # # ; hp laptop at all very disappointed and returned the item rendered it useless and not able to fit more than a # & # # ; laptop in the backpack .
this review is very simple i ordered one of these , and the gray strap on one shoulder began to separate from the top of the bag within about # uses i got a replacement -lrb- thanks amazon -rrb- within about another # uses of the new bag the exact same thing started to happen i do not carry rocks in this thing or <unk> it it is just a very poorly made piece of junk it looks good , feels good , etc , but it will fall apart on you very quickly
i am very disappointed that this is falling apart so quickly it is ripping out near the zipper so , now i have to decide if i should buy a new one or pay to have it repaired
this is high quality and well-padded , but heavy before anything is even put into it also , the front section is virtually unusable since the pocket is very deep and the zipper only runs across the top i have to return it added later : instead of returning it , i sold it to a co-worker , for the same price i paid it lasted a week before the <unk> part broke , and about a month before it started to tear swiss army ? ? i offered my co-worker 's money back , but he said swiss army has a lifetime guaranty well , that took months and resulted in a new backpack -lrb- big <unk> -rrb- and a very rude <unk> changing my review from two stars to one surprisingly , i have to say that if you want high quality and courteous customer service , do n't buy this brand
i bought this for my dell xps # . # laptop and i am very disappointed after trying to use it for my laptop it did n't fit for my laptop i was on vacation and came back after almost after a month so i ca n't return this now
straps started to fray after a few weeks , zippers just randomly burst open , not recommended at all small space inside can put a laptop , # book and # binders , past that it is a pain
this bag is very low quality . it has poor stitching at the seams and will not carry anything that has mass without ripping the stitching it has a good design for my needs , but needs to be stitched professionally
after using in for a few trips , it developed some internal tears and thread started to come out at a few places zipper got <unk> a few times <unk> meet the swissgear standards
purchased in june of # and worked well until the grey shoulder strap pulled away from it 's seam amazon will not take back called swissgear and they were not able to assist because this product was made by group iii international called them and completed their return form and was requested to drop it off at an luggage <unk> in <unk> i live in <unk> anyway , the cost of shipping and doing without laptop bag for # weeks would be worth my while spend a little more and get a better quality bag
everything was good but there was an issue with front of bag rubber this rubber holder <unk> after few months and now the rubber holder became useless even made backpack looks ugly i tried to find out to repair this backpack but i guess it wo n't be easy you may want to keep all docs that comes with backpack to get cover lifetime warranty
i ordered this bag to replace an old bag that i had one feature i liked about the old bag was a front pen pocket that kept some small items like business cards and eyeglasses organized i tried this swiss gear pack based on the quality that i saw on a different model that my sister owns they seem like well made products ; and i should say that this bag was up to their standards but - the small front pocket for pens etc only opens from the top , and getting at or seeing the items and small things inside that pocket is darn near impossible this rendered the front pocket pretty much useless in my opinion , and i returned the bag for a refund from amazon swissgear makes great backpacks , but i really want a small bag , not some huge # `` laptop thing that seems to be most of their line up this bag is smaller , but the pocket design was disappointing
the backpack has excellent storage capability and seems well made , the only issue was the straps were so uncomfortable i could n't keep the pack on more than a minute or two the upper part of the straps kept rubbing my neck , but i am petite and maybe this pack is just too large for me could work for a <unk> person maybe
this is a pretty small backpack it does not fit a standard # & # # ; macbook for # & # # ; mbp it would probably be fine the other compartments seemed small too i returned my shipment
i owned a <unk> back pack for years , it was excellent - i thought i was getting the same backpack , but its less than # the size , barely contains my # inch laptop and has far less
this backpack has a terrible pocket design the upfront pocket does n't open all the way , so it 's really difficult to get stuff in and out the middle pocket , presumably for books , had a weird construction where the top is a lot wider than the bottom seems like wasted space to me , since if i put something on top , i 'd need to take it out every time i need to access my books the last pocket has a well protected laptop sleeve , but you ca n't fit any more books in it overall , my complaint about the two swiss army laptops bags that i purchased is that the bag looks large , but its capacity is not as high as i 'd hope this one is going back , and i am buying an llbean backpack instead
i quoted tim 's review because it addressed my major issue ' , `` the outside front organizing pocket has all the nooks and crannies that you want , but it is almost unusable because of how tight it is if they had made it so the enclosing zipper went further down on both sides it would probably work quite well as it is , you ca n't really take proper advantage of them .
i like the look and feel of the bag , but when i transferred my books to the new bag and put it on , for the first time , the strap that held the plastic connection came apart after inspecting it , it looks like the piece of fabric to hold on the plastic piece had never been sewed seems like someone was rushing around to put it together and never actually put it all together i was very disappointed
<unk> , this back pack had everything i wanted a padded laptop pocket , several large compartments , and multiple pouches for organizing things unfortunately , the quality is very poor after two uses , the gray part shoulder strap started pulling out of the backpack it also has an attachment that you place on your key ring so you can quickly clip your keys to the inside of the bag the wall on the clip is so thin that it broke just by placing my keys in my pocket i contacted swissgear customer service about a warranty repair for the strap , and they told me i would have to cover the cost of shipping to back to them i appealed since this would have added another # % to the cost of the pack but they insisted that i cover the cost of returning my defective backpack i wish i would have bought something else
i could barely fit my dell # & # # ; laptop inside it was too cramped and stiff i thought it would have been bigger felt sturdy though overall i was concerned about the & # # ; wavy main zipper & # # ; mentioned in other reviews the main compartment was not a straight path around the bag , which i wanted i opted for a timbuk # command and am very happy
i have had this bag a short time # months or less and it already has a broken strap -lrb- gray portion -rrb- i expected better and have had better luck in the past
before buying this i read some reviews that the shoulder strap comes apart at the seam i liked the bag so i thought i would give it a shot and so far i have really liked it , however , they were right the right shoulder strap is coming out at the seam also , as a lot of other reviews have already mentioned , the front small pocket has a very small opening , you have to dig for anything you put in there as you can not see inside
tho the bag is mad of great quality the comfort and ease of use was not up to my expectations the large pocket is very narrow and makes it difficult to carry <unk> objects also the pockets are at odd <unk> and it just seems that this back pack is more awkward than
for me , recently i made trips around the us and used the backpack everything is ok , but i found a serious detail when i zipped the slide fastener there is a zipper lost one tooth so when i zipped , both sides could not fit well now i try not to use that zipper but it is very inconvenient i hope that i can get some refund i can post the picture so that everyone can see its making quality
this is the second swissgear bag i buy i was very happy with the looks and the light weight of both however , this one has good protection on bottom and sides , but no protection on top second day at work , the back fell from my chair and my macbook pro # `` was damaged -lrb- - keep looking for bags i would pass this one
the description says this fits # . # inch laptop but my laptop -lrb- sony vaio -rrb- does n't fit in this description should be really changed this fits # inch laptop only not # . # as
i purchased this based on reviews , but i am disappointed that in less than # months the zipper breaks and all my stuff fell out on the floor i have owned several backpacks over the years , including swissgear i wo n't be buying anymore after the poor workmanship of the zipper on this backpack
i liked the look and price of this bag but was very disappointed by the quality of the build the outside front organizing pocket has all the nooks and crannies that you want , but it is almost unusable because of how tight it is if they had made it so the enclosing zipper went further down on both sides , it would probably work quite well as it is , you ca n't really take proper advantage of them plus with less than # months usage , the zippered pocket contained within completely shredded making <unk> in even more of a frustrating exercise things that you often take out or put away -lrb- iphone plug , cables , pens , keys , etc -rrb- get caught and shred it even worse i am putting in for a replacement from swissgear today will let you know how it goes
just returned from a trip overseas for # weeks , though the front pouch would be awesome for the passport , keys , and money but the front pocket was completely useless the interior is black so it 's difficult to see , and if something falls out of the little pouches in the front it 's difficult to find the zipper does n't go down far enough to access the little pockets so you find yourself having to pull it open with one hand and open zippers and access pockets with the other excellent padding for a laptop , awesome protection for the mac , lots of room in the other two compartments . just cant use the front pouch for much
i put a couple of things in this . maybe a book , calculator , and tablet , and it feels like i 'm carrying around a few <unk> blocks it 's of great quality , but it 's just too heavy
the quality of zippers is not very good the bag fits the laptop easily but then there is n't much space to put many things after that so if you are looking for a very spacious backpack this is not the best option
its definitely a great bag , but the one and major complaint is the size of the front pocket - the zipper it too small to access items i find the pocket useful , but the zipper reduces the front pocket functionality i find it difficult to reach into the pocket - which is a deep pocket - and access the items its a bummer because the rest of the bag is great
this is a very nice back pack , however make no mistake that this is for a teenager or woman also , i would recommend this back pack only if you are interested in carrying a laptop and maybe a small notebook
overall , it was just okay the good thing is that it looks and feels durable , but it can hardly accommodate my # -inch laptop when i tried to zip it up , the edges of my laptop are kinda bulging due to its crammed condition there was n't enough room either inside the bag for other stuffs but the price is great
it is ok smaller than i expected not a lot of space to put things in after the laptop good if you do n't have a lot of things in the bag
i got this backpack to replace my messenger bag for traveling the laptop comes out from the top and there is no flap to interfere while going through security my main complaint is that the front pouch of the backpack has a very limited zipper and even when i unzip it all the way , it is difficult to navigate all the small pouches inside the water bottle pouches on the sides are also a little smaller than i 'm used to i had to stretch it quite a bit to fit a # oz plastic bottle the bag itself feels sturdily constructed and has plenty of room for all my stuff my # inch macbook pro fits nicely in the laptop sleeve -lrb- <unk> it does n't seem the sleeve is meant to cover the entire laptop - it only goes about # % of the way up my laptop -rrb-
the bag is great i ordered on monday the bag arrived on tuesday and i paid for regular delivery the bag has a lot of compartments and you fell less of the weight for when carrying the laptop
i really wanted to love this backpack my husband has a larger -lrb- better -rrb- version of this ... but i really thought it was going to be made better - as one would expect from swissgear within a few months the gray shock straps on the shoulder straps have pulled away from the seam . : -lrb- i have a bad back so the support those provided was super important to me i am hoping it can be <unk> , but what a disappointment . a few months use is not nearly long enough for the price -lrb- any price , imo -rrb- and quality brand this is supposed to be
the swissgear computer backpack has been a good product for me however , the elastic chord that is seen ` <unk> ' in the picture has stretched out permanently a year later and now looks terrible i also have stitching that has come undone at the seam on the arm strap connection to the upper connection to the main pack i do carry laptops and books , and i do use this every day the laptop pouch is nice for my macbook pro # `` -lrb- with room to spare -rrb- there are plenty of pockets and zippers internally in order to keep your important items separated and in place where you want them i understand that nothing will completely withstand the test of time i guess i just thought it could last a couple years before deteriorating over-all i would recommend this backpack to <unk> - but i would advise them to pick it up on sale , as the $ # price is way too steep for this quality at $ # , you 're in a much more reasonable <unk>
on the red front panel , the stitching is coming out and you can see the black threads in multiple places on the right shoulder strap the stitching is coming apart also i use it as an office backpack , no outdoors anything contacted group iii international about it , they replied promptly which is nice but i have to pay to ship the bag to them , and that 's only after <unk> photos and info to them first they will then check the photos and info and deem it covered by warranty or not what a beating of a process not so sure on the quality that i had such high hopes for will probably just let the thing fall apart and get something else because i do n't have the time to wrestle with the warranty ` experience '
pretty tough , put about # pounds of books and my laptop in it and it held up ok the top gray loop party came apart after heavy usage it did make a weird squeaking noise when walking with heavy books inside
