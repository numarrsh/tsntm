i bought this for my boyfriend for his birthday and he loved it he thought i spent way more than i actually did ca n't wait to see what i get for my birthday it also came in on time , very impressed by the whole experience
bought the backpack , then took it to switzerland for a week am now using it daily and on trips as my business briefcase much easier on the back than a briefcase with a shoulder strap the side pockets could have used a double zipper arrangement so it would be easier to hold drinks in those pockets overall very happy
this was a goldbox item so i got it at a good value it 's very durable with many pockets but it 's just not quite big enough for me it also does not have a water bottle pocket like advertised which really disappointed me the two side pockets are just too small
i purchased this pack as i 've been using a regular pack for airline carry-on , including a laptop i found that the pack had many dividers , as well as a built-in padded compartment for the laptop since i keep my laptop in a neoprene sleeve , i cut out the padded compartment , which took up ~ # of the compartment volume in the next section , a divider compartmentalized the compartment into three sections , which would be good if you carry lots of paperwork or small books , which i do not once again , i <unk> removed the dividers to make room for a camera bag , pillow and jacket the shoulder straps seem to keep sliding to the outside of my shoulders , and lacking a sternum strap , there is little recourse but to continue pulling the straps to center overall , ok , but would not buy again
this pack is of very high quality at a great price there are lots of storage compartments and pockets of various sizes to meet your needs it does not transport loose papers very well if you have other items in the bag as they tend to <unk> the dividers also if you need to carry very large or bulky items , this bag is not for you it does protect and secure a laptop very well
fits # `` laptop perfectly when i have the laptop in , however , i can only fit # notebook and # textbook - i suppose i do n't want to be carrying much more anyway it has a lot of pockets
great packpack for carrying a laptop and such high , high quality very impressed . lots of rooms , compartments for pens , <unk> cards , files , etc . i would give this # stars but the laptop compartment , is as some other users have commented , is not quite as good as it should be the notebook has about # in at the top where there is no padding or protection not a major issue , but i would think padding should cover the entire notebook still , a great , great pack
this is an all around great bag for school i really like that this bag is both a great backpack and does a good job of protecting your laptop it has a ton of storage and pockets and holds a lot of stuff the straps are super comfortable my only complaint is that the front pockets could be a bit larger so that a pen can easily fit in and out
this pack is great ! it is made very well and has lots of storage it is very comfortable to wear and it 's appearance is all that i thought it would be coming from swiss army worth every penny
the backpack is awesome when i first took it out the box , it was a little bigger larger than i imagined but not excessively too big i 've had swissgear backpacks before so i already knew about the build quality there are a bunch of pockets everywhere i pack away my notebook , a few books , ac adapter , misc pens , portable hdd , and ethernet cable all organized the best part of this thing is the comfort even with me lugging around all my junk , i do n't even notice the weight on my back but it gets heavy when i hold it by the handle overall , awesome notebook backpack
this thing is roomy , well-organized with plenty of pocket space and different types of pockets , and does n't scream `` i contain a laptop - steal me ! `` like many bags in this category often do it 's durable , with heavy-duty zippers , and seems water-resistant enough to withstand some rain it feels good on the shoulders and back and has decent ventilation do n't forget the ipod pouch inside the top pocket and the headphone wire eyelet
after five years of heavy use , this backpack is still in about the exact same shape it was when i bought it i 've found it perfect for my purposes -lrb- laptop , textbooks , the occasional weekend trip -rrb- , very durable and comfortable to wear i ca n't recommend it highly enough i wish more products were designed this thoughtfully and made this well
this backpack is amazing i wish i bought one of these swissgear bags years ago when i started traveling and needing to bring my computer along this has been a lifesaver while passing through airports i am able to put my wallet and other personal items in the backpack along with my laptop and all the peripherals that go along with that the bag is comfortable when worn over the shoulders the compartments have room for my <unk> , notebooks and still have room to spare
got this backpack as a gift from a friend the thing looks really good lot of pockets to keep things organized . plenty of space within zippers are great type of backpack which can be carried to work on the whole great deal for the price
this backpack is the best , according to both my husband and my son it is sturdy enough for a laptop , yet it is not super bulky it features multiple compartments -lrb- for keys , water , mp # or phone -rrb- , but some of the pockets are hidden , <unk> to a sleek and stylish look more importantly , it can withstand being thrown daily into my son 's locker or carried around as the carryon bag for my husband 's many business trips and the amazon.com discount makes it super affordable
the product is really convenient to put all kinds of stuff other than the computer itself it is <unk> bring to the school or the library as well as for a trip i like the bag
swissgear computer backpack <unk> with durable materials is an ideal carrying travelling kit for my laptop and other accessories the pack is heavily built provides excellent protection to any fragile items stowed inside the numerous pockets with the pack is another assets added to this pack , which comes with such a shocking low price item received on time as per schedule
i used this bag for two years and gave it to my son who has been using it for # years the thing still looks brand new swissgear makes pretty good bags this is my second swissgear bag and i 've always gotten plenty of bang for my buck
i am very happy with the backpack i fly frequently and this backpack is great for traveling the different compartments are handy although it did take me a while to organize it to my liking i like the design of the shoulder strap because it distributes the weight comfortably
it 's able to organize all my stuff very well , and i 'm amazed how someone came up with so many functions in such backpack i fits my laptop quite well , but it seems not suitable to large laptops
the only real issue was the the zip holders had <unk> <unk> after i moved to a <unk> area did not affect the bag use in anyway survived # years of some rough use compartments are highly <unk> and probably the best in class zippers did not survive a wash and had to replace the bag soon after
this laptop bag really made of swiss army it 's really protect your laptop with <unk> of pocket the price unbeatable at amazon compare with other brand , this really great wan na order another one for my brother but unfortunately it 's sold out when it will available ? ? ? ? ? ?
this is a well-made , nice looking bag with lots of protection for a laptop but make sure it 's the size you 're looking for this bag is very big and as a petite woman , i look silly carrying it -lrb- not to mention when stuffed full , it 's way too heavy to be practical -rrb- if you want a big bag to carry lots of stuff , this is it but if you want something a bit smaller and lighter , then this is n't for you
i am very pleased with the swiss gear backpack i had a dell backpack for my previous dell laptop and that backpack started to fall apart almost immediately after i started to use it the swiss gear backpack is holding up very well i use it almost every day of the week the backpack is comfortable to wear and the weight is well distributed
after owning other , more expensive laptop backpacks , i can say this one is definitely my favorite the large zippers and thick fabric -lrb- which feels like canvas -rrb- are both very durable additionally , there is a lot of padding to protect my laptop i did not expect it to be especially stylish based on the online pictures , but i have actually received a few complements in <unk> it 's a slightly darker color of blue and less bulky looking the extra padding for the laptop has some notable side effects first , the laptop is stored closest to the body , so if it rains <unk> that may serve as an extra barrier against <unk> on the downside , the bag does not breathe quite as readily as other laptop bags , so you may end up with a sweaty back if you use it for extended periods of time in warmer climates overall i am pleased with this purchase and would recommend it to a friend
this backpack is excellent for school ! ! the laptop is very well secured inside it there are a lot of pockets for gadgets and room for books it helps you be very organized it 's a little bigger than you would expect from a backpack , but it 's very nice very sturdy fabric i used it only for school for now , not for hiking yet
i purchased this backpack in april # and was pleased with the backpack at first aside from the fact that the backpack itself is heavy i liked the computer sleeve and the large number of pockets i used the backpack for about # months before one of the straps began to rip near where they connect to the backpack next a section on one of the straps ripped luckily i got this at a discounted rate on amazon but i still paid too much for a backpack that only lasted for # months i am very disappointed , sadly i will not be buying another swiss gear backpack again
i 've been using this back pack for a few months for college it easily holds a plethora of textbooks , an army of school supplies and my laptop it took me weeks to find all the pockets , which are handy for separating supplies from snacks from cosmetics from your handy swiss army knife -lrb- which has its own designated pocket , of course ! -rrb- it 's very comfortable to wear even when loaded down , and large enough to hold a heavy quarter 's worth of books , but i do n't feel like a turtle at a lean # ' # `` the material is durable and does n't show a bit of wear after a quarter of use so far it 's proven to be relatively waterproof my only complaint is that the mesh side pockets are shallow and are tapered at the bottom , meaning that even a narrow water bottle is prone to falling out if the pack leans over at all however , this is not a significant problem so long as it stays upright , and i 've yet to lose anything
this is an excellent , sturdy backpack good design and color -lrb- royal blue -rrb- too has loads of pockets for organizing and storing all your stuff could n't find a dedicated pocket to store laptop charger though . . that would have been nice the bag is definitely not light , it gets heavy even when packed with a laptop , charger and couple of other things but i guess thats the compromise for its sturdiness -lrb- metal reinforced handle , thick shoulder straps , <unk> back cushion support , huge zippers and durable material -rrb- also , the shoulder straps are a bit wide apart making it a little uncomfortable for <unk> framed people overall , a very good bag that can easily hold a lot of stuff
lots of pockets , good quality zippers and easy on my back its a wonderful bag it also has a very nice protective pocket for my pc i purchased # other bags before trying this one , i 'm so glad i gave swiss gear a try , i will definitely stick with them
well the main thing i was looking for was a laptop backpack that would fit my macbook pro # `` , and still have a lot of space available for my college supplies and well i 'm glad i choose this one , it really is a good deal , considering i saw the same bag on the <unk> main website for more than twice the price theres a pouch in the back pocket for my laptop and charging cables , as well as a larger front pocket with dividers for books and notebooks the other smaller pockets , -lrb- which there is about # just on the outside -rrb- make it <unk> to really store anything i also choose the free super saver shipping , and it only took # days to come so i 'm very pleased
this has plenty of room for all your large textbooks and folders , with a separate compartment for a # inch notebook , -lrb- my # . # inch acer aspire one fits quite well -rrb- lots of additional compartments for pens , calculators and two water bottle holders a little heavy , bit very comfortable back support from one college student to another , highly recommended
the interior seams tore in about # months i purchase the same laptop bag back when ibm owned the lenovo product line , and it lasted for years i replaced it because it got too dirty i sure hope lenovo laptops do not follow the same path
this backpack will last no more than # months max when you call lenovo because the seams are coming apart even though you have only carried a notebook in it , you are told someone else makes these backpacks no way to get the warranty repair on it , so you just throw away
this is one of those best backpacks i have ever used besides <unk> and other leading brands i have tried , i would rate this bag as the number # ; being designed professionally to suit requirements perfectly of an it professional like me though , the only thing which i miss is the waterproof design factor of the same but still , it 's the best laptop backpack one can buy i am really happy about the build , material quality , product design
personally , i think you will not regret for this purchase this bag 's quality is very good ; room inside is large enough for one # `` laptop and # thick textbooks for school use i also could put my huge <unk> into it , very convenient for school use
first , this item is advertised for a # & # # ; laptop but our # & # # ; laptop does n't fit into it also , in the photos , there is one that shows inside pockets there are no inside pockets on the case we received so we will be returning it
i purchased this laptop bag in oct. # it was delivered <unk> and was exactly as described it is a very cute bag and its size worked perfectly for my macbook air # in laptop the fabric has <unk> well as well however , less than # months later the strap is about to come apart from the base
i actually returned this item because i did not like the color and pattern it appeared to be of good quality though . it was soft and had very good padding . i had specifically ordered this type as i wanted dual usage with handles and a strap i ended up buying a different color and design but if you like the design you can trust this brand
i really liked this pattern but the one they shipped me was of a much bigger leopard print not thrilled with it it wont match my other bags so am probably going to return it
it 's nice n cute i wish it had a little bit more room for the charger and sunglasses i bought it for my husband and this is what he thinks of it
this case is nicely padded and a perfect fit for my new small laptop pay attention to the sizing directions - they are right on love the <unk> pattern as well as the built in handles and detachable shoulder strap
i love this bag it is the perfect size for my # . # inch chromebook it 's so versatile & can be carried with either handle or shoulder strap i love the material , roominess , pattern & the colors and , it has a cat on it : -- rrb- thank you
i love this laptop bag i also love the extra pockets that it gives you to store papers , pens , and other small office items it is stylish and the shoulder strap makes it very convenient and functional to carry around what i like about this laptop bag is that since it does not just contain your laptop , you can carry it like a purse
purchased this bag and received it really quick its a nice size case but ... ... ... disappointed about the following i bought the paisley print which i loved when i got it , the <unk> looking color is instead <unk> green looks like the coloring is old as the photo showed , inside the sleeve there were pockets for pens , pads , etc . mine has no pockets at all all it holds is the laptop shame i bought this and now need to look for another case
this case is fine it 's well made and colorful however , like other reviewers i purchased this case based on the pictures in the listing the pictures clearly show inside pockets to hold pens , pads of paper , etc . there are no pockets inside this case a bit disappointing since i like to put pencils , pens , papers inside my laptop cases so only three stars
my wife bought this bag and said she was very impressed with the thickness of the material ; however , she was disappointed with the lack of interior pockets as shown in one of the pictures the only pocket is on the exterior and is quite large the colors were a bit lighter than shown in the picture they are more turquoise and orange than blue and crimson she was overall happy with her purchase
this case is stylish , and the strap does n't slip , like it says the strap does get twisted pretty easily though and i wish there was more padding for my computer 's sake another downside -- the colors are not as vibrant as they look on a screen i can put my # & # # ; computer and a novel in the case and that 's it , which is all i needed overall i am pleased , and would recommend this to someone looking for a snug , stylish case
this is a beautiful case i love the design and it looks pretty much like the picture it was bigger than my daughter needed but she also <unk> when it arrived i would highly recommend this case
my # year old granddaughter picked this case out on-line as a christmas gift from me she had saved enough of her own money to buy herself a laptop and wanted a case for it for christmas we were very pleased with the quality when it arrived the fabric is heavy with a <unk> satiny finish , the padding is thick and the zippers and straps are sturdy
the description states that it is good for the kindle well , it certainly is not the case for the kindle dx it would be perfect if it were a half inch taller otherwise a nice well built small case for something i hate to mark down a product for the description but they should be accurate
i just got this yesterday from a different retailer i really like it it fits my # . # `` acer aspire one laptop it provides the right protection for my laptop i like that it has a pocket on the front that i can put a usb flashdrive , a memory card , or anything else that can fit in there to use with my laptop overall , i 'm satisfied with this product
this sleeve was made just for my netbook and it fits like a glove my only regret is that the power cords do not fit in the sleeve they are very bulky very well constructed and it does not take up any extra room
great sleeve to protect your # inch net book nice snug fit , good basic protection slip your net book into it and then put the net book into your backpack , keeps it from getting abused ! http / / <unk> # <unk> # <unk> #
i bought this sleeve for my acer netbook in october it 's so cute and handy makes my netbook look and feel like a novel i can put it in my bag conveniently it also protects my netbook as well
ordered on <unk> # netbook sleeves all from different vendors this was the only one that was correct and as advertised it also arrived promptly and in good condition
this backpack is noticeably lower quality than the earlier version of the same pack the zippers , material , less internal separate storage are all lower quality , thinner materials than the previous version i should have stayed with that model but had hopes that a new model would have improvements rather than primarily lower quality materials
the first time i had this pack loaded up , two laptops , mini projector and some various charging cables i had the pack on at the airport and one of the straps broke , did not fray or slowly come lose it snapped , it was a very poor sewing job i like the size of the bag but i am now going to have to take it to get repaired as i am traveling and do n't have access to a sewing machine targus needs to up their quality control big time
i got a replacement for this backpack after it started falling apart after # months the replacement lasted maybe # months i bought another brand i am tough on backpacks and they carry a full heavy load
this product looks good on paper lots of room , compartments , etc . to gain access to these compartments , just unzip or grab opposite sides and easily pull the zipper open sometimes the compartments seemed to unzip themselves this is a feature or bug depending on how you look at it never gave the issue much thought -lrb- since its never been an issue before with other bags -rrb- until my ipad fell out while walking to work in nyc when my wallet <unk> i replaced the bag this solved the problem
i bought this bag after having a previous targus bag for almost # years i was thoroughly disappointed by the quality of the bag not that the quality was terrible , but it just did n't live up to my expectations of a targus bag not for business , anyway this bag is a super bag if you 're going away for a long weekend and you want to bring your office and your full underwear and sock drawers i just do not see the purpose or <unk> of the <unk> thingy on the outside for ... what exactly just another way to be snagged on something , i think the bottle holder did n't seem serious enough to hold a bottle actually full of something , and the padding was & # # ; meh & # # ;
loved all the pockets and the amazing amount of room this backpack offered it sits well on the shoulders for comfort as well i was disappointed when the shoulder straps started to fray and split after less than # years of use
i bought this backpack to replace travel carry on it is pretty big so i can put my laptop , a couple changes of clothes , and misc items in it when traveling my one concern is that a zipper on the little part in the front broke off within # months other than that , the product works great as i use it a few times a week for going to the <unk> too did i mention i can put # full size heavy duty <unk> in it
so i needed a very large capacity backpack with a compartment to safely carry a # inch laptop , and i got it ample space , and its not <unk> up with file organizers , or zippered pouches , or any of that crap which you will almost never use which just ruins the space , so that was good it does n't seem cheap , just thin and almost weak i have it loaded down with # text books , all my school supplies , and a laptop , and it is holding up fine , i think it could have been made a little ` sturdier ' is all i 'm not disappointed at all though good bag if you need to carry a library on your back
i bought this for a member of my <unk> team to transport his macbook pro and he tells me it works just great on the bus and everywhere he goes
this my first back pack i 'm carrying two dell # `` laptops and a nikon # , flash and two lenses i still have room left over to bring my lunch not bulky at all and very sturdy construction
i have been hunting high and low for a laptop to fit my son 's monster laptop this bag not only fits the asus g # vx laptop but has so much room for college books , wireless mouse , etc . even the backpack found on the asus website doesnt fit their own # . # laptop glad the other reviewers on amazon confirmed that this laptop fit in this bag , i was at my <unk> end the bag is awesome my son loves it and is ready to go to college
though it 's intended as a backpack for a notebook due to the large capacity and being water resistant , it 's use as a school bag for <unk> books and keeping them dry is fantastic an excellent backpack .
i bought this backpack in august # as a birthday gift for my boyfriend he uses it heavily for his business school classes and rarely leaves the house without it this past october -lrb- # -rrb- we noticed that it began to rip on the inside and the cup holder began to come apart after contacting targus they immediately sent a label to return the bag and they sent a replacement the lifetime warranty alone on this bag is worth it
this is a great backpack very sturdy and spacious enough to even hold my asus g # laptop i had a hard time finding a good bag for my laptop and this fits the bill perfectly
just the right amount of pockets padding is plenty sufficient ample room for large laptop , ipad , accessories , documents , water bottle , sunglasses , etc . i have had it for three years , and take the train to work those who take public transit to work can attest ... many times running is required to not miss a & # # ; scheduled <unk> & # # ; through all of it , this backpack has held up extremely well i give this one my highest <unk>
this bag is a great bag it has plenty of pockets and space to fit not only by # inch laptop , but also all the cords and books i need to carry on a daily basis i 've flown with this bag a couple of times and it fits in the overhead bins very well it has pockets for the mp # player , and mouse pocket and water bottle holder a great bag at a great deal
bought this for my son for christmas he has a year and a half left in law school & is carry a ton of books and a laptop daily he was impressed on how much room there is in this bag and on how well made it is he was putting his books and materials in and kept finding more compartments no problem fitting all his stuff with room to <unk>
my asus g # sx fits great i was looking for a backpack that my new laptop would fit in i looked everywhere to find a review that said that one would fit and could not find one it would be nice if it had a little more padding , but then it would be even bigger if you are looking for a big backpack that can carry a bunch of stuff this is the one for you
this bag is just the right size for a day out in the city or a day hike in practice mine held a camera body + moderate zoom -lrb- e- # + # - # mm -rrb- in the quick access slot and two more lenses <unk> and a strobe above there is also a portion in the top of the bag for accessories my only complaint is that the bag is smaller than it looks , you will not be able to fit a # attached to a camera in this thing
perfect bag and just the right size im able to hold body with lens in the easy to get to compartment and also can hold two other small lenses with my big flash quality and durable bag , hope to use for years to come
padding and protection are first rate insides of # - # are highly configurable with nikon d # , no problem with # mm mounted on body stored horizontally , with some room to spare also stores my # mm , and could easily store another lens plus flash unit that 's without <unk> the storage capacity of the top compartment <unk> item is that the top compartment shelf has a zipper across # sides that when unzipped allows the padded shelf to flap down , giving one larger compartment if needed my preference is the backpack configuration , and as advertised , its no problem <unk> one strap , and swinging the pack to your front to get inside one of the quick access flaps if you had a much larger attached lens , its possible to configure the insides for a vertical storage instead of the pictured horizontal configuration this bag was a great find
find a perfect size camera bags is not that easy , the kata d- # - # is the one for small slr or m # system , couple lenses <unk> it 's easy access to your gears , i used for my olympus <unk> # . it 's small bag . good build and well protection for your equipments
well constructed with a quality feel to it feels like it is really protective for my gear - very strong , semi-rigid material compact size , but still fits in my d # , # mm , # mm , <unk> # g , sb # flash and spare batteries nice quick access panel on either side too lots of cool touches best of all for me ... no velcro fasteners , just zippers or clasps , perfect
love the bag its great for one good size camera with a couple of extra lens love the design and it holds up very well so far all the little compartments are nice , ex . chargers , batteries , memory cards and so on this bag is not for the super professional photographer since im sure they will have more than one camera and mostly lens a day trip on a shoot would be fine if knowing what to bring
works very well for my wife , she really enjoys the simplicity of using this bag , could of used one a little bigger since she now has a larger lens and one with the smaller range
i wanted a camera bag that is bigger than a lowepro slingbag # and smaller than the slingbag # and , i was looking for a slingbag that could convert to a backpack the kata d- # - # is just that this is a well made <unk> bag it can hold an olympus e- # , # mm and # mm lens the fit is a little tight , but i like it for travel
very well made <unk> backpack after testing several <unk> i decided to use the top compartment for the camera + medium zoom lens and the lower compartment for # lenses , flash , battery charger , a table top tripod and other stuff still need to figure out how to attach a tripod to the outside d-ring this bag is smaller than i expected because of the well padded walls all around , but camera and lenses will be safe the only thing that bothers me a little is the waist belt when not in use , it hangs without purpose other than that , this is a small bag with excellent build quality , in my opinion , better that my former lowepro products
this bag is about perfect for one who is starting out in photography it is handy , not too big and bulky , and has a lot of storage pockets if you do not need to carry a lot of equipment , this bag is perfect it is made well out of durable material
i purchased this bag for my # `` asus computer # `` for the computer seems to be the size of the sceen the computer is larger than # `` . so , if you buy a # `` asus , this bag wo n't work however , amazon is great about returns , i will be sending the bag back for a full refund ... have already contacted them one star because the bag did n't hold a `` # inch computer `` , company needs to work on the description a bit on the other hand , the product i purchased was a `` # inch computer `` maybe there is a communication gap between carrying case and computer manufacturers ?
eventhough it is notified that the item includes a compartment inside for accessories , that is not enough though when the computer is placed inside , the room does not fit for even the battery charger itself if you try to fit accessories inside , the bag began to be deformed i do n't reccommend this bag if you carry all accessories with the computer like me
i purchased this for my # ' # inch netbook with anything in the little pockets , it was an impossible fit so you would still need another bag or case to carry around your other netbook supplies like ac cord or travel mouse i would also be afraid to carry my netbook around like that although it would be perfect as a sleeve to protect your netbook inside of a bag or briefcase unfortunately , i had to send this product back
this is a well made case , but the one i received would not fit either my # inch netbook or even the # . # inch one i would have sent it back , but i found it fit my # inch dvd player perfectly
item was received in a timely manner it protects the asus netbook ok but the compartment is not suitable for anything except for maybe a few sheets of notes or papers
this product fits most # . # inch net books it is great the only bad thing is there is n't enough space to put the plug great to put in your purse though
i have the hp mini # . # `` and this case says that it fits up to # `` netbooks this is not the case i liked the case well enough to keep it if my computer would have fit
my wife found this to work via reviews on the kindle we bought it so that she had a case for her kindle too after receiving it she was delighted to use it cause it hold the kindle perfectly and protects it as well this item has been a nice find for ease of use and protection as well
much too small for hp # the netbook itself fits , but , as another reviewer noted , the powercord , and , most importantly , the battery unit -lrb- when attached to the netbook -rrb- wo n't fit -lrb- without leaving the zipper unzipped -rrb- item quality is excellent - just needs to be slightly bigger very poorly <unk> item
the hp mini fits tightly . if u want something to just carry your mini in it is nice . but no room for the power cord or any peripherals i used it to pack my mini in a suitcase and it worked well for that . also got a larger case that holds everything . will use that
case is well made and fits my mini laptop nicely only problem is that there is no pocket for my wireless mouse i must put it in my pocket when on the go
the case appears to be sturdy and well made , but it 's just a little too small to allow me to also carry the <unk> 's power supply without risking damage to the laptop with only two hours of battery life in my netbook , i often need that cord i also do n't know whether or not it would accommodate a <unk> with the extended battery -lrb- i have n't bought one just yet -rrb- with another half inch or so of interior space , this bag would be perfect
checked other reviews and agree this is a perfect fit for my wife 's notebook , very well made , used for a year and still looks and works great first time i 'd heard of kroo they do it right now i 'm looking at their case for a slightly larger device and have found a similar one for up to # . # inches called <unk> # . # case
this case works well , it 's sturdy , and fits my # `` macbook pro perfectly my only complaint is that the colors do not match the photo online i ordered the `` dark <unk> orange `` case expecting the orange to look like a dark , burnt orange , as it appears in the photo the orange is actually super bright <unk> a la late # s it 's not worth my while to return it since it works fine , but just a word of caution regarding colors : they might not be as they appear
case is a little darker than the image suggested , but other that that , everything came as described and for much less than you 'd find it at an apple or best store
best sleeve in the market . what i like most about this sleeve is the soft material on the inside . i feel like i wan na store myself inside it at times really nice soft material !
