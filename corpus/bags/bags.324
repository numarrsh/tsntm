i 've just returned mine this is a decent medium grade bag , but will clearly will not hold up if you are on the road weekly , like i am the handle loosened up quite a bit on my first trip and the wheels are not comparable to superior brands
this is the second kensington contour overnight roller suitcase and notebook carrying case i have owned -lrb- also owned one of the contour roller notebook carrying case . they are durable units however this time , the unit i ordered did not come with the zipper ends as in the picture on amazon dot <unk> the unit i received has some very cheap , <unk> zipper ends - not the nice , durable , <unk> ends as shown in the photo i can only assume the ends have been changed in an effort to save -lrb- the manufacturer -rrb- money take note of this when you order the product
i bought this bag in june # after owning the contour roller for several years i liked the design of this bag better than the contour roller , but the build quality of this new bag was worse especially the outside zippers , which were flimsy , easy to jam , zippers with inferior pulls -- nothing like was shown in the product photos i returned the bag to amazon for a refund i still love the bag and would buy another if i could be assured the build quality , including zippers , is up to the old standard does anybody know
the case is nice enough but maybe too compact ; it held less than my <unk> computer bag but because of its wheels was too big to fit under the airplane seat
the item works okay , but the handle makes it almost impossible to carry an additional item with it can not stack an additional bag on top of the roller bag the <unk> section opens from the top rather than the side , which makes it harder for packing and unpacking it gets the job done , but is not as convenient or as user friendly as my older model bag did
i was looking into buying a roller briefcase this one is more of suitcase for travel then for work i kept it since it has to be returned in a huge box i 've already spent $ $ on it * not a # roller * plastic by roller fell off after # month use
looking for one this size that fits in regional jet carry on space this one does if you turn it wheels up -- or upside down , in other words i can use the the garment space for large files , etc . two needs in my view -- heavier zippers -- these are fine , but seem light -- and , the strap on the back that fits over the handle of the bag below for secure rolling of two bags i thought the strap was there when i saw the picture , but it is sewn onto the back instead of being available like on other kensington bags well worth the money and because of design does not seem to be subject to as much abuse as other shorter kensington bags
i replaced the horizontal version of this product with this one this one lets you slide between airplane seats much easier all in all , a better designed back complete w / ability to just store a change of shirt and <unk> laptop fits snugly into compartment , but velcro closure really gets in the way i removed mine i also had the arm sling removed from my old and and attached to this one so i can effortlessly slip it over my large suitcase and form a `` train `` . i question its size at <unk> i had problems fitting it in their wire `` sizing `` <unk>
this little carry-on has an amazing amount of space in an amazing number of pockets my only criticism is that the front pocket , where one might keep smaller items , books , snacks , etc . , was open on the sides to the large clothing compartment nothing actually happened ; i just kept thinking i was losing stuff loved this suitcase i took it and one medium-sized suitcase for a month 's travel , and was just fine
the padded compartment for a laptop , plus <unk> laid out compartments for files , overnight of clothing , etc and quality construction make this the best <unk> i 've ever had stashing the laptop within allows you an additional carry-on on flights limiting you to two pieces , one of luggage , one of `` personal item `` and even fully stuffed it fits into the overhead compartment
i need to carry around # laptops with their respective accessories -lrb- cables , batteries , mice , etc . -rrb- and this is the only bag that can handle it the first one of these lasted # years of serious use
an outstanding bag at a great price fits in # % of aircraft overheads , will not fit in a crj # overhead , but i 'm not sure anything larger than a lunch box will if you find the bag will not fit in the overhead due to the width of the wheels , position the wheels so they 're up towards the top of the overhead the handle position and weight distribution is perfect for me -lrb- # ' # `` -rrb- i had no problem loading my lap top , toiletries and change of clothes in this bag -lrb- not shoes -rrb- i would for sure buy another one as some competitors are nearly twice the price , for a `` name `` and not an increase in quality -lrb- my opinion -rrb- the warranty sounds really nice as well , however i 've not had to use it -lrb- after # months -rrb-
i am very frequent flier -lrb- # flights a year -rrb- i have had this bag for more than a year and i am very impressed except for one small bad section of thread on an interior pocket and the fact that it does n't <unk> another bag while <unk> it is really great i could get the thread fixed under warranty but i ca n't stand to give up the bag for any amount of time it will not fit under any seat or in the overhead bin of a regional jet if you pack it the way i do the handle looks and feels cheap but it works very well no problems with zippers ever love it and will purchase another for sure
the kensington # has compartments for everything and is slim enough to be wheeled down the aisle in the airplane my last one was wide and a real hassle . this one is great
i ordered the smaller case in the same line , not realizing there was a larger model when the smaller one came , the literature that came with it showed the larger model i asked amazon if i could return this smaller one and buy the larger one in true , good service , <unk> , they said yes and expedited the whole <unk> since i was leaving on a trip for which i definitely needed the new case i can recommend either model , highly , but my preference is for the larger one one word of caution : because the handles `` <unk> `` into each other , they can badly pinch your skin until you get used to <unk> them before you pick up the case that 's a small thing , though it 's a great bag , either model
i recently purchased the kensington # i took it on a business trip to <unk> vegas and found it to fit my needs perfectly it has a padded pouch in the main section to protect my laptop and many zippered pouches and compartments it truly was perfect for business travel
got rid of the computer but liked this so much i kept it in case i needed it again in my next job
this is my # rd kensington case in # years i put over # million miles each on the # st two & they are still usable this case has many compartments to store cords , chargers , etc . you can organize & carry many things with you you can pack some clothes toiletries & more excellent laptop compartment a well made durable quality product & and a super value -lrb- $ -rrb- for what is out there super quiet rubber wheels telescopic handle that never jams for the pro traveler , this handles it all
made it through one trip on a plane with only the laptop and charger and the bag is going to sit in my house because it wo n't last spend your money on something that is durable , not based off of the looks - not worth it
even though i 'm a business professional -lrb- and have many & # # ; <unk> & # # ; black samsonite 's -rrb- , i like to have something a little more funky for everyday use i would n't recommend this to a teenager - the color was much brighter than the picture , and the color <unk> onto the white portion on both the handles and bottom the stitching was terrible and there were several loose strings on both sides , and i could n't seem to find a way for the shoulder strap to hang comfortably i returned it two days after i purchased it - the price was n't worth the poor quality i 've since found another & # # ; funky & # # ; laptop bag , which was only slightly more expensive but well worth it
i love the type of bag but it is the wrong size for my laptop and i was disappointed that it only come in one size i hope that there will be more of this type of bags for bigger
the bag itself is pretty good it 's cute and just what i was looking for however , the straps are n't so great i have n't used the & # # ; handles & # # ; much , but always use the shoulder strap and i just noticed a few days ago that it 's tearing away from the bag i only have my laptop , ipad , and laptop charger in the bag so it 's not heavy and i only carry it to and from work so it 's not bomb <unk> if it were n't for the strap tearing i would give this bag # stars , but if i ca n't carry it around it 's pretty useless
loved the bag , it was just what i was looking for had nice padding for laptop and extra pocket for files and extras case it seemed to be of good quality but then i saw that the handle stitching did n't get stitched together the red covering was tucked but not stitched i needed it to go and was n't able to return it -lrb- my time issues -rrb- have no idea about how the return would have gone i just cut the covering off the handle , it works , i have one red handle and one black
i got the bag and it looked great on the outside , very classic looking however the inside pockets were sewn upside down making then unusable everything else if fine i like the little pouch that comes with it , great for computer cords
material was torn a bit when removing packaging and can easily snag on anything rough however , the size of the bag and it 's internal compartments are great i like it a lot but just have to be very careful with it
the inside is great for my computer work , but only after i & # # ; fixed & # # ; this bag the handles were terrible i used a seam <unk> to cut them out then super glued the squares direct to the bag where the handles were now it 's a good bag a lot of work , but if you want to put in the effort , then you 'll like it
this bag does great just got what it 's design for . i am able to carry my computer , a notebook & calendar book in this bag and it 's not heavy at all
the bag was just as i expected the color is great and all of my wires and my laptop fit inside perfectly fashionable and i love carrying it everywhere i go
this product is great it looks as a purse and the fabric looks like leather the only thing i did n't like much is the fabric used inside it looks like it 's easy to break the seller should specify what 's made of
i got this bag in record time because of the amazon prime free trial i love everything about this bag , except for the giant pencil case the pencil case is twice the size as the one in the picture and i do n't even use it but everything else is great , good padding on the bag , sturdy strap , vibrant in
i just finished ordering and returning several laptop bags this is the keeper it 's not perfect i wish it had an outside pocket for my cellphone and <unk> ... but otherwise it 's good it 's very lightweight i use the crossbody strap and barely know i 'm carrying it there 's room for a power cord and some extras for the price , i have no complaints
the bag is cute , obviously my laptop fits in it well and it is light enough to carry around i wish the bag were a little bit more sturdy , and it is a little <unk> than i thought -lrb- but now can see it easily in the picture -rrb- also , the strap is a different color of blue than the bag ... which is a little strange still , i got compliments on the pop of color as soon as i started using it
the padding is thick , allowing protection to the items inside the material is n't bad , however it does n't look expensive either overall decent purchase it does what i needed for it to do
my # star rating is because i found for the price the material is n't that great i like the bag , love the color i just hope it lasts my ipad fits perfectly in there along with # small notebook i could n't imagine this holding up with a laptop much less anything else in it ... however its perfect for what i brought it for !
i got this bag as a birthday present and i am very happy with it it is a decent size , although i wish it was slightly larger i have only used it once and i have gotten compliments on it and the included pouch is perfect for charger chords , manuals , or a mouse the bag is cute and stylish and seems to be pretty well made i would give it # stars if it had a little more room or the <unk> was a little more <unk> out but its great , would definitely recommend
you can probably guess from the price that this is not the highest of quality ; that being said , for the price , i feel like this bag is a great deal it fits a laptop perfectly , it 's good quality , and attractive
good quality , fits my macbook pro retina # inch very well i can also fit a thin book in there along with the laptop but i ca n't fit the extra bag for the charger in there
i am glad i chose the pink because i can carry my # . # & # # ; laptop in feminine style the padding inside <unk> it as a <unk> <unk> computer bag so safety is assured for my computer i do wish there was a little more room -lrb- not too much because i would cram too much in -rrb- to include some peripherals for use with the computer the bag turned out to be a little narrower than i expected the little pouch is useful but can not hold everything and there is a real challenge for space
this is perfect to carry my surface pro along with a few accessories , a notebook and more my laptop was a bit too tight for it , but it does fit when needed the bag is very lightweight , which is great for daily use not nice enough for a board meeting , but daily office work is perfect
this bag is just ok the inside is nice and def serves its purpose the outside looks cheap and plastic like true the item does n't cost much but just know that it has high shine and def does n't look name brand
i absolutely love this bag my only problem is that the bag does n't seem to hang properly from my shoulder it 's very hard to me to have this bag flopping all over the place while i 'm trying to get the kids out of the house and such
i am using this bag for my # & # # ; macbook pro air it is light and the inside is cushioned well lots of pockets and a separate zipper pouch for power cords comes in great colors as well
i bought this for my # & # # ; laptop the computer is pink , and i wanted a pink case for it -lrb- i 'm a little obsessed -rrb- the case is actually a little bigger than i expected the padded inner compartment for the computer gives added protection and there is still room for cords , accessories , notebooks , etc . inside someone else mentioned that the handles were not sewn well mine seem to be secure the one thing i do n't like is that the shoulder strap is a little slippery i think i 'm going to put some rubber on it to help keep it on my shoulder
this bag feels great to the touch and it looks professional and expensive it was lightweight when empty - a plus when you know you know you 're going to have to carry it a lot my computer and accessories fit great communication and shipping were great i 'm really happy with my purchase
i needed something to carry my laptop around in and i was so sick of the <unk> looking ugly ones then i found this one and i love it i use it all the time
i received this laptop bag today and i absolutely love it . it 's big enough for my laptop , but i can actually use it as a handbag as well . the company that i work for gives the employees bags with their laptops , but the bags that they give are so big that 's why i decided to get a new bag on my own and this one was definitely a good choice
i give this product a five star it was as described , nice baby blue color as it 's pictured it was promptly delivered i have no problem with the case it holds my # & # # ; laptop with no problem and the extra pouch holds my power cord perfectly comes with a removable shoulder strap i would definitely recommend this case to my friends
i ordered two of these they hold an apple or a kindle safely along with other things it has a nice cushion inside to help protect the tablet it is a well made product worthy of being purchased
i was n't quite sure when i ordered this how the <unk> would look , but in real life it 's a nice looking bag and very functional as well the padding inside was the primary reason i decided to go for it , and i really like how well-protected my laptop is inside
i do n't write reviews for amazon , but this bag was everything i hoped for does n't hurt my shoulder , feels lighter than my previous computer bag , and it 's so cute ! pink lovers , this is for you i am so pleased with this item only downside is i wish it came with front pockets , but there 's pockets inside and a little bag , too you can fit more in it than meets the eye
i bought this bag because i thought it was so cute and fashionable i was afraid of it looking cheap but i was surprised how awesome it looked i loved the little pouch that came with it also a pleasant surprise - the insulated area for my computer additionally it holds my ipad and my dell xp # it is also small enough to take from meeting to meeting i am definitely getting the blue one as well
i have an acer aspire # . # inch and it fits in this bag perfectly and room to spare also the pencil bag is bigger than what i thought , so i use it as my charger and mouse case the bag is good quality strong and sturdy handles and a good adjustable cross body strap i use it for my college laptop case and it 's just what i was looking for and more the pictures do n't do this bag justice
i was looking for something that i could carry my macbook air easily and would also fit maybe a couple notebooks and cords of sort this bag has plenty of space and even has a separate little pocket with & # # ; air bubbles & # # ; to protect my laptop it was definitely a great choice for a laptop case !
this came just as expected everyone who is saying it is cheap just wants to not pay for much and get a lot i use this everyday walking around campus and it holds up great . the pouch it perfect size for your power cord
i love this bag it is fashionable and fits both my macbook air # & # # ; and my ipad air perfectly the neoprene cushion within provides ultimate protections and the inside pockets give me space for my cell phone , business cards , pens , etc . i also love that it comes with a small carrying case to help tote all <unk> and extras you may need while out and about with your tech
the product is exactly the same inside out as shown in the picture . the color is perfect , and inside is very spacious with a lot of pockets ; also , the small pouch is in a good quality love this case and would recommend to whoever is considering laptop case
this is the perfect fit for my sony vaio # in the color is beautiful and the extra pouch is a plus i do not like the long strap because it 's a different color than the bag
this was a great gift it was true to size made from quality material , and was constructed very well it was as much fun to give it as it was to see the face of the person receiving it great product would recommend it # %
i wanted a case for my ipad that i could take when i travel this is perfect very roomy for all the extra cords , charger , wifi , and ect very well made and seems very protective , and very pretty i highly recommend this travel case
i have to give this computer case # stars because it 's cute , spacious , and it can carry all my class work it also protects my computer really good because in the inside of the cases it has sponge
stylish , well made and very much me i wish i had it in other colors as well protects my macair , perfect fit has shoulder straps or short handles really like it
i love this bag i do n't really use the smaller bag to be honest all i use is the big bag i get a lot of compliments on it people keep asking me where i got it i can fit my laptop in the bag , my charger and about two notebooks in there just fine you could probably fit one big textbook in there if you wanted to it has three little pockets for pens and pencils and has to bigger pockets i just love it it was worth the money for me
this bag is very cute , a perfect size for a laptop and a few other items , easy to keep clean , and durable i work in a job where i carry a laptop with me into homes i bought the pink bag because i love pink but it is so easy to see , i do n't every just leave my computer i can definitely see it great price too i 'm thinking about buying another one as a backup when this one wears out
my new computer , also pink , needed a bag , since i 'm still using the old one for the computer i 'm replacing i wanted good protection and room enough for the cords and accessories , this has room for all my stuff , and it 's pink too
alright now this is my jam love my laptop carry case please please can you guys make then in two colors to gather oh yes pink and lime green i so want a pink and lime green one
i love my bag and i got it actually ahead of my expected shipping date and it is exactly what i expected it to be it came with everything it said it would and it was packaged properly so nothing would happen to it in the shipping process
i let my daughter place this order and we ended up with three of these cases i started to return two of them , however , i changed my mind the cases are excellent & # # ; maybe i can give them away as a gift
it 's very chic and in my favorite color of purple i actually purchased to use for a digital photo frame and the case was one of the few that would take the extra width of the frame as opposed to just a laptop it 's a cute way to transport my digital pictures to friend 's and family
going on having this for a year now it has traveled with me a few times and has held up nicely computer , charger and mouse fit perfectly in here i 'd recommend this
the beautiful bag arrived quickly and is just as nice as pictured it is used to hold my wife 's # . # `` tablet with its matching pink cover and does so nicely very well padded and keeps the tablet very safe and looks stylish while doing so also , has plenty of room for all the accessories that go along with the tablet very well made and very reasonably priced based on similar items at retail stores
i carry this case around everywhere with me and i have never received more compliments on something this much before aside from the fact that it has the perfect amount of room to also carry my binder it is great for every day usage and protects my laptop from water and anything i may bump into
i ordered this bag because i got a new laptop and wanted to make sure that it was protected i was very pleased when i received this new bag because not only does my laptop seem very safe inside , it is absolutely adorable it came with a long strap so you can carry it over your shoulder and a cute little bag to put your charger in so it does n't scratch anything else you might have in the bag i highly recommend this case to anyone wanting to protect their laptop
nice and padded it also has room for my cell phone and other items can be used as a purse as long as you do n't carry the kitchen sink
i love this little bag i bought it to use with my # . # macbook air it fits my power cord and accessories perfectly it can also fit my # sheet notebook , pencil case , wallet and keys quite comfortably considering purchasing it in the other colors i got this in black for my mom and she loves it as well
this is so cute i 've gotten so many complements on it it protects my macbook air and my ipad wonderfully , and looks great and the price point is great too well worth it odd enough , it has stayed pretty clean too
wonderful , wonderful bag . roomy and all in one bag i use it to everywhere i absolutely love it the strap is handy over my head so i can use my two hands to do what i need
i have a # `` macbook pro and it fits in perfectly i have room for my day planner and a notebook , pens , pencils , calculator - all of the pockets are great i 'm so happy that i went with this adorable bag ! !
i have n't technically used it yet because i bought it for certain meetings that i do n't have often but i liked what i saw when it arrived i already put my clipboard and pad folio inside and there 's enough room left for my laptop although there is n't room for the little pencil bag or whatever it is now i just need to use it so i can find out the quality of it
i love , love this bag it is so convenient for everyday use the best thing about this bag is the inside cushion and the the room the color is adorable
this bag is just as they show it light but good padding and # he size of my old bag very handy to take with you and even use as your bag and throw your wallet in with the computer i would buy it again
great bag & fits a large laptop somehow & all it 's accessories ! ! color is very purple & my daughter wants a <unk> color already so will prob keep this one for myself & get her a neutral color but it 'll be same bag bc it 's such high quality
spacious makes an excellent notebook case / purse was trying to limit my carry on with travel between the iphone wallet and this made life so much easier and better organized will be used again for travel and day to day
i 'm in love with this bag everybody asks where i got it from and think it 's designer or something the compartment is very protective and i feel confident carrying my macpro in it
i will admit that i was a bit frugal when it came to purchasing this bag for my new macbook pro this bag provides as much protection as my $ # <unk> <unk> computer bag not as stylish but for the cost and its roominess i 'm there are no complaints delivery time was faster than i expected overall ... winner
it looks really chic , i ordered the blue and the <unk> one and they look amazing ! has divisions in the interior and it has a really good finish recomend it #
i was a little skeptical in ordering this case , but thank god i did i have been getting compliments from my friends about it and i also love it fits my mac perfectly and i think its very chic , not bulgy i love it and would definitely recommend it
i did n't get this for a lap top i use it for my cross stitch there is a divider in the bag so you could probably keep # lap tops in the bag i have # cross stitch projects <unk> up with fabric , thread , pattern in my bag the handy little bag that comes with it i keep my extra <unk> , extra scissors , tape measures , thread <unk> , etc . . bag is light weight , good stitching , love the clip on strap so i can sling it on my shoulder , or leave it off and just carry it by the handles it is small enough to stowed in an over head bin if you were to fly with it i have seen some ladies purses bigger than this bag
i ordered the bag because of it 's unique style , i did n't want the same style laptop bag that everyone typically has it was a great price and when i received it i was very happy with the quality , style , and ability to safely hold and provide protection for my laptop
please buy this . & # # ; # i use this five days a week - hauling my work laptop to and from work , and it 's amazing shove a laptop in there and there 's plenty of room to spare super sturdy and puts up with me <unk> and abusing it like there 's no tomorrow oh , and it 's super cute get the lavender one
this works well , and i can switch from shoulder to my hand to carry my laptop when i want the outside is pretty and the inside is soft on your laptop and is nicely padded for protection , even on the bottom of the bag i can fit my fan in if i want , but i do n't want it <unk> up against my laptop so i usually do n't even bring it -lrb- fan is about # . # inches tall
this sleeve case is falsely advertised as being compatible with all # . # `` ultrabooks , including the dell xps # , which i own but my # . # `` ultrabook was basically swimming inside this sleeve case , which was about # `` too large , so i had to return this item also note that this sleeve case has a # : # aspect ratio , while the dell xps # and many other ultrabooks are # : # -lrb- widescreen -rrb- nope , it wo n't work if you also have a dell xps # , i suggest getting the official neoprene sleeve made by dell , specifically designed for this ultrabook , which looks great and fits very snugly
this one is too big for a # -inch laptop and the it is really smelly ! i put it outside my room for more than one week , but it is still
besides being overall poorly manufactured , as some others have complained , this unit had carry handles on the inside of the case , with metal snaps to connect them first of all , why would you put the handles on the inside to use them , you would need to keep the case open , defeating its purpose of protecting your computer secondly , those metal snaps will rub against your computer if you close the case all the way since the photos of the case do n't show these handles , i can only assume that ipearl is trying to unload their factory <unk>
i received this order about three weeks ago , and up until now , this product has been great it provides decent padding and enough protection for me to feel safe carrying my macbook pro around however , i noticed yesterday that a black smudge had appeared on the top of my laptop , near the apple logo i thought it was nothing important but noticed i could n't get it off completely today i noticed that there was a hole in my case , and the black on the case had <unk> onto my laptop , and now it wo n't come off there 's a stain on my macbook pro , and i 'm so angry that this happened honestly , this product was good until yesterday now i 'm very angry and annoyed
it is not right fit for the lenovo yoga # & # # ; <unk> , even it 's mentioned in description that it will fit to number of others laptops <unk> sleeve overall , in the corners it 's tight and <unk> in the <unk> of every side
this case is for a regular sized # inch computer , not a mac air or an ultrabook i use it for my dell xps # and it is simply way too big for thin laptops
the product description billed this thing as a case for an hp spectre xt it 's a little too large for it quality is ok i might use it more if i did n't think my computer was swimming around in its case every time i moved
i bought this thing thinking that i could easily slide the laptop portion of my ideapad yoga into the outside pocket i thought that it had no zipper but was more of just an open pocket no , the outside pocket is zippered the zippers catch and are not the best quality the case is a tight fit for my ideapad yoga i kind of like a slightly looser fit other than that , it is your pretty standard laptop case i guess you get what you pay for i would spend a few more bucks and get a case logic or something else
i purchased this case for a family member because i recently purchased a similar case at target i felt this case was a bit thin , which is why i gave it # stars however , the pocket on the front is very helpful because it will fit the computer charger -lrb- though a bit snug -rrb- if the material felt more sturdy , i would recommend it
i ordered this item for my lenovo yoga # `` it will fit you may have to stretch the zipper around the edges of the laptop to get it to closed the bottom of the case is <unk> than the top of the case the item arrived new there is a strong chemical smell this is worth the # . #
