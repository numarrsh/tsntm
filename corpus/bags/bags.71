very nice case for my laptop it keeps it nice and <unk> -lrb- if you keep the i side with your laptop -rrb- my laptop a light hp envy # inch screen . so this was a great case for the price
sure , it provides protection but i find that it 's not a nice fit for my macbook air # there 's just too much room for it , i expected a snug fit it 's probably good to fit a macbook air with a plastic case on it or a just a regular macbook <unk> but not the macbook air
i got this for my new computer and it does the job perfectly its snug and does n't wiggle around at all my only complaint is that it needs a small pocket on the outside of the case to put cables and such cause i hate putting them in with my computer and potentially scratching it or stretching out the case itself
i own a # . # hp pavilion dm # and this case is a smidge too big i would have preferred a case that fits more snuggly nevertheless is does the job & i used it on a recent trip to europe with no worries
it 's a little to big for my mac book pro retina , which is a little sad since it <unk> for that particular one i will have to deal with my lap top sliding back and forth inside of the case
it is a great case , but it does n't quite fit as nicely as i expected i think the size below might have been too small though so unless there is a size in between , it 's the best i could
this is a <unk> case it feels a bit cheap , but it does the trick if you 're not worried about having the nicest looking -lrb- or feeling -rrb- case , this one is n't bad
the case itself is super cute - i bought the # in thinking it will fit my # in laptop but it did n't . maybe i just read the measurements incorrectly either way i returned it amazon is amazing at returns no hassle at all i recommend going a size bigger if you buy
i ordered the tannin color which turns out to be more of a dark purple i do n't like that the case is n't fitted for my macbook , like it swims a little too much in the sleeve theres more than enough additional space to have some light interior packing to protect it some more also , the outside material is annoying and attracts a lot of hair and dust
the color was not as bold as they make it seem on the website got <unk> emails from the company saying it was shipped , then <unk> email saying o it was not , this went on for several weeks or even longer finally it arrived i <unk> recommend the sleeve , just beware of
im happy with this case , it really prevents my computer from scratches but its bigger than expected , my laptop is # . # inches . . and the case is taller for # inches at least but besides that everything works just fine
the title of this product includes & # # ; macbook air & # # ; sure , a macbook air will * fit * in this case - in fact , it could probably hold three of them this is not a good case for a macbook air you really want something to hold the computer a good bit more securely however , it does appear to be a good case in general , well-built , quality , etc . just no way the right size for a macbook air seller should either remove macbook air from the description or explain how it will fit -lrb- very loosely -rrb- wasted my time ordering and returning
i bought this sleeve in black for # `` - # . # `` laptops , thinking my # . # `` retina macbook pro would fit perfectly unfortunately , the sleeve was just too big when i put the laptop in the sleeve and held it vertically , there was an inch and a half of extra space above my computer the laptop slips and slides around inside the case , which feel very insecure i will be returning this case and seeking one with a snugger fit otherwise , the construction was very nice and it felt like a quality case ... just for a bigger laptop
i like the product its a standard cover for a macbook but anyone can get this type of cover from multiple sources only issue , i ordered the case and it two weeks to arrive it took five days from my order placement just to ship i am not sure if that is an amazon issue or case logic
it holds my # . # & # # ; asus laptop and that is about it i doubt it would ever fit any # . # & # # ; laptop i am happy with it as basic protective cover only i did purchase another brand case that had a carrying handle and a pocket on the outside so i could carry the power cord and a few slim items besides just the laptop i use both products depending on my needs at the time
loose fit but serves its purpose . nothing to rave about but nice for the price i use it more as a liner for a computer bag , as well as a generic cover
says it fits up to # . # & # # ; but does not fit our hp pavilion # . # & # # ; laptop needs to be about # - # & # # ; larger to fit well nice looking case and not as bulky as the brief case type
the material of this case is a little stiff and scratchy i wish it were soft other than that it 's a fine case i 'll probably replace it with a canvas case
despite some of the negative reviews i took a risk and indeed this case is much , much too big for macbook pro retina # & # # ; otherwise seems like a solid good quality case
i bought this for a dell # . # & # # ; laptop my hope was i could use this instead of hauling around a heavy laptop briefcase the case does feel well-made and would likely protect the laptop somewhat from minor bumps however , it 's a bit too large , meaning the laptop slides around inside a couple times i 've almost dropped it because the laptop slid to one end , shifting the weight , and i had to grab it to keep it from slipping out of my hand it would really help if it had some kind of carrying handle as well i probably would n't pick this one if i were doing it over
i got this case because i wanted some extra protection for my laptop when i had it on hard surfaces or carrying it around in my backpack the color is fine -lrb- black -rrb- , but the case is a little large i have a # -inch macbook pro with no cover and there is about an inch of wiggle room on both sides of the case this is fine , just makes my laptop so huge that it can barely fit in my backpack i also saw that the # -inch case has a convenient zipper pocket on the outside , this has no pockets or anything overall , this is a good product i guess i thought it would be designed for apple but i was mistaken
this is a nice color and would be a nice case for most # . # inch screen laptops , except for the lenovo yoga # i think it is too snug and was annoying to try and squeeze the laptop into the case i returned it only because it does n't fit nicely
this is not what i expected , this is a pretty large case for my laptop i expected it to be tight on my laptop , instead , it shifted around top to bottom which i did not like at all i wanted to fit it in my school bag , but it did not fit because it was oversized i was dissapointed with the size , but the quality is good
this is a good case , but i only wish it had a pocket to put my charger in instead , i have to put my charger in another bag and stuff this into the bag as well
this case is well made and great looking , but does not fit my macbook pro retina it does , however , fit perfectly the older macbook pro -lrb- with a snap on case -rrb- , or an older macbook
the case does the job the fabric is a little bit cheap and makes a scratchy sound , but for the price it is fine it fits my macbook pro snugly which is all i need i wish there were more sleeves with pockets for chargers
it 's a loose fit over my # . # laptop there is easily another inch of space which is nice , but might be a bit excessive and does n't feel like it is a tight fit . the laptop slides around inside the sleeve a lot
the # . # is much too big for the macbook # retina i have the # . # my # `` mac air which is great and perfect fit i do n't recommend buying for the macbook # ``
i have several case logic sleeves , and i like them a lot -lrb- i liked the <unk> series better , but , oh , well . and , yes , the product description says this is for up to # . # -inch notebooks but based on the product dimensions , i hoped this sleeve would work with my kirabook # , which is smaller than most # -inch ultrabooks in every dimension it does n't the sleeve 's dimensions are bigger than the kirabook # , but the sleeve is about <unk> inch too <unk> to fit it i hope another kirabook # owner will benefit from my experience and keep up the good work , case logic
it 's a little bit large for the macbook pro retina # & # # ; so there 's some room for the notebook to slide around a bit i was also hoping for some more cushioning however it has quality construction
not much can go wrong with buying a laptop case it serves its purpose ok i think the only thing i would change is ; it should be sold with a shoulder strap , because i have to put this in a brief case to care it from building to building
nice padding , will definitely protect the computer one drawback , is that it does not it the mac # & # # ; others with smaller macs also say that it does not fit theirs has an extra inch or so in the & # # ; front & # # ; of the computer mac users beware
i recently got a chromebook and it recommended me to also get this case with it so , i did get it it fits perfectly and that 's good but the material feels cheap and the cushioning of the case is just not enough if you say you dropped it , feels a bit too thing but better than nothing if you 're looking for a good protective case than maybe you can look for another i have an & # # ; incase & # # ; case for my macbook and that is much better if your looking for protection but this is a solid case
the case logic laps- # - # -inch laptop sleeve i purchased from amazon will not cover and zip close on my asus g # v # . # `` computer this is a great case i have bought three other case logic laptop sleeves in other sizes i have an asus g # . # `` computer that the # `` case logic laptop sleeve fits perfectly a reasonable person would expect that a sleeve advertised and specified to fit # - # inch laptop computers would fit a # . # `` laptop great case worthy of # stars , but <unk> - # stars i made a gift of the sleeve , rather than return it to
the black case logic carry case is exactly as advertised , no more and no less i think i thought there would be someway to pop the charging components into the case yes , it fits but just is sort of & # # ; there & # # ; with no pocket to prevent it from sliding around and scratching my new macbook air it is an inexpensive carrier and fulfills the need for me to have a cover on my computer when popping it into a larger back i choose not to store the <unk> in the carrier good value for a basic case that provides padding and protection
if you want a cover for your # `` macbook pro , keep looking this cover is way too big otherwise , there 's nothing wrong with it other than that the reason it 's so cheap is because it 's really pretty cheap do n't expect a really nice sleeve you 're getting what you paid for
i have a macbook pro retina # -lrb- late # -rrb- and i will confirm that this does not fit when i put it in it was still very loose -lrb- <unk> -rrb- thankfully it came with a padding -lrb- for packaging purposes -rrb- and i keep it in with my mbp -lrb- and its still a bit loose ! -rrb- it 's bulkier with the padding , but i use it for the added protection , otherwise my laptop would be moving around inside the case whenever i have it in my bag
the color shown on the website is drastically different from what i received the description lists the product color as `` tannin `` . what a terrible description who has heard of tannin or even knows what it looks like that , along with the poor representation of the product color in the picture led to me being quite disappointed when a bright purple laptop case showed up at my apartment i would suggest amazon change the description of the color if this product i must say though that i have since exchanged it for a black case of the same type and it is fabulous protect my lenovo laptop well and it looks great
this case is similar to some other incase sleeves , but build quality is n't on the same level not that it 's poor quality , just not the best i forget what i paid for it , but i felt like i got a fair deal it 's a great case for what you pay for , but does n't have the extra bells and whistles as some other brands if that does n't matter to you , then this is the case for you
it 's very nice and protect my laptop <unk> good but it is just a little big for my samsung ultrabook # . # we have so many information here to describe that i expected it to be the exact size is just a little so i 'll keep it , benefits are more than that i like it
i have a lenovo yoga # and i struggle over the edges to close the zipper , not what i was hoping for , but it will have to do for now
the length of this case is perfect for a macbook pro w / retina however , it is maybe an inch wider than necessary , allowing the computer to rattle around a bit inside not a serious problem , but it could be a better fit
my wife has a case like this for her # & # # ; macbook and it fits like a glove but , this one , my # . # & # # ; macbook pro has plenty of room to slide around i was hoping for a tight fit i guess from the description , fits # . # & # # ; laptops i should have known that it would be loose if you are looking for a snug fit , you wo n't find it here
the case felt like it was made well , the zipper and everything worked good the size however was a little off , there was about an inch + on the top and side when the laptop was in it that 's too much room for it to be sliding around , for me i like my electronics to fit snug in cases and sleeves so that i can just toss it in my bag and feel that it is a single solid item
i should have realized earlier that it should not fit the latest # `` retina macbook pro since apple actually made the new rmbp smaller and thinner i assumed it is designed for previous version of # `` macbook , which means if it perfectly fit the earlier version it definitely will be too big for the smaller and thinner rmbp so basically this case leaves a lot of space when you put your rmbp in the quality of the product is okay but do not believe that it fit # `` macbook pro retina
fits the # . # inch macbook air very well i even have a plastic case on the air , which adds just a slight increase in the original dimension i use the case inside a soft-sided brief-case and it fits well , does n't take up space , but i can take the case out , zipper it and use alone no handle , plus no pouch for the charger cord , but that 's fine
i ordered this case for an older # . # & # # ; toshiba portege and it fits perfectly the quality and construction are very good and the padding is a better than in cheaper cases , although it adds slightly more bulk a worthwhile tradeoff for me the corner protection is better as well there was no offensive odor other than a mild rubbery smell that quickly dissipated i mention this only because i 've seen complaints about strong <unk> from various neoprene cases the only shortcoming for my purposes is the lack of any kind of handle an unobtrusive strap would make carrying the case more secure and would help when taking the case in and out of a backpack
nothing really wrong with it , mine was # `` as advertised knocked off a star as the interior could be a little softer material or offer more padding side note : have a macbook retina # `` with a shell case on it , it 's in there pretty loose , so if you have one and are looking for a tight fit look elsewhere still it does the trick well enough i 've got the case on the notebook , this thing , and it goes in the center pocket of my travel bag which is padded not caselogic 's fault here , i figured with a shell on my notebook it would eat some space
bought this case for an asus vivobook s # ca-dh # t # & # # ; touchscreen ultrabook gray the case is very slightly too large , which results in a small amount of movement when the computer is in the case , however the movement is not enough for me to be bothered i would buy it again
super cheap case that fit my laptop perfectly it fits easily in my backpack and is perfect for carrying to and from class for the price i would say this was a great
did n't expect `` tannin `` to be a <unk> color a pleasant surprise upon arrival snug fit for a # . # `` labtop , my mouse usb connector gets snagged a lot when i try to take it out of the case , but it the case works nicely i was going to set my labtop down and i accidentally dropped it , very thankful for the case
nice sturdy sleeve but it 's just way too big for the new macbook pro # inch it can prevent my macbook from bumping into other stuff in my tote but i doubt it can prevent damage from dropping i kinda knew this ahead but seems so far there 's no sleeve having a tight fit for the new macbook pro yet so i will keep it
this is a nice neoprene cover that does n't add a lot of bulk or weight which is exactly what i was looking for i have a new macbook pro with retina display without the cd drive i was hoping for a bit more snug fit there is a little room left for it to slide around slightly -- probably because of the thinner machine however , it is not overly big and serves my purpose and is in my favorite color also , the price was good the product arrived in a timely manner and was well packaged this is just to protect my computer when i carry it in a larger bag with other materials this sleeve is not terribly cushioned but does offer some protection and certainly will keep it from getting scratched overall , it does what it was purchased for
its a very nice case i just wish it had a handle for transporting from place to place i cant let my grandkids take it to the car because w/out handles there little hands cant grab it
this works fairly well with my macbook pro # inch my only complaint about this would be it is not as snug of a fit as i would like it it moves around in the case a bit but it 'll do
great product as i have bought these for several laptops sadly the # . # will not fit the asus gaming laptops - they will fit it , but they stick out about an inch update - cut a piece of <unk> slightly larger than my new laptop -lrb- # `` -rrb- and using that , a heat gun and a little <unk> force - you can make it fit an asus laptop . :
got the sleeve today and <unk> as soon as i got it from the pack i was impressed with the softness of the fabric ... nice protective foamy cushions and beautiful color i ca n't wait to show this off to my friends :
the case is very loose , relatively poorly padded on the other hand , it does seem as though the stiffer case would provide better protection in the case of a hard fall vs a softer neoprene case i assume a macbook air case should have more padding material on at least the thinner edge , as you wo n't be distributing shock across as much area looks like it 'll do a fine job protecting the top and bottom of the computer anyways
very easy to put my acer laptop in and out - zips smoothly - seems well made i am totally satisfied that this rather inexpensive case is giving good protection to my new travel computer
this is a good case for travel and does what it 's supposed to it fits a # inch macbook pro very easily with enough space around this in my opinion is also why it should lose a star - it has to much fluff i thought it was only for the new macbooks but even my wife 's older macbook pro , there 's still room around the edges where there should n't be not that it <unk> the laptop but it almost seems like i 've put my laptop into a hard case but with soft sides not sure how else to put it
this case holds my # & # # ; macbook pro -lrb- # -rrb- and the styrofoam filler piece used for packaging is retained as an advantage to keep the very slim laptop in place within the case without the styrofoam , the laptop would be actively moving around withing the case , thought still protected fairly well
although this case says it fits up to # . # laptops , it is important to read the specify <unk> measurements to ensure it fits your laptop i was very disappointed that it did n't fit my husband 's asus <unk> # . # laptop nice product anyways
i have a lenovo x # carbon # inch thinkpad which i bought this case for it was slightly big so i just cut a piece of foam from the packaging and laid it on the bottom of the sleeve so now it fits perfectly otherwise i am very happy with the case
nice case which i 'm sure will do as it was intended seems to be well made could use maybe a little more padding but since i wo n't be travelling with my laptop much it will serve the purpose i have intended for it
i got this for my macbook pro # . # with retina display though the item is good , it wo n't fit the mb perfectly i mean there is some loose space left so that mb will move around
i bought one of these along with a # . # `` lenovo ideapad it 's lightweight and durable , and it does a good job protecting the laptop while it 's lugging around in a backpack a while back i had a laptop in a bag that i 'd forgotten to zip closed , my laptop fell out when i was getting out of a car and it cost a lot of money to fix after that i made sure to buy a sleeve every time i lug a laptop case logic bags are solidly built and do a good job protecting without making the bag any noticeably heavier
a case of high quality both of tissue and zip and gives good protection to the laptop the color is beautiful however , it 's not as tight as expected on a macbook air -lrb- there is room on the sides that you <unk> so if you look for a sleeve fit do n't pick this product , if you look for a better protection go for it overall a really good product
it protects a chromebook perfectly it feels a little sturdy , if you use to neoprene you know it can be really flexible . this case makes you feel like it will protect your device from a lot of bangs and bumps
this case logic # . # inch black netbook sleeve does what the description says it will do : it covers my netbook fits fine , is n't bulky or heavy i am not sure it would hold up under lots of travel and other active use it seems a little flimsy for that i put my netbook in the sleeve whenever i 'm not using the netbook to protect it from dust , and it works fine for that
while the netbook sleeve is fine , it needs to be a little wider to accomodate any type of card you have in the computer it will still fit , it just takes some work to fit it in
it 's a good case for the money and fits the macbook air pretty well it 's a bit looser than i would like you can even fit a small folder in there with the computer its a good sleeve for the computer in a bag or backpack , but do n't count on it taking much of an impact but then again , no macbook air is going to survive much impact
i have a # & # # ; hp laptop that fits very snug into this case i actually have to take out a usb plug -lrb- . # cm -rrb- for my wireless mouse if i want to slip the laptop in nicely it works great , i like it
this does the job it fits and measures as described the zipper is well built it was a little large from my dell ultrabook # z , but i added a iron on patch to it and i do n't mind it as much the only thing that would have made it better would have been a small pocket , but these are made to fit inside a larger case . protects well
it will keep your chromebook or netbook fairly safe from bumps and such i do n't like it because it is a sleeve and does not unzip all the way round
i bought this for an # & # # ; macbook air it 's not made specifically for that computer , it 's generic , and does n't fit exactly ; length is good , but it 's about # & # # ; too wide it 's a little bulky and stiff , but offers good protection
i like this laptop case because it 's very lightweight and also because of its simple design i might have liked it even better if it had some sort of side pocket where you could put a few pens and stationery , or a notebook or something otherwise , thought it was very reasonably priced and a good , basic laptop protector case
it was twice as expensive as a cheap case but it was not twice as good the only bad thing is that it s not as cushiony , zipper is nice and protects your pc from scratching it with the zipper
this case provides the extra protection i needed for the new lap top i carry mine to school every day and wanted some type of protection this purchase fit the bill at a cost i could live
laptop case makers would do so well to offer products specifically for the ultrabook class of machines now taking the marketplace by storm this case , while well made , is still too roomy for an ultrabook i 'm sure it would fit a regular sized # & # # ; machine very well -- and that is what it is designed to do a slimmer laptop will not be lost in the case , but it will <unk> around a bit less securely than i prefer pink color is lovely though , and zippers are easy and sturdy this is not a case to protect from drops or falls so much as a cover to protect from scratches and make the laptop easy to carry
fits my # in mac book pro even with the hard shell cover i have on my laptop opens and closes easily its great for the extra protection in my backpack while traveling i recommend this for anyone looking for a little more cushion for their # in laptops
exactly what you would expect my laptop is rather large and it fits well so slightly less bulky laptops might swim in it , but well worth the money
came one day before the expected delivery , so that was nice otherwise , it 's a nice case , bit big width-wise for my # . # inch laptop but otherwise seems quite sturdy and durable giving it # stars because it came out of packaging with lots of dust and string attached onto the case , had to <unk> it off
it provides some protection in case of dropping the chromebook or other sorts of accidents but it is a little small and is an awfully tight fit there should be some way to carry the <unk> too , especially when traveling
it fits my sony vaio s # just fine the padding is thick and somewhat stiff -lrb- good or bad depending on what you 're looking for -rrb- kinda plain looking but functional for the price
it fits my laptop well i realize now i should have gotten one with a pocket to hold the charger , but , oh well what was surprising was how quickly the padding got permanent creases in it
i like this case a lot , but there is no place to put the power chord you could stuff it in with the computer , but i do n't want to harm it it would be better if it had a pouch
good price and quality i have a # . # toshiba and i wish it was a <unk> more snug i purchased this because sometimes i like to toss my laptop into my backpack and wanted something to protect the edges and the laptop at least somewhat this does the job but the laptop is a little loose in there so when i have to put it in my backpack i find myself having to squish the corners a bit but love it
bought this sleave for my acer ao # it is a great fit and the padding is good no pockets but it does protect the netbook for travel would recommend this for a # . # netbook
for my asus u # <unk> this case is a bit snug , but it fits and the construction seems good i 've been using the case regularly for about a month now without any trouble the padding feels thick and <unk> resistent to <unk>
the quality of this case is absolutely fantastic although my laptop when placed in the case had at least an extra inch of space on either side , causing it to move around significantly while in the case an easy solution that i found to this problem was to simply keep the spongy material that came with the sleeve -lrb- as part of the packaging -rrb- inside when placing my macbook in it however odd it may seem ; it managed to keep my laptop from sliding around while still making it easy to zip the sleeve closed , all while adding a little extra protection
this case fits my macbook pro like a glove and has a non slip feel to it when i carry it i looks like it will provide adequate protection as well great price point too
this sleeve is exactly what i was looking for at less than # the price it keeps my macbook safe in my backpack during my day to day travels i would recommend this to anyone who needs a sleeve
i bought this sleeve for my chromebook and am pleased with it it fills a <unk> for computers that are n't tiny or & # # ; normal & # # ; sized my chromebook fits well in it , with a little bit of wiggle room the sleeve is very light , but the padding is definitely sufficient the exterior is easy to hold i have not worried about dropping it with my laptop in it
this is a good case if you have a standard # . # in laptop , but if you have a samsung series # <unk> do n't get this , it is much to big my laptop slides around ; i am looking for a new case that fits my laptop properly
i have a # . # laptop and wanted a case for it this case does the job , it is a little bigger then the laptop but it works out to not be much of a problem this case is very basic and really only good for preventing scratches on the outside casing of your laptop in saying that however , it is thick enough to prevent any scratching that may occur from having your computer in a backpack which is what i wanted it for
works well enough it has decent amount of padding i am unsure about the durability because i only have had it for about a week but i do n't see any big problems currently
it 's a pretty simple laptop case , but it works well it is n't bulky or heavy , when placed under the laptop , it keeps your lap from getting warm while i appreciate the minimalist design , i almost wish the rubber case-logic logo was bigger , so that it would prevent the laptop from slipping a friend has a similar case with a pocket , however she never seems to use the pocket for anything , and most laptop chargers are far to large to fit in it -lrb- and make it bulky -rrb- i say save the money and space and go for this one without a pocket
i like it in general although comparing to my old case for macbook pro , this case is not perfect fit for the # . # inch you can still find a significant space between laptop and zip line after you put your laptop in as a perfectionist , i admire this product <unk> but i ca n't recommend to my friends
i bought this for my # inch mac model a # the bag is thick and the material is soft which seems to protect it well i would say it 's a little big for my mac i would have liked a more snug fit i wound up switching bags , i had an incase # inch laptop bag which i use for my # & # # ; laptop i found that i liked the more snug fit and better grip i feel this that bag is soft and it looks nice , and zips nice but it would slip from my fingers when i carried it just like that
i like the product the laptop fits in perfectly it protects the edges and from shock as well the only thing i think there should be is an extra zipper for charger or a few small things
