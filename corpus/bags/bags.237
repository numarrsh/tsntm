very strong and reliable i used the older model during a combat deployment to iraq my wife mailed me my computer in this case , it made it to iraq with no damage i used the case to carry my computer back from iraq , and it protected my computer
the case is quite heavy and bigger than i expected , but it is super sturdy and has got some nice features most probably the best protection for a laptop computer on the market
i love the construction of this laptop case very durable and waterproof , i am not afraid to get caught in a rain storm when i have my laptop secure inside a little on the heavy side but if it were any lighter i do n't think it would be as durable i love the generous shoulder strap the part that holds your storage -lrb- papers , pens etc -rrb- could have been designed a little better so my papers did n't almost fall out if i was n't careful when i opened it i wish it also came with more pockets but i am sure i can find something to remedy that
i bought this case with the primary purpose of transporting valuables via airlines and <unk> to transport my notebook computer in the field it made a great airline carry-on case that i could put overhead or under the seat in front of me with my feet up on top of it as for protection of my notebook computer , this case gives me a very secure feeling when taking my computer out on a boat or to a <unk>
this product is very well made and would be perfect ... but the smell is awful it gives off a strong smell like cleaning fluid or some <unk> product hung it outside for two weeks and it still stinks
amazon says # . # inch but the packaging says both # . # inch and # . # inch way too big for my # inch macbook , this would probably hold a # inch laptop nicely
this sleeve is nothing special at all i really do n't have much experience in the field of computer bags and sleeves , but what i do know is this : i purchased a sleeve made by be.ez for my macbook that sleeve is so awesome excellent quality , offers good protection , and well made this one from case logic i purchased for my wife 's laptop and it is very thin and offers no protection what-so-ever you might as well wrap a brown bag around your computer all it will do is protect it from dust also it says it fits a # . # `` laptop , well i do n't know how big a # . # `` can get , but this sleeve could probably fit a # <unk> for $ # , you could probably find something better i think it 's worth about $ # - $ #
i like the quality of the sleeve , but for my dell inspiron # it was way too big i wanted a sleeve that would fit tightly and this had about # inches of extra space on each side i returned the # . # inch sleeve and bought the same one for a # . # laptop it fits great . :
i purchased this laptop sleeve for a toshiba # . # inch t # laptop but ended up returning it because of the fit the sleeve is <unk> designed so fit does not exactly follow dimensions of the toshiba the depth dimension was about an inch larger i eventually purchased an exact fitting sleeve from the toshiba website for a few dollars more material and construction were same except for the dimensions
this sleeve was to large for my # inch dell inspiron laptop it has a very bad chemical smell that did not go away after a week i sent it back the quality was good but it did not fit my needs
i ordered this case for my # . # inch laptop it is a pretty well-made case i would have preferred leather edging , but it is n't a big deal my problem with this case is that it was n't true to size i has about an extra # / # inches on the side and an extra inch on the top a little large , but an acceptable case
this product is a less expensive option than found in the apple store ; however , it does not perfectly fit the new apple macbooks the sleeve is approximately # inch longer than the new aluminum macbook , which causes it to slide around within the sleeve the incase product sold at the apple store and online fits the new macbooks
this sleeve is a good product , but the description is not so good the padding is alright , but it could use more it 's perfect for a backpack with padding that built for holding you computer however is you buy this sleeve for a # `` macbook pro you will find that it does n't fit this is because the description says it 's for a # `` computer , but fails to say that it means a # `` pc that is thick this is false advertisement i think
i <unk> this for my xps # inch tablet it does work ok , but the power button on the xps is always hit when putting it away this is more of a design issue with the dell xps # but if you get this case you might open it up and try to turn it on only to find out the battery is dead
the package states # inch laptops , this is definitely for one that is # inches i have a # inch dv # and it seems like it is swimming in this thing overall i like the case just a little big for a # in laptop it 's well made and love that the zipper , it opens the case half way so there is no problem putting your laptop in it nice look and well made , would work better with # inch laptop
i have a normal size # `` laptop and it has about # inches -lrb- literally -rrb- of loose room to slide back and forth in the case the case is simply too big for normal size # `` laptops to further <unk> my point , i direct you to one of the top rated reviews on the first page the buyer is very happy that it fits her # . # `` laptop i rest my `` case . this sleeve should be sold as an # `` sleeve other than that it seems well made as expected
this laptop sleeve is listed as a good match for the asus ul # a series computers it is not it is too deep for this laptop series it is a good height and width for the computer but is too deep therefore , i do not recommend a purchaser or owner of this computer series to purchase this neoprene sleeve
bought this recently to keep laptop in another container in my carry all type bag there is very distinct chemical type smell present even after sitting in the closet for about a month now it 's not as strong now and i 'm sure it will dissipate with time i have # inch hp pavilion dv # , fits nice with enough room to put <unk> usb hub and few other items inside these other devices have their own containers so to speak logitech nano with cute little zip-up sleeve or whatever you want to call it i basically wanted a sleeve type of bag for use in a heavier type carryall , so am happy with the functionality of it
not a bad product to protect my mbp fits into my laptop bag also would you believe some check points at some airports still asked me to remove the laptop from the sleeve , guess they 're not quite up to date , otherwise no problems really the sleeve seems likely to expand though , i hope not good value for the convenience i think i travel a lot so this prevents scratches on my laptop from having to get it out of the laptop bag and into the luggage scanners at the airport
i own a incase neoprene laptop sleeve and you can notice the quality with the case logic the price of this one is half of the other one so if you are looking for a cheap sleeve , this is just for you you wo n't get any better for this price , if you are a picky one stay with a # bucks sleeve and i guess you wo n't be disappointed
<unk> few cases are available for # in . laptops this may be the least expensive one the neoprene is about half the thickness of the <unk> case that i used for my smaller computer the case has no handles i was expecting a bit more for the roughly $ # that i paid , but i suppose it 's adequate for my infrequent travels
it 's too big for my # . # asus that i ordered it for , so i gave it to someone with a # . # `` hp , which fit like a glove <unk> on size , if your laptop is small for the size class it will probably be too
my son 's laptop is # `` and i could n't find a # `` sleeve that would fit this one is at least an inch too big but it will work if you happen to have an # `` laptop this would be perfect for it
it is hard to find a sleeve case that fits perfectly with my vaio <unk> # x # . # `` widescreen there is a # `` gap from the zipper i am happy with it though
it 's often difficult to guess if a particular sleeve will fit a particular notebook , so i 'll report on my experience in the matter after purchasing a belkin # `` sleeve that reviews led me to believe should fit my laptop , an asus a # <unk> # model , and finding that it was too small , i ordered this one it 's a tight fit but it fits the material seems a bit thin and the zipper does n't inspire expectations of longevity , so i only gave it # stars -lrb- with fingers crossed -rrb- i ca n't see myself <unk> this beast around much ; so given expected light usage it may serve its purpose
i got this item for when i fly home and my laptop stays in my backpack to avoid getting dust and <unk> in it it fits with sliding room -lrb- i presume for cords and such -rrb- and is a lot less ugly than the picture i have an hp g # compaq so i got the # . # in grey now we just have to see how it fairs the flight
i have a # inch laptop that is about # . # inches thick this sleeve has a lot of extra room in it , probably enough to accommodate a # inch laptop easily one nice thing about having extra material is that i can grab it by the extra and pull it out of my backpack the inside is also the <unk> material as well , not lined like some others my room mate bought an incase # inch sleeve for his # inch macbook pro and comparing the two , they are almost the same size and thickness overall though it is a nice sleeve for the price considering his cost him almost double what i paid for this
i have n't been able to find a case for my # `` hp laptop until now , and i find that this one suits my needs perfectly does have a strong chemical odor for a while -- made in china -- but i turned it inside out for a few days and it 's now much better as long as you are n't interested in having it next to your skin or storing food in it , it should be safe to carry and the odor should eventually go away i 'd recommend buying it if you need a case this size
it 's a really good case , as in it 's durable i like it the only problem i have with it is it 's runs a little big for my taste it says that it 's for a # . # `` laptop which is what i have and it 's slightly too big i would advise people buying this to get one slightly smaller than their laptop if they want a snug fit
overall i 'm happy with the laptop sleeve there are only # negatives that i 've found first , there are no pockets at all if you wanted to store something other than the laptop in the sleeve that 's not really a problem for me because i 'm usually carrying the laptop in a bag anyway secondly , the sleeve smelled absolutely horrible when it first arrived the neoprene smell was so strong i ended up letting it sit out in my office for about # weeks before the scent had died down it 's fine now
this case is almost perfect it fits really well , looks sleek , and is not too bulky my only complaint is the smell it is very strong , and does not seem to be <unk> does anyone know if the smell will go away after time
i bought this item for a fairly robust computer just to keep the shock from setting it down and such from scratching or jarring things loose the bag is fine protection from scratches and small shocks , but like any other sleeve is n't a cushion to drop your computer on the bag fit well and even had room to stuff a battery charger and some other stuff inside
i have the # . # inch version , which would really properly fit a # inch laptop looks fairly nice and simple -lrb- with the exception of a bit too much case logic branding -rrb- , and so far is doing its job , protecting my laptop provides a nice amount of protection without being bulky like other cases security friendly so the laptop does n't need to be removed when being x-rayed by tsa , which is a nice bonus
i bought this case a couple years ago -lrb- # -rrb- , and it 's still holding up i travel a lot for work as airline cabin crew , and this is what i use to protect my laptop the squishy material helps as a shock absorber in my suitcase it 's a good product
it serves its purpose - it protects my laptop from scratches however , it is a little big and does not hug my laptop like i wish it would , but for $ # plus free shipping , it 's not a bad deal
i have a hp pavilion dm # which is a # `` screen i looked at target and best buy to try and find a laptop sleeve but the one 's sold there were either only for # `` or over priced so shortly thereafter i ordered the case logic <unk> # `` laptop sleeve from amazon the sleeve is well made : sturdy seams and zipper and a fair amount of <unk> -lrb- i put it in my backpack with my text books and it always seems well protected -rrb- the only minor issue is that it is about an inch to large for my laptop , but then again if i wanted a custom fit sleeve i could 've paid a lot more to get one from hp all in all this is a great deal
for a simple soft cover for a laptop used at home only , this was a great value easy fit for my dell studio with # `` screen and keeps dust and pet hair off computer
this laptop sleeve was nice but i wish it was a little bit thicker to provide a bit more cushion , just feels sorta flimsy this might be a good thing for those who wish to stuff the whole thing in tight places
i bought two of these , one for my # `` on the go laptop and one for my # . # `` stay at home laptop it fits my thin # `` asus well , but it is n't snug i was surprised to find it is significantly too big for my not so thin # . # `` sony my laptop just swims in it saying it 's a # . # `` size is a bit misleading
i looked for a sleeve to fit my # . # `` dell inspiron for months it 's a perfect fit for my laptop inside my bag i wish case logic had a selection of colors for the sleeve and the trim i dropped a star because of the grey trim i saved money though and i did get a nice sleeve
we had to find a pink laptop sleeve and this one is just right for what we need we thought it would be a little more padded but it works
the case is really nice and exactly what i was looking for material wise , it is just a little too big for my computer nonetheless , it works fine and i decided to keep it great deal for the price
i 've had this case for over a year now for my dell inspiron and i 'm really happy with it it 's perfect for protecting my laptop in a backpack or shoulder bag while i 'm at school or traveling
after researching a number of options to protect my new xps -lrb- m # -rrb- , i decided on a neoprene sleeve the case logic proved to be a great fit it allows me to carry my laptop via a number of ways -lrb- backpack , briefcase , or just the sleeve -rrb- i provides protection for everyday bumps and scrapes only -lrb- do n't think it will survive a drop -rrb- but , for the price , it 's a nice product
i purchased the case and used it for over an year last week i dropped a whole <unk> on it and nothing got inside the case my laptop was safe
the quality of the cover is really good , and it was fitting my macbook pro # `` perfectly -lrb- although it has little space like one inch of empty space but that 's ok with me -rrb- i would recommend it to anybody
this is a great neoprene sleeve it has a good zipper and fits a # . # laptop with room to spare it has good laptop padding that will work for small drops i highly recommend this for large laptops
i purchased this to protect my # `` laptop i have no complaints about this slipcover at all , it is sized perfectly and the material it is made out of is really nice it stretches out and i am even able to fit the laptops charging cable inside when i need to i travel with my laptop in my car while it is in this case , usually on the floor so it does n't slide off of the seat during a quick stop and possibly get damaged from a fall my laptop has no scratches or damage at all after a few months of sitting on my car floor while traveling
the case works perfectly it fits pretty snugly , without being too tight just the right size the only thing that could make it better is a pocket on the front , but still a great case even without that
vary good product - fits my laptop easily easy to put the laptop in , and has a handy zipper i am glad i purchased it after much research to find the right size case purchasing from amazon is a pleasure
great case , maybe a little bland in terms of design , but very functional it protects the laptop great and works with the newest sony vaio s series with a little bit of extra room which is just fine ca n't really go wrong with case logic and the price was excellent would definitely recommend this to others
i bought the # . # sleeve for my dell studio laptop it 's a little bit big , but obviously , that is n't the fault of the product and actually works out quite nicely when i want to shove folders in with the computer has my thumbs up have owned this product for one year
i bought a envy # from hp and this bag worked great to hold my laptop in i have used it every day for a year and it 's still just like new
it looked like new , works like new no damages at all . # bucks cheaper too <unk> only con is ... the inside is not covered with cotton -lrb- <unk>
great product at a very good price , considering the fact that i have seen these for $ # in retail stores i used this to protect my # in macbook pro and it provides adequate protection with a thin <unk> cover and is a good fit it was the best value for money laptop cover i could find
i 'm a frequent traveler with this neoprene sleeve , i no longer have to put my naked laptop into the <unk> plastic bin while going through airport security a little extra protection while in my briefcase does n't hurt either
this one is really great covers my # `` hp laptop with ease it is made from very nice material , though wish that a strap was added as , usually # inch laptops are very bulky so a strap should be so handy
a great product that is easy to use laptop slips in and comes out with ease the zipper holds laptop in place with very little movement the neoprene material is soft and yet protects very well if you need a cover this type is excellent even the price is right
not a bad bag . sturdy material , cool design but it looks like your carrying a rectangular box around because the whole bag is pretty stiff . . however , the design is great the material is super durable only <unk> is that water seems to `` stain `` the bag . what ? ? ? ? no instructions how to clean it
i got the bag in time overall it looks good but it is a little bit larger than i thought nevertheless , i think the price is very good and it seems to be very secure for my laptop
this laptop did a great job for me , housing both my # . # inch laptop and my <unk> for nursing school the bag has plenty of pockets and compartments for your different baggage , and does a great job of staying shut to protect your laptop , because the velcro is super-sticky i would recommend this to a friend
got this bag to carry things to work as opposed to a purse i park and then take a shuttle to work on rainy days this bag is perfect i love the color and the velcro really does grips tight another plus arrived sooner than expected i was a bit disappointed though that the shipping was not free considering the bag arrived in an amazon.com box
this one is a new model , so could n't get any reviews before i bought it i found some design issues with this my # `` laptop ca n't be strapped in tightly as the strap for the laptop compartment is not adjustable and is designed for # . # or more the material between the main two compartments is kinda flimsy and does not go all the way down if you keep something at the bottom of one compartment , it can be taken out from the other compartment the height vs <unk> vs depth ratio is not very good for my purposes i 'm also <unk> about its lifetime , as the label says `` made in china ``
i bought this backpack on sale and it has been great it has enough space and for my everyday <unk> -lrb- including ipod and water bottle pockets -rrb- the notebook compartment is one of the best i 've seen it is completely padded and if you drop the bag , the laptop will not likely hit the floor it is not as confortable as i thought , specially the straps that can have a little more padding great material and excellent zippers
i would have given it a # if it were not for the fact that there is not enough space for stuff yes , it is a backpack and not a suitcase , but if you stuff a # `` laptop in there , you have no more room for anything else other than that , the zippers look very sturdy the material is thick and will probably hold well over time it fits very nicely around your shoulders and has enough pockets to hold <unk> like pens , usb thumb drives , mp # players , a small camera , oh and a detachable <unk> too
i have had this backpack for a few months now and love it . plenty of room to carry my laptop and all i need to get thru the day meanwhile , plenty of little places to sort storage sturdy material , definitely not the cheap stuff quality zippers and stitching a few things though : the hole for the mp # headphones are on the opposite side of where the mp # player rests if there were on the same side , the wires would not cross the storage area there is a nylon separator between the # large storage compartments , it is not secured on the bottom allowing things from each compartment to <unk> to the other the laptop compartment is raised and <unk> from the bottom , <unk> my # inch laptop to go to the bottom of the backpack therefore , the zipper does not close when the laptop is inserted in the protective area so i carry my # ; # lappy in this one
i bought this backpack for # <unk> and i think it 's a great price for a <unk> made backpack that has good padding for my laptop and my shoulders with that said , i was hoping to get more room for my textbooks and it certainly does n't provide much room it also does n't have as many pockets as some of the more expensive swiss gear 's offerings however , it 's a great value and i would buy it again if i need a new backpack
i am overall satisfied , it holds my notebook well and has a lot of padding to protect it , but i could wish it was smaller -lrb- for my notebook is # ' -rrb- looks great , has a lot of neat little pockets and is really durable
this item does n't fit the size of my computer , i didn ; t notice because my wife was using it and by the time i <unk> this it was to late to send it back
the top cover fits perfectly and works great , but the bottom is <unk> a bit the bottom has openings for the heating i guess but they look odd it has about # open squares randomly i returned this item its plastic , but the pink color is great , and the top looks great , the apple lights up under the cover and looks good if you want a affordable cover that gets the job done i would buy this , but i wanted something a little better so i bought a more expensive case hope this was helpful :
the cover is really nice even with the mcover case on it still fits in my incase padded carrying case , so it is well protected while in motion -lrb- i bike -rrb- it fits well and the feet on the bottom cover are awesome , since i have the first generation macbook air and it has had some overheating problems i wonder if the top cover will stay attached over time because it does not seem to be as attach as well on one corner , it is slightly small also , as a note , i do n't know about the other colors , but the purple cover has <unk> in the cover i 'm still deciding whether i like it or not , it 's not bad
i 've been using this pink ipearl mcover for my macbook air for almost # / # yrs i bought this as protection from scratches and to give it some ` style and color ' , and this little plastic cover has done that the top does ` pop ' off occasionally but it snaps right back on i love the bottom cover with the legs that fold out so that i can type in comfort when my laptop is sitting on the desk or table i would buy this again if needed
fits perfect - just like seller describes adds a fashion touch to the computer without spending a fortune especially liked the fact that the `` apple `` on the computer is able to be seen thru the case -lrb- others do not offer this feature -rrb- love the variety of colors to pick from seller ships immediately !
i bought this cover to protect my new macbook air and it does just that it fits perfectly over the entire computer and is very easy to install it just snaps in place , it took me seconds to put it on the legs on the back are a nicely added feature especially sitting at a table or desk it tilts it up and to me , the angle is perfect it 's very durable and i love that you can see the `` glowing `` apple right through it and of course i love the pink color i would recommend this to all new or old computer owners
i just got this delivered today & i 'm in love with it i saw the recent comments saying this case is bad but when i actually got it , it snapped on perfectly since my laptop is the a # model the color is a good shade of pink the bottom looks weird but nobody really cares about the bottom part this case is really good & maybe in the future i 'll purchase different colors
the rubber feet are adhered to the case by simple adhesive they came off within two months the clips that attach the case to the mba are lined up so they touch each other leaving a gap although i ca n't prove it , i suspect this was one of the reasons my mba hinge broke the legs on this case are extremely difficult to open and close , making a loud crack sound it only took five months for one of the legs to break avoid this case at all costs the tabs that hold the case to the air body finally broke today it is a shame i ca n't rate it zero stars
this cover is a good fit for my macair only one thing -lrb- small thing -rrb- , there 's a small space in between the top cover and the lid this does n't cause any problems i just think it would of been better pressed up against the lid
i bought the bundle for the cover , sleeve , and keyboard cover a few months ago and i 'm very pleased with it product shipped fast and the customer service was fair and reliable looking forward to shopping with them again
i bought this backpack when i wanted to have a new bag for my laptop i got a good jansport backpack for my niece a few month ago and she liked that one , so i chose jansport again it 's out of question that jansport is generally a good brand but this particular backpack is really poorly made the texture is made by some cheap materials , and definitely looks not as good as the picture shown on the website there are not many compartments in the bag with poor paddings , and the space is not as big as that was described at all nevertheless , the laptop sleeve is too wide for my # ' widescreen notebook so i bought another backpack of swissgear this weekend when i saw it on sale with only one third price of this jansport and the quality of my new bag is much much much better than this one do n't buy this backpack
i 've owned jansport backpacks in the past , and while this is a decent enough bag , it 's definitely not up to past quality the material is thinner , the zippers are not as heavy-duty and what 's the deal , jansport did you run out of zipper pulls half the zippers are missing them -lrb- despite what the picture shows -rrb- on the plus side , there are plenty of internal and external pockets , my large laptop fits without a fight , and it 's well-padded
i found this case , while created with great attention to detail , too small to hold all things i want to take with my dell xps # by the time i got the external drive , cds and power equipment in there was little room for a pda and ipod but it was built well and had lots of nice features it might work well for a netbook
ths is a terrific bag for an # `` to # `` notebook it 's well-built , it has a number of storage areas , and it can clip to the handle of a rolling bag <unk> the photos make it appear that the bag is made of vinyl or some other form of faux leather , it is not -- this is a woven fabric bag the photographs also make it appear the the inner pockets of the front compartment can easily hold such things as external hard drives or external dvd drives -- but they can not i have the smallest external dvd drive on the market and it will not fit into the internal pocket -- but it will fit easily into the compartment the bag is light-weight and <unk> , but do n't expect it to hold more than the computer , its accessories -lrb- power brick , etc . -rrb- , and a couple of file folders , documents , or magazines this is a computer bag , not a briefcase
i 've had a multiple targus cases and this fits my macbook air perfectly wish they had little better -lrb- more -rrb- storage for peripheral items such as pens , phones , etc . but good case and good value
bought this to fit my dell latitude # laptop i did have to take out the protective inserts to get it in it is fairly light but yet still feels solid
bought this for an asus # a fits it perfectly it is handy to fold down the flap to charge the computer i feel that it protects the computer some , but the padding is not very thick so the protection is limited for the record , not all asus computers come with a sleeve for their computers my # a did not include a sleeve
like this product a lot , i bougth it for my wife , and she love it but you have to know asus includes a sleeve with its notebooks so , if you want to save $ # uses the one included
i got this for a dell mini # and it fits perfect as i think someone else mentioned , the material is similar to what you find on a wetsuit a kind of rubber within fabric it 's not memory foam like other similar sleeves , but works great if you want something small to keep the scratches off your netbook when it 's tossing around in a bag
this is a great sleeve protector for a mini laptop it fits beautifully it takes a bit of work to turn inside out if you want to use the other color but it is well made and worth the money
i wanted an inexpensive sleeve for my new laptop and although this did n't specify fitting my dell , the dimensions seemed right so i took a chance after receiving it and not being a big fan of red , i reversed it to the black side and it is exactly what i wanted i can pack it into my purse or into a overnight bag and know that it is protected from damage also next month i will be heading through airport security , so i am happy to read the other reviews of not having any problems with this sleeve
i use this case with a dell mini- # and it fits perfectly it provides the additional protection needed when transporting it in my tank bag or backpack protection from scratches that is since it is n't a hard case , it probably would provide little if any protection from impact
good looking , trendy and sturdy bag , but too small to store a laptop has just enough room to store a hard cover book and few notepads at most weak magnets do n't hold outer cover together , so chances of losing things not recommended for school or office use
i got this bag to lug my # `` mac book pro back and forth to work unfortunately , the mbp is a little longer than the bag is tall so it extends above the bag a little regardless , the `` lid `` of the bag has no problems covering <unk> up and the strap is long enough to keep everything in place there is lots of extra room for your cables and a notepad or what ever everything feels solid and well made i especially like the use of magnets to keep the cover in place , rather than some buckle this bag feels like it will last a long time
this is a very well made product i had read many reviews before deciding on this bag i agree with others that this messenger bag is a very well made quality construction , compact , and clever design at a reasonable price my only complaint , like so many others is that the magnets are not strong enough to keep the main flap closed
i like this bag for its convenience and ease to carry i really like the vertical orientation of this bag in comparison to traditional bags this bag <unk> tons of pockets , a compartment that allows for it to stack on rolling luggage and more i also like the magnets that hold the <unk> down they are sufficiently strong and allow for quick access i would improve two things : make it a little more rigid and set it up so it falls more vertical when picked up by the handle
i got this bag for my husband he travels for work and has long ways to go in the plane i got him the swiss gear messanger bag <unk> it is not wide it is <unk> so it fits under the seat in the plane it is light <unk> and has this nice feature with the water bottle holder in the side it holds all his papers plus his headphones the only thing he is not so happy about is that it does not stand up itself but this is probably only because his laptop is # inch and the recomended size is # inch great bag and price worthy
i got this bag for my dell studio # it just fits though the lid does close with the help of the magnetic closure it is a well made bag with plenty of room for folders , accessories , and other items i 'm very happy with my purchase i do n't know if a # `` laptop will fit so you might try and look at others
this is quite likely the best laptop bag i have ever owned i have an oversized laptop that fits beautifully in the padded back section - i suspect that the bag would take a variety of sizes the securing strap is long enough for a large laptop like mine , but would likely secure any size laptop this bag withstood # airplane flights , banging around , stuffed under airline seats , was used a <unk> on all # flights it still looks as good as new and the shape was n't diminished a bit the front part of the inside of the bag is big enough for the power cord and <unk> programs to be stuffed in the magnetic closure snaps shut securely every time without having to hunt for a snap anywhere i have had several laptop bags over the years this is the best laptop bag for the money and took a beating and still looks new , so i suspect it will last a very long time i highly recommend this bag
this bag is wonderful for those who need to carry a lot of things with their laptop you can tell this has swiss army <unk> a security strap holds the computer securely inside and a large pocket holds power cords or accessories an outside pocket has spots for drives , disks or other needs good to carry things , but not so bulky that you ca n't carry it
the base of the back pack which looks like leather in the picture is not actually leather when you <unk> the bag in real it is made of perforated cloth . making the balance of bag somewhat awkward
it 's a nice bag and i got it on a pretty fair deal the only problem is that it seems to be too small to serve as a school bag
