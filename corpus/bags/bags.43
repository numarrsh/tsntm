unless you are buying this for your kid 's chromebook , just get a <unk> neoprene sleeve to protect your electronic device i will say that the product was well made and fit the chromebook fine there was a huge bulge when i tried to put in the power cord -lrb- brick -rrb- too
i bought the case for a # -inch lenovo thinkpad , and it is a little too tight , even though it was for a # -inch device i ca n't use the zipper compartment - too tight , and it 's hard to slide the computer in and out of the sleeve
this case is way to small for a # inch computer really had to stretch it to get the computer to fit and concerned that the zipper will scratch the computer shell
i love my chromebook , and i wanted a nice simple case for protection and ease of carrying i was using this case for a few weeks when i went to unzip it to take out my chromebook and the zipper came off legit straight off i was in class , so i had to use scissors and cut the thing open -lrb- like a <unk> birth for my chromebook -rrb- to get my chromebook out i do n't use a case now and my chromebook has been fine worse case scenario is it breaks and all of my data is backed up on google
the material the case is made of is a magnet for lint and hair within minutes of opening the package the black case was covered really what was case logic thinking did n't anyone there bother to test their products it also has a strong chemical smell what has happened to quality control
the case fits like a glove , but was n't meant to carry the ac charger and cord not sure how protective neoprene is i 'll probably end up replacing it later if you do n't plan on carrying the ac adapter , external hard drive , or a mouse - then it 's a fine case
i have had it for a month & a half and does n't seem to be holding up to well with minimal use , starting to fray a bit after owning this case i realize i should have took the advice of some other owner 's reviews & bought a better case
it 's very soft , offering very little protection from anything but scratches it is lightly padded and holds the little laptop pretty well , but the front pocket is pretty much worthless get a better one for just a little more money
this case is just a soft neoprene sleeve with handles and a front pocket it is soft and flimsy , just as any other neoprene sleeve would be do n't expect a rigid or durable case this case is not enough to protect your netbook or chromebook during travel to leave home , i always place this case inside of another case not sure why there are so many glowing reviews , as there is nothing <unk> about this case other than the price i feel you are better off putting that money toward a more substantial case for your netbook
we had bought this to keep my husbands netbook safe in transit it is very flimsy and its soft , so it wont protect the netbook from much there are no pockets to hold anything else if you are looking for something to protect and use on a daily basis i wouldnt recomment this
this case with handle holds my netbook well , but the fit is tight i have a wireless mouse adapter that barely sticks out from the netbook , and when putting <unk> out the netbook , i have to be careful to slide around the adapter there unfortunately is n't room to store either a wireless mouse or a wall adapter in the case , although there is a pocket where flat items -lrb- paper , stylus , etc . -rrb- could kept
this was quite a bit thinner and <unk> than i expected i got it for an asus # b it can hold the charger and the computer but not much else it 'd be good for putting inside a real computer bag with another computer or maybe a suitcase , to keep it from getting scratched up this sleeve also has two `` dents `` in the neoprene that wo n't come out even after trying to stretch it it looks like a defect in the material it 's overpriced by about # % of what it should really be priced amazon was slow to deliver this item it shipped out a few days after the rest of my order not that big a deal
i bought this sleeve for my recently purchased chromebook and it fits perfectly the downside to it is that it only has one zipper pocket which barely holds a power cord ill most likely purchase another sleeve w / add ' l
its almost too small for our # . # inch asus laptop but it works fine and there 's a pocket to tote the charger and a few other items good for the price
this case was just what i was looking for it fits my acer aspire one perfectly , with plenty of room for all the accessories & my nook , too , if i wanted to carry it there it 's light weight & has handles if i want to carry it separately it is a carrier & not a protector , which is fine for me i intend to put this inside my carry-on bag , & the stuff around it will do that ca n't be beat for the price the only reason i did not give it # stars is because there is no protection & i would n't want to mislead anyone , but as i said that is not an issue for me
very handy pouch for my little laptop ... gives it the protection it needs and also room to carry its charger as well the handle makes it easy to carry it along without fear of dropping
i needed a netbook case that would protect my netbook and fit in my bag comfortably with my textbooks and notebooks . this case did it perfectly . the case fits my # . # `` asus # n perfectly it has an inner lining so it does n't scratch my netbook . the handle is a nice touch too , that makes it easy to carry around and the case feels durable to me
i got this for an # . # `` acer laptop i use this bag constantly it is sturdy and made with body suit material the sleeve is a little big for my computer it 's loose , but this allows me to put the power cord , and a wireless mouse in the smaller pouch the pouch bulges out when full , but it works
it fits the chromebook perfectly , but if the pocket extended over the entire top of the sleeve , i could put the extension cord in there easily the sleeve also holds the wireless mouse , which i use nice quality and if the pocket covered the entire top , i 'd have given it # stars
good little case keeps my asus # . # nice & snug pocket size nice carries charger , mouse , and some more things easily <unk> what i was looking for i would n't dare drop my comp in it nor bump it hard does n't offer much protection in those extreme situations , but does nicely against scratches & every day usage i 'd recommend it
everything about this bag is excellent only complaint is the handles , and wished there was a way i can sling it on my shoulders to free up my hand i 'm probably going to end up getting another bag that has a sling option but this one is great for small trips and protecting your laptop inside another bag
i did n't regret buying this case for my # `` laptop fits great and the handle makes it easy to carry without me killing my shoulders my only complaint is the foam like material which is easily <unk> when folded slightly or when objects are placed on top of the case but other than that , its a sleek case that catches many peoples eyes
this is a perfect sleeve for the asus # . # `` eeepc it fits perfectly although the additional compartment with a zipper is not of much use i bought the product without actually seeing it anywhere and i do not have any
this case works well for me and my ipad it 's roomy and the front zippered compartment holds my notepad , pen and charger very well also , i ordered to because it has handles which make it nice to carry or grab on the go
hi , i bought this case for my samsung chromebook # . # arm processor the chromebook fits in perfectly , doesnt slide around and the zippers do not make contact with the chromebook when opening or closing the case the handles are a nice addition the pouch is large enough for the power cord , but i do feel it will stretch out over time and look bad from having it in there there is a slight odor as well the protection is good enough , just wish there was a little more <unk> like the speck pixelsleeve had , <unk> that case was a tad too small for the new chromebooks overall good case , good design and it fits perfect
case logic makes great products and there is nothing wrong with the case itself , but i would say it 's more for a tablet than a netbook it fits my # . # netbook from acer perfectly , but the problem is that that 's all it will fit with the computer in there the pocket becomes useless sure , it 's stretchy material so i could force the power cord and adaptor in there , but if i do that it seems like it 's going to rip so , the world & # # ; sleeve & # # ; is ideal in the description this is indeed a sleeve and not a case the pocket is good for a mini mouse and a usb stick , maybe a pencil or two , but you 'll probably be carrying the power adapter separately i use it still , but i 'm looking for something similar to my large notebook case that is pretty much a sleeve too , however , the pocket actually has extra material -lrb- gussets ? -rrb- at the edges so the pocket will expand when full and collapse when not full problem is i ca n't find anything like that in this size
the computer i bought this for was slightly above # . # `` and did not fit very well i had to squeeze my computer in , which caused unnecessary damage to the case the pocket was handy , but could only hold a charger and mouse at most it was a good case , but not ideal for my computer just check the dimensions on your computer before you buy and you 'll be fine
it fits my chrome netbook perfectly , is exactly as pictured and described , and seems to be of very good quality i am quite pleased with the product and on a recent trip , it protected my netbook adequately
son uses it to protect his samsung chromebook and it has done it 's job minimal wear in the year 's worth of use he has put on it ended up adding a key ring to the handle to keep his usb flash stick on -lrb- since storage barely holds the power cord if you need to drag that too -rrb-
i am starting a new job that wo n't allow offsite work , so this is a nice protective way to package my tablet discretely and carry a few other items without loading down my pockets it has a nice external pocket for a small journal , pen , keys , and the charger if i ever need to put it in a laptop bag , this is a nice insulated package
this was purchased to hold an ipad and a logitech ultrathin keyboard cover for same it does it very well without being too bulky it 's all soft material , so there 's no rigidity to protect the contents if you need extra , add a piece of cardboard the outside zipper compartment is good enough for a charging cable and plug it 's a good compact case offering medium protection
i have to agree with the other reviews about the smell it was really strong when i got it a friend suggested i put some dryer sheets inside it i put dryer sheets on every pocket and hung it outside in the sun it was a good thing that it came on a friday , so i left it out all through the weekend i 've been using it for over a month now and i do n't smell anything anymore it fits my lenovo x # perfectly
the sleeve is nice but there is no place for the power cord there is an extra sleeve to put cords ext , , , , but it bulges out and does not look professional or attractive im using it for my samsung chromebook i also have a mac pro which i am using a more suitable case
good case , nice pocket for small cords it does n't add much bulk , but it would n't protect your laptop from a corner fall , so plan on it being a carrying case , not a big shock protector
however , the fit is a little too tight for the chromebook i got , which was the recommended case , and the zipper suffers for it in no time at all kinda have to stretch the case around to make it work , but i still enjoy it overall
of course i have come to expect that from case logic this sleeve fits my new samsung chromebook perfectly and even has room for the power brick and charging cable in fact i can even sneak my mini logitech mouse in it
surprisingly well constructed handles convenient , do n't add to <unk> <unk> slight chemical reek -lrb- which i hope will dissipate ; not a deal-breaker hoped it would fit my new thinkpad x # ; does not , not even close fits my eee pc # well a good option for protecting a netbook or small laptop that 's carried in a backpack or case
this case logic netbook sleeve is perfect for the samsung chrome book secure zipper pockets for both your netbook , charger , thumb drives . ect easily carry on it 's own with the handles or slid it into your briefcase
this product is just right for the samsung chomebook the chomebook fits inside well and the pocket is <unk> for the power supply at first the handles may seem unnecessary but i guarantee you will use them for hanging on a roll around bag or for a secure grip when your arms are loaded with books or <unk>
i needed a good travel case for my recently purchased lenovo x # e this case fits it perfectly with the six cell battery , nice and snug , and has a front pouch perfect for charger and a few other accessories -lrb- not too many unfortunately -rrb- it was nice having a neoprene style case that you do n't have to wedge the power cord into as well
i bought a # inch bag for a # inch tablet because i like to have extra room for the charger , stand etc . this bag is perfect but it also has a very strong smell that lasts for a while it 's been nearly a week now that i have the bag and i can still faintly detect the odor
i got this for my acer # . # `` laptop it fits just right with a little bit of space on the side the pocket is very useful for my power cord and mouse the case itself is very light , which is a plus for me because i got this mainly to use when travelling ; i did n't want it to add more weight to my pack the material seems okay , although the stitching on the handles looks like it would n't last too long
this is a perfect fit for the asus # inch laptop/netbook i have it fits the computer , and a front zipper pocket will fit the mouse and the ac adapter but nothing else , which is why i like it not big or bulky the only drawback is the black neoprene material really catches lint , dust and other tiny specs and particles i have to constantly <unk> it off other than that i really like it
did a lot of research before choosing this one wish there were more color choices would also be nice if it had a long detachable strap but overall fantastic for it 's purpose stretchy front pocket is great would definately reccomend this and the price was great
i bought this bag for my acer chromebook the chromebook fits perfectly in the bag the handles are the perfect size for carrying my only reason for giving this just four stars is that the exterior pocket is a bit small for the chromebook power cord otherwise , the bag is perfect
will hold the samsung chrome laptop but is not sized only for this computer i would like to have two improvements ; more padding and a dock for a wireless mouse - personal preference does the job as advertised
fits my # . # inch asus seashell netbook perfectly though the netbook is not actually # . # inches -- the actual dimensions are # . # x # x # . # inches that extra half inch would probably have made it tight it fits in my backpack fine , and the pocket easily fits a charger or whatever it does n't really smell unless you like stick your nose in it
bought this case for my wife 's new samsung chromebook -lrb- wi-fi , # . # -inch . # . # model the chromebook fits snugly in this case , and the outside zippered storage pocket easily holds the chromebook 's charger , a wireless mouse and a set of ear buds the case is made of good quality material , and i would highly recommend this product
i just wanted to let anyone know , if you 're looking for a case for your google cr- # notebook , this is the one to get perfect fit , it 's very tight and it was kind of hard to zip the first # or # times but now i 've had the case for # days and <unk> maybe # times and it 's much better in the side pocket there 's more than enough space for the power cord looks great too and does n't smell as bad as people say -lrb- call me weird but i personally enjoy the smell -rrb- nor is it really that strong
my netbook fits in the main compartment and my kindle fits perfectly in the front compartment this will be very handy when travelling it is light and seems well made the handles fold neatly out of the way when not in use pleased with this product and happy to recommend it
my netbook case arrived promptly from amazon , as promised it is the perfect size for my acer # . # inch netbook it even has an extra storage area for my wireless mouse and other small things it is well-constructed and the material is soft yet sturdy it protects my netbook quite well i would recommend it to anyone looking for a case to protect and transport their <unk> laptop/netbook and the price is right :
the size is perfect for my macbook air # . # some people have commented on the smell of the neoprene i do n't find it bad at all after being left out overnight but partially covered with a cloth briefcase , i only can really smell it by putting it up to my nose if it had been in the briefcase , perhaps the odor would be stronger if i could , i would change one thing i would extend the zipper down the case further on both sides for easier removal but that 's not a big deal and i am still very happy with the purchase
myasus # <unk> perfectly inside this caselogic <unk> # sleeve the zipper closes easily around the netbook without stretching , yet the pc is secure and does n't move around inside the sleeve there 's a lip of neoprene between the pc and the zipper , so there should be minimal chance of scratching unless your pc is oversized for the case -lrb- see my customer image -rrb- side pocket is great for storing the power adapter , although doing so gives the case a bulged , lumpy look handles are sturdy and overall the case has a well-made feel to it the case had a fairly strong rubber odor when it arrived , but that 's probably common for any neoprene product shipped in a sealed plastic bag the smell is mostly gone after a week , but i had to set the case aside for a few days to let it air out all told , i 'm very happy with this case
smell goes away after about # and a half months otherwise this is an amazing product ... if i had an ipad i could probably fit the ipad the chromebook and both the chargers in there
this holds my dell inspiron # perfectly it 's a # . # & # # ; mini and since the material is flexible , the outside zippered compartment holds my power brick and cord the case does n't have any padding so there is n't any protection if it 's dropped so just be careful
this sleeve has just enough room for the charger and wireless mouse in the storage pouch the # . # `` netbook just fits into the main compartment with a small wireless mouse receiver on the side
it 's a perfect fit for my acer chromebook pocket easily holds the charger and some other small thin items like a pen and business cards the case is padded , but not bulky so i can easily put in my briefcase next to my laptop and it all fits
i got this for my samsung series # chromebook it fits perfectly zippered pouch on front will fit the power adapter -lrb- similarly to the way <unk> fit -rrb- awesome for carrying without adapter will carry the adapter if you need it too not a catch all type bag for computer and a bunch of accessories
i was looking for a simple neoprene case for my lenovo x # & this sleeve is exactly what i wanted it is protective & does n't take up too much space
i purchased this case for my netbook prior to a vacation when i first looked at it , i thought it would work well for the computer , but i thought that it did not have adequate space for the power cords and wireless mouse as it turns out , those extra items fit quite nicely and securely in the case i am very happy with the case and the seller was excellent
this was a storage case to protect a new chromebook i purchased for my grandson recently kids can be a bit rough on things and this is a good way to try and safely store such items he starts high school next fall and this is a good way to store and travel with his new netbook i would definitely recommend for the money it teaches kids to try and protect valuable items
this is perfect for the thin and light netbook crowd it has enough padding to protect your laptop , yet not so much that you lose track of the whole reason for buying a thin and light computer it fits my # `` asus # t perfectly
i am a full time student , and i love to travel i use a chromebook , and this case fits it like a glove the charger and a set of headphones fit snugly in the side zipper pocket this case has brought my chromebook to class every day , just tossed in a backpack it has brought my chromebook safely all around the country by air and car and out of the country on boat the handles are a little silly , but the few times i am carrying just my chromebook , they are <unk> convenient it feels funny having a double handle for something that weighs around one pound , but it is much better than <unk> to a neoprene case sans handles after over a year of hard use , this has held up great , without even a hint of wear and tear
i was looking for a case for <unk> chromebook -lrb- wi-fi , # . # -inch -rrb- that i had won at a conference was looking at thecase logic laps- # - # . # - inch <unk> sleeve -lrb- black -rrb- but wanted the extra pocket for holding the power cords and any other accessories i was worried that this case would leave a lot of room and the chromebook would slide around so far it looks like it is really snug this case fits nicely in my case logic messenger bag that normally fits my # -inch laptop that i previously lugged along when i travel with a computer very satisfied with this purchase and i would highly recommend this for anyone that has a samsung chromebook or similar item
i 've owned several case logic cases in the past , and it was the way they stand behind their products that keeps me as a customer this one stretches just enough to fit my hp elitebook # , even with the oversize battery installed room in it 's roomy pocket for charger and wireless mouse too
this case holds my ipad # and apple bluetooth keyboard i can also get a stack of mail and paper in it , or other appropriately sized things the side pouch holds all kinds of extras -- <unk> , pens , pencils , note pad , flash drives , cables , charger , and more because it 's neoprene it 's extremely flexible and <unk> , and provides pretty good padded protection fits easily into my laptop backpack -lrb- along with laptop -rrb- i highly recommend this case
well made and protects my chromebook perfectly with the padded neoprene material i bought it because it has a very convenient handle to hold it easily if only have one free hand to carry other things also the zippered separate small exterior pouch for cords , mouse and <unk> adapter was roomy enough to handle all of these was a real joy no longer have to pack a separate pouch for <unk> devices highly recommend it for those on the go
this case looks nice and is very practical the handles make it easy to carry the material is stretchy and the pocket in front is so big that it can hold my charger cords , my wireless mouse , and usb flashdrives
fits just right my for ll # inch laptop with the mouse receiver constantly attached it is made well and handy for all my needs i can fit my charger , mouse and headphones nicely in it and place the whole thing in my backpack
ordered this for my husband ... exactly what i was looking for it fit our google chrome laptop perfectly i liked it better than others i had seen it has a pocket in the front , and handles good buy for the price
i bought this for my son who just got his first computer not only was he excited , but he also choose this cover he likes it because it 's lightweight and easy to get in and out of
it is a simple case , that can hold a samsung chromebook , and its power supply it is very well priced and made of good quality material it is worth its price
fits my new hp envy which is # by # . # inches it has to stretch just a little in width to get it in but it is no problem at all cheap , simple and light just what i was looking for also , the zip pouch stretches enough to get the charger in without a
i bought this along with the asus # n netbook the netbook fits in here perfect ; fits like a glove where the netbook fits there is no extra room for anything in the zippered compartment other than some paperwork in the outside compartment i have room for the charger and a wireless mouse it is small and compact but that is what one would want for a small netbook computer and the essentials nice quality case and cushions everything quite well
case logic <unk> # . # -inch neoprene netbook sleeve -lrb- black -rrb- with a red interior zipper pocket on the side can hold other items and stretches well nice texture and easy to carry with the handle i love it so far to protect & carry my new asus # b
i love this case , it has enough room for the chromebook , plus the chargers , and even slid in a ipad into the case , and fit perfectly secure and safe would recommend to anyone who needs a case for their chromebook
it fits the samsung chromebook perfectly another review said that it is tight at first , then it gets better that was n't the case with mine -- it fit perfectly from the first time the power cord is a little big and clumsy , but it fits in the side pocket okay
it has just enough room for my # & # # ; netbook and my essentials : a power cord and a mouse it does n't take up any extra room and it 's easy to put my netbook in and take it out
my chromebook fits perfectly in this case and it makes it very easy to bring places i also love how it has the pocket on the front it easily carries my charger
this case has been great to use for the past month carrying the laptop , cords , mouse and earbuds to work each day the handle make it easy to carry works great for my # . # `` laptop
fits my asus # b very <unk> padding is n't particularly thick , but good enough handles look to be durable the pocket on the front works fine for holding my power cable -lrb- though i imagine large power supplies might be more of a squeeze only complaint , a minor one , is the chemically smell , which is getting better with time
i bought this case for my asus # <unk> # netbook the case does exactly as advertised the pocket is perfect for my power cord and it small enough to not add much weight while protecting the netbook
excellent , used by our son at school , protects chrome book and does not interfere with the use of the tablet student has no complaints , easy to transport chrome book between classes
this netbook sleeve is an excellent fit for the # . # `` acer it is well made and i did not find the odor of the materials used to be bothersome it is an excellent buy
i was looking for a case for my bamboo craft and look at this one at amazon i decided to buy it and it fits perfectly for my bamboo craft at first i expect this case will be a bit bigger for my bamboo , but it does n't it fits perfectly and it also has like a holder for the pen and sort of slot for the pen tip replacement -lrb- not sure if that 's the right term -rrb- very nice cushion as well would recommend for other bamboo craft user the only downside for this case is they do n't really have specific place for the cable , so you kinda just tuck it in and look kinda bumpy from the outside
this product is made from polyurethane my wacom pen and touch fits nicely inside as you probably read there is a little compartment for extra nibs the only downside is that the cord for the tablet fits awkwardly inside , it <unk> out the way it fits inside it seems like it has the opportunity to mess up the wires inside other than that its near perfect
i first got another case that was recommended by amazon , only to find out that it does not fit the new bamboo i have i returned it and ordered this case and i am very happy with it so far the material is nice and is a little bit like memory foam if you push on it it holds the shape of your fingerprint for a minute and then slowly returns to its original form i imagine that helps the case form to whatever it 's inside it and protect it better , and it 's also fun to play with for a second when you 're bored the one thing i think it 's missing is something to hold the usb cord so i would n't have to wrap the cord around the bamboo and risk the metal end scratching the tablet
as a tablet case this works very very well it does fit the capture tablet but not with the stylus at the same time returning this one and ordering the next size up
i can only confirm the other reviews , this is a very well done product the material is robust , the foam is thick and has `` memory `` , meaning it <unk> the shocks and keep the shape for a while the overall feeling is that of an extremely solid item inside there is a pen holder and it has also holders for extra pen nibs i does not get # stars only because it would have been nice to have something to hold the cable and the usb , which float inside the case -lrb- though there is enough room for those -rrb-
while i have n't tried any other tablet sleeves , i am overall satisfied with this one the <unk> material is thick and heavy , offering peace of mind when traveling wrapping or bunching up the tablet cord can be a bit annoying , but i imagine this is an unavoidable issue with any fitted tablet sleeve
the foam padding and the slot for the pen made this a better product than i had hoped i carry my bamboo to and from work and this case affords me peace of mind at a reasonable price
i ordered this sleeve for my son who was required to have the bamboo for a college class it fit perfectly and will help to protect his device -lrb- he 's a little careless sometimes -rrb-
although i wish it had a better or more secure spot for the pen -lrb- minor inconvenience -rrb- , overall it 's proven to be a great product and i recommend it for anyone traveling with their bamboo tablet
very happy with the construction and the protection that this sleeve gives my bamboo tablet my tablet gets a lot of abuse i cart it to school and sometimes things get put on top of it in the car i do n't have to worry to much this sleeve is thick & absorbs the shock of those items that get set on it i feel better about carting my tablet
i have just <unk> this case and its construction quality has far surpassed my expectations it has a very slim profile without sacrificing its ability to keep my tablet safe : the foam is excellent and a hard nylon cord sewn around the outer edge gives it additional stability and protection from an <unk> drop this case can definitely withstand transport in a backpack or messenger bag , and feels like something you can <unk> into a back seat without a second thought i 'd never heard of be . ez and was a bit nervous with my order , but i 'll definitely be looking them up for cases on other devices
i 've had a tablet for about a month and , on a trip , ended up having to travel with it in box for fear of it getting damaged decided to get this to save space next time i love this very stylish and great material -lrb- extremely stiff with just enough give for perfect protection -rrb- inside is a nice fabric loop -lrb- made from the same material as a car seat belt by the feel -rrb- for holding your stylus an oddly brilliant addition is a small rubber tab inside with three slots for extra pen nibs , something i never would have thought to include all in all , perfect for the traveling digital artist , i can not recommend this enough
i ordered this item for my ipad -- and had read some positive reviews -- but it is really too bulky to put in a handbag better suited for a netbook -- or if you want a case that can hold an ipad plus some accessories , this is fine i wanted more of a sleeve and have found something more compact that will fit in a tote or large handbag
i am always on the lookout for the ` perfect ' case for my laptop and my netbook ideally , i would have something that provides maximum functionality , a level of padded protection for the computing device , and looks somewhat attractive the photos of the acme made smart laptop sleeve were really cute i loved the design when i saw it online so i ordered it when i received it , i was disappointed in the looks right off the bat while the design itself is pleasing , the materials used for the sleeve make it look cheap and not as attractive as i had thought from the online photos the sleeve itself is fine for carrying it in , although there is really nothing to distinguish it from most other netbook sleeves i 'd rather use a plain black sleeve that looks less cheap than this one
i received two of these one for the netbooks and one for # . # screen laptops <unk> one for netbooks will not fit my acer # . # screen laptop the model for # . # model laptops does fit but is somewhat loose in it neither size is a good fit i really like the color <unk> they have and the nice smooth finish too they do not seem to collect finger prints so that is good now both of them have good padding for a slim sleeve and good strap but no padding for the strap so long term use will be tough on your shoulder i did not test to see if it was water resistant and will take it at its word on that one i will continue to use the # . # model sleeve for my acer # . # laptop even though it is not a great fit
this is a lightweight but well-padded sleeve that fits most netbooks it looks good -lrb- not just one more black sleeve and not obviously holding a valuable <unk> item -rrb- , and has a shoulder strap does n't fit a whole lot of other stuff - not even the power brick for most netbooks but it does the job well , looks good , and is not expensive if you want a fancier case with lots <unk> , this one is n't for you otherwise , it 's fine
