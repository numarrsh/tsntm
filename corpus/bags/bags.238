i bought this for my husband & have n't heard a complaint from him he carries his laptop in it to work everyday it seems comfortable & looks good i do n't see it on me though it 's kind of heavy
i think this bag is worth the deal of $ # and is a good fit for any notebook of # . # `` or under it has many compartments to fit in a lot of stationary items other electronic stuff , and the quality of shoulder straps is gr # it 's design is stylish and fabric has a nice texture , but at the same time it is tough and durable hence i would certainly recommend this bag
this is my first purchase from this vendor and am deeply satisfied with my merchandise there was no damage , missing parts or delay the product was delivered <unk> and as described
this a very nice laptop bad with enough space for additional stuff it is very well padded and is not a strain to carry the bag on your back for periods of time i use it with a # . # `` lenovo and it fits very easily in the bag right next to the laptop compartment , there are pouches to keep the charging cables and mouse , etc . there is enough space in the other pouches to carry other accessories also its looks are sharp too
i have one backpack of swissgear who traveled a lot with me and i am completely satisfied it fits <unk> my laptop sony vaio of # . # size i bought this for a friend who liked mine and the quality and space it is the same
i am very pleased with this backpack it is the perfect size for my needs i carry an hp computer in it plus all the materials for my meetings , and it fits under the seat of airplanes with even a little room for my feet
i purchased this bag a year ago , and have only used it occassionally while i was initially happy with it for the first # months , soon , the handle started becoming unbalanced , and then the top portion of the handle just broke and fell off i tried contacting customer service because this is theoretically under a # -year warranty , but got no response i 'm pretty disappointed , especially after reading all those other great reviews
if you happen to have a small # `` or less laptop then this is the bag for you unfortunately , i need a rolling bag for a # `` or greater laptop the info on this bag was <unk> when i bought it so it was trial and error the trial is over but the error lingers on
the briefcase we bought was for our new # `` laptop computer it is not quite wide enough to fit our computer into the compartment the computer is to go into so we do n't have the protection , we would have if we were able to put it there we are using the compartment you would normally use for materials i would include better measurements of the inside <unk> of the bag overall , we are pleased with the bag
ca n't find a better computer case than the swiss gear rolling case has plenty of room for accessories , but would be better if all the cases did n't have those annoying file folder partitions they would be great for business users , but for home use i do n't need them what i need is more compartments where the file folders are but they are usually standard on all cases of this size
i had a swissgear backpack for # years but due to a shoulder injury , needed to switch to a roller case this case was exactly what i was looking for and working out pretty good this case is not a little case and may be too big for some people the only negative that i have so far is with a # week business trip , one of the seams is coming apart -lrb- and i have tried not to overload it -rrb- the wheels and handle have been working great -lrb- these were my concern before i bought it -rrb-
this case looked great online and it is even better in person i carry college books and my laptop and it seems lighter than any case i have ever had sling it over your shoulder and it is like it is not even there lots of room to store everything you need for the average college <unk> , -lrb- the pics are a tad deceptive as you can carry three <unk> bottles rather than two -rrb- only thing missing was the cell phone case featured in the pics if anyone received it let me know
i needed a rolling office / tool shed between laptop , files , and tools it weighs in at nearly # lbs this bag fits the bill wonderfully at first i thought that the handle , when extended , felt a little flimsy there was a lot of lateral movement and twist to the handle but after a month of dragging it across parking lots , up and down stairs , and over all sorts of terrain i must say that my wrist appreciates the flex that is in the handle there are no signs of wear in any of the joints i do n't know if this is by design , but it sure works for me
went online and bought this from <unk> shipped for free and was only # bucks this bag is very good for the money i have seen some bags at twice the price it has many pockets , a large , cushioned area for the computer and the wheels roll nicely i would recommend this bag to business travelers on the go
perfect for # day overnight travel with business casual dress at the remote site plenty of room for a computer , related equipment , clothes and presentations no more <unk> at the airport
i love any item swiss army puts out this briefcase has plenty of compartment space and very easy to carry and pull around it 's very durable and sharp looking the only thing this bag may need , but i can live without is # wheels a must buy
you get what you pay for , this is not very good one of the unfortunate things about buying online unfortunately i threw away the box , or i would have returned
the bag is not very spacious as compared to my previous swissgear bag the laptop storage section features a velcro flap to secure the laptop -lrb- often gets <unk> with other items -rrb- about # th of the laptop -lrb- # `` macbook pro -rrb- stays out of the laptop storage `` pouch `` . the shoulder straps are very comfortable compared to older swissgear bags and distribute weight of contents very uniformly overall , not worth its price -lrb- usd # . # -rrb- would recommend buying other swissgear bags that are a lot cheaper
i bought # different swissgear and a samsonite backpack at the same time three are very similar in design this one is longer and flatter than the others it also has less pockets it is well made but has dimensions that are less ideal than the others for my travel needs unless you have something that is fairly long to fit in the bag , the length may be better served being transformed into more thickness
they need to do something about the excessively long straps they catch on everything - <unk> walking down the aisle in airplanes is a pain there has to be a better way than this otherwise , i like this pack for business travel not too big , plenty of compartments , decent quality for high
i wo n't go into all the features of the bag overall , it 's a nice bag , has the number of pockets i would like and is generally the size and shape i was after i was a little disappointed though with some of the stitching around the medium size pocket zipper the threads were n't cut properly and the zipper was getting stuck i cut them back , but unfortunately , it causing some unraveling so , instead of this being a multi year backpack , i 'm afraid it 's going to have a key pocket become useless in only a few months hopefully this is a just a <unk> flaw and that others receive higher quality merchandise
this is a good swiss army a lot of padding almost everywhere you can think of . which makes it comfortable to wear , but fairly heavy it is also bigger in size than what i expected from the picture it was a return for me , since i was looking for something light and small , mostly just to carry laptop and charger
so , this backpack is very big for me i 'm # ' # `` , and my son could n't use it because it 's too bulky for his school locker he also is very <unk> , so it 's huge on his thin # ' # `` frame i think it 's very well made , but i may have to return it because of the size
this is the second swissgear for me but i liked my first one more this is good but bottom shape is something i do n't like about this bag overall the bag is spacious
if you 're looking for a college backpack that 's not too large , this one fits the bill no , it 's not going to hold every text book you have for all of your classes and your computer , but it does hold quite a bit , comfortably i carry my laptop , a five-star notebook , a folder and up to four class books and though it can be a tight fit depending on which books i bring , it still works very nicely it 's comfortably padded all around and very , very nice looking has a place for your phone , a water bottle -lrb- though that 's a tight fit -rrb- , your books , your <unk> , and your laptop it also has many places to clip <unk> your keys or anything else that clips overall , i 'm extremely satisfied with this purchase
very sturdy and looks like that it 's waterproof . just a little big for a girl i want to use this backpack to carry my # ' inches mac pro i think this big backpack could handle a # ' inches one ... anyway , good backpack , just a little big for a girl
this is a good backpack with alot of room for storage of books as well as the laptop excellent for a college student it will do very well in protecting the laptop only problem i encountered is some wider laptops will fit in the slot but the strap will not hold it in since it is not long enough for example i have a # . # `` laptop and it would n't go over so i sewed on some velcro and its all good very good quality bag
this bag is what i was looking for its a great commuter bag for laptop -lrb- can <unk> larger then # `` -rrb- and other personal items <unk> larger then expected but over-all comfortable to wear and nicely designed for someone to be organized
this backpack is a quality product it has lots of specialized pockets for all your computing gear and is large enough to hold the laptop and its peripherals best of all , when you travel , a lady can have her rolling bag and fit her handbag in this backpack so she has two carry-on items and is n't required to check luggage
i ordered this on sale from amazon i was delighted when i got this backpack , it is extremely well made and had all the room i needed for the class materials i was taking to a class halfway across the country i bought this backpack to travel with and it did it 's job and then some i would recommend this product to anyone who is traveling with their laptop and needs extra room for books , magazines , notebooks and binders lots of space without being bulky this backpack is made extremely well and has some great finishing touches like the water bottle pocket that zips open and closed and a number of zipper compartments
very good and reasonable price in addition , it 's very comfortable when you are wearing it and you wo n't feel very heavy even if you have a lot of things in your bag
i have loved the swissgear wenger products and am always satisfied with their products especially baggage products a little expensive but its important to maintain the quality and hence the price is right i bought this backpack for my fiancee who is a graduate student she is very very picky about what she carries with her and wanted a simple sturdy backpack she was pleasantly surprised with what she received very sturdy backpack
good back pack , works perfect for me and has the right pockets and dividers for my way of using it , it is light and well made , also not too big or small just right very happy with the product an recomend
you really ca n't go wrong with swissgear this is a light and durable bag it has just the right amount of pockets to keep every student organized but , not too many so they waste time searching for items
i 'm very happy with this product , it has a lot of storage space and it 's very comfortable the materials are resistent and the zippers are made of good <unk> materials besides , the price was very good wen i bought it
works like a horse ... now using for # years also looks formal and can use in office only bottle holder is bit small for some <unk> the back feels fine at airports with this backpack ... <unk> but good
this is the second such laptop backpack that i 've gotten because the # st one wore so well looks still new after # tough yrs at college ! now both boys are smart looking students
it surely can take all that you have ... it is a rather big backpack ... not like camping size but it is sure quite bigger then my old swiss gear . expensive
i use this backpack for school and it has plenty of compartments and room to hold my schoolbooks and laptop safely durable build , kind of big but i do n't mind the straps and <unk> make it extremely comfortable to wear for long periods of time i love this
got a great deal on it and i 'm very pleased with this backpack i use it all the time and people always complement its well built look i 'm # and still rocking the one strap on shoulder look ! !
this backpack was just what i needed it has # compartments in the # large pockets main pocket has a slot for my # `` laptop and a strap to hold it in , a divider and another slot for books also # pouches where i keep my mouse and charger the smaller front pocket holds other things i need , a lunch , pencil box and little stuff and the smaller <unk> on the very front holds a couple things the straps are padded and the backpack wears nicely , it comfortable on my injured back side pouches for drinks are a little small but i get a medium size gatorade in there just fine i read that it does not do well against getting wet so i scotch <unk> the entire outside when i got it
i am not on the swiss gear <unk> , but i can not say enough about this pack i have bought two over the last # years , and they are both still kicking there is literally a useful spot for everything i plan on buying # more just incase it is taken off of amazon.com i ca n't seem to find it anywhere else
lots of storage and pockets the folder compartment is great to have and the zip away water bottle holder is a well thought out touch lots of sholder support protection for laptop is very thick highly recomend this well made backpack
this was a gift my son loved the fact it was well made and could carry ipod and accessories well as his laptop great gift for student or people on the
perfect size , and style simple , and sturdy very happy with this backpack my dell # & # # ; laptop is maybe a little bit small for the laptop sleeve , but it is still secure
bought this before college started up , and i am not disappointed in the slightest the bag handles weight very nicely , and does n't get too bulky very comfortable , even for long walks it has a respectable carriage capacity and it is extremely well made completely satisfied , definitely would recommend
i 've been using this backpack for two and a half months now it reeks of high quality the zippers are thick and sturdy , as are the straps , the partitions and the exterior of the bag itself it holds my # . # inch laptop , my galaxy note # . # in a thick case , a notebook or two , and a folder with miscellaneous papers with ease this is in addition to the laptop charger , pencil cases , extra chargers for my note and phone and some girl cosmetics girl cosmetics bring me to my next point : even though i am a girl of average height -lrb- # ' # & # # ; -rrb- , the back does not look bulky or too manly on me it just looks nice the straps are comfortable , and i especially love the little thingie for sunglasses on the strap i think this bag would last me quite some time i highly recommend it
- never had zipper binding issues - compartmentalization is convenient and great for organization - a lot of well thought out design <unk> - the side <unk> band on one of the shoulder straps started coming apart at the seam within a few weeks it 's annoying , but it has n't been getting any worse with time - the mesh pockets on the sides are too shallow to hold any decent sized water bottle - just a personal preference , but i wish it came with a waist
this backpack has good weight distribution so it does n't feel as heavy as other backpacks the bottom front pouch is harder to open than most other backpacks but after some wear in it has improved the bottom front pouch has a lot of room but it 's a little short overall i 'd give the backpack # .
i purchased this item to replace a targus bag i had when i first opened the box i noticed it was a bit shorter than bags i 'm used to , but i was amazed how much it held it is very comfortable and has a lot of neat compartments i 'm very satisfied with it
i purchased this bag because # -rrb- to replace the black targus bag i had been using for college # -rrb- the cool design , various compartments , and the color -lrb- red = my favorite # -rrb- the reviews were great i love this bag it houses my # . # `` laptop perfectly -lrb- along w / its accessories -rrb- and my college books the $ # . # i paid for this bag has n't gone to waste one bit comfortable to wear many pockets to hold practically everything you would need on a daily basis buy this bag i love it so much that i 'm even considering buying the same model in all black -lrb- whenever it comes back in stock ; obviously it 's popular
smaller than i expected , but i should have looked more closely at the size listed - returned because the material is very thin and did n't seem like much protection for items inside the
the bag appears to be good quality i have only been using it about one month but it is holding up well nice size to hold my ipad mini and purse type stuff i also appreciate that it is made with recycled materials the only thing i would improve is padding for the tablet compartment
i have been looking for a small messenger bag for over # months and finally i have the one that fits me i am not a purse carrying kind of person but needed more space when i got married -lrb- his keys , his wallet , his phone , camera , etc etc -rrb- i like to have my hands free and did not want to mess with a shoulder bag this bag is perfect - lots of organization , a place for my sunglasses , straps that do n't twist and bunch , small , durable and recycled one day i may have an ipad or something similar - it will then also be the perfect computer bag ; -rrb- love it
i have had this bag for more than # years and use it every day i am not a `` purse `` girl , but wanted something to carry my wallet , cell , e-reader , and other needed items this is perfect it is large enough to fit a few <unk> and a snack for the day , and the water bottle holder easily holds a # ml <unk> <unk> bottle i love that it is recycled and that the strap is easily adjustable , and the padded mp # holder is an added benefit it would definitely hold a small tablet without a problem the sticky rubber on the shoulder strap wore out after about a year of use , but once i removed that it was fine the sewn areas on the strap are starting to wear , and i will be replacing the strap but that is after carrying an average of # # in it daily the bag is still in good , but slightly worn , condition and does not need to be replaced
i have looked at a million bags to carry my <unk> , books , water and field stuff . this bag has many compartments , it easy on the shoulder and lightweight i would recommend this to anyone who carries too much stuff in the field
this is a very functional laptop bag , with pockets for all the usual things -- pen , pencil , cell phone , mouse , laptop , business cards love the green interior -- very easy to see what 's inside i was a little disappointed in the appearance -- a bit shiny and cheap-looking the handles are thin and stiff and not comfortable on my shoulder i 'm hoping they will soften some in time mostly , this convinced me that i need to buy a nice bag really like the convenience of a bag designed just for this purpose
i bought the bag a few weeks ago , and just returned from my first academic trip with it it definitely served its purpose : it 's an <unk> bag for holding my laptop and papers , and it 's reasonably comfortable it 's the first time getting my laptop in and out of the bag for security inspection has been so easy for the trip i also used it instead of a handbag -lrb- holding my wallet , keys , etc -rrb- i like the green inside : it makes it more <unk> , and easier to search for stuff i wish the bag had more inside pockets , and i wish the straps would have been stronger : it 's a new bag , my laptop is pretty light , and yet the straps already look somewhat worn out
i love everything about this bag except that the handles ' pleather begins to unravel in temperatures above # degrees <unk> -lrb- eg if you leave the bag in your car while you run into the grocery store -rrb- then when you go to wear the bag again , the black pleather bits shed all over your clothes and are annoying having to pick off if the manufacturer fixes the high heat problem , then the bag would deserve # stars because everything else about it is perfect
this bag fit my new gateway laptop perfectly -lrb- # . # inch screen -rrb- i love the bright green inside , so easy to find what you are looking for the black outside is subtle and classic
i am quite pleased and satisfied with the delivery and receipt of this product it is effective and practical the stitched is very done rendering the <unk> this product to be strong and durable the tote very easy to clean and stands upto hard rain and <unk> very well i have long need this product for some time thelaptop inside a laptop sleeve fits very well inside the tote 's designated sleeve <unk> pockets on each side of the tote smartly accommodate mobile phones and <unk> cases the key <unk> is a smart interior accessory for keys , key rings and <unk> drive with key connectors the price was just what i could handle very good investment
it came with a label on the box & # # ; bed bath & beyond & # # ; a quick web search of their site shows a clearance price plus i could have had an additional # percent off using one of their coupons boy do i feel taken i might have been able to save # percent from the price listed on amazon
the bracket attaching it to furniture requires some <unk> it 's a great idea but requires something to attach it to , like a table , bed or desk leg multiple bolts are provided but if the furniture in the apartment or dorm is something <unk> , forget about attaching it to that it requires some sort of vertical support or leg and <unk> nuts provided make it easy on easy off the lock provided seems to be of low quality and a trip to the hardware store could fix that but it 's not a standard size , it 's a smaller <unk> overall it 's sturdy and just about bombproof with space for a # inch macbook and pockets for smaller valuables
i bought this for my daughter to take to college based on the previous review , as soon as the <unk> came in , i tested the lock i could get the lock in and out but it was a struggle i went to my local hardware store and bought a round metal file i then filed the hole - <unk> it just enough to make it easier to install and remove the lock this resolved the problem i know that you should not have to make this type of ` adjustment ' but i felt that the usefullness of the product made it worth my while my daughter is now happily using her <unk> this is a good way of <unk> your belongings but the latching mechanism does need some work in order to allow the lock to be <unk> inserted and removed
works as described good quality construction neat and easy way to secure your items i got all # of their safes for my son works great with most all dorm / <unk> furniture
the vault is awesome for storing daughters laptop and important documents while away at school however , the hardware supplied with the vault only provided a loose attachment to the dorm furniture
good product and easy to setup they provide various bolt lengths but i still had to buy own and lock <unk> the interior pockets need strong mounting squares to hold them in place
it was wrapped in plastic , but definitely not new it was <unk> in scratches and marks definitely not happy i would not recommend buying anything from them i 'm very disappointed returning and getting a refund asap
this case is great looking and fits perfectly onto a macbook pro # `` , with appropriate cutouts for the power cord , usb cables , etc . i like the glossy finish and it really is clear enough that it 's not immediately obvious that you have a hard plastic case over your laptop however , i have not been able to remove the top half of the case -lrb- the part covering the screen side of the macbook -rrb- because it fits so tightly this means i have no way of cleaning my computer or the case furthermore , while the bottom half is easy to remove , it has a hard and rough plastic edge that digs uncomfortably into my wrists , so i do n't use that half overall , i think the idea of the hard protective case is a good one , but it has not been executed in a way that makes it actually helpful or user-friendly
this is great protection i was worried about heat , but no noticeable difference very easy to install update # year <unk> was a terrible thing to do to my macbook dirt and other things eventually work there way in between the case and the macbook the result is that the macbook becomes scratched from the constant rubbing of the dirt particles causing the macbook to look terrible
this case is a great idea not so nice as the satin ones but the clear color lets the aluminum of mac be seen it fits the old # -lrb- # . # `` , more square case -rrb- perfectly the case has a snug fit , feels great , and looks very professional although fingerprints show up more on this satin speck case than the <unk> speck case , the satin case does n't accumulate scratches as much
even though the product packaging <unk> stated `` fits macbook pro # , `` it was too small to fit over the top or bottom of my laptop and the port cutouts did n't match my ports i could 've prevented the problem by noticing the ports did n't match in the picture shown ; i did n't realize that there are multiple versions of the macbook pro # mine says `` model a # `` on the bottom save yourself the hassle of returning the product by comparing your laptop to the one shown in the picture
it provides the proper protection and it is easy to install however , it is fairly difficult to remove it and i struggle to get it off . overall decent project , reccomended
this case does a good job of protecting from dents and scrapes that being said , it has some major flaws all in all , it 's the best that can be gotten now that the laptop has become <unk> * stays warm and keeps fans running -lrb- i checked the internal <unk> , and they are pretty hot * the plastic strip above the disk drive is flimsy * basically impossible to remove cover from screen * not flush in some places * some ports are harder to use due to the plastic surrounding them -lrb- left side * makes laptop bulky and heavier * collects dust and may scratch <unk> * good protection * sleek plastic look and feel * fingerprints do not stay * has a hole for the <unk> button * has vents on the bottom for heat <unk> : still working after a year i have n't been able to remove the top cover , though
this case looks nice , but it 's rigid plastic , so i think it has higher potential to crack it <unk> very well on the macbook , but actually too well i can not get the top cover off for cleaning i could probably use something to wedge the cover off , but then i 'd be risking scratching the macbook itself or cracking the cover not very practical this case would have # stars if the cover were easy to get off and # stars if they used a more flexible plastic material
i dropped a # <unk> textbook on my macbook pro , and it left a huge dent in the casing now that i 've bought this case , i 'm not worried about stupid things like that anymore it 's a freaking tank - shockingly sturdy , and adds tons of support it 's heavy , but that 's to be expected when you 're adding this much dense plastic to protect your $ # computer
i wanted a cover for my macbook pro to protect the finish i saw this cover in the apple store and best buy , but it cost more i am very pleased with how it fits my mac and protects it the color -lrb- red -rrb- also gives you mac your unique <unk> and easy to spot it was delivered as new in the package it was easy to attach to my mac the only complaint i have is that i must make sure that i have attached the power supply securely the power supply is a magnetic connection and you have to make sure you line it up exactly in the opening in the side slot , otherwise you do not get a complete connection and charging does not occur
this is a great case , especially for such a great price i decided that i wanted to prevent my macbook pro -lrb- silver keys -rrb- from getting anymore dents this product fits that requirement perfectly it is not too difficult to remove to change the battery , but does not come off by itself it does not cause the computer to overheat and has n't scratched too much
disclaimer : i do n't own this product personally re : the picture that supposedly shows this product blocking ports on the right side of the computer : http / / <unk> # <unk> # <unk> # <unk> # <unk> # <unk> is most likely not the product on this page the reviewer probably bought the core duo model here -lrb- http / / <unk> # <unk> # -rrb- and installed it on a core * # * duo mbp notice the cover in the picture has three port openings and the computer has four ; the core * # * mbps have an additional firewire # port the cover on this page should fit correctly on non-unibody core * # * duo mbps with # -inch displays
my late # pre-unibody macbook pro looked and performed like new after the genius bar replaced my main logic board and lcd display so i decided to keep her looking new as long as possible this speck case is just what i was looking for excellent fit and finish i qualified for free <unk> shipping by purchasing an inexpensive cable that i also needed the only reason i that gave # instead of # stars is that the case does n't let my display open quite as far ... not a big deal , but noticeable
it 's a pretty good case for the macbook pro , it consists of two pieces which each clip on to either the display and the underside of the laptop they 're not too easy to take off , however - the manufacturer appears to recommend the use of a credit card for removing them -lrb- they hook on with clips -rrb- however , it adds protection but at the cost of thickness the laptop becomes pretty thick with the case , and in my opinion becomes slightly harder to grip - for the plastic seems to be more slippery than the aluminum of the macbook pro also , my wrist sometimes catches on the part that covers the cd drives , which is fairly annoying but in the end , i 'm very happy with the seethru case , and i feel a lot more confident using my macbook pro in rougher situations the added heft is worth it
its a pretty good product speck is pretty high quality protects from scratches and dents -lrb- the macbook pro is pretty susceptible to those if you 're into the whole <unk> thing , then i 'd highly recommend this case i kind of wish i went for the clear version though when the lid is closed and the apple light turns off , you ca n't even tell what kind of computer it is also , if you had or are looking into getting decals for the lid of your macbook pro , this might not be the case for you , things like that wont really show up under black i wish speck made a the color of where the apple logo is clear so it shines through brighter instead of making the whole things black , but i knew this before i bought it over all , its a pretty good buy
so i read a lot of reviews before buying this thing most of them are good and so far i have to agree # -rrb- arrived fast # -rrb- perfect fit -lrb- although my screen 's small <unk> due to <unk> seems to have increased a tiny bit after attaching this protection case not much ! # -rrb- it does attract small hairs and more than the mac without the hard case not like a magnet though as other people say not that bad at all # -rrb- the item being a clear see thru thingy i did n't even take into consideration that my mac , which i bring where ever i go , <unk> a little weight with the hard case on the other hand that mean that the shield actually have some build quality so it 's not a complaint - just info for you guys that have n't bought it yet so far i 'm pleased
the purple is a very rich dark purple - darker than i expected i like it though it 's not `` girlie `` like some of the other colors because it 's so dark , it shows finger prints and smudges much more than my aqua cover
this is an excellent case it goes on very easily and it is visibly sturdy it did n't surprise me much , as i 've got a speck ipod case that is fantastic as well however , you may experience some overheating , but it seems that it will take a few hours of straight use i brought it to work today and everything was fine until near the end of my day when the fans on my computer started crying `` help i 'm <unk> ! so , now i 'm on the look for a laptop fan
i love my new case ! it -lrb- along with a new battery and snow leopard -rrb- makes me feel like i have a new computer ! i love the color it was very easy to put on -lrb- i watched a video -rrb- glad i could find one for my older macbook pro
purchased this for my wife 's macbook pro fits snug , well constructed , and retains macbook 's streamlined appearance no cons other than added weight , which is minimal definitely recommend this product for consistent scratch protection and good looks
the case works very well snaps on easy and protects the laptop without covering ports it does add some weight to the mac but it doesnt bother me just make sure you know that this case is for the older mac versions not the ones with the black keyboards
the cover is awesome just make sure you 're buying the right kind for the size of your laptop and for the model of it some people have covers for the newer laptops only and they are different sizes but i bought the correct one and i love it it is a little bit heavier , but its worth it to not have my laptop get scratched and banged around in my backpack i 'd recommend this product to everyone with a macbook pro
i bought this case in # and was impressed with its neat fit and protective surface it lasted for two years without a problem a few months ago , i did the <unk> and put my mac onto my car and drove away i recovered the computer from the side of the highway and expected the case to be shattered to the contrary , the case did n't even have a scratch while i lost the computer , i was very impressed with the case 's quality and its crash resistance
i have used the royal blue one on my silver keys macbook pro for # years , and it looks great , many admiring comments , and it has saved many dings and scrapes it does n't , however , last forever , and i broke off one corner with the narrow strip over the cd slot i had a lot of trouble finding this one , and am sorry that i can not get any more great colors to keep my laptop better protected the aluminum needs it , if you take it with you
was getting ready to travel and looking for a case for my macbook pro neoprene seemed the way to go when i saw the specks why get a flimsy rubber shell when for the same price there was a cool looking case that would actually protect my laptop
i purchased a case just like this the day i bought my macbook pro # . # ghz back in # i have dropped , banged , and slid my computer around everywhere this past week , a heavy blunt object fell onto my closed macbook pro it cracked my now # / # year old speck case , but did n't even put a dent or scratch on the computer i purchased this new case to replace the old , but upon removal of the old , the computer still looks like new underneath if you want to keep your macbook of any model in great condition and protected , this case will save it from the daily accidents that are inevitable
great piece , especially considering what else is still available for an aging laptop i had the v # and ultimately had to replace it as it was broken in many places after # years i came across the v # case and so i bought it hoping for a better design luckily this one is better than the version # it 's still polycarbonate and will therefore be subject to light scratching if cleaned incorrectly it 's not that more modern rubberized finish from other companies but overall its thicker than the v # and protects the laptop well i would buy it again considering the lack of options
i was on tour in <unk> , and needed a case that was going to protect my computer as i was going to record every concert we played it did a great job . my computer was safe and awesome the whole time its hard as hell to take off though
cover that protected the entire unit it was easy to put on and not hard to remove for cleaning too bad we have to cover everything -- well at least i do
i did n't originally have a case for my mbp -lrb- early # -rrb- , but as the years have gone by & my traveling has increased , i saw the need to better protect my investment i recently upgraded my ram , so there is a fair amount of life left in my beloved mbp & i wanted to make sure the rest of my laptop could last this is the perfect solution for my needs : it is clear , it fit perfectly , & it protects my mbp from normal wear & tear i am interested on how this will potentially contribute to overheating , so i will write an update after a couple of months
the case has a thin lining inside that is supposed to protect the computer there is a rivet on the outside of the case where the red string wraps around i had the case for # months now after sliding the computer in and out , the back of that rivet created a scratch on the top of my new computer i now have a sheet of paper inside the case to give it added protection the new case i ordered will better protect my expensive investment and i can then toss this envelope case in the trash
the late # macbook air barely fits into the case the snap does not close but the string does keep it closed the case is cheaply made it is simply two pieces of almost stiff leather that is sewn together on the edges it does the job but could be better
fantastic idea with a great look , but it 's not made to size for the # `` mac air the actual envelope dimensions are close to # . # `` x # . # `` i like the cloth lining ; the leather is stiff
