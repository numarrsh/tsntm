good value & fast shipping endless supply of pockets and compartments big enough for a laptop , ipad or anything else you could possibly need to carry with you to work or school , or both
excellent brief case that holds laptop computer easily and buffers it well for protection very light but very strong which helps for travel it is exactly what i was looking for , well priced , and very well made i can recommend this to you without hesitation
this laptop bag is great i bought this bag for my husband i wanted something durable and this is what my husband need it it has lot of space easily you can organize a laptop up to # inches , cell phone , wallet , keys and some others stuff excellent for someone who works in an office
we had new laptops we needed a carrying case for and also as we use them to program <unk> we carry numerous additional cables this case housed them all and although it is for # & # # ; laptops and ours are # & # # ; it holds them tight and safe inside i can recommend these for anything # to # inches in width lots of pockets for storage in a relatively non-bulky case
ca n't say enough nice things about this i was lucky enough to pick one up for around $ # - worth every penny this was a replacement for a previous -lrb- different brand -rrb- satchel professional enough for office carry , rugged enough for travel light , with lots of room and compartments
carries far more then i dreamed the # openings on the top are great carries a # inch laptop with room to spare pads on the strap make it comfortable to carry
i carry # computers with me when i travel -lrb- # & # # ; each -rrb- and surprisingly this bag , easily holds them and everything else i drag along probably the best computer bag i 've ever had and i 've had many
i pretty much work out of my car , so the trunk of my car is my office and i needed something that could carry a lot of stuff this bag was the answer it has plenty of room and compartments to hold all of my stuff build quality appears top notch so hopefully it will hold up over the long haul my only complaint is the # pen/pencil pockets are a bit on the thin side , so some mechanical pencils i have would not fit pair this up with some small pencil/pen bags to hold a lot of the little stuff , and you are good to go very happy with my purchase and i would recommend this bag to anyone who spends a lot of time working on the road
this is a great bag it fits my # . # laptop perfectly and has plenty of room for my papers and school note books the bag can get heavy and the strap is good but if carried for a long time can feel like its cutting into your shoulder but having the easy luggage slip makes up for that for the price , i could not have asked for more
this is a really nice bag , but it is # & # # ; deep , not # & # # ; deep as described on the website and on the samsonite tag with <unk> <unk> the size of the bags , this will not work as a carry-on bag despite the description that would lead you to that impression
i bought this about a month or so ago and already the suitcase is showing a defect the back pocket is a large compartment and the second back compartment is the laptop compartment i usually try to fill up the back compartment but sometimes there is a bit of space if there is any space not filled in the back compartment and you place your laptop in the second to back compartment , the laptop compartment falls underneath the back compartment and now looks <unk> in like an accordion this has to be product defect in the product i bought or if all the suitcases do this , then samsonite made a bad design i will be calling samsonite to see if i can get a replacement because my item is defective ; will hopefully get a replacement because i have had this item for a short period of time and have this issue
i bought this luggage because i really trust on samsonite products , but this is pretty bulky bag , it 's way too square , but i am using it it 's not exactly what i was looking for , it works well for papers , lap tops and tablets . i use to have a softer bag , that 's why i am a little bit disappointed but the quality is great
i would rate # due to workmanship however , it does not fit under the southwest aisle seat thus i am required to put in overhead so rating goes down also do not like the handles as they collapse down and are sometimes hard to get <unk> of
i was looking for a rolling laptop bag that would fit under the seat but this item looks to be too deep the bag is # inches deep -lrb- contrary to one of the dimensions in the item description -rrb- i think it would be difficult to fit under the seat especially if you are sitting in the back of coach class in some airlines other than that , i think the bag has a lot of good features and would actually work well as a primary carry on bag i could see myself using this for a two day cross country trip -lrb- red eye out , one overnight and return the next evening -rrb- with laptop and suit if i was only going with a tablet , i could probably do a three day trip with just this bag unfortunately , my primary <unk> for a wheeled bag was to be able to store it under the seat and this bag would be too hard to wedge between the seats of some airlines to get underneath it might even be a challenge getting it into the overhead bin of some of the regional jets i ended up returning this bag and ordered a slimmer one
i often do a quick <unk> trip and do n't need an entire suitcase in addition to my briefcase with laptop this roll-on is just what the doctor ordered it is just big enough to hold my business materials , laptop with charger and mouse , clean socks , underwear , spare shirt and toiletries plus it still fits under the airplane seat in front of you
i finally had to breakdown and return to wheels and this samsonite bag so far works great i may update this review after # months to see how it holds up over the long haul
good solid business bag with more than sufficient space i would prefer if the & # # ; <unk> & # # ; were in the middle of the bag rather than on each end that is why this is a # star rating rather than # excellent buy for the expense
this case is perfect for business travel roomy with lots of pockets makes it nice to care along all necessary items for laptop and even has room for a change of clothes if needed sturdy build makes it a much better buy than most other roller cases out there bot a cheaper one originally and it did n't last # trips before the seams started <unk> so we made the decision to spend a little more money for this case and it was worth it
i bought this to carry my laptop with me for business trips it fits under the seat in front of me and has plenty of room for files , other electronic devices and accessories it is a big plus to not have to carry it over my shoulder anymore
we have always carried a backpack with our luggage but , after checking said luggage after the last few trips , we decided on this samsonite rolling laptop and overnight bag it great as it has a ton of space for some clothes and personal electronic it 's easy to <unk> and easy to use it stores well and we have enjoyed using it
i wish the front compartment was not for files . then this would be the perfect overnight or weekend bag i am able to pack # days worth of clothes and my laptop and accessories and all my paperwork into it i have a shoulder and neck injury so the ease of the bag is very important to me yes it does fit under the seat unless you are in certain aisle seats it is an exact fit to wheel down the aisles so you have to pay attention or it catches on seats the only other thing i would change is that i cant fasten the handles together would be nice to have them velcro or snap together when traveling so you dont have to pull them together to pick up the bag and put it in the car so far this is the best business trip bag i have owned
gray bag but not as large as i thought it would be i bought it for work figuring the clothing compartment could fit the manuals i need it only fits two manuals back there after i put my computer in the computer pocket and my files in the file pocket great bag but a bit tight for my needs
i bought this for a gift he loved it except for the fact it has no shoulder strap , so i had to return it and get one with the strap sorry , samsonite , you fell one star short on this item
i bought this bag because of my bad back and my school materials are pretty heavy i like everything about this bag , the way the different compartments are laid out the material is durable and the telescopic handle is pretty tall when fully expanded which is another plus for me , i 'm pretty tall
this is the second samsonite case i 've purchased while it is very similiar to the five year old case that i had to retire - this case is lighter and has many improvements first , the case does not tip over forward - even when overloaded second , a front zippered pocket has been added that is perfectly sized for boarding passes third , the pocket and strap for the laptop is more secure - and would fit a wider laptop perhaps samsonite could design the next edition so that it unzipped completely to allow the laptop to go through airport security without being removed from the case fourth , the handle is better fifth , somehow more clothes fit into this case than the first one i owned the only strange thing - but i was <unk> by other reviewers - is there is some noisy lining and some & # # ; <unk> smell & # # ; but those are very minor to me this case will also be subjected to daily use as well as at least # flights per year , and i have high hopes that it will perform well
i was so happy with my samsonite from about # years ago i replaced it with a new one ... so what 's that tell you ? <unk> said i love it and very functional
at work we are required to take our computers back and forth to home with us every day i am finally to the point where i can not lift that much weight with files , etc . that you feel is necessary to cart around i was constantly pulling my shoulder and neck out this has been a body saver the only downside is lifting it in and out of the car but after that it is a smooth rolling and pain free experience i can put my work computer , several files , my ebook reader , my lunch box , my charger cords in this and still have room to add things good quality - zippers work smoothly i would definitely recommend
fits under airplane seats just right can pack a lot for a short trip this is the only bag i use for <unk> i do wish that there was one handle instead of two
i damaged my older laptop as i had to carry it in my backpack , so i decided to order this wheeled tote that is fits my new laptop and notebook perfectly i love this case , and highly recommend it for graduate students and professionals
i love this bag initially it 's somewhat <unk> as it 's <unk> larger than your usual laptop bag but it pulls well , is well balanced and has lots of great space the bag folds into itself if you do n't use the ` overnight ' section so it 's not so bulky i do a lot of airplane travel and it just about fits under the seat in front given the relief on my <unk> this is a great buy i do n't regret and would buy again
office on wheels spacious for a weekend get away i bought it so it can pass through as a personal item on <unk> airlines and not as a carry-on <unk> charges $ # - $ # for carry-on but personal items are free big enough to travel light
i read a lot of reviews before deciding on a bag and non of them were helpful , so i 'm try to keep this short , sweet and to the point # st of all i do not use this for traveling i use this as my everyday computer bag it is a great everyday bag , i rolled this thing everywhere and i keep it pretty full too and it has n't broken or the handle become <unk> i 've had this bag for about # months and i have no complains
i had a heavy computer bag over my shoulder at an airport when i saw one of these i got the information from the man and started my search this is great i have to use my carry-on for mandatory things i must carry with me this counts as a computer bag and carries so much more i can have a change of clothes , keeps my papers nice it 's so much better for my back and for organization than an over the shoulder computer bag just need a bungee cord to attach to my rolling carry-on so i can roll through the airport easier
i got this case for work , to take my computer back and forth , because i have back pain when carrying heavy items it works great and is just the right size it fits a lot of other stuff also , without being a bulky case
this product has exceeded my expectations in quality and functionality as an educator , it is perfect for lugging my books and files from school to home and back it is very durable and spacious ; i highly recommend it
this case was an answer to a problem i faced after knee surgery when i was n't allowed to lift anything over # lbs . i have a work laptop and associated work material that i must transport back and forth to work altogether they weigh quite a bit more than # lbs using this wheeled case allowed me to transport my laptop , etc . , without harming my knees the case is well constructed for the price i have been using it for a month now and have not a problem with it i really like the different compartments in it i can recommend this case for normal use of back and forth to an office or other workplace
just the right size to put in the overhead bins on most airlines . will hold clothes , paperwork , computer has a long handle making it easy to pull along also it is very lightweight when empty worth every $ $ !
i bought this for my husband , who has to lug a laptop plus equipment around with him every day to and from work his old bag went over the shoulder , and it was causing him back and shoulder pain this wheeled bag is great - everything he needs to carry fits perfectly , and being able to roll it is saving him all sorts of money on aspirin
this is perfect for me to take out when i am on reviews it accomodates and organizes my computer , files , notebooks , and assorted office tools -lrb- <unk> , pens , pencils , etc . -rrb- sturdy and easy to use
so far i love it ! my main concern was whether it would fit in the overhead compartment of a crj regional jet and it passed that test with flying colors ! i did have to carry it down the aisle but there 's only # rows on a crj even if you 're at the very back it carries everything my backpack had in it , everything is easily accessable , it stands upright when not holding the handle , and my shoulder will no longer be sore seems to be good quality we 'll see how long it lasts but i 'm already convinced i 'd buy another one in a heartbeat oh ya , the price was fantastic too
samsonite 's wonderful quality with heavy duty zippers that all work very smoothly holds an amazing amount of stuff in a compact bag have not used in on a plane yet to see if it really fits under the seat , but i 'm hoping
purchased this to replace an older swissgear bag although the swissgear bag has more volume i can still put all of my necessary computer gear and files into this case the roller blade wheels make it really quiet and easy to roll the exterior and interior are well constructed with seemingly durable materials there are several pockets to hold all of the miscellaneous things i need to carry great bag overall - excellent value also
samsonite # . # -inch classic wheeled business case -lrb- # -rrb- very well padded to give your laptop excellent protection very roomy for packing for an <unk> stay i wish the wheels were the kind that you can role along beside you i think its 's a good purchase never been disappointed with anything i have ordered through amazon
i really love the wheeled business case makes my job of carrying heavy work documents much easier on me i received it in good condition and within a few days of ordering i 've recommended it to my co-workers
well , i 'm a fussy computer bag shopper and this one fits the bill fits my toshiba pc perfectly roomy , lots of pockets , <unk> of storage space - and its a samsonite great bang for your buck
this is the fourth samsonite briefcase i have owned over the last twenty five years this bag has plenty of pockets and plenty of room it is replacing the briefcase that i have been very hard on it has more room that i need on a daily basis but all the extra room will come in handy for my next trip
i bought this as a gift for my son , an engineer he found his laptop case was getting heavier and heavier with things he needed for business trips this was perfect for him and all of his work related items ... and it has enough room for a few overnight items in case he gets stuck somewhere unexpectedly
hi i got the samsonite <unk> case and its just perfect , it does have alot of pocket inside , and a lot of space to put <unk> you want it is strong so its a good case
i travel a lot and this is perfect for a carry on for longer trips it carries essentials but for a shorter trip , it is all i use it is lightweight and moves easily i would definitely recommend it for any type of traveler
bought it as a birthday gift for my dad , he is been using it for over # months and loves it keeps all his documents neatly organized it also wheels to perfection
this product is amazing i travel quite often and was hauling # briefcases with books / laptop i read the reviews on several cases and was <unk> by the strength of the wheels after reading the reviews on this case , i decided to order it is sturdy , the wheels move easily , it holds several thick textbooks and a macbook in addition , the front pockets hold quite a bit of additional items i would highly recommend this item
this is a nice find i was looking for a bag that would fill the space under the seat in front of me , and this does the trick there is ample room inside for your laptop and notebook and a pair of shoes , a shirt , pants , and underwear my goal is to be able to travel everywhere using carry-on baggage only , even on regional jets so far , this has worked on <unk> # and <unk> # / # series aircraft paired with small duffel that goes in the overheads of even the smallest jets , this makes for a perfect piece of luggage
i have had this bag for year and during this time the shoulder strap has come unclipped from the bag numerous times i have done nothing to cause this it finally came unclipped as i was removing it from the car , causing the bag to land on it 's corner and break the case and power switch to my sony vaio i would not recommend this bag to anyone due to this design flaw with the strap clip
there is a hole in the bottom of one of the pockets my guess is that the stitching was n't done properly since i could find no <unk> reason for the bottom of the pocket to be partially open the pocket is unusable also , the shoulder strap keeps coming loose
i own a number of samsonite products and have been very happy with them all in the past , but this bag has been a disappointment after just a couple months usage , the bag ripped along the zipper on the top corner the rip appears caused by the strap rubbing on the bag while being carried , which seems like a significant design flaw
i bought # samsonite classic top <unk> it is indeed a nice , affordable and well designed bag however , the zippers on the bag are very weak and broke off in about # months of use each time as this happened twice already , i personally would not recommend purchasing this bag for a long term use
my # inch dell inspiron fit well in the bag the other compartments are okay and not very spacious to put clothes , toiletries or bulky stuff the worst part is that the hook comes off while carrying and this can be <unk> if the bag falls down
i do n't feel that , in spite of the brand value , this bag is worth the money protection is minimal and the materials seem consistent with those used in cheaper bags it looks professional but is perhaps wider than it needs to be , even for # & # # ; and that makes it look awkward when carrying it
this is the type of bag i was looking for it 's sturdy - big enough for a laptop , files and other work materials unfortunately , one of the hardware clips where the strap attaches to the bag broke the day after i got it it 's still functional there is a hook , but the piece of hardware does n't close i would 've returned the bag but i really needed it and it looks like the hardware clip just needs a small screw to be whole again otherwise , the bag is great
it is a good quality bag , fits my pc and tablet very well also includes other zippered pouches and a pouch for papers the shoulder strap is comfortable and the bag sits well when on my shoulder the handles are also comfortable the main downside is that the pouches do not open far enough the main pouch for the laptop contains a lot of good areas within in to keep items , but because the zippers do n't open down the sides , it is difficult to get to them and use them
nice bag for the price however if you are a heavy user you will get about a year of use out of it strap started ripping away from the bag about a month ago and i now have to purchase a new bag thinking of spending the money and trying a tumi
the <unk> time i used it the strap came off and the bag almost went bouncing down the stars luckily i caught it not much longer it came off again it 's a design flaw in how the strap hooks to the bag the bag itself seems to be well constructed with a good design and is larger than i thought it was going to be it 'll work fine if you replace the strap i just carry it by the handle
this is a good sturdy light weight briefcase at a reasonable price i gave it a # for utility and had it been a little more attractive , it would get a # i could not find anything comparable in a local store
very nice well built case the material is very tough and has an extremely durable feel the construction is very well done with heavy zippers , good pockets and nice handles the only draw back to this back is that the front pocket is hard to get into it only opens on the top and does not leave a lot of room to get your hand into the inside of the pocket works very well and has good compartments this carries a laptop very well and i would buy from samsonite again
very good quality piece , well constructed and filled the need for me i carry my office with me and needed somewhere to stash notebooks , planner , pens , camera , etc . this bag is perfect for that only issue i have is that if it is fully loaded , it tends to fall on it 's side when you place it on the floor or a table price was good for quality received i would recommend this bag to anyone needing a safe , sturdy way to transport things
this product is great it really suits my daily activities which <unk> constantly moving around a large laptop , ipad and <unk> and there is still plenty of room the bag has loads of little pockets for <unk> your different items i feel that this item would suit anyone with busy life style
bought this for my fianc & eacute ; who travels into the city for work he loves it and i like the way it stores his laptop and much more worth the money and came quick
it is light and has enough room for the many items that i usually carry i would have liked it better if there is a pocket or space for a water bottle or thermos , and a space for an umbrella on the whole , i am happy with the bag
i bought this item some months ago this year , today it looks like new , sometimes the strap <unk> from the side but does n't happen that often that 's why i do n't give it a # star but the material is resistant , my husband loved it , i recommend it for business man that want to look very professional and are carrying a couple of work items with them
i have no complains whatsoever regarding bag itself only a bit disappointed because i did actually believed to those who said that # . # laptops fit into the bag well may be some really slim ones do but asus rog is not one of them the very top of it is barely covered and you need to apply some force to actually close the zipper over it it stretches the bag awkwardly and i am not sure it will last long that way so be aware whoever is getting it for asus gamer republic models mine is asus rog # inch and it does not fit
being a samsonite you expect it to be good and it is it is well made , has good storage , and is easy to find things in it with the silver lining why manufacturers have black internal linings - when typically your gear is black making it hard to see things is - a mystery a can find my black wallet , black bluetooth headset , black pens , black hard drive etc easily with a quick look before i head out the door interior size and pockets are very good the downside ... a key ring holder would be nice inside the large zip pocket holding pens etc . a wider shoulder strap would be nice too -lrb- where it rests on your shoulder -rrb- great value for money though for usd #
our son-in-law to be is very happy with the quality and design of this computer bag , which was given as a birthday gift recently the purchase and delivery to his address went without a problem it feels good to have given him something he wanted and uses with pleasure
this bag is great it has many compartments that work very well for frequent travelers i would recommend it to anyone that does a lot of traveling the slip over feature makes it great to slip on your roller bags
the bag is well built the computer compartment is a little snug but it definitely fits my huge laptop the large front pocket is a little difficult to get in to sometimes but that 's not much of a downfall for this bag
everything is good about it it seems durable , comfortable to wear , and has a good amount of pockets my only complaint is that it is not as spacious as i thought once you put a laptop inside otherwise it 's great
bag is nice everything fits nicely quite a few pockets to keep things separated one pocket has pencil , calculator , pen , etc . slots shipping was a few days late though
similar to my older kenneth cole model pockets are a little tighter i can fit lots of gadgets in the pockets in the compartment where the notebook fits it would help if the zippers for the main compartments went further down the sides to open up easier still it is light weight and holds everything i need for business travel
quality case for organizing a larger laptop pockets for everything the metal hardware is a real plus over the plastic ones offered on many other cases of this price range i do wish the gussets were a bit wider for easier access
seems very rugged , have used it for a month and a half and no problems very well padded with more than enough pockets and compartments zippers are metal and durable , would recommend to all
this bag was exactly what was described i was hoping it would be just fat enough to stand up on its own when i set it down , and it was n't & # # ; but who cares it seems sturdy , and i expect it to last for years
this is a very practical , spacious and smart bag i use it to carry a lot of documents along with me and it still has enough space for a large laptop the finish is great and it looks sturdy enough to survive for a long long time
although it is a bag of large nylon cloth , it is a place with a very light easy-to-use sufficient thing the metal fittings which fix a strap to a main part may also separate suddenly , and i think that i will exchange for a precise thing if a thing is put into the fastener carelessly fixed to a cart , and a portion without a bottom , since it will naturally drop , <unk> are required
lots of pockets and very lightweight my work computer came with a dell bag it is larger and heavier this bag is much smaller and holds more than i need to carry
this is a well made laptop bag sturdy construction and lots of space unfortunately it was not big enough for my m # x alienware laptop i would have given this item # stars but even though i used the given measurements to make sure laptop would fit it would not zip closed
i have a <unk> sized # . # & # # ; hp laptop and it just barely fits in this bag there are plenty of side pockets but they do n't open very far so thick things do n't fit inside them too easily with the laptop , cord , and power brick jammed into this thing there is n't really room for much else one nice thing is that the shoulder strap detaches easily
i got this to replace my last samsonite bag it 's just what i needed with a great amount of space for how light it is my only addition would be to give it a wire frame bit you really ca n't beat the quality for this price
i read all the reviews and looked on other websites for the best laptop case for a # . # dell inspiron this one fits my laptop perfectly the padding is enough to prevent damage from banging against a hard surface there is enough room in the other compartment to put a cell phone , pens , notebook and reference materials i do not need the case for everyday use only once a week when i take the laptop to my writer 's club it is not heavy to carry and i do not use the shoulder strap since a medical condition prohibits doing so i can not comment on extended use since i have only had the bag for a week i will update comments later if i find any defects or problems after a couple of months so far , it is what i wanted and fits my needs would recommend this bag
very classy laptop case it does both jobs ; keeps the laptop safe and also looks very nice when your walking down # th <unk> in nyc with this bag it fits the suit dress and tie
this samsonite case is precision made and well thought out it has plenty of compartments for personal needs as well as business needs , including your mobile device -lrb- s -rrb- every zipper is sewn & # # ; spot-on & # # ; and moves with ease and speed no struggling with zippers whatsoever the handles are comfortable to carry it by , or you can use the removable shoulder strap i love the strong nylon fabric it is stronger than leather , lighter than leather , more <unk> than leather , and does n't immediately begin to look worn out like leather i 've owned mine for three months now , and with regular use it handles perfectly and looks completely new
at first , my husband did n't like this bag however , after he switched all of his files and computer to this bag , he now loves it i would definitely recommend it for anyone who has a laptop computer it has the slot that allow you to attach it to your carry-on bag so , it can ride on top without falling off
i 've been looking like a product like this for a long time the two main compartments have plenty of room i was able to store my laptop and charger in one side and all of my papers in the other with room to spare the side compartments offer some space for small gadgets , writing utensils , usb sticks , etc . the case is lightweight and durable , and sat well on my shoulder as far as i can tell it is waterproof and , despite heavy usage for half a year , does n't look any worse than the day i got it i ca n't recommend this product highly enough i love mine
i just got this bag to lug my relatively large work laptop -lrb- hp pavilion g # cl - # in screen -rrb- back and forth to work everyday it has been perfect for this use , but it also is very well constructed for more heavy duty travel for the price , it 's really good choice for every day use , business travel , or both the pocket to fit the computer into is plenty big enough for my laptop , and there is another full pocket area for notebooks or other items there are also a couple addition zipper pockets overall , i just think it 's simple , does the job as intended , and is very well made -lrb- <unk> ... it 's a samsonite -rrb- , so it 's going to last
it is a very good choice if you have a # ' laptop and a lot of gadgets it can easily fit my msi ge # , a slim keyboard and a # ' tablet not quite sure if the hinges are from plastic or metal
i just bought a # inch laptop and needed a new bag to protect and carry it in i love it this product is high quality and i would recommend it to anyone i 've had the smaller version of this bag for years and it still holds my old laptop and is still in great condition i love all the compartments
so far so good my husband had been using this briefcase for # weeks and i have not heard any complaints there seems to be ample space for his lab top and files the briefcase seems to be just the right size
i am a <unk> and play mostly contemporary music a lot of <unk> , especially with <unk> , are # size , and they fit in here well the corners sometimes get a little bent up , but that happens when i turn the pages anyway as long as they have sturdy backing , they fit great it is durable and has worked quite well for me so far
i purchased this bag for my husband because he 's been hauling around heavy leather attaches for years when the bag itself weighs # to # pounds before you even add your paperwork , it 's hell on your shoulder this bag is strong but light and carries as much as all of my husband 's previous bags , and he loves it
i love - love - love this bag i was worried it might not fit my # . # & # # ; computer but in actuality it fits two that size with room left for all my other important gadgets / papers it looks smart as well i highly recommend this bag
i paid $ # . and change for this including shipping -lrb- i want next day delivery $ # -rrb- i would have paid $ # . # for this bag . so many pockets , easy to get to them a lot of space i work in a hospital so this is perfect for me i am very happy i would recommend this anytime its a great buy
well built and holds a # & # # ; laptop plus it has a section for holding files and a nice , organized picket to hold pens , pencils , business cards and more it 's a great bag that will fit your needs , especially if you are traveling
