this is a very nice looking case i purchased it to carry my # & # # ; macbook pro i liked that it had a front pocket to house the <unk> cord the problem with this case is that it barely fits the macbook # & # # ; once i snapped on a hard shell protective case it no longer would zip up a smaller notebook or a tablet would fit easily and for the price would be a good choice i will look for something larger for mine
the design and material are great , but the only big problem is that it is super small and compact the zippers almost scratch yr mac everytime you zip it up wish it would have came with a little more room
was n't the right size but it wil do . my laptop is a # inch , but the case barely hold the top , little too big i do like the side pocket for cords and storage of by detached cd/dvd drive
my air and tablet never were so happy there is just enough protection as well as room for mail , misc small objects very handy and a great value from amazon
i bought this case for use with a # . # `` late- # macbook air i believe the case was designed for a mbp as well it fits the mba pretty well , although it just seems like it is looking for a little more thickness in the chassis when fastened in the straps for use in the case nevertheless , it works well , and seems to offer great protection for the laptop , which is something i have had a hard time finding in a case made to fit the # . # `` mba one word of warning - it is definitely designed more for women - none of my male users were interested in carrying it around with them :
this case seems protective and well made the outside pocket is handy , but would be better if it could more easily hold the charger and cord when not in use , such as when traveling
i have a # & # # ; dell it does what is expected hold and protect my product the front pocket holds the charger i love the the <unk> of it it is not big and clunky
used it for my macbook pro # inch -lrb- # non-retina -rrb- this is a very tight case so i would not recommend using it for the bigger mac book pro like what i did but i managed to still zip it up if you would like to use it i think it would be perfect for the retina or macbook air the pouch in front is also very useful i was able to fit my power plug , mouse , hard drive , and other stuff
i use this for my # & # # ; dell laptop it fits great the power supply , mouse , and a usb cord with phone charger will fit in the small pocket there is no extra room for things so if you want to carry more things , buy a larger case
love it , extra nice since i do n't have to take my computer out of the case when going through security when i travel which is often i would only add one more handy item to the case if i could ; an additional handle for the shoulder
great carrying case for my mac book pro has a storage pouch for the cord and plugs on back just make sure you do n't keep both cords and adapter in the pouch when the mac book is in use the weight of the full adapter in the zippered storage case on the back , tends to weigh enough to pull the screen portion of the mac book backwards but , this product offers very good protection , and ease of use
just got my casecrown case for my toshiba portege r # , and it is great the laptop slides right in for a good snug fit , and the front pocket is just the right size for my power adapter from the pictures , i was n't too sure about the thickness of the memory foam , but it 's about on par with any of the other neoprene cases i 've used in the past would have been nice if it was a little bit thicker , but i do enjoy the slim profile of the case and how i can just throw it into my backpack the checkered pattern adds a dash of style compared to the solid black of other cases i also liked how you can secure a lock to the zipper of the main pocket , very nice touch my only nitpick would be the smell of the memory foam when you first open the package you just need to air it out for a few hours , it 's not a big deal all in all , a great case for my toshiba r #
you never have to take your computer out of the case because it has clear tabs to hold the top of the computer to the top of the case there is also a large enough outside pocket to hold the charger plus not too heavy or bulky but still provides protection for the # & # # ; mac pro stylish without being in your face
i read the review and thought `` i can give it a shot `` i wanted something light weight and easy to travel with i was extremely happy when i received my case it is made of durable material , the computer fits in the case perfectly and the front pocket holds the charger and even a foldable keyboard as i sometimes need a different keyboard for certain programs still has room for a mouse too if your looking for something portable , durable and easily <unk> -lrb- you only have to open and go , no need to remove the entire computer from the case this gets # + starts from me ! ! !
this case is just what i was looking for ! my mac book pro # `` fits just right the outside pocket is great for cord i never have to remove my mac book pro from protective case to use or charge i am very satisfied with this laptop case
perfect size for the # inch macbook , with a large expandable accessory pocket that will hold the power cord/adapter , plus more on the aesthetic side , it has a great subtle pattern , and i 'm confident that it would protect my laptop from all but the most disastrous of impacts i searched for a long time before i settled on this product , and it was worth the work
fit my apple macbookpro # inch notebook exactly i was able to fit the cords and mouse in the front pocket not much room to fit anything else the quality is very good and strong material to protect the laptop i am very satisfied with the product as i do n't really need to carry anything else in the case except for the obvious - laptop , cords and mouse
i really like this case and it fits my macpro really well what i really like about it is how i do not have to keep taking my macbook in and out of a case whenever i want to use it i can just unzip this case and begin using the computer easy and compact to carry
i purchased this case for my # inch mac book pro and it fits perfectly this is one of the few cases that also has handles and a roomy front pocket for the cord it 's has a nice look , is n't bulky , and provides a good amount of padding for the computer it also has straps on the inside to hold the computer in the case while it sits on your lap all in all , i 'm very happy with it and would buy it again
this small case just fits my macbook pro # inch so it packs in minimal space what i did n't expect was the ability to run the computer in the case to use i just open the case and the computer keyboard is there and so is everything i need to <unk> with this works great for short uses , but if i 'm doing a long project i find it better to remove the case to prevent heat buildup -- i can tell by the increased noise from the fans
i was n't sure what type of case to get for my # `` macbook pro so i started doing research and reading reviews this case is like a <unk> <unk> for your computer i had a little trouble figuring out how it works and my boyfriend made fun of me and did it for me i was actually going to return it because i felt it did n't fit you have to open the computer to put the case on and then it stays on as a protective cover with cushioning i wish it had a carry on strap so i could put it over my shoulder rather than carry it in my hands but that would be my only complaint i used it to travel and i use it around my house i have no trouble charging or hooking anything up to the computer because all the connections are exposed even with the laptop closed i 'd definitely suggest this for any macbook user . :
the case fits my apple mac air # `` perfectly since putting the mac into the case , i have never had to remove it to use the mac or charge it i have not had any drop accidents but i feel if i did the case would protect my investment the outside storage compartment is perfect for storing the charging cable & ac adaptor all in all , a great case
i bought this as a gift i was unsure if my wife would like it for her macbook air i was delighted how much she loves it , how well it is made , and how great it looks a really nice product
i love the design of this case unlike many cases , it allows you to use the computer while still in the case it 's slim and easy to carry it 's pretty small ; the laptop fits perfectly and the side zip pocket will hold the charger fine great price and just as good as the $ # + incase
this case is small , light , and contains a pocket to store your ac adapter , cables , usb drives , etc . it 's far more useful than those sleeves the quality is also excellent , do n't be fooled by the $ # price , it 's a great case i do not think there is a better and more practical case if you have a macbook air i also tried a macbook pro inside this case , and while it fits , it 's a bit tight this case is better suited for the mba
i ordered this case a while back after much <unk> i have to say this did not disappoint it 's exactly as described and the double memory foam keeps my air nice and safe i also love the front pocket which fits the power cord and portable external hd so if you 're in the market for a cute and durable case for your air , this is the way to go ** note . . when you originally open the package there is a slight smell to the case i would recommend airing it out for a few days prior to use
i purchased this case for my macbook pro # & # # ; and it fit perfect ! ! ! ! i even have a cover on it to protect the outside of it and it was still a perfect fit ! ! i highly recommend this product for a <unk> , sexy laptop carrier
i love it handbag came # days earlier , this laptop bag is perfect for my macbook air # the bag have is a holder for a laptop , a pocket for the charger , a very beautiful and great quality i advise everyone excellent protection for your laptop
i did , and the fabric , which is a beautiful coarse weave , came apart at the seams in a couple of places the pack is smaller than it looked to me when i ordered it one other issue is that the side pockets are n't large enough to hold anything useful -lrb- like a small water bottle or compact umbrella .
i wanted a smaller pack for general items the size and color are perfect , but i think there are too many pockets weird , i know , but it <unk> the shape of the inside if you do n't put things in just right
i think this backpack is well design for the sport or busy girl b/c of its many compartments when i got it , i started moving my things over to this bag and i could not fit everything in this bag when i looked more closely , i saw that the bottom of the bag was not wide enough and i could not carry my water bottle in it i brought this bag to replace the mini backpack i already have , but i think i will probably just buy a new one of my old backpack it 's the same size as the ful bag if the bottom was wider in width , i would keep it , but it did n't fit my needs i really like the design of the comfy straps and the many compartments as well as the zipper in the straps
i wish it came in more than pink -lrb- light and dark -rrb- which is why i give it # out of # stars i 've owned one for # years and it 's held up very well with daily use i 'm in the market for a new mini pack and none i 've come across compare to this one it 's very roomy , has lots of pockets and is overall a great mini backpack guess i 'm going to like pink the other one i purchased to replace my ful does n't come close to this one
i purchased this pack for a trip to orlando -lrb- full week of theme parks -rrb- the size was perfect for all my essentials with lots of great pockets the larger pocket could easily fit # oz water bottles -lrb- a must in the heat and <unk> -rrb- and the padded straps were very comfortable the only problem i had with it -lrb- besides lack of color choices -rrb- was that the right strap has a small pocket that i used to keep a small bottle of roll-on perfume the fabric of this one pocket is less durable than the rest of the bag and within a few days a hole formed where the perfume bottle rubbed against the pocket other than that , great product , worth the price . . perfect size was easy to either take on rides or <unk> stow in <unk> -lrb- required by some universal orlando rides -rrb-
big enough for the essentials -lrb- wallet , keys , camera , phone , kindle -rrb- , but not too big that it becomes cumbersome or bulky i love all the different pockets to keep organized big enough for my camelbak # oz water bottle i look forward to using this i purchased it specifically for travel , but i think it will be beneficial for hiking and any excursions where a purse may be slightly smaller than necessary or inconvenient to carry on a shoulder
i use this thing every day it carries anything you and pack into it it 's durable , has a lot of pockets , tough zippers , a surprising amount of storage , it is on the smaller side , and it obviously light the straps are easy to adjust , but will stay in the position you choose without loosening there is also a pocket on the right shoulder strap just big enough to hold some <unk> <unk> phone the straps are padded , as is the backside of the backpack tough stitching as well excellent for travel
i purchsed this as a result of reading other reviews i am extremely pleased with the price , quality and size it is as advertised and if you are looking for a small backpack that will work as a <unk> carryon for your next flight -- this is the one ! !
i got this backpack to downsize the load i carry everywhere it works great i can get just enough stuff into it to survive -- snacks , book , calendar , checkbook , etc . one of the greatest things is although it 's black on the outside it 's white inside , allowing me to actually see things inside it
i absolutely love this item ! i 'm a backpack instead of purse chic and this is the perfect size with more than enough pockets as well as very sturdy ! could n't be more satisfied with this purchase :
this was exactly what i was looking for i 'm not a purse girl , i prefer backpacks that are stylish and comfy this bag is made to last , is the perfect size , and very cute i have been looking for something like this for awhile
you can find lots of `` cute `` little backpacks that are poorly constructed , meant to last only a season before <unk> them i was surprised at how very well made this little backpack is i foresee using it for years to come it is also well-designed with many <unk> exterior and interior pockets , and a clip for keys it is the perfect <unk> for girls who do n't do purses i wish i could find it in other colors , so i could have one for fall/winter and the pink for <unk> the hot pink is a bit jarring for winter use this little bag , especially for the price , is a very pleasant surprise
durable , sturdy fabric that is made with quality stitching multiple pockets can easily store small items the ipad does fit in the larger compartment with room to spare for your cell phone , keys , etc . one day at the <unk> we were able to store # adult and # child size <unk> in this pack -lrb- with a water bottle , too -rrb-
i wanted a small backpack for my kindle fire , a small journal , and misc . booklets and papers this backpack exceeded my expectations the materials and workmanship are of good to high quality the straps are easily adjustable and truly designed for an adult i fit everything i want to carry and and still have unused pockets and room for more
my wife and i used these bags daily while on vacation in san francisco to carry cameras , maps , sunglasses books , etc . the bags are a perfect size , not to large and not to small the bag construction is excellent and at the end of two weeks of daily use the bags show no signs of wear the straps are comfortable and the compartments easily accessible this is an excellent product
i absolutely love this case for my little laptop it 's fun and always gets a lot of attention especially at airports , where everybody always just have black , boring ones it 's nice and soft and definately protects the computer i can fit all the necessary cords , mouse etc in the side pocket
my wife just loves this this arrived much more quickly than promised and is just beautiful after being very <unk> with the cases available at many retailers , she decided to look online and found this the only difficulty was deciding between the light and the `` <unk> `` pink she has a white acer # . # inch for travel , and this is perfect
this case goes perfect with the pink acer aspire one netbook that i purchased i have had the both of them about a month but i get so many compliments when i take them both out to use people just ca n't believe my computer matches the bag they call it the `` diva `` computer
i just love this hot pink case it has great padding and the front pocket is perfect for the charger i also keep headphones and a usb thumb drive in the case as well it was a little more money than what i wanted to spend on a case but so worth it i think the color is my favorite part it is very sturdy as well and feels light when using the shoulder strap
i just received my new `` hot pink `` case for my brand new pink acer aspire i have the # cell battery and it fits nicely the front pocket holds the battery cords i had been looking everywhere for a girly case for my pink mini laptop i suppose i could 've gotten the <unk> pink one but i decided to go over the top , and glad i did this case is perfect for anyone who loves pink i got ta laugh everytime i look at it these just became available mar # th
the case itself is about what you 'd expect for $ # , not great , but acceptable however , the lock is completely useless you can easily force it open , even with a slight bump , regardless of which number the lock is set to and when the latch is closed , the <unk> are almost impossible to to turn bottom line - it was a waste of money
this case appears to be slender in size , but once i received it , it was very <unk> i gave it away simply because it would cost more to ship it back . : -
the case is decent , but i do n't imagine it holding up for too long i got it and it looks sleek , but it is not as sturdy as it looks you can easily bend the cases side with a finger or two the case also scratches very easily and after sitting in my car during the day the casing started to bubble a bit overall it will work for my purposes , but do n't expect it to maintain its sleek look for what it is i think it should have been a little cheaper
the pros : very sleek design , soft and compactly shaped but has enough storage for a laptop , power cord , wallet , phone and even a small lunch box of the right shape the handle has held up for frequent use and not giving way . <unk> con : after a year , the fibers along both straps are giving way so i have white frayed bag straps - very unsightly for a professional laptop bag i am wondering if i can get some clever strap covers that could also look professional <unk> that i may have to stop taking this to work , it looks quite frayed at the handles i am usually very careful with my things so it may not be due to misuse
the case barely fits around the netbook and when the case is open the netbook slides around because the straps are loose the pocket in the front is extremly tiny , i have a small portable mouse and the power cord in the pocket and it barely closes i bought it for the price and it does it 's job but i probably would n't buy this product again if i were looking for a new case
i am glad i purchased this case i feel that my computer is safe inside this case i like the extra pocket on the front i can put my cord and a small mouse and use as i need it i 've been looking for a case with stability and with a pocket for extra computer stuff . good idea
... if you 're looking for something more , like extra room for a charger , ect , look somewhere <unk> the only <unk> i have is that the inside plastic that holds the netbook in place is a little hard to deal with
i have the exact model this case is designated for but it does not fit the top portion of the case is too big which causes it to bend outwards when picked up or touched the wrong way everything also feels like it will snap off at any given moment do not buy
i so wanted this case to be awesome first of all , it 's not exactly clear , it was more like frosty and it covered the apple logo so i could barely see the glow from the apple when the case is on , you ca n't open the monitor all the way because it stops where the back of the case clips to the macbook the clips on the side were not flush with the laptop and therefore , when you brushed your wrists past it , it would scratch you also , pain the rear to take off dang clips left a scratch on the aluminum =
this is a cover with poor quality ! ! ! could you please let me know how cleaning ? ? ? ? ? ? i buy in may and until today i can find the way to cleaned up
this case is fine for what it is it 's cheap and it protects your computer , period but there are a number of drawbacks - somewhat <unk> safe adapter is prevented from being seated properly due to the case <unk> translucent than clear in <unk> fit in some places , which allows dust to build ... and most <unk> - it only took # months for the built-in feet -lrb- that prop up the macbook pro when extended -rrb- to break off during normal use if you 're ok buying replacement cases every # months to remedy the feet situation , than this is the case for you otherwise , i 'd recommending spending a little more and invest in a better -lrb- and more stylish -rrb- case without extending feet *** update # / # - the company says they will send replacement <unk> for free , if in warranty or for a small fee if out of warranty beats having to buy a whole new case every # months
the cover snaps easily onto the laptop and fits nearly perfect it should provide the level of protection similar to that of the more expensive speck see-thru hardshell , or even better because the plastic is probably twice as thick the cover gives you full access to all ports and slots and fits the newer magsafe plug having said that , there are a few things i could live without , such as engraved lines , which make the cover look cheaper , and the laptop 's substantially increased weight with the cover on there are also retractable feet , which feel rather flimsy and seem to be prone to breaking what makes the feet even more irrelevant is that the cover prevents the lid from opening all the way , which is my only major complaint it is <unk> noticeable even when the macbook sits on the desk , and gets extremely annoying when you place it on your lap -lrb- and that 's what laptops were for last time i checked -rrb- in my opinion , the <unk> viewing angle is a serious flaw in design this is what makes me give three stars to otherwise a very nice product the bottom line : for $ # and free shipping , it 's a good deal if you do n't mind that your lappy wo n't open as wide as it used to
so as much as i love this case , i have to give it three stars this is my second case , and i just decided to write a review after the second one broke both times i 've had to replace this case have been due to the feet breaking off , so i think the cases last me about six months each as a college student , i do travel with my laptop very often , so the feet on this case get used almost every day the only question now is it is worth buying a new one , investing in a better one , or just living without the feet if you 're not traveling a lot with your macbook pro , i would n't worry too much about the feet breaking off too fast i still really like this case but it has its <unk>
it fits fine but the only annoying thing about it is that the upper cover bulges out and leaves a hollow space between the cover and the laptop otherwise it 's fine
case is as stated very basic installation bottom of case is nice since it gives you the option to raise the back of the computer higher than the front , which is good for cooling the top of the case however does n't sit flush with the top of the the computer it raises slightly off the computer which allows dust and junk to get inside overall does what i bought it for which is protect my over priced computer
i bought mcover based on price . the item do what is say it wraps up your mbp , it <unk> of # parts . the bottom part is excellent well ventilated with legs too no more damaged hard drives from over <unk> top part is <unk> that is why i gave it # stars it is not well <unk> so when you look to my mbp it got bulge is it the shipping which cause this dome ? i will read other reviews to know if i am the only one got this issue in the mean time i will contact the company looking for replacement of the top part
the case is exactly as it appears and was very easy to install however if you have a newer model with the horizontal plug then you will have problems getting the ac adapter cord to fit properly you can make it work but after a couple of weeks my husband decided that it was too much trouble trying not to move or accidentally knock it out hopefully they will fix this glitch ; then it would be a great buy
only thing i do n't like is that on the top cover there are <unk> bumps at each of the four corners i was planning on putting decals on the case , but am not sure how that will work also this clear case is sort of a foggy clear ; the speck clear cases are so clear and shiny but this case was way cheaper and came with a keyboard cover , which i 'm happy about the feet on the bottom case is a nice feature though , which speck cases do n't have
the bottom cover snugs in perfectly well but the top cover does n't it 's bowed out i thought the top would eventually settle down after some time but unfortunately , it did n't overall , it 's great product hope they can fix the top cover such that it will perfectly fit
the mcover hard shell case arrived as promised , the installation went flawlessly , and the cover provides the desired computer protection , all while looking good a high quality product and a very positive buying experience
the cover is great i have this one to replace one that i had on the old macbook pro i had i love how this fits it is very protective one issue is that the top is bent yes , bent in an upward fashion so dirt and dust can get underneath when i contacted them they told me to take a picture it is clear , ca n't take the pic to show what i am talking about other than that it does what it is supposed to do i would still highly recommend this product to keep your macbook looking great
the last one i bought came with a keyboard cover ... where 's the keyboard cover ? ? ? otherwise this cover performs fairly well it protects your system from minor bumps and scratches , but definitely not from a drop not sure anything that will
i 'm normally not that picky , but i just dropped a bundle on this laptop so yeah , i 'm buying something to protect the investment i considered a colored one , but i think the look of the aluminum is so <unk> , it would be a shame to cover it it 's already a shame that you cover the tactile feel of the metal i am talking about how a laptop feels , i have officially gone insane anyway , the kit comes in a bag without instructions so of course i put the top cover on upside down <unk> but that gave me the ability to appreciate how sturdy the product clips onto the back of the screen other reviewers have pointed out that the screen does n't open as much when the shells are on - i thought i had this problem to , until i. . . opened it further dunno , maybe i 'm lucky anyway , it works , it 's a good deal with prime , and now i can put <unk> stickers on my laptop and not feel like i am ruining the value of the device
very good protective case for the macbook pro this product is not clear but cloudy if you are looking for a case that shows the beauty of the macbook this is not the case for you if you are looking for a good protective case then this is the case for you -lrb- note is also comes with legs so you can prop the macbook up , very useful for typing and notebook venting
i was looking for a `` rubberized `` clear hard case for my macbook pro i was n't able to find one , despite many calling themselves that most are just satin clear plastic i chose this one because it is <unk> it has a satin finish , but once again , it is not rubberized and does n't provide a `` grip `` keeping the macbook more secure in your hands this case fits perfectly and i like the feet on the back , giving it a `` lift `` plenty of ventilation in case your laptop gets hot
great product for the price also liked that it came with a cover for my keyboard that fit better then the one i bought before definitely something you should get to protect your mac
got this cover a few weeks ago , and i like it it has these nice little feet in the bottom that you can flip out to elevate the back of the computer slightly it snaps on easily and fit perfect this is a hard shell clear plastic case and it will protect the computer well it 's really more of a functional product than a real slick looking product my husband bought a cover for his macair which looks like carbon fiber . . while it 's really cool looking , it wo n't provide the same level of protection that this hardshell case does i did also buy a keyboard cover and a cover for the palm rests and the track pad so that the whole computer is essentially protected
i have a mid # in macbook pro with a disk drive -lrb- not the retina screen -rrb- and this case snapped right into place i mostly use my computer at home , and if i travel with it i have a very protective bag , so i just needed something to keep it from getting scratches or smudges on the aluminum i 'm not sure how it would hold up in extreme conditions , but i do n't think many people are going to take their $ # macbook mountain climbing for my purposes , this case has worked fine so far i even like the little legs that raise the screen about an inch and a half and keep the bottom from getting too hot i do wish it were more clear and did n't have the <unk> thing around the top part of the cover , but that is more than can be expected for $ #
the cover fits nicely and does not draw attention to the fact your macbook pro has a cover i just do n't know if i like having a cover of any sort on my laptop so i am guessing it may go away in a month or so i am sticking it out for that time to give myself time to get used to it for what it is , however , i would definitely recommend it to someone looking for a cover
i ordered it on sunday and i received it on tuesday afternoon very fast shipping the item is very easy to install i have l shape power connector , which the maker says `` <unk> be # % compatible . `` and it is charging but if i look <unk> plastic is still getting in the way that 's why its # stars
i was looking for a case to simply protect my # `` macbook pro from fingerprints and scratches this item does the job , but the cover scratches and leaves marks easily i 'm not sure how it will look in the long run , but for now , as long as it 's protecting my laptop , i 'm fine with it i originally wanted a colored case , but got this clear one instead , i just might get a colored one too :
this cover seems great on the base on the lid , the cover does not connect well enough thus it does to not fit tightly the cover also blocks the ability to open the laptop all the way
cheap , solid case i got the clear to maintain the sleekness of the computer , like it slightly frosted ... clear easily snaps on my only gripe with this case is that the plastic digs into my wrists bc it is so hard of a plastic and i rest my wrists on the computer to type better safe than sorry though , when spending that much on a computer
i bought this product because it was more reasonably priced over the macbook covers i found on the apple website or the apple store easy to put on comes in a variety of colors too
great product , specially the feature in the back which raises the laptop up allowing cooling and also easier with the typing i found the product worth the price , especially as i carry my laptop around a lot with me , but definitely putting a cover does n't make the mac appealing to look -lrb- at least to me -rrb- but its definitely functional
its pretty awesome considering the price . the only bad thing about the case is that the stand does n't seem like it would hold up to the weight of the laptop on top of that , the pressure on the laptop when typing . but all in all its good
this is a great way to keep your new macbook pro from scratches i had a similar one on my old macbook and it really saved it i use my mbp with a <unk> display and usually place my ipad on top to charge and store for the night before i got the hard shell case , there was a lot of friction between them i just did n't want any scratches it simply works
this is good case for the money comparable to specks and incase my reasoning for # stars on appearance is due to the fact that the top lid is warped and does n't sit right on the computer but other than that no complaints what so
my wife wanted to something to protect her new mbp # `` while retaining the good looks of the aluminum unibody we had a speck case for a older macbook but it was too expensive this easy-to-use case was just what we were looking for and it 's a much cheaper alternative it installs easily and fits perfectly - the quality is superior to speck case - and it wo n't scratch the surface we are very happy with the product
i wanted a crystal clear macbook case , but this one is a half see-through type of thing but i 'm happy with it as this material gives more durability and hand grip -lrb- it 's a little rubbery . the case itself is <unk> to normal , minor wears hopefully the leg parts on the bottom will last long since this part is the weakest part
received what i expected from this product it does prevent the screen from opening completely , and i noticed that the charger sits off of the connector a bit , but it does not affect charging at all also came with a free keyboard cover which i was not expecting
good protection for my new macbook pro fits well on # `` pro , clear cover does n't interfere with the overall aesthetic of the macbook , and it protects it against scratches ca n't say how long it will last because it seems like the grips could eventually break off , but so far so good
overall this cover is a good buy with few problems the case is made of durable plastic with plastic tabs holding it to the unibody construction however , once in a while you will have to put it back on because movement sometimes causes the bottom cover to pop off one side or the other the only other issue is that you can not open the screen past a certain point because the top cover and bottom meet and stop the screen i would buy this product again and recommend it to my friends with macbook pros
the mcover clear hard shell case is a pretty good <unk> it does what i need it to do , protect the macbook pro it installs very easily , leaves all ports open for easy access the `` fold out `` feet on the bottom is a nice feature , although one of mine just hangs down and does not snap closed kind of annoying large openings on the bottom as to not trap heat is a good feature , but i would have designed it with more holes , but smaller the larger openings leave the mbp just a bit unprotected , which could result in scratches all in all , i would say the mcover is a good choice , certainly worth the <unk>
item shipped fast and was packed neatly enjoy the cover so far it 's durable and stays on well only minor problem i 've had is that the bottom cover tends to squeak at times when holding the computer in your lap other than that , i would recommend this cover to everyone it 's also priced very fair
really like the cover protects my # `` mac perfectly and it 's easy to use i 'm always lugging my mac around the house and i 've been afraid i 'd scratch it now that i have the cover , i feel much safer carrying the mac i 'd give this a # star too except that the power cord bumps into the cover a bit but it 's still usable and you ca n't open the screen all the way not sure how long the cover will last but so far , it 's been a good protection and definitely worth the price
i found this case to be very useful . it does what it was meant to do , protect the macbook pro from scuff and scratches all the ports are accessible , and the vents and little feet stand below help keep my macbook pro from overheating the best part is that i can place stickers or paint designs on it without putting it on directly on the macbook surface at all the only downside for me is the feet stand mine had broken off and there 's no way for me to find a replacement to put back to keep it up again if they made this part a bit more durable i 'd give them a full five stars
using this on my laptop as i am typing the review for the money you ca n't beat it keeps my computer safe the included keyboard cover is not very functional just annoying but the case is great
i bought both the clear and the black cases i love them both and the price was right the clear came with a keyboard cover but my black case did n't come with one i 'm not sure if it was supposed to or not but honestly i do n't use the cover anyway so no big deal i love how the feet pop out on the bottom i use it often unless it 's on my lap as far as looks i personally like the clear one better than the black i 've seen other black cases that may look a little bit better than my black case but the price is better for this one great buy i would def recommend
this product does what it is supposed to it was easy to install and protects the aluminum body of my macbook pro i would strongly encourage anyone looking for a little extra protection for their mbp to buy this it 's inexpensive and works , just like my mac
i saw the mcover on a co-worker 's macbook and i knew instantly that i wanted one it is nearly perfect for my use i wanted a shell that was clear - because i do n't want to hide my macbook - and that would help keep the macbook tilted slightly the mcover delivers and is affordable
i bought once for my wife 's new mac book pro and she loved it so much i got one too works well and definitely protects the keyboard from coffee and crumbs she 's just about worn hers out in fact and not one complaint , ever
