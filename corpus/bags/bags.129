this thing worked like a charm we used it to lug around our portable dvd player on a monster road trip from ohio to florida it has a unique hanging system that is easy to put up so that <unk> in the backseat can watch movies it held tight and never slipped as it was hanging between the driver and passenger seats my only critical critique is that it 's a little hard to plug power cables and headphone jacks into the sides we have an # . # `` player -lrb- this fits up to # `` -rrb- which made for a <unk> squeeze to put those components in it 's also tough to change dvd if you are in the front seat and your kids do n't know how to work <unk> up or down the device while sitting in the back <unk> fallen asleep but if they are <unk> and old enough teach them how to do it and you will be just fine
we 're always impressed with case logic cases our sony # ' portable dvd player -lrb- and power cord and dvd folder -rrb- fits perfectly the suspension system works ok , but it is really uncomfortable to access the player from the front passenger seat of a <unk> you have to <unk> your upper back and arms in some really painful ways to pull the player out and change the disc while the car is in motion it would be nearly impossible to change the disc if you use the anchor straps all in all though , we do like this product
easy to travel with my player knowing it want get damage or broke . plus , its so <unk> to carry it with the <unk> part to make it more easy to know it is by my side
i use this case to hold my # `` x # / # `` lab top computer the case is divided into two sections i store the computer in the front section under the strap i store the power cord and mouse in the other compartment when the case is laid on it 's back the stiff sides , if tilted in a bit , give me a sturdy enough structure to set my computer on the flap , which then is lying flat on the table , i use for my mouse pad i love it
use this case on a # hour car ride held the player without any problems and attached to the car seats with limited effort would recommend it for the price case logic <unk>
this case was better than what other things we found for our needs i like that it hangs between the seats ; out of our kids reach it was difficult to change movies while moving though also it is a bit of a pain to put it up and take it down frequently we just left the case up and removed the dvd player when we got to our destination we only use this on long trips but in all we are pleased with it it allows us to use the dvd player we already have instead of buying ones that attach to the headrest we 've used headrest mounted bags in the past that do n't allow the dvd player to open fully ; so it was easy to kick and hard to keep tight enough on the headrest so it did n't sat this bag eliminated those problems
we love the functionality this case has to hook it up between the two front seats in our minivan so our kids can watch movies on road trips great size , good quality
i chose this rating because i love the case unfortunately , my likes largely go against the more modern media products out there in terms of recommending it , it would depend on the age of the <unk>
this is a great case i originally thought it was just a case to store and protect the sony # inch dvd player , but upon further review it also has the straps to hold the player in the car i use the case in the center between the front seats so both kids can see it i comes with a strap that hooks around the front seat head rests and the case has strong velcro that attaches to the strap it also has # detachable straps that hook to the bottoms of each front seat to it is fairly stable it holds the dvd player in place and even has an extra pocket for the cords , straps , remote , etc . when not in use it is the perfect storage case an exceptional value
the case was just as described nice quality and nice case i wish i had gotten one a little bigger so that i could stick a couple of dvds in there also
i love this carrier it is very easy to use i like to take our dvd player down when i am nervous it could attract someone to break in our car with this carrier is so easy to take off and hide it under my seat it hold the player securely and stores a few dvds behind it
it is a nice case and very simple to use it has a storage pocket behind the spot that holds your player i bought it for the nine inch <unk> wide screen player and it fits very nicely into the case no complaints here
it 's true , my macbook now look dumb maybe this product should be called a `` theft prevention `` case , because your computer looks so cheap , no one will think it 's worth the trouble of stealing ok , looks ar n't everything the case does n't fit well the bottom is always slipping off , and the top , like some freaking <unk> , just took over and i thought i was never going to be able to remove it i had to get my husband to help me worst of all , the edge under my wrist is really sharp and irritating my recommendation , pay a little more and get something good
i bought this case about a week ago and i just removed the cover to clean the dust particles from the inside of the case during this process , i managed to find many scratch marks all over my macbook and i was puzzled to why there would be scratches if i 've had this cover to protect my # month old macbook turns out , this case completely defeats its purpose of protecting the macbook , instead , it makes your macbook look worse by making many scratch marks all over the computer this product is a complete joke , and i do not recommend this product to anyone if you want to keep your brand new macbook in good shape , please find your product elsewhere opposed to this cheap , no good , clip-on case save your time and money
the case is good except the bottom part rubs against your wrists which hurts alot i ended up taking the bottom part off and only use the top part because of the pain of the wrists -lrb- yes its that bad .
does what it 's supposed to do , but the half that covers the front side requires some work for the latches to click in the right places the color is clear , so it does n't cover up anything , just to use as protection from scratches and what have you
very helpful , but when it comes to beauty , nah , it makes your cool mac looks ` dumb . ` it becomes ugly once it wears out and there is no way to keep it crystal clear ca n't help it though and for those new buyers , remember to take out the cover frequently , otherwise it will leave permanent marks on your mac and when it gets old , it is difficult to make it look good apart from the dumb look , it does help protect your mac from the usual ` wear and tear , ' just the ideal thing for people who are n't so careful and for those who write rave reviews , please wait for a few months to see and test the product -lrb- s -rrb- yourself before you write anything ... it is misleading i 'm in my # th month with my crystal case , and i am happy with it final word : there are better products out there . -lsb- ... -rsb-
this case looks good on my mac and it fits good too it protects your mac from any scratch or if it drops its just a great cover would definitely recommend this to others who like to take good care of their macs =
poorly - made , ugly product , not exactly # `` more of # / # `` and because of the material used for the padding it fails to hug the laptop properly the padding -lrb- which to me is more on the outside -rrb- reminds me of memory form because when i pressed into it , the <unk> of my fingers came out as it looks in the picture it is very flat although i do n't like it , it will serve another purpose for my laptop -lrb- as to act as bumper for the bottom of my rolling backpack this the only reason why i 'm giving this sleeve two stars
there is no neoprene padding whatsoever in this sleeve it does not stretch at all it feels more like cardboard i can put my laptop in some cardboard for free this is a cheap and thin sleeve that wo n't provide as much protection as a proper neoprene sleeve
this was way too loose and ended up on trash get something that 's snug it was my fault though , cause the reviews did say it would be loose but i thought i could live with i found it too ugly to use though
my # inch dell laptop fits perfectly into this case , and the case offers good squishy protection from light damage i was hoping for a little more softness on the inside , but i am very careful with my laptop and i know that the case will do a fine job
i ordered this for my # inch hp laptop and overall i would have to say # out of # stars i think it is made of a good fabric and it is actually a lot more durable than it looks in the picture the only reason i would not give this # stars is because i thought it came with the straps inside to hold on to it overall for the price and quality i couldnt have done better
it fit my # inch thinkpad t # s perfectly like a glove but was too big for my other # inch dell # r this is a nice , sleek looking case made out of a good memory foam material i use it for extra protection in a backpack the only downside is that mine has a permanent <unk> of <unk> on one side which appears to be a manufacturing error
slightly large for it 's size but gets the job done my laptop is an hp # & # # ; screen and its fits with about # inches to spare length and width wise would recommend for the
all i needed was for a simple inexpensive case for my new and sexy laptop , to protect it . . nothing fancy and that was it i like it a lot :
for the price <unk> to it , it 's a great sleeve i was looking for something cheap that i could throw into my messenger bag while walking around campus it 's does n't have great padding , but there 's enough there if you plan on keeping this in a bag with textbooks the zipper seems like it could break if forced , but i have n't had any problems yet do n't buy this if you 're going to carry the sleeve only it will not protect the laptop if it decides to fall like a bag of bricks ; however , if you have a bag , it 's a cheap alternative to a bag with heavy-duty padding
the product is very clean and smooth it fits perfectly for my # inch samsung laptop that i now carry everywhere with me there is no place to hold the charger it 's just for the laptop was the only downfall of this product but that 's ok the material is very nice and durable except for the cushion inside of it it seems like it 'll break easy but if you take care of it it 'll be fine
i bought this reluctantly given some of the critical reviews , but now that mine has over # air miles on it i do n't understand the criticism the neopreme is of average thickness and will nicely protect against the normal bumps and scrapes associated with travelling the inside corner elastics hold the laptop nicely in place the zipper works fine i can see no evidence of any poor quality and all this for a fabulous price what more could one reasonably want
this laptop bag is huge the comp sleeve is good sized and well protected , the there 's more than enough room for everthing else i 've used it for back and forth to school as well as travel if you want a large back-pack instead of over the shoulder carry bag , you 'll love it the material is a bit more `` burlap `` like than i expected so i 'm not sure how good it will look a couple of years from now
i wish the backpack could hold a rigid shape like in the picture ; however , the product is still great cons : no cellphone holder , or headphone opening everything else is convenient i have a # . # `` laptop with a huge battery , so this backpack is good plenty of space for books i 'm in college with # classes a day , most of my classes have # + page books , so the space is great i enjoy the product and was surprised that shipping was quick
i really like this bag i agree with <unk> <unk> 's review that there are not a lot of pockets however , i like that with my old one , the extra little organizing pockets were always wasted space since i just threw stuff in anyway there are # zippered pockets , but they would n't hold anything too bulky well , maybe business cards , id , phone , etc . it is quite roomy my # . # laptop -lrb- inspiron # -rrb- is a little loose in the protected area , but not as bad as <unk> 's must have been i sometimes need to take a # `` computer -lrb- which fits barely -rrb- for work so it actually works great for me it is a bit more casual than my old <unk> bag , but it has a lot more character
this is a great looking bag but i felt it did n't have enough padding to keep my laptop safe if the inside pocket for the laptop had more cushioning i would have definitely kept this bag , but it has already been returned
pretty simple and straight forward : the bag is a good fit for my laptop , provides a sturdy strap and plenty of room for extra things , and looks good doing it the buckle is both stylish and at times frustrating if you need to close it in a hurry all in all , i 'm happy with this purchase i really dig some of the finer details of the bag , like the <unk> carabiner -lrb- sp ? -rrb- on one side of the strap the small pouches at either end work well for throwing in sunglasses , keys , ipod , phone - especially when going through airport security and trying not to lose all those items that typically live in my pants pockets
bag works as advertised , constructed fairly well , fits most everything i need , although i wish the strap was a little longer and padded otherwise , its a good , fairly inexpensive bag
it 's bigger than i 'd hoped for , but is generally comfortable and stores a lot of stuff it 's uncomfortable when <unk> and bulky , but for a laptop and some class supplies it 's great
i absolutely love this product i gave it a # star just because of the closing mechanism its <unk> but once you get use to it , you dont mind at all other than that its perfect lots of room , pockets , big enough to fit anything i recommend it to anybody
i really love this bag , i use it for almost everything now its very spacious , and the latch is somewhat <unk> but it works , and its easy to get accustomed to the only fault i find is that a hand grip would have went well on top of the bag itself to pick it up instead of using the strap
was as specified my son uses it as a `` book bag `` for school rather than a laptop bag he was pleased with this product it seems very durable as well considering wear and tear normal school bags take , this has withstood alot and is still in great shape
my hp <unk> # -lrb- # . # inches wide -rrb- does not even come close to fitting into this case true width of the case as measured is only # . # inches useful width because of stitching on sides # . # inches because of flat front to back panel stitching -lrb- no side panels -rrb- its impossible for any laptop wider then # . # . # inches to fit into the case
after reading the reviews -lrb- positive and negative -rrb- , i decided to through caution in the wind and purchase this sleeve i wanted a sleeve so i can place my brand-new laptop in my brief case to use as a buffer between the laptop and a carrying case -lrb- added protection -rrb- what a mistake ! the smell , sort of a neoprene type smell is very strong leaving it in open air will not totally rid the smell when i opened my briefcase the smell of the sleeve was still quite noticeable most importantly , the sleeve was too big for my sony vaio f series wide # . # `` which i bought it for the laptop did not feel secure in my hand . most of the time i though it would slip out of my hand thereby destroying my computer i would not recommend this sleeve/case for a sony vaio f series wide # . # `` laptop !
regret , that is what i feel about buying this bag , for two basic reasons the first , it does n't fit my # `` laptop the second , even if it did , the material is pretty thin and offers no protection whatsoever i went for the cheap option , i got what i paid for if you are looking for a case bag , look somewhere else , or you 'll end up with regret
i chose this cover primarily for fit i have an asus g- # -lrb- # . # x # . # x # . # -rrb- it stretches slightly to fit snug like a glove there were no issues with this product except for the smell it maintains and overpowering petroleum stink that i was unable to remove after almost a month of ` airing ' and three -lrb- # -rrb- intense wash efforts -lrb- baking soda , vinegar , <unk> , several brands of odor <unk> , # wash <unk> ... it 's still there this bag stinks and is not going near my computer threw it away
yet another laptop case that simply is not large enough to contain my g # jh when forced into the sleeve , the seams appear stressed and may easily fray it is very difficult to insert and remove your laptop from this case i did have however found one that does work : everki commute # . # -inch laptop sleeve with memory foam -lrb- <unk> # -rrb- i bought it about a week ago , and it does its job if you have this computer , i would not recommend that you waste money buying this laptop case that does n't fit
love the sleeve but it has a terrible plastic odor even after airing it out for days ended up returning it as the smell did lighten up but never went away
this product has no zipper to contain the computer and i do n't feel that it holds the computer in place since it has a strap that hold the two sides together ... and nothing else to secure it also it has a very strong smell that has put my allergies in over drive it is going to be returned
i just bought this and immediately have to return it because it is n't # `` as advertised i measured the case and it is only # inches ... does n't really work for my # `` computer do n't buy this if you want a real # inch laptop case
i ordered this case for my hp probook # s # `` and it does n't fit at all because it is much to narrow , i have to squash my notebook in somehow so that i have to be glad that the seams do n't rip but on the other hand the case is much to long so that in the vertical scale it is much to sloppy the other thing is that it smells - somehow toxic the smell is so <unk> that you can not leave it inside the room you are working , eating or sleeping it really was a waste of money
the bag really smelled bad when i got it i was embarrassed to even use it as anybody within # ' could smell it and comment i washed it three times with cleaner made for <unk> -lrb- because it is made of neoprene -rrb- and it significantly reduced the smell unfortunately , the cover is now separating a bit because of all the washing i would n't recommend buying this bag because of all the work that must go into processing it before it is useful
this was a gift for my wife whose favorite color is red it 's good-looking and well-made , but a tad small for her toshiba laptop it 's such a struggle to get it in and out of the case , she rarely uses it the foam sticks to the laptop the design requires you to stuff the flap under the loop maybe velcro closure would be easier maybe with use it 'd stretch out more , but since she 's no longer traveling with it for work , it does n't get much use
i do n't know what this case is made of , but the smell is so <unk> that it burns my eyes and <unk> it would probably protect my laptop if i could use it i will try washing it again and see if the odor disappears
a # `` fujitsu <unk> would easily fit in this sleeve but it really looks flimsy , loose , and of no real use hardly the strap can hold the flap it is slippery and there is no way you can carry your laptop within it before putting it in a proper case yet the price is low enough -- not to complain
i 'm sure this sleeve is fine for a smaller computer , but i bought it sight unseen , because it was cheap enough to gamble on i 'll probably just give it away , cause i have no use for it
i bought this sleeve because a previous review stated it tightly fit the asus g # j series -lrb- i have the g # <unk> # -rrb- if you have a <unk> # . # laptop this sleeve will fit it , however despite the other review i do not advise buying this for an asus gaming laptop it is n't just tight - it is extremely tight basically , the sleeve will likely split if you are going to use it regularly with an asus g # j rig it is just too small for the series , like many # . # bags and sleeves for any other <unk> # . # inch computer it will work well as other reviews stated , it has a strong chemical smell it is neoprene , so the off-gassing may be toxic i bought it for only occasional use inside of a case logic bag as an extra bit of insulation , so i will be keeping it
as in the title , my msi gt # gaming laptop fits into this sleeve , but very tightly so tightly that it 's not <unk> to keep sticking it in and taking it out every time thus , i am just using this sleeve as extra padding for the laptop 's top and bottom within my messenger bag can not complain too much for the price
this laptop case is not as thick as i had thought it would be , but it does a good job at preventing scratches and maybe stains while transporting your laptop if you were to drop your laptop it would n't provide much protection so i highly suggest you look else where if you want a case that can seriously protect your laptop
the sleeve looks like the picture and works as advertised but if they had <unk> you would n't buy this very strong smell of <unk> glue or <unk> that stuff <unk> people sniff for a <unk> i just received it and sure hope it airs out but what the heck ... it was cheap ! ! lol <unk> <unk> : after a week or so the smell went away thank god ! ! ! ! ...
the price is good , the fabric is sturdy , i really like the contrasting red trim on the closing flap , but when all is said and done , it 's still a sleeve and not a case which means that it does n't really close securely the size is great for my laptop -lrb- which has a # . # `` screen i believe -rrb- and also holds the power cord and mouse but it does n't have a closure i am planning on sewing some velcro on the flap to close it
it fit 's my # hp pavilion just fine this case is very thin the smell was overwhelming ... just horrible i would not recommend this case i will be looking for something else i would not buy it
this notebook sleeve fits my # & # # ; hp very snugly it does what i wanted , in that it provides an extra layer of padding/protection for my laptop when i transport it in a shoulder bag however , it 's not very thick and does not provide much in the way of actual padding
first of all this thing fits my # `` widescreen gateway p- # fx laptop perfectly the catch is , it smells bad , like burn plastic or something similar have to wash it several times before the smell go <unk> than that , everything looks
this is not a heavy-duty case for a laptop that will be slung around all day at school or on the job it is , however , a great protective neoprine sleeve that keeps your laptop free from scratches , <unk> and the occasional gentle bump my # . # `` inch asus laptop slides smoothly into it and the band easily slips over the laptop , making the case secure one thing i have to do when using it is to remind myself which side is the top of the laptop an arrow or other marker showing the proper insertion would have been helpful but this is something you can do at home limitations aside , this case is a great deal for the money and is well worth having
simple sleeve which i use to carry my dell vostro # in a hard case that has very little padding fit was very tight but taking it in and out on a daily basis has loosened it up to where it 's easier to slide in and out it had a distinct chemical smell to it but that faded away after a few days it 's doing what i expected and at a reasonable price
my macbook pro # -inch fits perfectly into this sleeve -lrb- see pics i uploaded -rrb- no edges of the laptop sticking out when in the sleeve -lrb- another costumer has a pic of his pc laptop 's edges exposed when in this sleeve -rrb- dimensions of the sleeve are # . # x # inches -lrb- but the material might stretch a bit if needed -rrb- as everybody else pointed out , the smell is pretty strong in the beginning , but should be gone after a few days -lrb- i hope -rrb- overall a good product for a very reasonable
this sleeve fits the asus g # tightly , but it does fit , which finding one for this computer is difficult nothing to scratch , a definite plus i use this when i travel in conjunction wit my slappa case for the extra protection and when not in use seems well constructed , should hold up with regular use only four stars because of the tight fit for a normal sized laptop this would be a good sleeve and a five star
# . # inch hp laptop fits but was initially very tight has stretched enough to fit reasonably well decent workmanship for price smell typical for neoprene product ; goes away after a while will use it as an inner sleeve in a bag
this sleeve is perfect for my widescreen toshiba # . # `` laptop it fits my computer snug without being difficult to remove or put in the case the material is soft and the red color is really quite red , which is aesthetically pleasing it does have some smell to it , but nothing that does n't <unk> over time i thought of it more like `` new car smell `` which is basically industrial <unk> i took off one star because the material and the smell guarantee this thing is not eco friendly but i guess that 's the trade off for a great case at $ # worth every cent and more
i was very happy to find a sleeve that fits my # . # & # # ; laptop when it arrived , it was exactly what i had hoped , except that it it has a very strong rubber smell i am hoping this will dissipate with time
i can squeeze my # . # & # # ; wide dell m # precision laptop into this case because it stretches so much bought it for the padding and protection from scratching when i put it into a case with wheels it 's well made the bright red interior grabs my attention whenever i open it , and makes me smile
i have a sony vaio with # `` screen and did have the sony neoprene sleeve for the laptop through the years , the computer sleeve was lost and i started to look in `` brick and mortar `` stores for a low cost replacement i found it hard to find a protective sleeve that was not overpriced or too small this sleeve fits perfectly and is a real bargain for the cost other comments concerned an odor and that is true but i do n't plan to place my nose inside the sleeve on a regular basis after a few weeks , the odor lessens to a degree that it is barely even noticeable i found that other sleeves were going for $ # or more , so for the price ... ca n't beat it
here we go , and let 's keep it simple -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - price : <unk> : <unk> : nice and soft and stretches to a perfect fit smell : yes , it 's there strong at first ... time will tell it 's not a deal breaker ! am i happy ? : -rrb- update # / # -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- the smell is # % gone !
this fit my # `` hp laptop perfect i just had to air out the cover for a week or so before i could use it ... lol i do n't know why is smelled so bad but whatever chemicals they are using to produce this product should not be <unk> other than the smell i really like it
i spent alot on my laptop and wanted to cushion and protect it this sleeve is handy to slip it into when i do n't need a backpack or use it with my backpack as added protection it 's easy to handle and stays closed without having a clasp i like the red interior i may have mine monogrammed it has an expensive appearance with a nice price tag
fyi : a # inch <unk> just <unk> the size of the monitor when measuring your laptop , you must measure it closed , from corner to corner this is the actual size which should be about # inches for most # inch <unk> some manufacturers accommodate this and some do n't , it 's good to ask
i was a little concerned whether my # inch laptop would fit , based on some of the reviews , but the worries were needless it easily stretches to fit my # inch hp laptop the big flap provides a extra layer of padding if you need to carry <unk> , but do n't want to carry a separate laptop bag this provides protection
this product was just what i needed it fit my dell studio # very well and the bag does n't have a zipper so no worries on scratching it the only reason im giving this a # star is because there is not much protection sure its good for taking in a backpack but not by itself in this case am otherwise happy also incredibly fast shipping , got to colorado from <unk> in less than # days on standard shipping
nice quality though the side that load has this huge flap that you have to wrestle with to close it would have been easier with a bit of velcro , or lip closure
my gateway # `` laptop does fit in this sleeve , but it is a really tight fit i can close the flap and the entire computer is covered , but the stitches on the band around the flap are visibly stretched i will keep this sleeve - packing the computer in it inside a piece of luggage will offer some protection from bumps etc . as to the odor ... it really smells bad when you first open the package i soaked it in febreeze and let it sit to air out for # hours and that made a huge difference -lrb- apparently , there is nothing febreeze ca n't fix
i purchased this laptop sleeve after reading all of the reviews and was not disappointed it 's roomy and well-made ... no zippers to scratch my shiny black laptop and it arrived within a couple of days after i ordered it you ca n't go wrong with this one just be sure to measure the outside dimensions of your laptop and go by the published dimensions of this sleeve it is exactly as described i 'm very happy with this purchase & with the price i paid
i have been looking for quite some time for an affordable sleeve -- this is it i have a macbook pro # `` and it fits perfectly people have mentioned a smell when you get it , no big deal just wash and dry on low heat for the price you can not beat it fast deliver too
it fits a # . # `` x # . # `` x # . # `` notebook there may be another inch left to stretch on the length which measures # . # `` inside measurement and # . # `` on the width inside measurement without stretching it is thin , but i plan on inserting the two -lrb- notebook inside the sleeve -rrb- into the belkin neoprene notebook sleeve for # -inch laptop -lrb- f # <unk> product dimensions : # x # x # inches giving the notebook a little more padding and hopefully moisture protection at $ # plus $ # s & h ; and arriving <unk> this sleeve is a steal new from bargain cell the smell does make your eyes water
this sleeve is perfect , no zippers , no velcro and my laptop fits perfectly : not to tight and no sliding around inside the sleeve if you are looking for something to protect your laptop , this is it ! !
this is an awesome product , i bought it for a toshiba # `` and the sleeve is for # `` laptops so the choice was awesome 'cause it perfectly fits the product
it fits asus g # ... except that a good inch ~ inch & quarter sticks out due to the nature of the design -lrb- the big rear vents -rrb- someone else already mentioned this issue among the reviews i 'm not sure how long the stitches will hold up , but for now , it looks good enough i really like the softness and the fact that this is stretchy ... although when i first opened the bag it came in , it smelled so bad <unk> a but now it 's almost gone & bearable
seller honest , product perfect , delivered perfect , everything was perfect . thanks all involved on process god <unk> you all <unk> loves you give your life to <unk> one <unk> of your <unk>
i purchased this for my g # and it fits nicely as other buyers have mentioned i 'm happy with it although i 'm also getting the scent of # <unk> i 'll update if anything goes wrong
the subject kind of says it all , compared to the other offerings , this fit my requirement for my new hp # . # fits like a glove , fast shipping , great price it will not protect the pc from a fall , but it more protection from scratches and dents while in by backpack i would recommend this to others looking for scratch and bump protection , just keep in mind that it 's not a replacement for a laptop bag or <unk> backpack also , <unk> , the seller , shipped quickly using usps
when i purchased this item i was hoping it would fit my # inch laptop that looks like a # . # inch laptop my hp definitely fits in this large case it stretches wonderfully to the laptop i love the slide in flap because i <unk> it so the inside portion could show i would definitely by another one if i had too its worth the money - -rrb- and some said it smell bad , i think it smell good because it has a & # # ; new & # # ; smell too it
purchased this many <unk> ago and the five star rating has not changed this item has shown itself to be durable ; rain , stain resistant and professional looking to boot fits my laptop to the tee and i have no problem getting it in or out
this sleeve is very reasonably priced and adds a decent amount of security to your laptop should you unintentionally rough house with it my sleeve arrived stuffed inside a package far too small for shipping it and was noted to be torn at the top upon opening the company promptly sent me a replacement with no problems
some people complained about the smell of the sleeve if it bothers you that much you can wash it some of my friends actually like the rubbery smell about the case , it is great it fits my toshiba # . # inch perfectly fine my laptop is also a thick one so i 'm not sure about the people who complained about it
call me <unk> , but i do n't require that my gear accessories smell like <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> actually , i rather dig an industrial <unk> when i 'm packing up my electronics , <unk> instruments and <unk> <unk> it 's snug neoprene , sans zippers , is perfect for my laptop , and -lrb- per my last <unk> -rrb- has yet to cause any <unk> <unk>
the sleeve arrived promptly it is just the right fit for my toshiba satellite a # laptop as other reviewers have noted , it does have an odor i have aired it out , and the odor is gone now i recommend this product
i 've had this cover for my # `` toshiba satellite for over three years , and i 've used it every time i 've transported my laptop to school and back in my backpack it 's slightly stretched but has molded nicely to the shape of the computer it did smell at first , but i did n't sit around <unk> it , so it had no effect on my life i 'm actually reviewing this today because i 'm going to buy another one for my new toshiba also , my cat loves laying on it when i set it on a chair
the sleeve fits perfectly for my lenovo g # , which is # . # `` i am not certain if it would fit # `` laptops though good price for a laptop sleeve there is a plastic smell when i first got the sleeve , it 's gone after a couple of days of use so i would n't be too worried about that
i <unk> this item after reading the many reviews for this item i recieved the item about # days after ordering it it fits my # . # `` acer like a glove the item is just as pictured , it is a sleeve and works as just that to protect from scratches and cosmetic defects dont expect too much support or protection this is great to use if you plan on carrying your large laptop inside another bag with other items to prevent scratches the smell is not at all as i anticipated i expected an extremely unpleasant odor <unk> the other reviews but was its not bad my sleeve smells like a new pair of shoes
it fits nicely with my new toshiba satellite # `` a # -s # since my laptop has a twelve cell battery i was kind of worried but luckily it fit well it 's not snug or loose , just perfect it has a slight smell but nothing as exaggerated like some have mentioned maybe some ppl r just more sensitive than others but it does what it 's supposed to do it 's made really well and looks like it 's durable it really does a great job @ covering the entire laptop and it 's easy to slide it in and out it 's a great value in my opinion
this sleeve is very stretchy and has enough padding to do minimum scratch or small bump protection i have a # `` alienware laptop , a monster in size , and it needs to stretch to accomodate the large size but it does just fine the inside is red , outside black and a neoprene like fabric it did smell like the `` rubber `` smell right away , and i had to rinse it and hang it in the garage for a couple of days i use it just to protect the laptop from scratches from the computer bag zippers and such and it does a nice job for the price , a bit of airing out is ok and the only real drawback long term it is a dandy buy
i am very happy with the sleeve , just bought the new gateway p- # u gaming laptop i searched all over for a sleeve big enough for my laptop and this fits perfectly . th battery on my laptop sticks out the back but its no problem with this sleeve since it folds over the smell is very bad though , other than that its perfect i would recomend to anyone with a very large # in laptop just make sure u wash it a couple times to get rid of the smell
great sleeve . fits nice and snug and protects my laptop from scratching they say it has a smell to it , but it will wear off after a while i would recommend to any one
