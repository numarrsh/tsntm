`` the `` navy blue `` case looks exactly like my computer screen shows more of a dark royal blue versus navy love that this seller uses priority usps = quick case attaches easily and has a good fit definitely worth the money suggestion : if you like things to match , buy the clear keyboard cover , not translucent blue ; it looks <unk> , unless the wrong one got sent to me overall , great !
for the price it is awesome cover i saw some at other store that were twice the price it was n't hard to put it on at all looks great and fits nicely the apple symbol is hard to see but i really do n't care because i rather it be protected it than anything i have the older pro -lrb- no retina display -rrb- # so if you have the new one this won & # # ; t fit yours
it 's a pretty good case for the money i replaced a $ # dollar case that had cracked in the corner , after a few weeks this one cracked in the same spot but it was # the price so i 'm not as upset about it apple logo does n't show through case unless lit
item as described it does tend to leave some oil marks from your hands but can be cleaned up just fine . it snaps on to your notebook just fine and there are vents on the bottom
i received a macbook pro laptop for my birthday wanted to make sure it did n't get scratched up looked everywhere for a case they were very expensive i put in # in . macbook pro case saw a color i liked and more important a price i liked when i received the case it snapped right on looked great and you can see the apple logo when it lights up on the back have had it for months and still love it and my laptop looks like new
my husband has been wanting a case , so glad i found one for him and at a great price , he already opened it and put it on his macbook , great gift , for great value
the title really says it all the only thing distressed about this bag is there are some <unk> marks in the leather which the description indicates it might have but in no other sense does it look like it is anything but fresh off a factory line , no character , no history , no <unk> the image is highly lit and a bit washed out which leads to the deception on top of it all the lighting <unk> how bright all the brass accents are , which adds a lot to the <unk> of the bag other than that , it does appear to be a high quality item , just nothing like the picture would indicate
i read a couple of reviews that stated this would happen , but i still ordered the bag and hoped that just maybe i would have a different outcome unfortunately what was said by the other reviewers was true i even waited for a over a week and did n't use the bag i just let it dry out hoping the oil would get absorbed into the leather i also tried <unk> the manufacturer -lrb- not the shipper -rrb- asking for some tips on trying to fix the problem , but they did n't even respond to my email it 's too bad because the bag is the perfect size and looks great until the oil starts rubbing off your clothes
i received this bag as a gift it 's a great bag in theory : well made , looks good , lots of pockets , smooth zippers its major problem is the coloring of the leather will rub off and stain light clothing as others have reported , the stains wont necessarily wash out -lrb- i 've been able to reduce the staining some -rrb- it 's fine with darker clothing , but you 're asking for marked and stained clothing if you wear it with anything else i thought the rubbing would stop after a bit , but it continues even after months of consistent use
this bag seemed to be exactly what my husband wanted , especially the smaller size that perfectly accommodates an ipad he has n't begun carrying it regularly , but i 'm a little concerned about the <unk> bronze finish hoping it does n't rub off on <unk> shirts -lrb- as an insert that came with the bag <unk> -rrb- probably that 's only a temporary problem , if at all we are keeping it
it 's a simple and beautiful bag it had more organization inside then i thought was going to be there the inside has blue lining i was a little shocked about that but whatever , it is what it is
i got the bag for my husband and he loves it it definitely needed a coat or # of polish when we got it , but i was already prepared for that since i read through other reviews it 's well stitched and the perfect size for a daily use work <unk> bag
i read all of the reviews for this bag and decided it was the one for me - and i am not disappointed i commute with this bag when i <unk> to work - my # & # # ; macbook fits perfectly in it - with room for my ipad and other stuff i did n't have any oil rub off as suggested in other reviews - even on my white dress shirts it is already <unk> well , and people always comment on how nice it is great price , great bag , great purchase
high quality construction , nice leather - looks like it cost # times the price as others have said , buy the tan-kote to keep the stain from rubbing off on your clothes - but this is well worth the effort to have a true <unk> leather bag
except that ours was not the color that it looks be aware the leather is far lighter all in all it looked like it was made excellent the leather looked incredibly durable and classy this was a gift though , and the color was not as expected
the bag is so cool , thou you need to be careful the first couple weeks it will stain your clothes , nothing that will not get out with a wash though
it looks like advertised and of a very high quality worth every cent i used tan-kote on it , which made the leather a bit look less cool , but never had any problems with light clothes
this bag is absolutely beautiful very professional , retains solid rectangular shape when filled , and the laptop holder that comes with it fits my # & # # ; perfectly there are many pockets and separations in this bag , which is why i like it more than the <unk> , but the separations do n't add any bulk there have been complaints about the color rubbing off on light clothing , but i treated it with some tan-kote -lrb- http / / www.amazon.com/gp/product/b # <unk> # <unk> # -rrb- and i have n't seen any problems in all , this bag is wonderful , and i 'll edit the review in a few months to see how well it holds up over time
very well made i have not experienced the rubbing off of the color on my clothing that some others have mentioned it holds all my essentials and is perfect for airline travel
i got this as a replacement for my # year old llbean backpack i started biking to work and the backpack is rather awkward being high up on my back ; not to mention the heat buildup and sweating as a result this messenger bag rides lower on my back , is better balanced and allows airflow to keep me <unk> this also looks very professional , simple <unk> design , beautiful brushed leather , heavy duty zippers . and a luxurious lined interior the only point i do n't like is the shoulder pad is on the wrong side of the buckle and is not able to slide to the correct side other than that i love it
very nice , classy , expensive looking laptop bag in the leather messenger style bag design with contrasting industrial quality stitching i was <unk> from some of the <unk> but this is really quality stuff , no rubber padding to <unk> , i thought i needed a smaller bag but this thing fitts my # / # & # # ; dell lattitude e # with an inch to spare length and width wise the blue padded fabric interior sleeve with velcro closure is perfect there 's room for a charger , <unk> , arc mouse , verizon modem , sd cards , cables , <unk> # , extra magazines , spiral notebook , etc , with zippered pockets to spare the shipping packing pretty well absorbed any extra oil mentioned in previous reviews , and the smell of fresh <unk> leather is awesome by the way , it was delivered packed nicely inside a fabric shopping bag
very high quality leather and looks fits my # inch macbook pro just fine and has lots of extra pockets to carry other stuff i 'd high recommend this messenger bag to anyone who does lot of business
by far the best bag i have ever owned ! the quality is incredible inside and out i do a wide range of work so i 'm always having to adapt to whats happening , this bag gives me that ability and then some i recommend it to anyone who lives a fast <unk> life that always has to be ready in a split second for anything
this is a great bag , it hold my macbook pro # inch perfectly lots of compartments for extra storage for notebooks , pens , cell phone ect i the brown bag has not caused any staining on my clothing the bag is well made and stylish and detailed i can tell it will last for years to come
i did n't have any <unk> that some did but i hung my bag over the non used showed for a week to let it air dry prior to use fits everything and my gf called my indiana jones when i wore it to class now if i can just find the hat
i have the # in macbookpro and this purple cover just barely fits it the bottom cover pops off all the time , its very annoying i would n't recommend this cover
i ordered this because lets face it , it 's cheap and i also ordered a sticker to go on my mac so i wanted a see through case it did the job of protecting my computer from lugging it around campus it collects dust , dirt , and grime easily so i went to take it off after about a month it would n't come off i tried everything ! a little <unk> , credit card , razor blade after another month of trying i had to use a scissor to cut the case and now i have a permanent <unk> in my $ # macbook pro
it 's good protection from dings but it 's the second one i 've bought because the bottom keeps cracking that 's a little disappointing but at least my computer is n't getting the dings this one cracked as well so i am not having good luck with cases especially for the bottom
it fits good and pretty easy to figure out how to put on it looks really good and i can now handle my macbook pro more freely with having to worry about bumping into things also very fast shipping ordered friday and just got it this afternoon and im glad with this purchase dont know whats with those bad reviews i guess i got lucky
i really love the color and fit of the laptop cover , and it got here on the first estimated date i just have a few problems : theres a small scratch on the top of the cover and unfortunately it did n't even come with a keyboard cover ... so that part was kind of a rip off but besides that , the color is pretty accurate -lrb- it seems just a bit lighter -rrb- and it is protective and fits well more like a # . # star review
this product was made to fit my apple computer the case was brand new and came with an extra bonus gift a rubber protector for the keyboard this seller shipped quickly and arrived in perfect condition great product and seller would recommend to anyone
i ordered this for my mac and i could n't be happier i enjoyed the clear keyboard cover that came with it i never take it off except to clean it
i love my case , and i might just buy another one in the future it 's nice to be able to take my laptop with me anywhere i want without worrying about any potential damage get one if you can !
the case was everything i expected and more i 've purchased cases before but this was definitely worth the buy i also received a keyboard cover it did not take long to receive and was in great condition
i needed a bag for occasional work trips since my usual work bag is n't big enough to carry # days worth of clothes and i got tired of taking two bags through security this bag fits the bill though i have a couple of complaints the <unk> of this bag are fairly thin and if you put anything heavy in the inside pockets they just kind of <unk> into a jumbled mess i appreciate that the bag is light , but i 'd rather trade a bit of weight for some thicker internal material the tsa flap for a laptop is good , but that could do with some <unk> up too the bag tends to kind of flop over as you 're trying to zip it up if you do n't take your time for some reason it seems to take longer to zip up the tsa flap on this bag than it did to <unk> my laptop out of the bin and drop it into the laptop sleeve in my messenger bag i 'm sure i just have more practice at that , but this could definitely be smoother i have no doubts about the quality of this bag , it feels like it 'll last years so this is the best i 've found so far , but i 'm going to keep looking for something that 's a bit more rigid with some better internal organization for the stuff that i bring with me
i bought this for my wife since he likes the backpack style over messenger style she loves it , tested in <unk> and <unk> with no issue with tsa let 's see if it passes <unk> in a few months overall , timbuk # makes great product it 's expensive but it lasts forever not as padded as i would think compare to the command bag , which is my favorite overall , it 's still an awesome bag the most important thing is that if she 's happy , than i 'm happy : -rrb- happy wife , happy life :
material was a little on the thin side , but the backpack has held up pretty well i 've use it on my daily walking commute for the past few months and it still looks new
i have had several timbuk # bags and this is my favorite the tsa friendly compartment holds my laptop and this section also easily holds my ipad as well there is a section for all my power cords , a smaller section for pens etc . and the kicker is there is a compartment for a small amount of clothing i recently went on a two day business trip and was able to carry just this bag and given all these compartments , this bag is quite small i may never get another kind of bag again
a comfortable bad that does everything is says it will easily fits my # & # # ; laptop as well as a bunch of other stuff i love the front pocket for quick access to small stuff -lrb- i mostly keep my work badge in here . give it a try
i first saw this bag at rei and instantly fell in love , but i could n't justify the $ # . # price tag so i went searching for the same bag at a better price i found this one for about $ # and it shipped super fast i could n't be happier with the purchase
there is a great deal to like about this bag good pocket <unk> it was just a little too small for my needs , and tastes i travel quite a bit for business and i needed something with a bit more space and bigger pockets if you 're just toting laptop , tablet , glasses , maybe a book , then this is the bag for you anything more -lrb- laptop accessories , food , water -rrb- and i suggest go bigger
i am very pleased with this backpack i like having all of the different pockets for organizing and keeping track of things it was a little smaller than i expected , but i am just able to put my # & # # ; toshiba laptop in the back pocket seems to be made with high quality material
it 's a little smaller than i thought it would be overall , very pleased the different pockets make it really convienent on my daily commute the external pocket that goes the length of the backpack is perfect for an umbrella . # inch laptop fits great , but too small for my # inch laptop very comfortable backpack
this pack is a great laptop carrier i never feel insecure about my macbook air in it , and think it does a great job of staying in place when <unk> the individual compartments are more fun than functional , but im still working on <unk> its capacity everyday the main compartment is n't small , but its not very big i find myself needing to externally add things on the pack i travel around the city with my dog and often am carrying for two , but still # . though the compression straps are <unk> they are pretty small , no way your getting a yoga mat or large jacket under there when your pack is full # . the water bottle holder is small , my <unk> does n't fit : -lrb- but all in all still love the pack , and find it useful
i was tired of my big , bulky computer backpack and wanted something slimmer the <unk> fit the bill i use this to go to work in a typical office setting i usually carry my lunch , umbrella , phone , notepad , pens , etc , and sometimes my laptop i have been very pleased with this timbuk # it seems very well constructed and i like the organization the laptop seems to be fairly well protected without making the backpack too bulky the black color works well in a professional setting with work clothes i did find that the bottle opener was a bit obnoxious for a work setting and i cut it off
i used this backpack for my mac book pro # i got stuff for my mac book and stuff like small umbrella , pens etc . i will buy again and recommended to anybody the backpack itself is so light
very nice high quality bag has just what you need to carry gadgets around i just wish it had a hardened sunglasses compartment and possibly a little more storage room but i guess that would not be the purpose of this bag i have many timbuk # bags and love them all and trust them to hold up for a long time
this backpack is the perfect size i can easily fit my laptop , ipad , and two binders in the backpack it is very durable and has plenty of smaller compartments to carry smaller devices such as charges or <unk> i would highly recommend this to family and
i 've only had this backpack for a few days , but i love it and would probably call this my perfect pack all the pockets are awesome and i can organize to my heart 's content the pack does n't really seem that big , but it fits whatever i need in there the separate tablet pocket and organizational pocket won me over , too plus , the colors on this are so sleek timbuk # pays close attention to detail and quality , and i 've never gotten a bad bag from them -lrb- there have been many -rrb- i added photos to the customer image library amazon posts for us
my daily commute involves # + miles of walking , along with a # or # minute ride while standing on the train this bag easily adjusts to keeps the weight close to my body , significantly reducing the stress on my shoulders and lower back i carry my laptop , laptop charger , phone , phone charger , sunglasses case , wallet , keys , lunch and a change of shoes with a little room to spare
it 's just sort of a visual joke it does work well and takes up very little space , but i do not think the string will last very long , but for what ? $ # what the heck i kinda like it
the color looks nothing like on the pictures - terrible , <unk> there 's no way this is leather - <unk> look and feel glue stains on the outside of the product # the lip velcro strip came completely detached only prior stitching holes visible no thread to indicate it was ever attached this one jumped out at me right away , and was the biggest disappointment i do n't write bad reviews to make myself feel better in fact , i do n't believe i even have a review out there below # stars but how anyone could send a customer a product in this condition is beyond me
it works , but does not offer much protection , is cheap , and feels cheap from # feet it looks good , but any closer you will wish for more the red thread is thin , and the small little buttons feel as they are going to rip off with just a bit more use if you are wanting to spend less than $ # , and that is your basic requirement , it will do i would recommend looking for something better , however
i did n't like it i paid $ # and $ # shipping mine arrived in a folded manila envelope which resulted in a crease down the middle of the sleeve also , there was residue -lrb- appeared to be glue -rrb- or another substance on the lower red button those buttons and string are useless , they appeared to be glued on and offer little functionality item felt quite cheap , thin and flimsy my # `` air did fit nicely , and the look was relatively unique it is a mildly attractive sleeve and offers a thin level of protection , but i am not interested in using this product the seller did apologize for my damaged sleeve and promptly issued a refund , so that was appreciated on my end
this case is indeed really cute i get compliments all the time ... but it is poorly made the red buttons have dried glue on it when i received it it 's still there coz i could n't remove
the material this product is made of smells like cat <unk> had to flip inside out and air outside for a couple days after using daily for a week exterior envelope material started to peel in corners
it 's a pretty cheap case , but it works just fine i never take the case out of my backpack - just slide my laptop in and out of the top the <unk> piece fell apart in relatively short order , but the velcro under the flap keeps it closed
the case provides minimum surface protection for my # macbook air the fitment is very loose -lrb- you can fit at least a finger through the sides after you put your mac in the flap has very little velcro the leather is very cheap the color is much darker than what is described
it does the job , it looks sleek and you would n't guess there 's a laptop inside the red buttons you tie the string around are kind of tacky , as is the string , but otherwise it 's neat i just put up with it and enjoy the inexpensive laptop protection
does not look like a real envelope , but for the price it 's good enough from far away looks better regarding the protection this is only like a carry on bag it wo n't protect your mac from a big fall
simple soft case option for your macbook air that looks cute and wo n't weight it down the quality is pretty good except for the string - mine seems to have frayed rather easily that said , it was really affordable , so no regrets and a really discrete way to carry around your laptop
it fits perfect the # . # & # # ; macbookair , it protects it enough and it is very discrete , the only but i have is that the string to close it is kind of flimsy
well ok , for the price i suppose i should not be surprised that it is not leather but is actually some type of leatherette it does look cool and i really like to carry <unk> my macbook air in it it looks just like i 'm just carrying some papers
i just want to rate this item <unk> i purchase two each from different sellers the other black you would think the higher one was better by the other seller right this one is by far better quality and a little cute velvet like pocket came with it nice ! ! !
just got it today ; first thoughts : it 's clearly a <unk> material , but it looks pretty good -lrb- the color is more like a yellow manila envelope than `` light brown `` -rrb- it does n't really have any padding at all , so it definitely does n't offer much drop protection however , it should offer good light-weight scratch protection if , like me , you just want something to cover the air while it 's in a larger bag also , in addition to the red tie cord , there is velcro under the flap certainly worth what i paid for it -lrb- under a <unk> -rrb-
i got this for my mac book pro # in and it works perfectly and is also very sleek and stylish however , i 'm already facing a problem where it is beginning to sort of flake of peel off in certain spots but for the price i ca n't complain
inspired by steve jobs ' reveal of the original macbook air -lrb- he wanted to show off how thin it was by placing it in a document envelope , -rrb- this item is great i got two - the original cream color that looks like an envelope and a red leather one the original color only gets # stars because it does n't hold up as well to dirt , scratches and stains after # months of basic usage and by basic i mean that it pretty much goes in and out of my backpack each day red does seem better , however and it looks pretty great too
sure it is faux leather - but for this price , i am not complaining it is a little loose for macbook air , but still a decent product a happy customer
this case was slim and snug for my macbook air it does not have any cushion for bumps or drops however so buyers beware it just looks nice the string gives it a more realistic look of an envelope but it is annoying i just ended up cutting it out on mines
i got this for my # & # # ; macbook air not very heavily padded , but as im careful w my things that isnt a concern for me i get a lot of compliments when i bring it out
the case is cute , and the color was just as pictured in the sellers images there were a few imperfections : the surface has a really small scratch and on the front there is a small <unk> red circle i presume the seller stacks the cases , and the red circle from another case left the mark all in all it is really cheap , so for the price you ca n't expect it to look exactly the same as the leather version i have a hard case and the computer fits great in it , and i only expect protection from scratches and cosmetic damage if you are looking for heavy duty protection this is not the way to go
a bit snug , which is good the string is very much like that you would find on a paper envelope but it 's a great product very slim design means i can put it in my backpack without worry
i have now had the beige one for over a year i travel with my laptop , plus i bring it to work every day so the case gets quite a bit of wear and tear , and it 's still kicking in regards to other comments yes the string broke on it eventually , but since the thing has velcro it does n't really matter , plus i never used the string either way no it 's not going to help in a drop situation , but most laptop cases wo n't i have had one of the neoprene ones that 's supposed to and dropped my laptop and it did nothing to save it i use it primarily in my messenger bag to keep stuff getting into the cracks and openings i have a snap on case on my laptop as well , but that does n't protect the ports it 's worth the $ # +
this is a wonderfully cheap sleeve for my # & # # ; macbook air it looks like a business envelope , so when i walk into meetings and set it down , nobody thinks it 's a laptop the string thing is long gone , but i never used it it does have a little velcro tab that holds the flap closed * simple * cheap * decent quality * soft material <unk> * not a ton of protection against dropping your computer * no room for extras -lrb- mouse , charger , cable , etc
for the price , it 's pretty good it 's a cute sleeve i like that it looks like a manilla envelope because people would n't automatically think i 'm carrying a laptop it is very thin so if you 're looking for something to protect your laptop , this is n't it i also use a hard case for my macbook air and it fits snug in this sleeve the corners are starting to get bent though -lrb- probably because it is so thin -rrb-
this is a thinly padded sleeve for mac book air it is practical and cute if you are looking for primary heavy duty protection , i 'd look for something thicker but if you have a sturdy bag and just looking for a practical sleeve this is quite good and inexpensive
ships fast and is super cheap the string broke within the first month of use and the sleeve is not a snug fit so if you do n't velcro the top your laptop will slide out very easily but if you always velcro your sleeve then you should have no problem
delivery was right on time and its working great with my laptop it fits perfectly and does n't easily scratch its unique and i get lots of complements on it i highly recommend it
this is a great little sleeve and i 've received many compliments on it it 's not terribly protective , but i do n't mind that because i slide the sleeve into my purse for transport
this is a perfect , snug fit for a macbook air # inch however , i cut off the red buttons and <unk> they look cheap , are cheap , and serve no purpose as there is velcro under the flap
it looks like an inter-office envelope it fits in my large purse and people have no idea a laptop is in it it just looks like a file or inter-office mail friends want one
i really like this . . hopefully the closure will hold up i passed through airport security without a hitch it was almost as if they recognized that it was a laptop meets airport security <unk>
i love it just the whole design my computer fits perfectly even with a case on my computer only problem would be that the strings are starting to fall part beside this is a good sleeve
does n't offer a ton or protection , but i do n't plan on flinging my macbook air anytime soon no problems yet with the red tie string like others have reported get lots of compliments on the case great price ... look and feel of leather -lrb- albeit faux
exactly how it was described nothing wrong with it so far love the look and feel of it could n't tell it was a laptop case from afar and was able to fool friends with it
it 's hard to tell from the picture how good this product will be or it 's construction i was pleasantly surprised when i received this i have a macbook air and it slides in here like a glove the inside is a felt type of material keeping the laptop safe it 's great because if it 's out and in the envelope , no one knows what 's in there
reasonable price , charming design , good protection i like it only one tiny negative - the string thing is very cute and <unk> for <unk> mailing envelopes , but in practice , you 'll not use it , because of the handy velcro tab provides good protection , though of course not as much as a fat rubber bumper thing , but then instead of this cute thing , you 'd have a fat rubber bumper thing
so my wife ordered this for her new macbook air and i was a bit concerned about quality when i saw the price i was flat out wrong the case is made strong of good quality soft leather and fits her air like a glove it 's not very shock <unk> , but it was n't made for that reason either this will fit nicely in any bag , adding very little bulk , and protecting your air from scratches and dings
this is an awesome <unk> that is perfectly designed for your # inch macbook air it is crafted from a good-quality faux leather material , lightly padded and enhanced with a flap and string closure the overall look is one of understated coolness
perfect for the # inch macbook air # model i wanted to protect it when i was n't using it , so it would n't get dust on it does n't take up any space and weighs nothing would buy again for that purpose it has no padding , so if i were to take it somewhere i would slip it into a carrying case
i purchased a brown envelope looking computer case on a sunday and was expecting to receive it the following friday i got it on tuesday the service was quick , easy and great i am very satisfied with the product it was just what i was looking for and it fits like a glove
worked great for my samsung ativ <unk> # c tablet it will hold both the tablet and the keyboard , but it 's tight with just the tablet , it works just fine it 's not padded but that 's ok since it 's kept in another bag which adds the protection the purpose of this envelope is to protect the tablet from scratches when it 's put in another bag the envelope will not protect the tablet if it 's dropped i do n't plan on dropping it -lrb- but just in case , i got the warranty for accidents like that . i will reinforce the little red circles and sew the end of the string so it does n't unravel ... ; however , the velcro is mostly used to keep the envelope closed
great for when you just want to protect against scratches , but do n't want a bulky cover the string is a little annoying but holds the cover more tightly closed than just the velcro i cut off part of the string to make it shorter and that helped great value for the price
this case quite simply did n't fit my laptop , which is in the series that is advertised as being compatible with this case i am returning it and not attempting to purchase another
pun intended this is not a case it is a piece of plastic you put on the top of the computer its worth about a dollar and i assumed it was a case because of the high price
my item was damaged when i opened it and they did not want to replace it really dumb when you can not even get your item replaced when they shipping and handling damaged it
bottom line - this is a solid case visually , it is pretty plain -lrb- solid black , obviously -rrb- the case fit my dv # perfectly the pop up stands on the bottom are very well designed , not flimsy - complement the case nicely there are two little rubber feet on the bottom portion for this price , well worth picking this case
as for the backpack it is nice but the computer compartment is too small for a computer i sent it back for this reason and they informed me i had to pay the shipping and they would keep # % of the refund for sending it back i looked and i do not see that they will <unk> # % of the refund for returning it
the bag is great looking and well made however , it does n't fit my # . # `` dell laptop i was really disappointed not be able to use the bag so i had to settle for swiss gear renegade # ``
the bag is very nice tons of compartments , a lot of engineering and thought went into this bag ... all except for large people this bag fits over one arm , and not the other i ca n't wear it on my back , and if you are a smaller person who wears it low , then you 'll be upset with this the straps need to adjust further i could n't wear it , so it went back if you are a # regular , then this would be fine for you ... # tall , you may notice its up high on your back
