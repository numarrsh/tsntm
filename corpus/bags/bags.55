this case is really nicer in person than in the picture it is a really nice bright blue and has a sheen to it it fits a # . # in . screen size laptop perfectly and even has room if the laptop were a little bigger the compartments are great for the charger or other items and either used with the handle or the strap is very stylish and well padded to protect the laptop it was a hit with my daughter
the quality of this product is fantastic i purchased this one for my kindle and accessories i also purchased a purple one for the ipad i will be getting i do n't look for a case that comes with a product , i always look for one that is better and has more room for everything that can go with it
i like this bag , got it for my new pink vaio it has lots of compartments and is strong the only thing i did n't like was the little metal tabs on the zippers came off way to easily i need to get a set of pliers to squeeze them back into place otherwise you 're just putting on a tiny zipper handle
i love this case lots of pockets and plenty of room for a notebook , pens , etc . the only problem is there was a small tear in the black foamy fabric on the inside rim of the bag , exposing a layer of white foam i 'm afraid the tear might get bigger over time but overall i 'm pleased with this bag
it is really nice great protection for my laptop the color is really a pretty girly pink lots of room inside to carry everything you need love the shoulder strap the only thing i would caution about is because it is a light color , it may get soiled pretty easily i do n't haul my lp through a lot of public spots , but it is something to consider if you plan to do a lot of traveling with it the case itself is exactly as advertised i would consider a darker color if you are concerned about getting it dirty i love mine , color and all
i bought this to match the pink computer i gave my neice for her bday she is very happy with it it has a handle and a detachable shoulder strap there is room inside for a mouse and any of the other usual items
it fit both my computer and the lap desk i use underneath it the pockets are big enough for all the cords and i have extra space for my ipod as well
this was an excellent purchase for my computer no male is going to try and walk away with this computer bag in pink it has sufficient cushioning , nice shoulder support on the strap and relatively light weight
very roomy bag , great material and comes with a separated -lrb- and padded -rrb- shoulder strap the outside pocket is perfect for your charger , etc . and there 's plenty of room on the inside as well great bag and price
this fit my laptop prefect pockets inside for mouse and other things outside pockets big enough for cord , papers and my kindle so i 'm very happy with this , color is a little lighter then shown
wanted an affordable bag that would actually protect my laptop in different weather and situations was a little hesitant because of the low price but the quality was actually better than i expected the padding inside is great , tons of pockets and spaces for things you may need -lrb- pens , papers , calculator , book , charger , phone , etc . -rrb- shoulder strap was very comfortable and seems to really make lugging my laptop around much easier i am very impressed
this laptop bad was better than what i expected inside there are so many compartments its very useful if you need to put files as well as your laptop in there i love how even when you put the laptop charger , it doesnt make the bag bulky best investment i ever made
there isnt alot of extra room but it fits my laptop perfectly i can also put my power cord & wireless mouse in the bag color is great , and it seems to be well made sometimes it is scary buying online but this time it worked out perfectly
it 's cute it 's very strong & sturdy and the pouch in the front is very handy i 've had this bag for a while now before posting this review and i have no regrets in buying it i 've had no problems with it and have no complaints
this is a pretty pink case i purchased for my daughter it has lots of room for her computer and all her other & # # ; stuff & # # ; the bottom has rubber grips and there is an extra pocket in the front i am thinking of buying a second one for me
i love this bag ! ! it 's very roomy with lots of places to store stuff i use it to carry my net-book and all the accessories everything fits , and then some i also love the color the picture shows it to be a deep pink , but it 's actually a light pink , very pretty it comes with shoulder straps , even if they do n't show it in the picture
i paid $ # for a fake this seller sold me something <unk> this case covered the headset outlet , every time i wanted to use my headphones i had to take of the bottom part this case also covered part of the charger , so i could only attach the charger in a certain wish i had n't waited so long , i might of had a chance to get my money back stay clear from this seller
perfect fit : -rrb- and i love the feel it 's silky and smooth but very durable , love it te color is great and i feel better because of the name brand and it 's not generic
this was a very good purchase as a hard case , it has a softer feel to the outside fits perfectly and is easy to assemble have n't had any problems yet i have always bought incase items for my iphone and previous slips for other computers , and this purchase has not failed
the case fits the laptop exactly , it does n't have a nasty log on it and it protects the computer perfectly it also shipped really early and arrived early then the shipping date overall this product is great and i would definitely recommend getting it for you computer . :
perfect fit for the mid # macbook pro i 've tried other cases , and the incase brand is the best so far it does n't look or feel cheap like the other cases and has a satiny feel which makes it easier to grip
when i went to micro center i saw this particular incase for $ # so when i saw this product at $ # on amazon i thought it must be too good to be true but it is great i love the soft feel and matte look of the hardshell case it 's in the most lovely raspberry <unk> color and fits perfectly on my brand new # inch macbook pro i just recently purchased highly recommend this -lrb-
super cute , fits perfectly if you have the computer thats in the description and $ # less than what you would normally pay for an incase case like this one i used to have this exact one but in green and paid $ # for it -lrb- retail -rrb- and saw it as great deal the in my opinion , i find it wise to spend on quality to protect your laptop considering you spent well over a grand for it
i got this case about a year ago , and now it already has a crack the bottom part is almost impossible to take off , and it seems that the plastic does not hold up well i 'm dissapointed
the color is perfect this case protects my laptop wonderfully and holds on tight it does not really interfere with the laptop 's cooling either however , the soft finish peels off , so be carefull of sliding your macbook/macbook pro on the table it is better to lift them and place them where you need them
nice rubber feel its not too bright either the air holes on the bottom definitely allows the computer to breathe and not over heat it also protects the computer really well so its worth every penny its also a lot cheaper on amazon since i have prime
great , great , great i love my new cover i got my order days after i bought it even though i did n't pay for faster shipping and it was over the thanksgiving week it was super easy to put on it is worth the extra money to get such a reliable product
we have several family members with macbooks in the house so different colored covers make them easy at a glance to differentiate i previously had a case by another manufacturer which i returned as this case seems to have double the ventilation holes on the bottom i love the translucent green color and it fits perfectly on my macbook pro # `` and is high-quality in appearance and design also , i bought it in the summer of # and it is holding up nicely
this is the first time i have purchased an item on amazon , and the company -lrb- incase -rrb- sold it for a cheaper price otherwise than this , i love the case it fits perfectly i love my new macbook pro even more now i even purchased the keyboard protector to match
when it comes to protecting and maintaining the quality or life of an expensive piece of equipment it usually turns out that `` you get what you pay for . well , this is true with this case yes , it 's a lil more expensive that the other cases out there but when you pay what you do for a mac you should want to cover it in a equally reliable case plus , the case has some great colors to pick from , it doesnt scratch that easy cuz its not a glossy finish , and it allows you to get to all your ports and plug-ins i particularly like matte , almost rubbery feel the case it 's not slick and shiny , yet not dull either it 's a nice medium oh and its super easy to put on and it doesnt fall off hope this helps
this hard cover for the macbook pro is easy to put on and very functional i love the fact that i can get other covers and have different colors for each season in a nutshell , this cover is functional and stylish !
looks great but wound up not working out the thread is trying to un do itself and the hole <unk> front of the bag is big enough for things to fall out nice for a weekend or overnight trips but i feel like it 's not strong enough to hold
my <unk> son loved the design there is a small hole from the headphone picture where you can pull out your earphone or headphone cord if you put your phone or mp # device in the bag pocket however , i found the material somehow too thin if you bring too many heavy books inside , it may tear easily
the price is fairly reasonable and the appearance of the backpack is good the only problem is the design of the backpack , kind of lack supporting , and too spacious that things in the bag tend to mess up with each other
i bought this for my # year old for <unk> year i needed something that looked different i looked in all the stores and i was n't finding anything so , i took a chance on amazon so glad i did because she loved it it 's sturdy and cool looking and what kid does n't like <unk> so , the design is really cool it 's now april and she 's been using it since september it 's still holding up :
got the backpack well before the expected shipping date the bag is a good size , with a good amount of pockets and spaces to put things there are two ways you could wire your headphones through , and plenty of room to keep your laptop , books , mp # player , and anything else the material feels sturdy enough , and i have packed it pretty full a few times now and it holds up well wears comfortably , and looks awesome
the bag was very poor quality after a short time of using it , the shoulder strap pad stitching came undone as did several areas on the bag it looked great when i first got it , but terrible , terrible quality
... the shoulder strap broke after only two weeks of moderate use the bag never had more than a laptop and a kindle inside at any time , so there 's no reason the strap should have broken so easily the bag has good storage space and padding , but if you plan on using this as a <unk> bag , you might want to look elsewhere
smaller than i expected , but otherwise a great bag a place for everything , my kindle , ipad and macbook air just needed a bit more space for all of the cords
for the last few weeks i 've hauled my # . # inch acer aspire laptop around africa in this case it 's been perfect there 's enough room in the pockets for the charger and power adapters plus file folders , flash drives , business cards , etc . also , there 's enough padding in the case to protect the laptop when i 've dropped the case and laptop the compact size is very nice it 's easy to throw the carrying strap across my chest to carry the laptop in addition to a backpack also , this small case will fit in a larger pocket in my backpack if i do n't want to carry two items now i 'm looking for a little bit smaller case like this for my # inch tablet
i have only had the bag for # weeks and it is already ripping at the seams i could understand if it was stuffed full of things , but all i carry in it is my laptop very poor quality
this product is cute and <unk> , but does n't last very long my daughter was complaining about tears in the material after using it for # weeks at school we are shopping for another one , but this one will be better quality and most likely more expensive need something for a short time this is it need it for # days - buy something else
this is a great bag -- compact , nicely padded , good compartments it came quickly and in perfect condition my only complaint is the color i am a purple freak , and this is more brown than purple they should call it `` dark maroon `` or `` dark plum `` or maybe even `` slightly purplish brown `` , not purple that being said , it 's a terrific bag for my laptop
i love the color of this bag and how compact it is considering all it can carry it has about # <unk> pockets of all shapes and sizes and it is made of quality materials my one complaint is that it may not be equipped to handle the heavier stuff i have been using it every day to carry my laptop , two books , a notebook and a portable hard drive one of the <unk> handles is beginning to tear off and i have only had the bag a month however , if you use the shoulder strap rather than the handles , it seems to be able to handle the weight i really love this bag despite the fact that it is beginning to fray in one spot
this bag is more than i expected for that price just perfect choice with several zips , pockets of every size , water resistant , nice color would n't go for more expensive ones this one works just perfect
this bag <unk> me on how many things i can put inside it aside from my laptop it has different compartments where you can organize your stuff it 's a good fit to my lenovo # `` laptop and with the shoulder pads included with it , bag feels lighter to carry on shoulders ... and , great value for money .
perfect less expensive alternative to high $ $ $ cases lots and lots of pockets and storage i did n't even expect saw complaints about the color - but it really is the same color as it appears in the photo on my computer not <unk> purple by any means - but it 's not black or gray and good enough for me ca n't attest to durability just yet - but it arrived in perfect condition
this notebook bag is not very sturdy but okay for basic storage of your laptop while at home or simple trips it is quite heavy when encasing my laptop and charger so a more comfortable handle would be nice however , it is a great price ... you get what you pay for
i love this bag it holds my laptop perfectly , i have an asus # . # it also holds my charger but i would have hoped for it to have a little more pocket space overall it 's a good buy
i really like this bag if i changed anything , it would be to add more pockets - in the lining and another on the outside but i knew what it had when i bought it , and it 's a great deal for the
i bought this for two reasons - it 's the color i wanted and at a really great price has plenty of room in the front zippered pocket for my wireless mouse and the cord i love it
i love this little bag if you 're looking for something with a lot of padding maybe because you travel and your lap top gets banged around a little , this is not it but , if you just want a lightweight , sturdy bag to store your laptop in and maybe occasionally take it <unk> , this is it it has a zipper pocket on the outside of the bag which i usually store my mouse & mouse pad not a lot of extra room once you place your laptop inside but it 's not meant to be a ` briefcase ' more padded than a pack back type carrier , but not heavy duty with multiple zipped compartments i do not like to leave my lap top sitting out at home , so this is a perfect little bag to store it in and put my lap top away on a shelf
the good : the bag looks great , feels well-constructed , fits my # `` macbook pro perfectly and <unk> me compliments the bad : it is so slim that you can barely fit a single book along with your computer it 's completely impractical god forbid you might need to carry something that is n't a flat rectangle in this thing also , though it 's nicely constructed , the <unk> mesh on my shoulder straps began fraying after several months this is weird since they 're not really coming into contact with anything i 'd highly recommend to someone who only needs to carry their laptop i 'd highly not recommend to someone who needs to carry more than their <unk> accessories
seems to be a very well made bag and my macbook pro -lrb- # & # # ; -rrb- seemed very well protected and a wonderful fit problem is once i put the cord in too , the bag felt stuffed to the max pretty silly really to have it that small also , the futuristic look of the bag does n't fit my style and it looks tiny on me -lrb- i 'm about average size , # ' # & # # ; # lbs -rrb- high quality but tiny this one is going straight back
this is a great bag and it is very stylish but it seems that the backing material and the shoulder strap material break very quickly the material used on the inside of the shoulder strap is mesh and it seems that it gets <unk> very quickly otherwise , if it were n't for the poor product construction the bag is very nice since it 's light and slim it 's comfortable to move around with and holds a macbook pro very snug though brenthaven did agree to replace it immediately with it 's lifetime <unk>
with all of my previous brenthaven bags still holding up the high quality , this is failing left shoulder strap part is <unk> i will contact brenthaven and see brenthaven informed of a new unit on its way service is spectacular update -- just received a replacement bag ca n't say enough about the service and warranty of brenthaven
very good build and quality very slim profile that helps to avoid bumping into people when you are in a very crowd train but it offers too little carry spaces for serious travelling
the only complaint i have about this backpack is that there is no space for a binder , i mean # space if you get a really thin binder , maybe you could cram it in with the laptop i ended up getting folders for my papers . padding all the way around the laptop i feel pretty secure about my laptops safety while it 's in the backpack also , it looks very professional
i say & # # ; almost love it & # # ; because it 's very smart in it 's design looks like something a professional wold carry , not a college or high school student would the one and only flaw i found is that the shoulder straps do not stay in place every time i adjust it to be perfect within minutes it slips i thought of sewing the straps in place but that would ruin the feature of adjustments overall it 's certainly functional and well designed with a very tailored finished look i said # stars , but if the straps stayed in place it would be # stars . :
bought so i could have a professional looking backpack for work i really like it i agree with some other user comments about the strap slipping off if you only use one shoulder which is why it 's # stars instead of # it easily fits my # & # # ; macbook pro and ipad along with room for a mouse pens and some other items all of which seem adequately protected in case of a drop i 've never used the rain cover as the backpack seems pretty water resistant without it if they were to improve it i 'd say lose the rain cover and fix the strap thing overall it is high quality and i 'm very happy with my purchase
this bag is too big for a # & # # ; macbook in my opinion the bag quality is exceptional and will last forever just like the other brenthaven bag i have , but in my opinion it 's too big i will be sending it back
really like this backpack it 's slim , stylish and functional i love the side access for laptop / ipad -lrb- although there is an ipad inside as well -rrb- there are lots of little pockets to store business cards , passport and other important items it 's stylish enough to take to meetings i 've received a number of compliments on it the only minor negative is that it does n't sit perfectly on my back i 've tried every variation of strap length hopefully they can sort that out in the next iteration , although it 's not a big enough issue that would n't buy another one i recommend it
nice stylish backpack great material , looks very slick one thing though : it pretty much only works very well if the only things you want to use it for is your laptop + ipad + few pens i bought it with an attempt to use it for light workout gear , which is not working amazingly for would definitely recommend it as a nice stylish laptop backpack , very ergonomic too
it is built rock solid in <unk> possible but lacks some <unk> control i noted a missing zipper tab on the inner side of the bag 's flap i replaced it with a small zip tie or cable tie no issues with the rest of the bag wo n't return it as i 'm overseas
i own several different back packs and in up stuffing everything in them this one is slim and handles the task top notch i use this for work when i do n't need to carry much i love the product and this will always be my first back pack of choice brenthaven will rock your socks off ! !
great slim laptop backpack enough space for everything i need on daily commute to/from work , including laptop , charger , mouse , kindle e-reader , phone , wallet , and umbrella it is nice looking , but could use some color
am using it daily it is able to hold my notebook comfortably and its power cables despite all the other things that i pack into it , it still looks slim and had attracted many positive comments while carrying it around
i love , love , love this computer backpack very slender and lightweight fit my macbook pro with no problem sometimes i wonder if i forgot to put in my computer as it so light on my back
i have had this backpack for a while now the bag is perfect for my macbook pro and it is super unobtrusive sometimes i wish it was a bit bigger but then i realized i did n't buy this to carry a lot of stuff only one minor issue is the stitching is coming loose a bit around the velcro points otherwise great bag
i originally purchased this bag as a replacement for my previous bag one which broke im very glad it did i use this bag everyday to store my # inch macbook for work its a very high quality product and has been very durable i usually do n't review many products , but i had to give this one a quick review i get a lot of compliments on it and would definitely recommend this to anyone who 's in the market for a laptop backpack
this is the back pack of all back packs ! ! i have shopped around for a while reading all kinds of reviews i saw the video about this product and found it to be every bit of what i saw it turns out that the first day getting it in the mail i showed my wife and it 's hers know she loves it because it has great padding , but not to bulky she loves biking and takes it with her everywhere i will buy another for me great work on this bag ! !
i got this backpack recently and it is ideal for your laptop and other gadgets it is well made and it has several pockets inside to store several of the gadgets i like the side storage for your laptop , so i do not have to open the front to take my laptop out so far it is very versatile backpack
buy it now i do like # <unk> a day in a f # gs , with the laptop in my back is a little heavy , but the pack just grabs me and is confortable enough to do the adventure also is strong enough to be attached to the seat behind my butt , and stay there the entire day , just a little help from a <unk> with hooks and off road i go
i 've been using this back for about a month now , and it 's been great for carrying my # `` macbook pro it 's padded notebook enclosure is excellently protects and accommodates it , yet it could also easily accomodate larger notebooks the front pockets carry my power adapter , texas instruments <unk> # <unk> graphing calculator , the power cord , pens , pencils , and an five subject notebook i have n't found much use for the device pocket , it would be great for storing ipods or my phone , but it 's inconvenient to open as i am required to take the bag off of my back it comfortably fits either shoulder or both
this bag is awesome if you are willing to carry just your laptop , tablet and a notebook and few other <unk> one gripe i have is that they could have included a separate pocket for the laptop charger , but its not a big deal as the front pocket is decently big enough the best thing about it is that its highly compact without compromising on the room for the basic things
what a fantastic backpack fits my mac air , some paperwork , and my lunch it is great for biking to work because it is so lightweight it has lots of useful pockets for phones and things , and it looks great and , brenthaven customer support was amazing
this is a nice case that fits the ipad nicely my wife and i put both of our ipads in it when travelling however , we bought this a few months back for $ # from amazon directly , and bought a second one in november for $ # those were good prices for it , but $ # + ? ?
this case is quite different than other netbook case for one , the material is like a soft <unk> jacket and it is well padded there 's a small compartment to hold the ac charger or other items -lrb- phone , flash drives , etc -rrb- overall , i like it and of the # <unk> i purchased for my netbook , this is my favorite i bought mine from an amazon marketplace seller for < $ # i loved it so much i bought # more to give out as gifts
the ipad case works for me i found it to be a little tight fitting at first , but the snug fit is good it has enough padding that i feel confident that is will protect my ipad it also gives me a place to store my ipad so i know that it is secure
this is a very good case the only con it has is that the device is a little bit loose in it should have kind of strap to fix the device ... but anyway i would recommend it to
great case for the ipad soft sided for protection and pockets for small <unk> wish is , that it should have shoulder straps option would be easier to carry when traveling
i was surprised as how sturdy and durable this is i would recommend it highly ! ! it will fit my ipad # even with an otter box , so i 'm even more impressed with it ! !
after trying out several different cases/sleeves for my ipad # i found that this one was best it has plenty of padding but still is small also has place for charger and small acc i even spilled a drink on it and it did n't go through , also i would recommend against trying that it has been a great choice ! !
this case is the right amount of padding , no too bulky . i use it for the ipad the handle makes it convenient to carry around . and is professional , and protects the ipad from scrapes and bumps
i was n't expecting much given the low price , but was extremely pleased with this case fits my ipad # perfectly , looks great , and has plenty of protective padding i was going to get one of the rubberized slim cases , but am so very glad i went with this one instead highly recommended and the price ca n't be beat
i bought this for my `` hard to please `` wife she actually likes it it is well padded and the handle is well made the extra zippered pocket is handy for a few accessories
tidy little case that can be tucked into a backpack or other case to add extra protection i use this with <unk> <unk> sleeve for ipad - <unk> makes a nice combination this case is well padded it 's a nice little case if you just want to carry your ipad into * $ s or other wireless venue for some <unk> browsing , checking email , or whatever the size is exactly right for the ipad # it is probably worth mentioning that the case was on sale for less than $ # when i purchased it
i 've been looking for a small bag to snugly hold my samsung netbook with power adapter and not much more after checking out several other bags in big box stores i came to amazon to see what they have to offer i ordered this hoping it would be merely adequate was i ever surprised this fits my # . # inch samsung netbook like it was custom fit for it it fits like a glove which was what i was looking for it 's nicely padded and i expect my netbook to be all the safer for that summary : for those of you looking for a small , snug fitting case for your # . # inch netbooks and not much more than a power adapter , this fills the requirements quite nicely it 's padded and well constructed
it was lovely but unfortunately it was not clear that the case is only padded on one side and the other side was very hard i would never put my mac in that and feel that it was safe i returned it
the case provides terrific support for your laptop the macbook fits perfectly inside the case and because of the slim size of the bag you can use the laptop while it is still inside it the only downfall is that i wish there were more room inside the bag or a seperate pocket to hold the laptop charger you can put the charger on top of the laptop and manage to zip the case , but you risk scratching the top of the macbook , which is n't worth it
this case is adorable fits my macbook air perfectly love the pink my only critique is that there is no pouch or pocket for the charger i just have to lay it on top of the laptop
the case is good quality , and it looks very nice the only issue i have with it is that it does not have any space for the charger , or say , hotspot so i would have to carry those items separately in some other bag , and they would take a lot of space in my purse
i have been searching all over for a hard case to protect my computer checked every retail store i could possibly think of to no avail this case is perfect protection for my computer i recommend to anyone who cares about their laptop the handles are an added bonus
i love it it holds my laptop just right and i usually use it when i know i wo n't be home for long periods of time only downside would be that it does n't have room for the charger to fit but it does a good job at protecting my laptop
great color and great value there are some soft cushion inside my wife loves it but for macbook air , the thickness of the bag is still a little bit thick
i love this case , it is light and styling also great for traveling easy to go and protects the mac of any harm inside it has some more protection so it travels more secure
wow ! ! this case looks great in person the color is fresh and vibrant my macbook pro fits perfect inside . and its secured by a strap and extra padding inside only thing is no additional space or pockets but the fact that this case is slim , hard cover and a lot of protection inside i did n't mine the no additional space
this was just what i wanted in a case the greatest thing , it is also a lap pad and protects from the heat now to see if it goes through tsa when i am traveling
this item came on time and as described i wish i had found one with a pouch to put the charger but i did n't . ; -rrb- i recommend this case # %
it 's alright ... loved the fact that it was a durable sleeve for the <unk> however there is no where to put the charger that was a big pain ended up ordering another one that did come with a compartment to store your charger
