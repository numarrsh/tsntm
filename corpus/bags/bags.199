on my late # macbook pro , the case does not reliably stay snapped on -lrb- bottom part that rises up above the area near the touchpad -rrb- i 'm happy that it protects my mbp finish , but the & # # ; rubberized & # # ; is not so rubberized and the case scratches a ton
i ordered this case a little over a month ago , and i ca n't really say i 'm impressed with it i do n't feel the quality of the case is very good , as i 've started to notice some small cracks in the case after a month of use i 've also noticed that it left some small scratches on my macbook when i removed it to clean out the dust and dirt caught between the case and my computer i bought this case because i love the colors , but i 'm on the hunt for a new one to replace this
the case is pretty and once i realized that i needed to snap it into place on the bottom , it fit perfectly i like that there are vent slots on the bottom and pads for the case to rest on i also like that the case is transparent , so that i can see the decals on the front of my computer through the case this allows for more <unk> update : # and half months after buying this case , i have cracks in the case , with one piece actually falling out of the case -lrb- leaving sharp edges i 'm disappointed in the longevity of this case , especially considering i 'm always careful with my macbook and have never dropped it
loved the color & look and arrived quickly , but does n't fit have to return probably ~ # cm too big on each side never had an issue buying covers before - so <unk> disappointed , as we really wanted this cover
i do n't like the product it did n't fit well on my macbook , it did n't clip in all the way it 's also cracking and i 've only had it for a couple of months
i loved the color and i thought it would be great , when i put it on i felt like it did n't fit as perfectly as i thought it would after a few weeks there were cracks in it on the sides i still use it but you could easily get a better one
got it quickly and was exactly what i was expecting however , i needed to take it off to clean my computer and it snapped it was probably part my fault but i have not had this problem in the past with other cases similar to this one
bought this for my macbookpro mid # laptop the cover is nice but the foot pads are made of soft white material and started to crumble and leave white streaks when i <unk> my laptop on my desk
the purple cover is not true to the color advertised it came in a much lighter , duller purple still pretty , but not at all what i was hoping for the case itself cracked in several places -lrb- after about # or # months of medium wear and tear -rrb- , especially the corners i had to take it off because one spot was sharp i got this # months ago it 's alright for the price given also , be careful when putting it on and taking it off little plastic tabs are what hold it on , and if broken , it wo n't stay on anymore
i know it has to be # pieces so the computer can open/close , but the bottom does not fit as snug as the top it does not wrap over and & # # ; click & # # ; securely in place over the back corners and therefore slides off besides that , the material is great , looks great i 've had it for # days
how do you clean it ? i ordered it last week and it 's already soooo dirty ! ! ! i love the color and the look and feel but it really does n't fit the way it should and locks on to all
this product overall is okay ; the color is as pictured , and the fit is tight and feels safe however , the laptop can not close properly because of the case , so i am returning it
i am replacing identical item that had to be removed several times lately and the bottom no longer stayed on the new one has rough front edges that you feel when using track pad i still get compliments but next time will try another style
the only reason this product received three stars is because of the fact that it was delivered promptly otherwise , upon opening my package that i was beyond excited for , i saw that the case that i received is not at all the case pictured the color is actually a tiffany blue , and as a matter of fact , it says tiffany blue on the packaging why its labeled as a different color then , i do not know all i know is that i 'm thoroughly disappointed and will be returning the item it may seem like something small , but i expect to get what i order
a little bit more thick than i would like does n't fit the front corner exactly right , so there is a small ledge between the plastic and the computer when it should be flush -lrb- like the other side is -rrb- it 's a cheap <unk> until you upgrade to a better one
comes well protected and snapped on like a charm i had the lid snapped on backwards at first because no instructions or <unk> is provided however you 'll quickly notice when it 's not fitting right and fixing it was a no brainer definitely recommend it
update : # . # months : all corners are cracked , only one is chipped still serviceable , still very good grip , still very good protection other people say corners crack , maybe something they can fix -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- only a couple of weeks old , but so far the product is great seems sturdy protection and the rubberized texture means you have a more secure grip when lifting it in and out of the case it took a bit to fit the case snugly on the laptop -lrb- at first , i thought it did not work -rrb- , but once in properly , it seems secure the proof is in how long the <unk> lasts
i love the rubbery feeling , and the color is very pretty it does have some slightly raised edges around the keyboard area but it does n't really bother me much , only when it was super <unk> new
within a couple of months , my new <unk> had a couple of scratches on it , just from setting it down on tables or <unk> this case solved that problem easy on and off , it looks good and protects the outside of the mac
it 's already cracked around the sleep indicator light so i already need a new one i dropped my mac the day i tried to install it , so the frame is warped and the case does n't quite fit right
i really like it except that the top cover <unk> coming off it makes the computer slightly heavier , bit does a good job of protecting it the computer can still slide into my backpack even though the top case is rubberized all in all , i 'm glad i bought it serves it 's purpose well
bought this for my aunt and it fit perfectly , looked really good and matched the keyboard cover that i bought separately with it so far so good the & # # ; frost & # # ; / matte look looks really
product came just as advertised and the color is awesome the case snaps on in place easily and the bottom piece has an open back so the laptop lid can close overall very happy with my purchase
i do n't know what it is about this case , but it makes my computer look magical and i 'm always excited to start using it the case feels like a <unk> <unk> - i could n't ask for anything more it also arrived perfectly on time , thank you
finally a decent cover that does n't add too much bulk to my mbp my only gripe is when i open the mbp on my lap it will pinch either my legs or my pants but i ca n't fault them for that
shipped on time fits my # macbook pro perfectly it was even a little snug to get on , but once snapped into place it is not coming off the color was exactly at described
i have bought several similar covers on amazon this is the first one that fit perfectly and did n't crack within a few weeks i 'm very happy with this purchase so far
these are great i bought them because i already have a <unk> protecting the <unk> of my mac , but i needed something to cover the bottom this worked great because it comes in # pieces , so i did n't have to use the top piece protects my mac while not adding too much bulk and keeping it cool i would highly reccommend
looked a little flimsy at first but it snapped into place and fits perfectly still seems sturdy enough to protect computer but not add any weight and it 's a very pretty color in person
i bought this for my husband who had used a more & # # ; plasticky & # # ; one previously , which had cracked -lrb- hence , i was purchasing a new one -rrb- this one is more rubberized , and has a great grip and feel to it , which my husband loves , because his mac is so heavy , a good grip is essential my daughter also really liked it , so i replaced her old one with this one they both love it , and so far it has protected their -lrb- very expensive -rrb- laptops well
protect your computer from scratches and dings if you pay $ # to $ # for a mac why would n't you want to protect that investment . for the price you can not go
i just wrote a positive , five-star review of this product , for which i took the cover off and weighed it several of the the tabs broke when i tried to put it back on , making it useless will protect your laptop for sure , but obviously not made to come on and off repeatedly may buy another after i get over my <unk> should be more durable for the price
this cover fits well but the little plastic pieces that secure it in place break easily i treat my laptop very well and randomly i 'll notice that some of the plastic hinges have broken off otherwise it 's quite attractive and i think it 's a rather good purchase but dislike how i have to snap it on as it comes off due to the easily breakable plastic hinges
some will complain that this cover feels flimsy but like most computer covers , it feels quite sturdy once you get it on we did have some trouble with this process one of the clips on the bottom piece was bent too far in and would n't catch after several attempts with a hair dryer i was finally able to warm the plastic up enough to bend it to the correct position and then snap it on the computer proceed with caution should you have to do the same as i 'm sure one could accidentally break the tabs off completely trying to do this all is good now that we got the cover on though
i like that there is actually a shell available for the hp folio # , since i thought it would be a lost cause to even look but , to my surprise , i came across this item on amazon overall , i 'm pleased with the purchase it 's durable and fits well , and the rear feet extensions are a nice touch that allow the laptop to sit at a more comfortable angle however , i found the finish to be uneven and <unk> it 's somewhat matte in areas and somewhat glossy in other areas i was expecting a uniform matte finish and i agree with another reviewer that this case would be difficult to remove without breaking the clips , but i do n't have intentions of taking it off in the end , the benefits outweigh the cons of this shell case , and there are n't many other options for this laptop change the quality and texture of the plastic , and it will be perfect
i placed my order in the middle of september and still have not received the bag i purchased the bag through a living social deal this company -lrb- onna <unk> -rrb- has horrendous customer service also , there is not a customer service number listed on their website just received word that they could not deliver my bag due to a problem with the shipping address -lrb- i emailed them with the correct zip code -rrb- and it was returned to sender they are just about the most <unk> company i have ever ordered anything from ... and i still do n't have my bag # weeks later
purchased a bag for my wife at christmas , when my wife opened her <unk> she indicated that it was too large tried to contact the company with numerous emails at address indicated and have received no response at all it is like purchasing something at a <unk> market
i purchased the <unk> bag from onna <unk> from the today show i have to say i was disappointed the leather is thick , heavy , not soft like many of my purses reminds me of a briefcase it looks ok but to be honest with you , but it looks a little cheap to me i would not have purchase it if i had seen it in person
i did n't purchase this item though amazon but i always have the habit of looking for product reviews on amazon i am very surprised by the <unk> # - star reviews of this onna bag posted by the previous # reviewers if you look <unk> enough , almost all the reviews were made on the same day or within the same week it makes me very curious if not suspicious - the comments are highly positive , to the degree that they almost sound a bit ... <unk> imo , this is a nice , decent bag but it 's very big and of course spacious leather is of great quality although the hardware comes off as a little cheap i got it through a deal and it costs # of its original price , hence i 'd say it is somewhat worth it , given it 's soft leather and fashionable style
i also purchased two of these purses through the <unk> promotion - <unk> & turquoise colors loved them so much that i just ordered # more as gifts through another special promotion the company had e-mailed to me i will admit that it took until <unk> to receive the purses ordered at the end of july , but i was n't in a hurry for them so it was n't an issue for me the most recent e-mail indicated that the latest ones will ship <unk> # business days , so hopefully they will arrive in time for christmas as to the quality , the leather is really nice , the purse `` <unk> `` perfectly , the colors are nicer in person that they appear online , and i have received several complements on the purse as well at the reduced price -lrb- $ # -rrb- , it is well worth it
this past christmas , i went searching for a gift for my wife , but had no idea what to get her a coworker of mine suggested for me to check out onna <unk> handbags best advice ever when my wife opened up her gift , she was in love with her <unk> bag ! she uses it all the time definitely great quality saw some of the negative comments and i have no idea what they 're talking about never had any issues whatsoever looking to purchase another one for my wife 's birthday that 's coming up if you want an excellent gift option , this is truly your best bet
i really wanted to like this bag i used every day for a couple weeks , but i kept getting annoyed by the cutout for the handle at the top of the bag when the snaps that closed and the flap are connected and the adjustment straps are pulled tight , it is hard to get my hand all the way around the handle my fingers go underneath the flap and it is n't very comfortable you could keep the adjustment straps loose , but it is just a pain i went to staples and picked up a bag called the <unk> , that is more compact , has a built in binder and has a very comfortable handle i recommend that one instead
this was much nicer than i thought it would be , as i got it for a very nice sale price great construction , lots of storage room , tons of zippered compartments thank you amazon again
great bag at a good price classy look and practical the laptop function is so convenient for frequent flyers never take computer out of bag - of course unless you are in the presence of an <unk> tsa agent
i bought this bag to go along with a new laptop i purchased , and am really happy with it it really feels like a high quality bag , and i hope that it would last me many years to come
i like the size of the backpack and the design is great but the pocket -lrb- inside the top front pocket -rrb- and credit card pocket ripped , they are rarely used pockets that i would n't expect to rip the quality in the <unk> is lacking
this pack is perfect for a student this back pack seemed to have less pockets then most packs my home laptop is <unk> dv # c # us -lrb- # . # -inch screen -rrb- laptop - it fits but , its tight my work laptop is <unk> inspiron # . # -inch jet black laptop - up to # hours # minutes of battery life -lrb- windows # home premium -rrb- both fit individually but i ca n't have them both if i want to include anything else ; like a textbook
this targus laptop backpack is a great compact , multi-functional bag it has three separate compartments varying in size from the small - large with a padded slot for the laptop and an extra sleeve for your kindle or tablet my # `` toshiba slides right in and still <unk> room at the top to zip i choose the red color so it would stand out better , and the insides are a lighter shade of gray which helps to see the items that you always find hiding at the bottom of the bag the padded shoulder straps makes it very comfortable to wear and everything seems well distributed inside targus has always been a great brand and this backpack <unk> that quality
the targus products in general are good quality and practical , and this is no exception this is one that i reach for when i only need to take a laptop or a tablet and a few cords and maybe a spare battery and external drive and other small items with me it works well with a variety of different devices , that 's probably it 's biggest strength this is a very versatile backpack do n't rely on it to protect from heavy weather or heavy impacts though , this is a lightweight , versatile carry bag for electronics
i purchased this bag for a chrome book , knowing that the computer compartment would be over sized although that is true , it still holds my # . # inch chrome book well and centered it is well protected and padded it also holds all of the accessories that i need to carry as well as books that i might need for research i normally carry it by the handle on top , but the shoulder straps look well padded and comfortable
received my bag today , was delivered as <unk> , i love amazon for that like the bag but received it without the sholder strap great service is for <unk> if the product does not meet your expectations all pictures display a strap so that is what i expected
i travel a lot for my business purposes and i was looking for a good briefcase to make my life easy after a long research , i decided to purchase this <unk> titan full grain heavy duty leather briefcase messenger laptop bag when it arrived , i was really impressed by the quality the notable feature about this briefcase is that it is equipped with a large number of pockets i got the opportunity to pack my stuff in those pockets in a convenient way and stay away from the hassle this is a user friendly briefcase and it does not cause any issue for me during travelling it has enough space even for my # inch laptop the briefcase is made out of full grain durable leather and i can feel its durability i will not have to replace my briefcase again for the next few years because this has everything that i want the amount i paid to purchase this was a great investment that i made towards my future
the smell alone is worth the price more pockets than i need , but i am learning where i keep things the zippers are strong and easy to use i carry a laptop . a tablet , # small cameras and some files with me at all times , and i still have plenty of room for more stuff i ca n't count how many bags i 've tried and sent back , but this is a keeper !
this bag was bought for our up and coming professional daughter she wanted form and function along with stylish looks without the sacrifice of quality this bag holds all fits all and satisfies all when it comes to covering all the bases got it in # days and it is perfect could travel with it anywhere i 'm jealous i want one
great looking bag , it is large and structured . there are a lot of nice pockets so far the only thing i 've noticed missing is a key clip inside a larger pocket that said , the first trip through tsa security and the zipper is already malfunctioning i would love to get my money back for this as it was an expensive item i 've only had it for # weeks my cheap bag lasted years
i bought it in september and now its march and it already falling <unk> choice . there is better ones in the market than this one for example thule . it is small for college students
i bought this for my commute to downtown <unk> -lrb- meaning not rough school use -rrb- the first one i received had a zipper that <unk> almost immediately i returned and amazon sent me another one right away the second backpack has lasted little less than a year and the same thing occurred with the main compartment zipper it now can not be securely shut all the way for the cost and brand i expected higher quality zippers
i read review upon review to find a great backpack for my son , who is a <unk> in high school he is in all <unk> classes and has a lot of books and notebooks to carry to and from school every day his jansport was still good after three years but i wanted to get him something that could protect his laptop as he needed it more at school for projects we loved this bag as soon as it came -- the color , size and structure were perfect but after one month of school , the zippers broke it is n't just that the teeth are n't catching -- the pull tab fell off in pieces for the two main compartments ! ! i was so sure that this would be a winner based on the samsonite brand and reviews . . but now he is back to the jansport until we find something better
the bag itself is awesome , very stylish and practical too bad the zippers are so delicate and sensitive i returned one after the zipper had broken in only # weeks the new one endured about half a year and then again - zipper malfunction , now the bag ca n't close it 's a shame they put zippers more suitable for a purse in a bag that should support heavier loads and no , i did not overfill it
overall , this is not a bad backpack case the little loop thing at the top tore partially off after only a month of use and now i ca n't return it so i 'm very disappointed in that aspect of it it could also use some more stash pockets inside and the outside water bottle holders are partially open and too small for some standard water bottles next time , i 'll go somewhere to view them in person first
the quality of the bag is great besides , the design is wonderful however , the bag is too heavy too carry all day , and sometimes i prefer to use another bag just to avoid carrying much weight
after <unk> around with backpacks with air <unk> that kept going flat and a & # # ; fly thru & # # ; laptop bag that started coming apart , i found this backpack i do n't like backpacks with lots of <unk> me of old michael <unk> <unk> this pack has enough pockets without having too many zippers the internal organization is <unk> i wish they 'd used a smooth surface vs. the felt feel <unk> have rough skin on my hands and it tends to snag this stuff otherwise , it 's a nicely organized , well made laptop backpack i 'd buy it again
i am looking for something to replace my existing backpack which is starting to fray on the side after reading the reviews , i ordered this item the package arrived on time as promised it has stylish design but functional it was not compact as i imagined but it has the room to put items like pocket book , smartphone and accessories , water bottle , power cords , mouse as examples if i use this for business travel i am happy with the purchase
actually i want a small one for my # in mac pro and one or two books when i received it , i do n't think it is the right one and i decided to return it however , one of my friends came to see me and was very interested in it he thought it was very functional for making everything in it well managed so i <unk> the return request and send it to my friend
looks better than i expected and i have been using it for a few months and still seems brand new does n't bend or fold very flat , holds its puffy shape all by itself its a bit hard to carry on one shoulder for me , but very comfortable if i use both shoulders
bought or college <unk> he uses every day , is holding up great # months in . really he only carry 's what is needed for that days classes which is about two a day it all fits ... snug ... but fits do n't think would work very well for hs kids carrying tons of books from hour to hour
this backpack is well-designed and sturdy with plenty of secure storage i do n't doubt that it would hold up quite well to any abuse i might have been able to give it my only complaint is one that does n't show well in the photos ... the case is primarily black , but has fluorescent blue trim and <unk> the inside of the pockets are also lined in the same bright blue for me , one who wanted to use this when i meet with clients , that 's just not professional enough for my <unk> standards with that in mind , i had to return it and look to something else again , the product is great , and would be perfect for a college student or perhaps someone younger who does n't meet with clients for sales purposes , but for the <unk> professional , it 's not a fit
very light compared to other bags i prefer small bags usually to find this a bit bit although this is of course a relative thing the size actually come in handy when stuffing jackets and things in there
i bought this backpack off amazon , it arrived quickly and all is great , except the fact that the bottom is n't plastic ; so if the floor is wet , your laptop might not make it by the way , my old samsonite had plastic water proof bottom
the backpack is very good looking , and the material is great after all , it is a samsonite but i expected it to be a little more spacious you can a laptop , and to big # -subject notebooks with it it is not really good for all purpose uses , like for a trip it does not have a holder for the laptop it is comfortable , and shock absorb thing seem to be working
the size is perfect for what i expected please note that a laptop that 's # ' # inches just manages to fit into the laptop area ! the materials could be better but i 'm glad i got it for really cheap :
after reviewing many sites and checking multiple backpacks this is the one i decided to buy and i am very happy about my decision i had good experiences with samsonite bags before and that 's one of the reasons i chose this one the bag always stand upright -lrb- even when it is empty -rrb- which gives it a nice looking appearance the shields in the laptop compartment are perfect for people like me who tend to throw away their bag when they get home the shoulder pads are designed very well and even the time my bag was very heavy i do n't feel much on my shoulders
the design is great , it stands by itself even if empty material seems good except the back support , it 's kinda like sponge in net so after carrying it , the net gets rubs and balls are form hope it wo n't break apart oh ya , it can carry heavy weight got this for my son as a <unk> bag u can carry by the handle in heavy weight too ! ! it 's a hard and well made handle , not those that seems to be breaking when u carry in heavy weight
i think is comfortable but if you 're going to be late and you need running the backpack does n't help it would be better if it had a belt across the breast like other backpack
i 've had this backpack for about a month now , so far i like it very much i carry a macbook pro # & # # ; & nikon d # for work and this backpack works well for me - the laptop compartment provides great protection - the macbook fits in very well - the main compartment is a little ` deep , ' pro - you can fit a lot in there , con - hard to reach for smaller item - the front compartment is perfect for smaller items , i place my writing pad , tablet , pens etc . in there
almost perfect backpack it fits everything you need for short and quick travels the only thing i didnt like its the feeling that the upper strap is fragile , but have n't had any problems with it
the quality is top notch , no doubt . the padding on the back makes it more bulky and you would not want to carry this bag everyday to work / college but its too rugged and strong and worth carrying for travel . it has a lot of required compartments
i love this backpack it 's cushioned so it does n't hurt as much as other ones do when you carry them it also holds a lot ! plus , it protects my laptop with it 's built in padded compartment
i got this backpack a really long time ago , but never put a review on it , till i use it for a little while , the quality is really good , and very <unk> ! !
my husband ordered this to replace a laptop backpack that he carries every day so far , so good seems to be holding up well to daily use with a heavy laptop and other work items would definitely recommend
it 's perfect for my # . # in laptop and lots of other stuff you can feel it 's quality when you 're using it the details also look very cool bottom line , i think it 's a <unk>
this suitcase is very confortable and large , so you can carry everything you want perfect for laptops or tablet great for professor or students or just for a good trip
i like it because it earned me points with my wife -lrb- who i bought it for -rrb- she loves the way it looks and is proud to walk around campus with it it has comfy pockets in it that i wish i could fit into she say 's its the best back pack she has ever had this thing has so much padding on the side that is against your back that its like a pillow it 's also built like a tank , so i 'm pretty sure <unk> uses this one
i 'm happy with the backpack samsonite voice air and you can upload all kinds of accessories you need and gives you the protection that the backpack you are sure they will not have any damage
i was a little hesitant about ordering a computer backback without being able to see it , but i 'm really glad i selected this the quality and workmanship are what i would expect from samsonite i like the extra protection the shock bumpers bumpers give to my laptop there is plenty of room for my laptop , ipad , books , cables and accessories i would buy this again without hesitation
i really like this backpack , it protects your laptop really well and i also i like the fact that this backpack has a compartment where you can put your tablet in and protects it from the impacts also it is very confy once you put it on your back you would n't be able to notice it was there , it has a very soft and confy side on the back of it and it also has lots of compartments where you can put lots of stuff on it the only complain about it is that it has a very short distance where you can adjust the size of the bands , but while time passes you will get use to it i really like this product i will recomend this backpack to all of the people who likes to have their laptop safe or tablets safe
i use this backpack to carry around my # & # # ; laptop and various books it seems well padded , and it is certainly comfortable i read a review that said it was hard to clean and stained easily i have n't put that to the test yet - i love the color -lrb- the gray <unk> a little -rrb- and i do n't want to do anything that might <unk> that maybe i will try and apply a fabric protector ...
ok , for the <unk> out there , quit complaining because no one bag can do everything this backpack is well made , sturdy , provides good padding on the bottom of it for your laptop it has pockets for your laptop , cell phone and tablet
stone -lrb- international graduate student from china here is some of my personally view that may help u ~ # . big enough to put a # inch laptop # . good looking + feel solid structure enough , but need to practice # . cheap but useful -lrb- cause i got # % discount , only pay # + tax , maybe $ # i think -rrb- and i think it is also worth to pay the list price $ # # . famous brand that i can trust # . most important i always buy <unk> . from amazon directly . and amazon never let me down from china to us . so far so good
samsonite makes great <unk> and that i why i bought this for my daughter she just started school today and i will let you know how it turns out i believe in the quality and reputation of samsonite
i bought this a gift for my younger brother who was starting college this year he had just bout a new laptop and i wanted to make sure he was able to get it to and from class with everything else he was going to have to lug he loves it it 's got a special area just for the laptop -lrb- he has a large macbook air -rrb- and it fits great it 's super padded and has extra space for big books , a spot for your phone or <unk> and have really padded straps for the money you are certainly getting what you pay for
- i have now owned this backpack for four months and have used it everyday , sometimes with light and sometimes with heavy loads - when viewing it on amazon , the flashy blue color had me worried , but i purchased it anyway and i 'm happy to report that it 's not half as flashy as it seems in the pictures here - the padding on the bottom does its job which is to both protect your laptop from harsh impacts , as well as prevent the backpack from toppling over which can be a nuisance - the shoulder straps are comfortable and cushioned - the front pocket is especially useful if you own a <unk> of these are to be expected from a quality backpack anyway , but the construction quality here is the most impressive feature that it has n't lost its form even under the <unk> use of a student who usually carries multiple books , papers , and a laptop is further testament to the build quality
bought this bag because i needed it for work the pads on back helps by giving you support the bag has a lot of pockets so it 's easy for me to put my laptop -lrb- # inch macbook pro -rrb- and a tablet in another pocket good for my tools as i am a tech and need the space i read people have zipper issues within the first month , so far i have n't experienced any issues with the bag
this is a very nicely made backpack , well padded in all the right places to protect the contents and the shoulders and back of the wearer it has a type of rubber shock absorbing system on the outside bottom of the bag to protect the contents if the bag is dropped or set down hard the handle on the top is almost as sturdy as what you would expect on a small piece of luggage for the size , compartments , and level of padding i thought it was very reasonably priced i am not in school but think this would be a great pack for a student it expands to quite a large size i was seeking a bag for travel and something a little smaller so i returned it but it was not due to the quality or the price of the bag i would recommend it and would not hesitate to purchase it if it met my needs
if this bag has anything , it 's too much space the ad says it can fit a # `` ; it can actually fit a # `` laptop and my umbrella , tablet , several <unk> , a few hardcover graphic novels , ad various other gadgets , <unk> , and doodads and i still have space when i 'm finished with my umbrella , i can put it in one of the side pockets so it wo n't get my other contents wet i love this backpack
really light on the shoulders -lrb- when compared to a similar bag with the exact same things in it -rrb- the laptop compartment is well padded , the rest of the division inside is also great
bought it as a family backpack for trips used it during <unk> trip recently , love it if i must complain about something , then the exterior side pockets are not deep enough sometimes the water bottle may fall out if the backpack is tilted
i like this bag a lot it protects my laptop well , has very efficient organization pocket in the front , and the main pocket expands when you unzip to make it really easy to find things in my backpack without being a <unk> backpack
i really liked it and it is quite spacious and is very strong also and i feel it is super comfortable i would really recommend it to use i am loving
i received this backpack yesterday and i must say i am very impressed the backpack is just the right size -lrb- fits a # . # `` screen laptop -rrb- and offers tremendous room for books and miscellaneous items without coming across as bulky the zippers feature waterproof technology and the backpack looks absolutely stunning with electric blue features around the external edges the inside padding is also surprisingly soft the bag features # main pouches -- the smaller one offering a compartment for <unk> storage the cushioned straps and exterior make the bag easy on the shoulders and back samsonite has hit a <unk> here in terms of features , design and practicality
