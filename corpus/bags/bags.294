this case was an amazing purchase -lrb- got mine in royal blue -rrb- nothing really spectacular , but it does the job perfectly for me what i really do like about it is that it has n't melted whenever my laptop would overheat which it a huge plus i also have gotten numerous compliments on it which is nice overall , i really enjoyed the product and it 's a great bang for your buck
the case delivered on time and i love it so far it did fit my macbook air # & # # ; laptop the color is what i was expecting i would recommend to others about this product
fits my macbook perfectly and the color is beautiful just as advertised i 'm very happy with this purchase i bought this mainly for cosmetic reasons , to prevent scratching and fingerprints on the outside of the computer it does a great job and i love that the case is rubberized , so i do n't have to worry about it sliding off of my lap while i 'm using it
i love this product i wanted the protection and it snapped in place well i did have to try the top twice as one clip would n't ' t catch at first but then i <unk> starting with back clips and it all snapped in this means the there is no play once installed , no shifting and therefore no scratching the finish provides a better grip on the laptop and more secure to hold of course the colors are nice i got the orange and my daughter got the light blue apple light shines through the keyboard cover is n't a perfect fit , so i am trying it and appreciate reducing dust and all from <unk> up the keyboard i feel like it is doing exactly what i need
this case looks as is on the picture very nice and sturdy i absolutely love it i would recommend to anyone looking for a hard shell case cover for macbook air # & # # ;
i 've been using this case for a whole college year now and it has been great to my laptop i definitely recommend it for it is soft , slim , and protects the mac from unexpected damages
terrific macbook air case for the price : good quality , fits well , and arrived on time even better that the case is available in a nice shade of yellow , a difficult color to find -lrb- made my daughter quite happy -rrb- this product and seller are both highly recommended
i really like this cover it is good quality and i have gotten a lot of compliments for it it is the & # # ; tiffany & # # ; blue color and it words great for on the go
i have bought the more expensive cover that costs # . # and this one is of the same quality def . will be purchasing one of these covers for my mac pro
i love this case it replaces the one that i had before that cracked i need these cases to protect my investment one of the best parts about the case is the rubber grips on the bottom they hold my computer in place when it is on a <unk> , <unk> or desktop the last case i bought had grips that came off in the first i owned it - and it cost # times as much thanks , topcase
very pleased with this case , since it snaps on easily and provides sufficient protection to the computer from regular mobile usage i would recommend this case to mac air users besides , this company provides prompt shipment
the color is perfect and looks absolutely amazing on was delivered in three days if you are interested in the least bit i suggest you buy now , you wo n't regret it
clicked on no problem took me # seconds and only because i was being careful i dont like cases i still do n't use one on my iphone i was leery about purchasing one for my mac i am extremely satisfied with this case it take nothing away from the & # # ; air & # # ; in my macbook thin , sleek , and elegant
this is such a great case holds up very well and does n't add a lot of bulk be sure to put the top lid on the correct direction as others have stated , this case is very difficult to remove i installed the lid the wrong direction the first time , and ended up using an old credit card to pry the case off without scratching the macbook
got this case in the hot blue for my macbook air # `` and i love it ! the top and bottom parts snap on easy and the outside is a soft rubber that is kind of translucent , but still very easy to hold it is easy to clean -lrb- i always get makeup on everything -rrb- using just a dry cloth i did n't really like the mouse pad mainly because i was expecting it to be the same color as the case and it was like some random cheap looking thing . overall , the case is exactly what i wanted and the hot blue is true to color from the pictures on amazon.com great purchase and super cheap !
this product deserves # stars for its quality and durability i love not having to worry about the bottom of my computer getting gross and dirty the product feels very soft yet strong this is by far my favorite case
as soon as i bought my macbook air i bought this and it 's awesome it snapped right into place the only minor issue with it , is it does get dirty quickly but as long as you maintain it every once in awhile its a really awesome case i know lots of other people that have this same case in other colors and they all look great really pleased with this product
lightweight , easy , snaps right on , does not add bulk but protects it and allows a better grip of an otherwise slippery mac price was extremely reasonable , $ # ! ! ! highly recommend , and it comes in great colors
the color matches the picture so my wife was very pleased it snapped into place easily and fits perfectly i emailed the seller to confirm that our model would fit this product and they replied quickly
i received the black addition in about # days and i was very impressed its a cool mate black not glossy and seems pretty sturdy and was easy to install id buy it again and would recommend it
i have the newest model of the macbook air and this case fits like a glove it only took about # seconds to attach and the red color is super vibrant the satin rubberized texture does not show any fingerprints that i have been able to detect and is nice of a little extra grip over the aluminum body for less than $ # i was beyond satisfied with what i got
i ensured my id # matched the # it said it fits easy to apply all the fittings are just right seems more secure for the air does make the top a bit more awkward be careful not to let its weight move the top without your help
bought this for my son 's new macbook air he uses for school since the notebook has to last him at least three more years a little protection makes sense the topcase provides that protection as an added bonus it 's less likely to attract fingerprints than the macbok air itself takes seconds to snap it on and fits perfectly
i 've got the case earlier than i thought i 'll get it at first it seems not really nice , but when i put it on my mac i felt in love with this case and the color -lrb- aqua blue -rrb- is wonderful this case does n't make my mac thicker and i did n't notice the different between using the mac with and without the case now i can put my mac on the glass table and i 'm not afraid that it 'll get a scratch .
this is my second case for my macbook air - the first was a well known name with an expensive price tag it was made out of hard plastic - it cracked after having it for a few weeks this case fits so well - its snug and does n't come off when opening and closing the top like my first case did colour is bright and
i love this cover i first bought a $ # black cover at best buy but i took it back when i saw this one i love the pink and the quality is the same or better than the $ # cover i am so glad i bought this one =
i bought this hard case cover and it arrived with the bottom piece of the cover broken i contacted the seller , sent him a picture of the damage and he sent out the new piece right away very happy with the product and the seller the case fits the macbook air perfectly
this shell is lightweight and fits the mac like a glove it is obviously way strong - it came in a flimsy plastic bag with no padding , withstood the us postal service handling and arrived in <unk> condition
fits well on my macbook air -lrb- mid # version -rrb- very lightweight , but still sturdy , easy to put on , looks great , feels nice - smooth but more rubbery , less plastic-y great color , looks solid but apple light shines through easily exactly what i was looking for and an awesome price update # : the bottom case pieces have broken off -lrb- with standard use -rrb- , keeping the bottom part from staying on the computer unfortunately , this makes the case much less useful
at the apple store i was looking for a case that i saw the genius bar <unk> were using that was so attractive it was suggested i look at amazon what i found was this case along with the key cover color is a knock out plus the feel of the case no more fingerprints actually ordered two different cases and this is my favorite by far would recommend - # stars
i love my hot blue rubberized case for my macbook air it fits my # & # # ; like a glove the color and feel of the case is amazing as well would definitely recommend
i would recommend this product to anyone looking for something to protect their macbook the color is just how it looked online and i know this case will protect my computer this company is speed and great
i bought this for my macbook air # & # # ; and i really love the color it is a tiffany blue color the only thing is i wish it was a little more see through so you can see the apple logo when its not on it does show when it is on but not when it is off also i decided to buy a decal sticker so it does n't look so plain but overall i am happy with it and i love how it feels
this case not only looks great , but the price is even better i almost bought the case from apple for $ # , but tried this instead for $ # and i could not be
i love it ! i drop my laptop like all the time and this case saves it from being dented or scratched i love the color so cute ! i used to own a speck laptop case which costed me a lot more like $ # i think . . and that thing cracked after a few drops . this case , i probably dropped it twice as much as when i had the speck one and not even a scratch or dent in sight i love this ... and it 's so much cheaper too .
i bought the clear case which is very nice it gives the macbook air a non slippery feel was very simple to put on -lrb- there were no directions -rrb- by lining up the bottom and setting it in the shell then snap on the top
it fit my laptop perfectly and was really easy to install -lrb- just snap it on ! -rrb- the color really pops too , i picked the robin blue color one thing though is when i slide it around on my glass table , the white rubber legs peel a bit
the case and color is exactly what it looks like in the picture i love the texture of the case hard to take off , but its a good thing when you accidentally drop the laptop would definitely recommend this case because it 's not a bad price for something that will do the job of protecting your laptop
i initially ordered the wrong case -lrb- bought it for macbook air and needed it for macbook pro -rrb- , return was simple and easy , product was great - error was mine we were able to easily order the correct one and got it promptly great company to work with , great product - especially for the money
my $ # speck cover broke within # months so i was looking for a replacement i bought this in the robin egg blue and i love it fits easily , love the rubber feel and the color is a replica of <unk> i ca n't believe how cheap it was -- i actually like it better than my
fits my june # macbook air without any problems it may crack like other hard cases i have purchased before but for under $ # i really ca n't complain i got mine in the green color and it is very similar to the picture and is very pretty i get lots of compliments
when it initially arrived it was broken , probably from how it was handled through the mail but the seller responded quickly and sent me a replacement this is a wonderful case , many people ask me where did i buy i definitely will recommend to others thank you very much
it 's exactly the color of a tiffany & co. box , it 's a really nice color to look at it fit my new # & # # ; macbook air perfectly it also arrived early which was a plus
orange is my favorite color , so i was excited to fine a shell case that was n't $ # instead i found this one at less than $ # and am completely happy with it
i ordered my first case for $ # from apple and it cracked within a few weeks this was was much cheaper and seems to be more sturdy and works so well for me
i think this case is great it is soft to the touch and the color is beautiful , installation was very simple as well makes my mac stand out
i had gotten this case for my new macbook air let me say that it was worth every penny the moment you snap this case on , you know that # it is not going to come off -lrb- which is what you want ! -rrb- # it looks and feels as if it will protect my computer from those pesky scratches # . compared to the other cases , this one keeps my computer sleek and slim all in all , this is an amazing purchase
i bought the black version of this case for my new macbook air # model , # , and it fits perfectly ! the case feels very nice and high quality it 's a hard case but has sort of a <unk> texture that feels very nice i 'm glad my apple logo is still shown clearly through the case the case can get dirty if you have oily hands , but it 's easily cleaned with some water my only complaint is that the feet of the case do look a little cheap -- like they 're made of some kind of foam they should have been made of some nice durable rubber if you ask me however , i feel like they will be good enough for what i 'll be using the case for , so i do n't mind much i was about to consider buying the $ # dollar speck macbook cover at the apple store , but i 'm so glad i bought this instead for just # bucks ! i 'm extremely satisfied and i love this case
i have a # & # # ; macbook air -lrb- late # with <unk> the case fits perfectly and even has an opening for the dual mics the rubber feet are a neat addition i did n't think i 'd need them , but they prevent my laptop from sliding off the <unk> desks that we have in my school
this was the case i have been searching for it fits perfect and very slimline looking i had a speck case but price was too high and this one fit better i bought two more just so i can change the outside decals , provided by <unk> , whenever i wanted great customer service as well they are very <unk> and able to easily get in touch with thank you topcase
so easy to put on computer and love the color i bought it to protect my new computer from dings and scratches should work very well the price was also great
well honestly , i would have given it four stars because the case itself is n't anything special it does fit my laptop , but i feel it could be a bit tighter fit but it 's not so loose that it 'll fall off just do n't drop it lol i also wish it came with labels so you could tell which way it goes on , but it 's not hard to figure out however , i have given this product five stars because it said the delivery would have taken a whole week , but i got it within three days i also love that the bottom has slits so that the laptop can breathe , otherwise it would overheat the color is true to the picture , which i got purple and it 's more of a lavender -lrb- as shown -rrb- it 's gorgeous all in all , great protection for the price you 're paying
i select this item for the color i bought a new computer for my niece -lrb- graduation gift -rrb- and need this item very fast for protecting the computer the shipment arrived on the same day it was written in amazon was really fast i thanks them this company really help us sending the merchandise <unk> on time
my case arrived in the mail just three days after i ordered it it fit the mba perfectly and is a little bit rubberized i was a little skeptical about the purple on the silver but it looks amazing it almost adds a metallic color with the silver computer
my case was just as described it fits well it actually arrived earlier than the shipping said that it would the only complaint that i have is that it makes the top of the computer heavier so sometimes the screen will tilt back without me wanting it to other than that though the product is perfect
one of my co-workers purchased one of these i was impressed , and got one for myself it snaps on pretty easily , and stays on the case was inexpensive , and has proper cutouts at all of <unk> on both sides - usb , earphones , etc . it does n't add any noticeable weight , and it has n't fallen off since i put it on i 'm glad i got it , as it seems to be doing a great job of protecting my macbook air
thank you for the pretty purple cover for my new mac , i love it , and feel safer now too it is so nice to see the apple through the top when i have it opened
this case is amazing fit like a glove and once it 's on it 's not <unk> and omg the price of a case at a retailer makes this a no brainer i just use it for work so i ca n't necessarily attest to it 's performance under pressure , but i just wanted to keep it safe from scratches and dents and it 's doing the job
great case ! ! ! ! i love the soft texture of the case the royal blue is gorgeous ! ! people might say its hard to snap on , its a bit challenging but once its on its awesome i love it so much ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! its a quick and easy case to put on , its protective and it doesnt make the bottom of your computer hot great case ! ! ! ! ! love it ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
i made this order on january # and although i did <unk> the delivery -lrb- received it jan # -rrb- , i was very surprised at how quickly it arrived needless to say i was happy with my purchase -lrb- robin egg blue -rrb- the color you see online is the color you get i got the same color sleeve bag cover case also and would actually make one recommendation for future <unk> -lsb- to the seller : please do n't fold the sleeve case ! it leaves an ugly crease
this was a very good product , it looks great , pretty color , plus it 's for a great price instead <unk> $ $ $ in target , staples , best buy , and etc . this is the place to get your laptop covers =-rrb- thank
exactly what i was looking for easy to put on a protective cover for scratches and everyday use without being cumbersome great color , thats easy to spot where i left it free mouse pad unnecessary , just a waste really happy with it
purchased with <unk> based on some negative reviews fortunately it arrived without any issues the material is slightly rubbery , but does not attract lint aside from the minor & # # ; cheap-looking & # # ; feet , product is great
i love the case as i read in the other reviews the older cases used to cover the second microphone on the side but this one is already fixed love the <unk> color and how well it fits my computer just what i wanted and how i wanted it
i am thoroughly enjoying my topcase rubberized hard case it looks awesome on my macbook air i definitely recommend this case to anyone wanting to enhance the appearance of their macbook
i recently purchased and macbook air for college and the first thing i did was purchase a case for it i 've had this case now for a few weeks and it 's working great , this case is proven to be wonderful and is protecting my investment better then expected thank you for selling a great product
it 's soft and sexy on the outside , yet you can feel the inner strength it possesses it holds my air in a loving <unk> and this quiet security like a mother 's love , makes my apple glow
i was really worried about all the customer reviews saying that it does n't fit and that it covers the second microphone hole i have an a # and it fit perfectly it does not cover the microphone it is hard to remove , but using a credit card -lrb- or another hard card -rrb- works well when trying to take it off slide it in and push it against the clips and it comes off i got it # days after i ordered it i like it so far , no complaints
great case for my mac book air clips right on and does n't slip off no matter how i carry or store the air great color selection i also have the red for variety
i love the fact that its a clear cover because you ca n't tell that there is a cover on it by simply looking at it it definitely helps protect my macbook air from oily hands and other dirt marks on the outer parts of the laptop it was not that hard to put on - just need to be a little patient
i thought it was too good to be true with the price because anywhere else at the stores they are like $ # or more when i got it in the mail and put it on my lap top i was very
i 've had mine for a few months and i just love it does n't make my air feel bulky i ordered the tiffany blue color and it 's just perfect one of the little feet has cracked a little , but i lug my computer around daily for work , so i would n't consider it a defect , just the reason i need a case :
fits well , its just as described , received prompt service , i would certainly buy from seller again purchased the clear cover so from across the room you can hardly tell that the macbook has a cover the rubber feet hold the mac securely on top of my pc which is <unk> as other customers have noted , the cover does n't show fingerprints and looks quite professional
yep , after the rolling computer bag , this was a must i <unk> one of these at my boss 's office even asked the guy -lrb- somewhat <unk> -rrb- if i could feel his case well it was perfect and amazon had one in purple
rubberized texture of case , does n't show fingerprints , and has # rubber feet and slots on bottom for heat release -lrb- accurately pictured -rrb- hot blue color is also nice arrives in mail with no instructions and minimal packaging , but undamaged both top and bottom have tabs that snap onto the laptop press top and bottom covers on until you hear a click and see that all the tabs have latched onto the laptop case covers all of the laptop except for the back hinge and port access there are no noises or movement of the pieces once installed easy to determine front/back of case bottom , but harder with the case top you 'll know you have top on correctly when the cutouts and tabs on the top and bottom of the case cover meet on the sides and front when the laptop is closed case does not seem to impede range of movement of the screen and the apple logo shines through the cover
this case is really protective and i love the rubbery feel to it i put a white sticker on my laptop and then the case over it and it still shows the sticker beautifully
the price was great and the color is exactly what it 's like in the picture -lrb- i got the light green one -rrb- i really like it so far and i like how it comes in different colors
did i mention , love ! ! love the color , love the feel , love the fit i just love it first mac and wanted something sturdy yet , feminine and professional , this is all that i am very happy with my purchase
not as transparent as the picture suggests that is the worst thing i can say , the fit is perfect and the price is great compared to the others that are $ # in big box stores
i give this case # stars i ordered the <unk> green case for my macbook air this has a great price compared to the apple store products , and speck products definitely a great buy !
i love it it makes my mac look even more perfect ! the corners seem a little not secure but i think it will be ok . i definitely recommend for the price
i love the case for my macbook air the case snapped right on and fits perfectly the color is light purple , just right great for the price also , the case does n't cover any of the microphones or anything else
it arrived fairly quickly and was very easy to assemble the purple <unk> nicely with the silver laptop , and it has a good feel to it it makes the laptop feel a bit heavier , but that 's okay because the mba was so light and delicate before that i was afraid to put it in my backpack now that it has more substance i feel like i can carry it around in my back back without worrying about it being bent or broken i am # % satisfied
i gave this rating because the service was great , it arrived sooner <unk> thought it would i love the case cover and i <unk> it to anyone who has a mac air because it comes indifferent colors , it adds more of a personal touch thank you , <unk>
i hesitated buying this case because of the reviews and because of the color but i could n't have been more pleased with my decision it was easy to put on and stays on just like it should the color of the pink case is n't quite as <unk> and light , like the picture shows instead it 's more of a normal pink , which is exactly what i hoped for my only suggestion is to clean the top of your laptop before putting on the case because fingerprints that were already there will show through the case i definitely recommend buying this case
i just bought a new # & # # ; macbook air , and i bought this case because it was cheap and pretty snazzy looking i did n't however , think it would save my computer in a fall or anything i just put this case on my computer yesterday - which fits very well by the way it only took a minute to get the bottom piece to clip correctly on on sides it fits snugly and securely , and the plastic is a nice smooth matte well , my computer took a tumble out of my bookbag today as i was picking my bag up it landed on its corner on a hard floor , and i was amazed to see zero damage to my machine the plastic did n't even break or snap , but bent a tiny bit so now i love this little case
great color and protects the computer nicely good quality and like the feel of the material no chance that my daughters computer will ever get mixed up with another one great price , shipped quickly and looks even better
what girl does n't want to open a tiffany blue case every day such a great way to update the look of my macbook it fits great , and makes me think of spring and robin 's <unk> and of course , expensive jewelry
cheap , great protection . just a little hard to uninstall overall tell your grandma , tell your kids , tell your wife tell your <unk> wife haha , that this is the best case for mba around
so far , it has worked well for my macbook air i love that it is a bright color and that it has little rubber feet so the laptop does not move around while i am working on it
the package arrived on time and was packaged very well the case color was exactly what i expected it was easy to attach -lrb- snap it on -rrb- and it fits perfectly
i bought an older macbook air so i can run snow leopard this case fits perfectly the outside is smooth i 'm thinking about buying another set for my macbook pro
it is unique , the color ... it is not as yellow as the picture rather is is gold which i think its ten times better ... for any one , any gender just great ! ! very slow shipping tho but when it does arrive , you ca n't be mad
easy to put on , i love the color -lrb- soft but saturated pink -rrb- and the texture is great i ca n't speak to the level of protection yet , but it feels very sturdy and secure the cushioned feet on the bottom are lovely too , no more scraping the table when i use my
case fits my air wonderfully ! i would reccomend this product to anyone wanting to protect their macbook . i have yet to drop it , but am certain it will be safe from at least
do n't throw money away on similar cases that can cos up to $ # this case shipped fast and slipped on to my macbook air without a problem it looks great and the price is right
this cover was really cheap so i was afraid i would get what i paid for but it is actually great the color is vibrant and the smooth finish feels really nice i previously bought a $ # cover from the apple store and it broke really easily this feels much sturdier and looks nicer too very happy with the purchase in fact , i 'm planning to buy another one for my niece for christmas ! : -
great case for the price easy to put on , hard surface for good protection but it has a soft feel to it color is good too recommend if your trying to save money
item arrived on time and is exactly what i ordered adds a nice feel of protection to the mac and comes with slits so that the air can vent out on bottom
i ca n't really say anything bad about it it feels nice to the touch , the fact that it 's rubberized and not plastic i get lots of looks at the computer because it stands out
