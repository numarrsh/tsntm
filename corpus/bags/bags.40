this is a great bag for this price i did not buy it from amazon -lrb- i actually stumbled upon it at best buy for $ # more -rrb- i am <unk> to have spent more than necessary , but it 's worth it even at $ # i use it to carry a large laptop and because all of the internal compartments close with zippers , nothing falls out despite the one clasp that keeps the bag itself closed i 've received several complements i 'm already concerned about what i 'll do when -lrb- if ? -rrb- it ever breaks you ca n't go wrong
when my last messenger bag , that i <unk> loved and so much <unk> on literally died , i was <unk> in finding a suitable match not only did i find that , but more this bag is lighter and much more versatile it came to me faster than promised and right on time great product , great vendor and as always , thank you amazon for hooking me up
great size bag to carry <unk> from my car to the building have n't been using it as a laptop bag and it still has tons of room to organise everything
it case itself is nice padding is not too thin but thin enough to not be bulky i just disliked the color i was expecting a grayish color and its much <unk> than i thought i was also expecting the inside to be neon orange and its more the a <unk> , <unk> color i was n't a fan it did however fit my lenovo ideapad # . # & # # ; well though
i love love love this herringbone pattern it fits my computer comfortably , and it so easy to slide into my tote back or bookbag , love this case and use it all the time
if you 're looking for a nice little inexpensive case , this is it keeps it safe from accidental scuffs , scrapes , bumps etc . the case itself does n't come in a lot of colors but it still serves its purpose not too flashy other than the inside which is a drastically different color than the out who really cares though since it 's not like you even pay attention to what the inside looks like anyway the fact that it does n't stand out with flash designs or colors makes it look more professional which is better in my opinion basically it 's a nice case for the value
i am pretty happy with this laptop sleeve , it is a bit taller than my laptop , but is a great width and was much cheaper than a lot of the sleeves made for my specific laptop i was -lrb- happily -rrb- surprised to see bright red lining in the case , but slightly disappointed with the amount of padding in the sleeve it will definitely work , but i think i was a bit spoiled by the neoprene sleeve i had for a previous computer overall a great buy and worth it
love this case fit my # . # & # # ; lenovo laptop with room to spare quality feels good and has a nice texture to it love the color too it may be a bit deeper brown than pictured but looks great recommending this case to a friend for their laptop too
this is a sturdy and attractive laptop cover there 's no going wrong with it 's neutral gray herringbone pattern , perfect for office , travel and anywhere keeps your laptop protected when not in use the interior is a bright orange in contrast to it 's subdued outside appearance i love the protection and the appearance
i got this sleeve taking the risk that it would fit my # . # `` samsung np # c -lrb- the new series # -rrb- it fits ... just the long way , it is a tight fit , but not stretching anything maybe an extra quarter inch and it would be perfect though however , it closes without issue , and while inside , the zipper is padded so i 'm not worried thankfully , i am able to have my logitech mini usb in the laptop as well vertically , there is a good . # `` extra room the orange interior is cool
i love this laptop sleeve it 's durable and fits in my backpack it keeps my laptop safe from scratches and pretty much anything else that could physically damage my laptop i have a # `` toshiba laptop that fits inside of it perfectly the exterior color is very basic , very masculine , and the orange inside provides a very stylish contrast to the outside i 'm very well pleased with my purchase the shipping was very quick also
i use this to store my large laptop while i lug it to , from , and around campus i like the material on the sleeve as well as the extra protection that it offers my laptop it also protects my laptop from anything that may harm it in my backpack yes , i would recommend this product
i read the reviews on this product before purchasing it and decided to get it anyways because i have a fairly large laptop but when it arrived , i was shocked how large it actually was way to big and am returning it bummer because it is super cute but it does n't do any good if my laptop is sliding around in it
like really ugly . and it feels weird i got the wrong size because i measured my laptop corner to corner and added an inch for cords etc . the one i got is huge , could hold two laptops is n't very thick to offer protection alone , more of a in your big bag cover be careful of your sizing because it was going to cost me as much to pay to return it than it did to buy it because the error was in my sizing
this is not the proper fit for a # & # # ; laptop its <unk> but does n't fit it was super cheap , so i do n't complain but really are you saving money by getting things that do n't work properly
i bought this sleeve for my macbook pro however this sleeve is too big for macbook pros , thus it 's useless for me i have to admit that for larger laptops it could be a very good sleeve since the quality and asthetics of the sleeve is very good
does the job wish it were a little <unk> and had a handle or carry strap tight fit if you take power cord & wireless mouse with <unk> print on
i ordered this case in the plaid color but received a brown color which was bit of a disappointment it fit perfect on the sides but pretty loose around the top -lrb- toshiba # . # `` -rrb- overall , it 's ok for the price
this item is good enough to store your laptop but not really provide protection a little bit big for my # . # laptop which is actually good cause i can also store my ipad or other stuff price is reasonable for a case logic
i am incredibly impressed with how fast this got here it literally got here the next day i like the product a lot however i did order the plaid one and i received the tan one , which i am sort of unhappy about however the product is good and the fast shipping sort of makes up for it
got this for my ipad looks good and protects well enough , but it is designed more for a netbook than a tablet , so there is a fair amount of extra room with the ipad inside it 's not necessarily a bad thing , but something to be aware of in any case , it functions as expected
this is a nice netbook sleeve , however it is a little big for my ipad and i would n't really recommend it for an ipad it seems well made and is attractive enough , but does n't have many bells or whistles it is a basic unit for the price , it is a good carry case for a netbook if you do n't need anything but a nice-looking basic case
this is a very straightforward sleeve thin , fairly dense , stretchy foam and one zipper the interior is bright orange i 'm currently using it to hold an ipad which is also in the stiff <unk> case which apple makes using the both of them , i feel comfortable tossing the ipad into my purse it 's quite a bit oversized for the ipad -- i think i could fit two or three of them in there , but instead i 've tossed in a couple accessories too i have n't yet tried fitting a netbook inside , but since the material stretches , i think something with a tighter fit would work better the material looks nice and tailored , very much as pictured if you 're looking for a simple , nice-looking sleeve for your netbook or ipad , this is a good choice
having recently acquired a # -inch netbook , i was looking for an easy-to-use case for transport -- and this is it this case logic product seems to be durable and well-made , with a single zipper that opens from the top corner and down one side , so i do n't have to fumble with multiple zippers my netbook slips out quickly , and i 'm ready to work it also doubles as a temporary lap desk , though for short periods only , since the case will block your heat vents the outside of the case is a soft fabric that probably wo n't show much wear , and inside , the case is lined with neoprene to give some added protection to the netbook the case does stretch a bit , so some people may be able to wedge in a brick plug ; otherwise , there 's no provision here for accessories
my major concern about the caselogic # . # inch laptop sleeve was whether or not it would actually fit my samsung n # . # inch netbook -lrb- i knew it should , but ` should ' and ` would ' are n't always in <unk> . the case is easy to use , with an <unk> zipper , soft outer cover and neoprene padded interior i like it better than the freebie cover that came with the computer because it actually fits better and is less bulky the brown herringbone with <unk> interior works for us , since both my spouse and i use the same netbook when we travel we both like the tailored appearance bottom line : five stars for the price , it 's a good buy
this appears to be one of those things that is better in concept than in reality the outer plaid fabric is horribly bunched and wrinkled , with a texture similar to the <unk> <unk> used in summer clothing with a summery pastel plaid , that 's one thing , but if you bought this thinking it would look professional , you may be disappointed the wrinkles are consistent across the fabric , it does not appear to be the result of a manufacturing error , though even in extreme <unk> zoom , i ca n't see similar ones clearly in the product image additionally , while this case comes up suggested for the ipad , it probably would n't be my first choice for that product , as it 's oversized in width when used with the bare device the excess width means the device slides around quite a bit within the case , rather than fitting snugly padding is extremely minimal , enough to protect against scratches from other things you may be carrying , but expect little more than that in the way of protection from this case much as i hate returns , i think this one is going back to amazon
nothing special about this one it holds an ipad with logitech bt keyboard it 's affordable two things i 'd change about the product : add a small wrist strap , and have a cut-out or <unk> the zippering location so that the tablet can be charged while zipped the latter <unk> it is <unk> , and i 'm not <unk> them for that
i bought this because the one i was given with the tablet was too small now this on is actually too big but at least the tablet fits in it i 'll use it until i can find one that fits right
this laptop/netbook sleeve is just that ; a sleeve i can barely fit my fairly small netbook in to it , and there is no room for the power adapter the fabric and stitching are not top-notch , but are ok not bad for a the price , but i expected better from this manufacturer
it is a great sleeve , but they really do need to take `` ipad `` out of the description i like the texture and look of the fabric on the outside , the material on the inside is good but my ipad just flops around inside , even with its cover . ipad owners will still be happy as long as they know that before it arrives
i got this case for my transformer prime and keyboard there is <unk> inch extra space in the case but it not <unk> tablet the keyboard the <unk> sleeve and the power cord ... it makes for the perfect traveling case i would have <unk> wasnt so much space but it works well
i purchased it for my tablet i love it because what i like about it i can put my tablet in a case and then put it in the sleeve and still have room i love the color very stylish
i have cases with handles and cases with straps all take up room in my purse i was looking for a case that had padding without the handles or straps this case fit the bill it 's perfect i was n't sure i was going to like the plaid design , but for the add on price of five bucks it was worth taking a chance on it when i received it i was very happy with the color and plaid design my husband saw it and asked why i did n't get one for him so i guess it 's unisex too . ; -
purchased this bag because i wanted something with more style than a boring , black bag it 's cute , just as it appears in ad the only complaints i have is that it is a bit flimsy and loose fitting i kept the foam padding that came in the packaging and use it inside the bag to provide a layer of protection for my pc -lrb- an hp pavilion dv # -rrb- since it fits with the pc , you understand that this is not a snug fitting sleeve , there is room for the pc to slide around without adding some additional material inside
the laptop sleeve is really cute and the fur is soft after i ordered it i was worried it would not fit my # . # in laptop , but it fits perfectly and snug it does not have too much padding but i feel like it is just enough , especially for the price and cute design the design is a little different than the picture , or perhaps the lighting in the picture was not true the laptop is leopard print but under light the leopard print <unk> i like it now that i am used to it but did not at first i gave it a # rating because the lighting in the picture does not show you that
looks and works well i had to return the first one i bought because it was a little too small , but i just reordered a larger size very easy return and good service
amazing product the quality over all is just wow the feel of it is very soothing to the skin i love it i bought this for my girlfriend and she loves it so i am happy with this product i would deff recommend to those who are looking for a good print case for your
i wanted a sleeve for my new small laptop so i could just slip it into my bag and still protect it from dust , moisture and scratches i saw this one and thought what a fun idea it turns out not just fun but very well made , soft with just enough padding for protection and the zippers and pulls seem good and strong
i purchased this for my macbook pro and i love it it 's furry , and functional the quality of the <unk> is nice and thick , and it protects the laptop quite well i dropped it a few weeks ago and nothing happened to it
more attention should be paid to the quality of materials used , as well as how the individual components are sewn together one of the shoulder straps has come apart from the top of the backpack , rendering it essentially useless after # months of normal use the fact that the other strap is still properly attached gives further evidence that the failure here is related to the manufacturing of the item hp should <unk> higher standards for products branded with its logo
the bag looks very professional nice stitch , good material lots and lots of pockets butit will not fit a regular # . # inch laptop/netbook i have a lenovo # . # , and will fit very very tight the corners of the laptop sticks at the edges of the top of the bag , therefore , if you ever drop the bag , laptop goes bye bye truly amazing good material , great feel to the bag , but the laptop pocket is too small to fit a regular # . # inch laptop/netbook -lrb- its thick enough , but not high enough -rrb-
the backpack is very beautiful , has many dividers that let you organize things better , but i felt a little narrow , and it does not fit the notebook much like folders wider and thicker books but i still recommend it because it is very beautiful and quality
even after a year this bag is going strong i no longer own an hp , but a dell now and it still fits in snugly i would so buy this bag again because of its simplistic look and its <unk> though the years
to large for me it was a lot bigger that i thought it would be sent it back and got another one which i love if you are short do not buy this bag
i 've been looking for over a year for a professional women 's # `` laptop bag that was n't black or brown this bag is gorgeous , my # `` laptop fits perfectly , and there is plenty of room for files , accessories , makeup , etc . it has metal feet , so the bottom will not get scuffed or dirty when setting it down there is also an outside pocket for keys the strap is long enough to fit comfortably on your shoulder feminine , sturdy and practical the only improvements would be a long shoulder strap that could be worn across the body , and matching shoes
this bag completely serve my <unk> needs it fits under the seat on the plane & i <unk> more than enough room for my laptop , mouse , cords & even a couple of magazines it also looks nice too ! !
finally , a women 's tote that 's big enough i searched forever to find a computer tote bag for women that would fit a # `` laptop and did n't cost hundreds this is n't flimsy either i 'm not really into pink , but for the size and quality of the bag , i can live with it great quality , great price
i have searched everywhere for a bag for this laptop and until i found this bag i could not find a bag nearly as nice when i travel i like a bag that i can put my wallet , documents , phone , ipad etc and this holds it all i absolutely love it
what a well-made , beautiful purse i 've had it for over a month now and it still looks new i carry a heavy laptop in it , along with power source , <unk> book , and all my other necessaries , and it does n't show any signs of strain or breaking it 's quite heavy with all that in it , but that 's to be expected i 'm very pleased
this is a lovely piece of luggage for the computer my favorite part is the leather handle which fits my hand perfectly pink is n't really my color , but this pink suede is very fashionable and pretty glad i purchased
two years after purchasing this backpack , the shoulder straps are shredded the zippers no longer reliably close and are broken so that you ca n't be sure they wo n't open as you walk with it on your back also , not all airports internationally allow you to leave the computer in the sleeve there is not a lot of protection for your laptop when setting the pack on the ground
i purchased this backpack for business trips by the end of the first day on the road two zippers had broken the bag itself is good quality but the zippers are very cheap and i expect more of them to break before i get home
this is not a good bag upon delivery i opened the package , took the bag out of its wrapper , unzipped the first compartment , and found the zipper does n't actually close the bag instead , what happens is the zipper runs along the track and when it reaches the other end you still have a completely open bag quite an amazing trick to have a zipper that does absolutely nothing total time using bag : # seconds guess $ # for a bag does n't really pay for much
i sent this backpack back just after attempting to put my computer etc in it the zipper on one of the pouches had already broken before i even used it you try to close it but it remains open ... most have had this happen with a zipper before ... the teeth on it dont <unk> after zipping
i bought this backpack as a school bag after using my other old swiss gear bag for # years this bag has successful proved to be a giant piece of s *** after the # months of minimum use i have put it through first off both straps started to fray and are now just bare strips of cloth next a seam along the edge of the backpack came apart and let all the padding out then the s *** ty ass stitching on the top of the backpack ripped leaving a giant gaping hole in the top of the bag and now after all the other s *** has happened to the bag the zippers on the front # pockets literally came off i have put this backpack through zero abuse other than it carrying my books please do n't buy this horrible scam of a backpack
the zippers on the backpack suck a couple of the zippers get caught and # % of the time the teeth do n't close when i finally get it past the stuck part i can not use the smallest section at all overall , the backpack is also a little bulkier than necessary it 's extra heft does not add to the design , it just makes the backpack bigger and heavier i think it 's due to poor materials
i had a swissgear bag for many years the seams failed , but the usage was extremely high , so i opted to go with swissgear again the new bag 's construction is much worse , the zippers are awful , and the lack of compartments mean i have a massive <unk> every time i get something out of the bag save the hassle and save your money
i 've had this bag for ~ # months now and have taken it on # business trips i `` <unk> `` through tsa with no problems with the <unk> design my gripe are that # of the # zipper burst and now are completely unreliable to stay closed very disappointing from such a reputable brand
i bought the backpack for college and was fairly happy with it , accept that within the first # weeks , the backpack ripped along the zipper seam i take good care of what i own , but this could not stand up to ordinary wear and tear
i was very upset when my daughter called me to tell me that i should have read the reviews on the product before i purchased it apparently this is a serious manufacturing defect and i was disappointed because i trust in the swissgear name
i 'm simply giving it # star because i ca n't use it my # . # `` <unk> from <unk> will not fit in this bag other than that , it 's a great quality bag i hope this helps
do not buy this ; it is an awful product many people have complained about the zippers breaking that did n't happen to me but i found the zippers would just work open as i walked around after the second time my laptop fell out onto the street i threw this into the trash a total and expensive waste of money
this backpack has a lot of padding where the flat surfaces of the laptop come in contact it has a good number of useful pockets and unzips flat for use when traveling through airports the main problem , and this is a deal-breaker , is that there is no padding on the very bottom of the bag if you put your laptop in the bag and then set it on the floor with anything but perfect <unk> , the corners of the laptop would bang against the floor this was supposed to be a birthday gift for my husband but it is completely unacceptable i ca n't believe whoever designed this bag allowed such an oversight
the main compartment zipper literally snapped off a day after i owned it i had # binders and a book in it i would 've returned this piece of crap but i burned it ... please save your $ # and buy a jansport ! !
i got this <unk> on the swiss brand , well im a heavy traveler and assumed this would last ... wrong . shoulders started ripping the stitching , then other things started to rip as well i got an rma for it but havent been able to return it yet since i 've been on the road so much and actually need a backpack ! ugh
this was billed as holding most # `` laptops i managed to squeeze my # . # `` laptop in , but not my # `` the shoulder straps are rather insubstantial , not up to the quality i 'm used to in swiss gear the entire bag feels more cheaply made than other swiss gear products
i had high hopes for this backpack and initially thought the construction was high quality boy was i wrong within a couple weeks the stitching on the shoulder straps started breaking and fraying it has become <unk> after four trips my previous backpack was a generic brand from walmart and it was much better made than this on sending it back and moving on to a different brand
the zippers are worse quality than other swissgear backpacks they are made of cheap plastic rather than metal also the backpack straps ripped in # weeks of use the stitching seems rather weak and does not stand wear and tear or even moderate use
within one month straps began to fray , now the body of the back pack is falling apart i bought this brand because of it 's durability , but it stinks i am in need of another back pack for my son in college after only # semester of college ! very , disappointed !
this product is very cheaply made and started falling apart soon after the purchase ! ! ! unfortunately i waited with return too long and now i will throw it away please do not buy it ! ! !
i bought one of these in <unk> for my granddaughter for college she called me and told me one of the straps broke , so i ordered another one # wks ago and already this one broke i will never recommend this for anyone these are not cheap
the bag came with a faulty zipper i ignored several reviews that spoke of this issue thinking that someone would have realized by now that this product has an issue returned it and got a `` timbuk # `` - love it
i bought it around # months ago i at the beginning was very <unk> because of its low price and seemingly good quality however , its zip , the one for the laptop layer usually went up automatically this happened for about # times in the past # months since i experienced several times at first , i would put the zip all the way down so that it would n't go up easily but it did n't work today , when i walk <unk> as usual , the zip was completely broken and my newly bought laptop fell out and broken i was really annoyed can seller give me a reason or solution
i have had swissgear products in the past and i have had good luck with them the zipper on the computer compartment broke in <unk> # weeks i contacted amazon because i ca n't locate where it came from amazon said it was past the # days for return i spent more money on this backpack than i have ever spent on a bag and it is useless
pay attention to the other negative reviews about this item if you put any amount of weight in it , it will begin to fall apart i have maybe # textbooks , two # -inch binders , a graphic calculator , and some miscellaneous notepads in it and already the straps have begun to fray i heard a ripping sound a couple days as i picked it up by a strap there are loose threads near the end of the zippers i do n't have time to return this and i can sew , so i will not return this , but my old <unk> backpack was better quality than this the only good thing about this backpack is the amount of pockets
after buying this bag , i wanted to use it for first time during my travel i packed my laptop and stuffed it with a few clothes as soon as i zipped it , the zip broke and started opening from pressure points i had to unzip it completely and take out some stuff in order to make it work before that i had ogio bag of same size and i used to load it much heavier than this one
to start with , i never used this bag to carry my laptop or anything heavier than that despite this , the stitching for the chain -lrb- for the primary compartment -rrb- ripped off in the second week of use now , there is a # -inch hole right in the middle of the compartment i had to buy a new bag within # month seriously , my previous bag -lrb- which was a third of the price i paid for this bag -rrb- lasted a whole year same with my wife 's bag which was half the price i am definitely not buying swiss gear backpacks again its just smart branding and poor quality thoroughly disappointed !
i purchased this backpack for my fiancee so she could have a backpack that would accommodate her # -inch laptop unfortunately , within about # weeks the straps started ripping , and a large hole formed in the seam of the front pocket i would have expected more from a swissgear
i 've had this backpack for # months and am disappointed with its quality and durability one strap has already begun to rip open and several zippers will not stay closed i have not abused this backpack as i 've been using it for <unk> travel for work i would not purchase this backpack again and would second guess anything from this manufacturer
within first month zippers split and became <unk> straps ripped at base <unk> is the worst bag i 've owned and is a huge disappointment given the brand january # <unk> bought a north face bag after this one fell apart and i carry the same items and weight and the north face looks like i just bought it superior quality to this and other bags
bought it when it was on sale used normally , just my laptop plus some books i use this backpack with care and i always lift slowly to try avoid giving the bands too much pull however , now both bands have the strings come out , <unk> , which makes me no longer want to put my stuff in because i do n't want to drop them this happened one week after i can claim it is defective
the backpack comes with two tags on it one says ` padded laptop sleeve holds notebooks up to # `` in size ' yes , fifteen then the second tag says `` fits most # inch laptops `` . so which one is true we tried the # `` laptop we bought this for -- a dell precision model -- and it did not even come close to fitting in the sleeve we have a # `` laptop , and briefly thought of keeping this one as a backup bag then we looked at it more closely and realized it is not of the same quality as the swissgear bag we already have we sent this back to amazon the same day
this is a great backpack in terms of design , but the zippers on the # smaller outside pockets wo n't actually zip , or stay zipped i noticed this problem listed in some other reviews , but i thought it was an isolated problem it is in fact a design flaw with the zippers i received mine , took it to europe a few days later and promptly returned it when i got home
it 's a great bag while it lasts very convenient and easy to use but the zippers broke within a few months , and now it 's tearing -lrb- strap and around zipper -rrb- it 's as beat up as i 'd expect after three or four years , i guess when i went back to look at how long ago i bought it , i was surprised -lrb- and disappointed -rrb- it just does n't hold up
in my opinion , this backpack would be too heavy for the <unk> my students hated it too it 's too bad because it is a great brand , but seriously it is heavy without anything in it trying to carry it with a book or laptop in it would probably be painful
i bought this bag so that i could carry my laptop around with me a bit easier within a month of having it , the shoulder straps began to tear the repair process is less than hassle free , no <unk> postage however , i did fly with it and the smart scan did make things a lot easier
it seems to be getting harder and harder to find a good quality backpack with lots of pockets and compartments for organization i had to send this one back , because it had almost no <unk> to put my stuff in
this pack was hard to evaluate online but when i got it i did not find it useful for my travel needs if it had a sleeve to slide over a suitcase handle it would be nicer
my son has been using this backpack since # and here it is less than a month it has already ripped in # places i expected better quality from swissgear i do n't know if i would buy another one
i got this backpack for school in order to hold all of my books i go to a very rigorous school and i carry lots of bags in my backpack something to the tune of # pounds daily this backpack was definitely not up to the task the metal zippers seemed to do great , and i was quite impressed the back part literally fell off of the rest of the backpack this backpack is great ~ just not for lots of weight
got two of these packs for my kids who travel a lot they love the & # # ; flip it open feature & # # ; for tsa , but both have had problems with broken zipper tabs seems to be a design flaw -- i mean , i could understand one of the bags getting hit on something , but two
i 've had this backpack for a little over a year of fairly light usage unfortunately the zipper for the middle compartment came apart and now wo n't stay zipped usually when the zipper splits and you can get the # sides back together it will still work fairly well well with this zipper no matter what you do it still comes apart with almost no pressure i 've used a lot of backpacks over the years and have never had a zipper fail like this or fail after only a year i would have expected more from this manufacturer so heed the warnings of the other posters and steer clear of this backpack
i used this for a laptop , as well as some notebooks and various other small items the laptop was always the heaviest item in it after only a few months , it 's already tearing at the seams badly , so much so that i had to <unk> down some of the <unk> to keep them from getting caught in the zipper i would highly recommend some other model this is apparently very poorly made
i had high hopes for this bag great design , great brand , solid price ... should generally be a safe bet right initial expectations were met upon arrival the bag worked out perfect for my day to day activities with my t # snug and protected all around unfortunately within # months of use the seams down the shoulder straps started to separate , this was followed by stitching at the top of the shoulder straps giving way shortly after i 'd like to point out at this time , the bag carried nothing more than the laptop and power supply about the # th month in two of zips started to fail . # months in the stitching started to fail down the one side of the bag overall i could n't be happier with the design that being said i could n't be more disappointed by the <unk> poor quality of the build from such a reputable brand
although the swissgear sa # scansmart backpack is advertised on amazon as fitting `` most # inch laptops `` , the actual label on the backpack says it only fits # inch laptops trying to squeeze a # `` laptop in this backpack is a challenge
the bag is very spacious , and seems to have the right types of pockets , but it did n't last more than a month of daily use -lrb- my son took it <unk> to school -rrb-
i purchased this bag about # months ago and one of the little gray straps right at the top of the main backpack straps ripped about # . # months ago on the bottom seam i thought , `` no big deal `` however , since that time and little by little the area where the gray strap ripped started opening up because there is actually a seam in the main backpack strap right there in the same spot the strap is not attached at the top and is not # piece now the thing is torn straight across and is only holding on by the side borders it will rip shortly so now i need a new backpack the design is flawed and if all the swiss bags have the same strap design then they 're all junk i 'm looking elsewhere
i wo n't go to deep into this one as most have covered it already i am in the aviation industry so what i travel with differs from the <unk> a bit the bag easily <unk> all my odds and ends and the main compartment was big enough for my flight manual an aviation headset and an accessory bag the big issue i ran across was the zipper on the laptop compartment is fairly weak , with # ipads in it the zipper was difficult to use and after # weeks already showed damage the zipper also popped open on # occasions , a beefier zipper would work wonders the bag will work well of occasional travel but i have big durability concerns for everyday use i went ahead an ordered on ogio renegade for my work needs
this backpack was great in the beginning , but the straps frayed and broke at the tops within one year i could have used a waist strap for traveling or hiking with this backpack , but my laptop -lrb- toshiba -rrb- fit fine
the bag was good , and of very good quality agreed on that but the zip on the bags are not so freely movable keeps getting stuck at one place , and i fear breakage of the zip sometimes while using it making the zip hole a bit circular might have helped
