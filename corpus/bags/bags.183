i bought this for my roommate originally i compared it to a previous case on my mac which has sharp edges where you rest your palms this case is much more comfortable to use i will buy more of these to replace the cases already on my macs the only downside is that . it attracts fingerprints , but to me that is inconsequential
make sure if you order this you do not have a retna mb this fits like a glove and the is no room for error only con i have is that you have to guess on the top which way it fit
its hard enough to keep your computer safe and i can see the apple sign shine through it came fast , and it fits my computer great , does n't block any openings that i may need like other covers do i love it
i searched for the perfect cover for my macbook pro and i found it in the kuzy i have a mid- # macbook pro # & # # ; and this cover fits it snug like a bug in a rug could n't have asked for much more does n't hold in heat , my computer fans have n't turned on once a great buy , very affordable the rubberized feel is awesome and it has small rubber ` feet ' on the bottom which helps also
i love the color and protection it provides my macbook pro only downfall is when -lrb- i know its bad -rrb- lay your hands on the keyboard and resting your hands on the mac , the edges are a little rough and can scratch you best to keep your hands a little elevated above the mac and you will be fine other than that , the cover does n't block any holes or ports and fits it snuggly definitely recommend this or any of the colors offered by this manufacture
this case gives my macbook pro that extra bit of protection , without adding any bulk to it it fits perfectly and also gives a splash of color to the dull , grey laptop
i purchased this case a few weeks ago and really love it this helps to prevent fingerprints and makes my macbook more secure not to mention it looks really cool
easy to put on and really does a great job to protect it my case has taken some <unk> and shows as it 's there are some cracks in it now , but i 'd rather the case the crack than the actual laptop
love this product , exactly as it was described fits perfectly and looks amazing would definitely recommend this product to other people ! also cant wait to purchase the silicone keyboard protector
this is by far the best cover that i have bought for my mac i like that its very sturdy and its not this cheap plastic the cover feels like its thicker then the one that i use to own and honestly i should have spent more time looking into the material description , i would have began with this type of cover definitely a great protective case the color is very vibrant color which i really liked alot
this shipping was super fast , i did n't got any problems at all with the order now , <unk> the case , it has excellent quality , i really like the rubberized finish and it fits perfectly to my macbook
great case <unk> the screen when closed and my # pound daughter halfway stepped on it the only thing i do n't like is i though it being rubberized it would grip
fits like a glove , looks good , no worries at all great matte finish - not too grippy and not too slippery the kuzy is good - at such a great price , too - you 'd be crazy not to put one on your macbook pro ! ! we all know the mbps scratch easily - so why not protect it and help it keep it 's value ? best $ # i 've spent in a long time
i feel like this was a really good deal the case looks and feels great fits my laptop great and looks slick it 's been two months now the rubber feet are beginning to fall off i still think for the price it 's a good option but if you can pay an extra # $ and get a better reviewed case , i would jump on that
i wanted to buy a cover that would protect my # `` macbookpro for quite some time but had difficulty spending up to $ # . # for items that were rated mediocre at best after searching amazon for several weeks i decided on the kuzy rubberized hard case and could n't be more pleased with its quality and perfect fit for my mac with the wide varieties of colors available , the hardest decision was what color to purchase it 's extremely durable , easy to install , and its rubberized feel ensures my mac wo n't accidentally slip out of my hands i 've had so many complements , just today i was searching the other available colors to purchase ; my initial purchase was black i would highly recommend this product to anyone who is interested in a high quality and durable case to protect their macbookpro at half the price of similar items i absolutely love it and could n't be more pleased with my purchase one day very soon i 'll will decide which color to purchase next i now feel confident that my investment is more than significantly protected this is a five-star item
just as described by seller , product fits my macbook pro just like a glove i enjoy the rubberized texture it makes it not feel like it may slip out of my hand
kudos to the seller on this kuzy macbook pro cover it came before the scheduled time , and it is simply beautiful i ordered the purple cover and the color is as advertised fits like a glove easy to install would recommend this product to all
it looks cool , i bought it for a lil extra protection it basically fits , pretty tightly it has a nice look and feel , glad i finally bought one so far so good , been about a month no issues
love this cover keeps the aluminum clean and free of scratches snaps on well and stays in place amazing we pay twice as much to protect an iphone good quality and a very fair price
i just received the case in the mail , and must say that it looks wonderful on my macbook <unk> picture does not do it justice i was a little apprehensive purchasing a cover online , and wanted to make sure that i bought one that was of high-quality ; this one is indeed i would definitely purchase from this seller again from a very pleased customer
love this cover for my macbook ! the two pieces snap right on and it was the actual lavender color shown in the picture arrived within a few days , just like they said
very nice light pink color having some trouble keeping the bottom attached , but if hold from the bottom , it works well i have gotten several compliments , glad i ordered it
the kuzy case is a perfect fit for my macbook pro the cover is snazzy , fits like a glove , and does what it 's supposed to do : protect my expensive computer no complaints at all
i like the slightly rubbery feeling i can keep a tight grip on my mac book when carrying it it also protects from scratches it is vented on the bottom to let off heat but that has n't been a problem yet i saw that someone had complained about wifi reception after installing this cover but i have not noticed any change in speed or reception all in all a great bit of protection for my new mac book pro # . # & # # ;
snapped right on my mbp and looks nice the soft matte black finish is cool ca n't speak to the durability yet , but we 'll see i wondered which way the top lid cover should face -lrb- since no instructions were included -rrb- i put the side with # clips in the front and the # clips in the back -lrb- at the hinge -rrb- and it seems correct i also received a prompt follow <unk> you email directly from kuzy which was nice
the bottom part does not fit properly and comes off easily , causing you to fumble as you pick your laptop i ended up taking the bottom part away top part works fine , so they should charge clients only half the price
one star is too much on this product ... . # - the case may harm or scratch your mbp 's edges # - easy to get marks and scratchs with your nails # - both covers the upper and lower do not fit on the mbp # - the quality of this product is so <unk> . if you were able to buy mbp , then you should be able to spend more money to get a better case than this
guess i should have read all the # -star reviews more carefully the bottom of the case does not extend all the way back to the hinge and snap on anywhere on the back side or rear , so if you pick up the laptop it immediately falls off at first i thought was missing a piece but after seeing reviews and other pictures i see this is by design , which i think is a faulty design i contacted kuzy directly from their web site to ask about and <unk> they never respond kudos to amazon support for immediately responding and am returning this
this cover did not fit the upper lid correctly no matter how hard a tried to remove and adjust it there was always a gap on one side the macbook started getting really hot and the fans would be going full blast after using it with the cover for # minutes or so without the cover the fans rarely ever come on i returned it
i love the color of this case but less than a year old and it was already falling apart i have never had a case that lasts less than # months of regular use , and i have never even dropped my laptop it 's so disappointing i just ordered a new one and i am staying away from kuzy
this cover fits and everything , but it is a piece of junk three of the four rubber feet came off within a week and the <unk> & # # ; stubs & # # ; ended up scratching my desk do not buy , unless of course you want to get your desk <unk>
there are two major flaws with this item that i wish i had known before hand the first is that there are four rubber feet on the bottom ; these are attached very <unk> and they will come off , as has happened to both me and a friend that has the same item if you are not careful , you will lose them second , for whatever reason , the lip is raised where the top of the screen contacts the <unk> body portion - you know where your wrists rest this lip will dig or cut into your wrists
i returned this because the bottom piece did not fit -lrb- would n't stay on -rrb- and there were no cutouts for the accessory plug-ins so if i wanted to plug in a drive , etc i would need to remove the cover first
the case is fairly attractive , durable and seems to do a decent job protecting the computer however , there is a major design flaw that i was really surprised to not see more people commenting on in reviews and makes the case unusable for me the issue is that bottom piece comes up around the bottom front of the computer and ends just a tiny bit above the plane where you rest your wrists when typing or using the track pad this creates a hard , sharp ridge that rubs painfully on your wrists or arms i find it intolerable and will be returning the case i 'm disappointed because there are n't a lot of cases available for the retina yet and i was really hoping this one would work be aware , though ... unless you want red scratches all over your arms , this is not the case for you
does n't really fit well in the # & # # ; retina macbook pro i was extremely disappointed - but this would have been the second i would have to return - so i took the
first time experience with this seller was good as product arrived on time however product did n't match description as well as expectations it is n't a proper fit for the mac pro retina the bottom half off the case does n't snap on , it just slides into place and can just a easily slide off as there is no locking mechanism the top for the screen however fits on fine it is a hard plastic case with rubber feet that easily detaches also the case does not vent heat properly and as a result the laptop operates significantly hotter
i ordered one , because we have ordered one for my son 's macbook pro and it fitted perfect so i wanted one too , ordered it , and put it on but it came in slick plastic instead of rubberized returns are not accepted by the seller , but thanks to amazon , they took it back and refunded some money
the wax protectors on the bottom if the case are all bad they leave wax all over the place on the table , desk and even inside my work bag
i 've had my case for over # months , and thankfully i have never dropped my mac , but recently the corners of the case have started deteriorating both of the corners of the bottom part of the case have started cracking and chipping , even though i have never dropped it or done anything to warrant such deterioration the case worked really well for # months , but now it is n't holding up
i have a newer macbook pro with a retina display -lrb- # & # # ; purchased early # -rrb- i loved the way this looked and for the first few months did n't have any issues recently however cracking and chipping has occurred in corners so i 'm not sure how long this will last if the product were less expensive , i would n't mind cycling through every # to # months , but for the price , i was hoping that it would last longer
when i received my box , i was so excited to open it when i did open it my heart just <unk> my cover came with unfinished edges and a crack on the top cover
fits really well , is pretty good looking , and lasted for a while it cracked after a few months like other reviews have noted , so it 's not the perfect solution - but at least it was n't the computer getting damaged the feel is very good and makes it more grippy also the # grey pads at the bottom kept coming off and i 've had to constantly <unk> them at one point i lost one of them and found # other softer pads i had in a box and they 've stuck without ever coming off once and the ones i replaced them with are black , which looks much better than the original gray overall a decent cover , but do n't expect it to last too long if you travel and expect the bottom pads to peel off
the case is fine it 's solid , hard , and thin it keeps my mac from getting scratched when i carry it around in my backpack -lrb- i also have a laptop case i use as well -rrb- it did crack when i tried to take it off once it fits on the mac pretty snug so be careful when removing it if you need to also , your fingerprints will decorate the outside edges from where you carry it , open it , etc . it makes it look kind of dirty but it 's okay as long as my actual mac is n't getting scratched lastly , when i got it it looked as if it were sitting on a shelf for half a decade lol i just wiped it with a wet <unk> towel and let it dry all in all it 's doing good , just wish it did n't crack when i tried to take it off
rubberized and grippy does a good job protecting my mbpr from scratches the edges near the track pad are too sharp but that was solved by sanding down the edges the feet on the bottom fell off until i used gorilla glue to hold them on
i love the color and how the matte coating fits , but the coating scratches off pretty easily also , i thought the apple light would show up more but the outline of the apple is really blurred also , i 've used it for less than a month and the rubber feet on bottom have already fallen off
the build quality is good -lrb- as good as the speck one i have on another mac -rrb- it fits well ; decent price , the shipping was right on time as expected the biggest issue i 've is that the latches that make the case stick to the bottom part of the macbook pro has relatively sharp edges i do not use a mouse ; so use the built-in track pad extensively -lrb- i think most mbp users do this -rrb- the latches come in the way ; and constantly <unk> the bottom of my palm i literally have to hold my palm up so as not to brush the latches , which puts stress on the typing fingers and <unk> overall use i did not have this issue with my other mac with spec case cover i bought this over # months ago ; and immediately found this to be the issue i wanted to try out for some time before posting this review yes , the sharp latches does hurt & hinders the trackpad usage
nothing bad about it , nothing great about it its hard to make it look clean because of the rubber material , but it does fit perfectly i just do n't like that it kind makes noise when i pick it up , like i 'm putting too much pressure on
looks nice on the mac and serves its functional purpose however it broke within two months on the top left screen corner seems like they got the dimensions slightly wrong on the corners because a lot of people are reporting this issue
it fits my new mac pro laptop , but a little piece on the side cracked a couple of months after i got it not particularly sturdy the color is really cute though
pros : easy to put on cons : fingerprint magnet has some rough edges thus far i am content with this hard shell case and would recommend it update : case has started to crack even though i am gentle on my electronics
this product looks high quality and decent i liked it a lot after initial use and wrote a good review for it i 'm writing this second review for this product because it broke in multiple places -lrb- # -rrb- the left edge started to have crack and i had to cut off the cracked part -lrb- # -rrb- # out of # rubber pads at the bottom came off without them , the cover does n't stick well on desk so i have to put up some <unk> replacement this is overall a good product in the market i 'm yet to find a better replacement
great fit , sexy and classy look , but starting to fall apart after # months around the edges nothing too bad , but not the sturdiest of cases for those who are a bit more harsh with their electronic i truly abuse my
i feel that the case does a good job at protecting my retina macbook pro installation was a breeze and i do n't feel like the case is going to damage the laptop the rubber feet do an amazing job of keeping the laptop in one spot the case does not protect the bottom back corners of the laptop however , this is clearly visible in the product images so you should n't be surprised after less than one month of use the rubber feet have started to fall off i can usually push the rubber back into place but the adhesive is starting to give it is irritating that a product does n't even last a month however , for the price it is a decent laptop case and any protection is better than none
i bought a black kuzy about a year ago and it was a great fit -lrb- perfect -rrb- , so i decided to buy a new one since mine has definite wear and tear this new one has a top that does n't fit well , but stays on the edges of the case has little clips so that it stays on your laptop , but the top piece was slightly too small it 's staying on just by how tight it is , but i 'm a little worried it might pop off in the future
the top fit perfectly the bottom slides off my macbook pro retina though i would n't purchase it again but it does the <unk> it does n't protect the back corners i like the texture of the case though
shipped quickly great packaging awesome design but wait oh look out it did n't fit one # th of an inch too short to small disappointed had to return it by different companies fit like a glove
the black case on my mac retina makes me look professional and serious i love it it has a nice <unk> feeling and i just dont like how hard it is to remove it and put it again but hey thats about it
this is a nice cover the fit is good and it protects the macbook there are two issues - the bottom cover does create a slight rough edge under your wrists and the top might cover the magnets making it harder for the computer to turn back on after its closed it did not happen all the time but it does happen from <unk> overall its not a bad cover for the price
it 's a good case and stays on well but it scratches and flakes easily and i do n't think it would protect it very well in a fall ; just keep scratches off
i like the style i use this on my late # retina mbp i will say that some of the edges are a bit sharp should have been more rounded but i wanted something that would protect my $ # computer so it 's worth it
it 's a cheap product had a little <unk> getting it to snap on correctly the colors are also a slightly off but if you need a cheap case this one still does what it needs to
overall quality if ok product was delivered on time and no complaint on the seller the bottom portion of th cover does not fit well and it comes out often either it 's design or the cover is not well
product is very brittle near the edges the tabs that clasp it to my macbook all broke off within # months without me ever taking the case off the rest of the case is sturdy but the tabs are too weak
it is in fact a hard plastic , rubberized cover it is not the color it is <unk> to be as others have commented i was hoping they were wrong or it had been isolated incidents it 's a plain , lighter , boring pink otherwise , it does fit i ordered the bright blue one for my husband his is gorgeous
its nice looking protects my mac however , it could be made to hold the mac a little better the bottom part has a bad habit of slipping of the laptop a
order and received product without a flaw the product seems to be of good quality , but it is was not `` rubberized `` . it was more of a <unk> plastic it did not provide the non-slip surface that i was looking for
the mac apple hardly shows , the color is also a bit duller however , it servers its purpose , worth it for the price it fits perfectly on my mac book pro # inch retina display -lsb- #
nice looking , and pretty sturdy at a good price point the only con is that the little rubber feet came off after a month or so of daily use i used some gorilla glue to put them back on which has worked so far but we 'll see
it 's a great case , do n't get me wrong but the rubber grips on the bottom already fell off and i 've had it for # weeks also the case sometimes scratches my wrists when i rest them on it to type
irritating , sharp ridge i read a review before purchasing this that said it irritated , or scratched your wrists while typing , and i though that was ridiculous well , now i see what they meant there is a ridge where you rest your wrists that is rather sharp and does become somewhat aggravating after a while a little bit of # grit sandpaper to round off the edge helped but did n't solve the problem this is something worth noting however i also noticed that the finish on the rubber feet rubs right off with a slight amount of friction and pressure with your finger there 's obviously a compatibility issue with the two materials and makes me wonder what will happen with the ` rubberized ' finish years down the line i 've owned speck cases before and this definitely is an inferior option , however , if you 're okay with sacrificing the longevity of quality material , this is what i 'd call a great economical alternative
as people mentioned the rear corners are not protected the worst part in my mind is the little rubber feat they came off within weeks , leaving ugly glue residue and not letting the computer stay off the ground to cool i would still buy again , top part looks nice and it stays on very well
i 've had this cover for about a month and so far it has done its job it looks great , feels great and protects my mbp retina fit : very snug feel : hard plastic with a soft rubberized feel maintenance : easy ; wipe with microfiber cons : a thin layer of plastic/rubber that <unk> the -lrb- # -rrb- rubber nubs are peeling from the friction not a big deal overall : i 'd definitely recommend this product to family and friends
i was hesitant whether or not go to with this model or one of the big name brand models i went with the kuzy because of the price and most of the reviews i 've used this for a week now and i 'm <unk> happy with it the fit is great i realized it would be a fingerprint magnet but that did n't bother me the cover is pretty soft to the touch i wanted something that would protect the aluminum which this will do i have n't taken it off yet so i ca n't comment on how easy it will be to take off but i 'm sure as long as i 'm careful it will be fine my only complain is the palm rest is pretty sharp so i 'm probably going to sand it down a bit to help with that other than that , i 'm very happy with the purchase and would do so again if i ever need to
the case easily snapped onto my laptop and has protected from many bumps and bruises shortly after installing the hard case , one of the gummy rubber feet fell off several months later , another and now all # are gone these <unk> pieces worked well while they lasted , but i ca n't say that i really miss them still enjoying the case more than a year later
was misled or possibly , i <unk> a bit by the information on this product i thought it was going to be more of a & # # ; rubberized & # # ; texture , not a hard case for the laptop
it was n't exactly the same color as in the picture , but it still looks good the edges of the case are a little rough , and the bottom part does n't quite snap on all the way , but it 's still pretty securely stuck on it was half as much as comparable cases , so i ca n't complain i 'd recommend this if you 're looking for a cheap but decent cover
i am not a neat freak at all i just do n't like my $ # laptop covered in finger prints other than that , the case is awesome nice and snug , and the transparent effect on the apple logo is super cool
the cover does an excellent job of protecting the computer this may be too picky but it slides off a little too easily could be a fraction tighter having said that i would certainly buy it again it is an excellent value
yes , i 'll agree with everyone else that the bottom piece of the case has a sharp edge where your wrists rest , but it this can be resolved with a little <unk> grain sandpaper the case looks good , does n't cause heat issues , fits nicely , and can easily be removed when necessary the cost easily <unk> the minor edge issue
very decent case , much better than others that i have tried only catch is that the cover on the bottom of the macbook pro is a bit loose and does not completely and tightly cover the bottom its a bit loose but otherwise its a great looking case and looks great on the macbook pro fix the bottom and it would be fantastic
fits snug , but the clips could be designed a little tighter i would buy another one like it i really like that its not slippery , good grip so you do n't drop that shiny laptop
i wanted something to protect my macpro so i could take it outside to the <unk> and not have it get scratched , etc . easy to snap onto the laptop the color selection is awesome
i bought the kuzy case after long <unk> on what would <unk> a good laptop case i ended up choosing it -lrb- in black -rrb- because of the matte finish and positive reviews on its <unk> , and have been happy with it since it came in the mail the finish is perfect , too glossy and you leave fingerprints or too rubbery and dirt and dust stick , but it is soft to the touch yet remains looking clean it seems to be a little lopsided on one corner , but i 'm sure that 's just because i have n't figured out how to clip it on correctly yet a perfect case i would recommend for any prospective laptop owners
the case fits well , does have the rubberized feel which makes it seem like a quality product and does fit pretty well to the macbook the only thing preventing me from rating # stars is that the edges are a little bit <unk> as if the plastic has n't been rounded off properly they can be a little bit sharp and uneven which does make the case feel not as nice
i bought this case a couple months ago for my new macbook , and i have n't experience any major problems with it it does crack a little and a little piece of it on the side chipped off , but if you 're treating your mac with care , this case will protect it obviously , you should n't go slamming your mac down or you 'll break the case i love the way this feels it 's like velvet and sometimes i 'll just sit there and rub my hand on my case i would recommend this for someone in high school or college , just looking for something to protect their mac
the case was a little hard to finagle onto the laptop , but now that it 's on it fits pretty well it does a good job of protecting the outside and does n't block any of the ports i 'm trying to find a sticker to personalize it now
i have had this case on my mbp for several months now and i have not had any issues if i could change one thing though , it would be the design on the front -lrb- to the left and right of the trackpad -rrb- when i am lying in bed and typing , those areas kind of dig into my wrists it is not very comfortable to rest your wrists on at all other than that , i am very happy with the look and protection
once i finally received this item , i was pretty happy overall with it , other than the fact that the bottom half does not completely cover the bottom i do love the overall feel of the case i just wish the feet on the bottom were a little bit shorter and had smoother edges . other than that , i would highly reccomend this case i am not sure about the <unk> colors , but even though the orange version really shows fingerprints , it is still the perfect orange for anyone who <unk> the color : -rrb-
the only reason i did n't give this # stars bottom piece does n't cover back corners also , front part of the bottom piece rubs on my wrists while <unk> the trackpad other than that , it is a great case
the rubber circles that are on the bottom of the case to prevent slipping did not last long it fits fine and i like the rubberized , soft texture as previously mentioned , it 's true that unless your macbook is on , you will not see the apple <unk> clearly
pros : protects the outside of the case has a nice rubberized grip -lrb- wo n't slip out of your hands -rrb- looks <unk> : the tabs that are used to hold the case on seem very fragile , but seem to work so far have used the case for about a week and so far so good
pros : perfect fit for computer body , vivid color , <unk> texture cons : the four small `` feet `` on the bottom half of the case fell off within a week of use -- i guess the glue holding them on was n't strong enough this does n't impede functionality , just a minor inconvenience
although this product does not have a polished feel , it does well to cover my macbook i am not sure how durable would this be , only time would tell but i am not disappointed with the fit and finish provided by the manufacturer i had slight issues when fitting this on , a little too tight during installation , but that 's what a precise fitting product is supposed to be i am happy with this for now , and would recommend this to a friend hey , one more thing , it would have been nice if the apple logo had been cut out allowing it to stand out now this logo get covered as well , which is boring
this seems to be a nice hardshell for the macbook pro retina if i had some complaints to say it could be more snug it seems to be slightly loose but not enough to fall off otherwise its a decent buy for the cost
i bought one of these a year ago and have been using it since on my laptop easy to install , i like the way it feels after about # months it started to crack a bit today one of the corners broke off , exposing my laptop i 'm rougher on my laptop than average , and carry it with me all over the place i feel a year is a good amount of time for a product like this to last , given how thin it is and things so -- not the most amazingly durable thing ever , but very reasonable for the price i 'm <unk> another one just like it guess that means i 'm happy
this is a great laptop cover that definitely does a great job of keeping the computer clean and <unk> the rubberized feel makes it easy to grip and does n't feel like it can or will just slip out of your hands the only downside is that it shows everything in terms of where you touch it , etc . but it 's not that big of a deal , just a slight drawback but apart from that , love the case
good fit and looks good only thing is that it came with minor scratches on the inside , but it 's not visible on the outside some smudges of darker black are visible from the outside , could n't be removed overall good for the price , but i expected it to be in almost perfect condition
the case fits perfectly . so far i 've had it for about a month and i have only # complaint . the edges arent polished they are <unk> and some are sharp to were it hurts you i took some really fine wet sandpaper and cleaned up the edges but i should n't have had to do that
i was very excited to get my hands on this case , because it looked like just what i wanted the feel and the color were as expected based on the description , and the case fit my macbook pro perfectly however , i noticed that the edges of the bottom half are starting to crack , and it has n't even been a month since i put it on
i choose this cover because a wanted a sturdy case but with some grip to it <unk> product is <unk> what <unk> expected and the color is just <unk> i would recommend this cover for anyone , but the hardest part is to choose which color to choose from and the keyboard cover is wonderful also
