i use this for my macbook air # & # # ; it 's a little loose but when it 's in my handbag , it definitely protects it from everything else in there -lrb- keys etc . . the only issue i had was when i received it , the plastic smell was kind of overwhelming but after airing it for a few days , it was totally gone
i definitely know the smell everyone 's talking about it smells very plastic-y , like a <unk> shoe store , but just a couple days of leaving it out of the packaging before i used it let it air out and i do n't notice any smell anymore it fits my # & # # ; macbook air perfectly , and i like that there are not zippers to make noise when i 'm in class it 's a good case and has enough cushion and the price is great
the sleeve is nice and thick , and fits the # & # # ; macbook perfectly . a good basic , no fuss sleeve , for those who just need to pack up their laptop and hit the road
the protective sleeve is soft and does its job i had to air it out for days to rid it of it 's odor but it 's gone after a few weeks
i got this for my macbook pro # `` my mac also has an outer case but it was till able to fit into this case it is soft and durable and you it protects the laptop from all the <unk> and bangs i <unk> my bags to i got the turquoise color which is a cool color but gets dirty easily i have had it for less than a week and it seems like i 've had it for years because it gets dirty easily you are better off getting a color that does not <unk> easily other than that , it a great case and for the price i paid , i would definitely get it again
ended up not using it because it smells toxic and the material is cheap if i could do over i would just buy one at the apple store but thank you for fast shipping and the color choices are nice !
everything came fast and was included the case itself is a little different color than it appears the only complaint i have is that the case itself gets very dirty quick
i like how it 's very lightweight and easy to use the macbook fits very well inside it as well the inside is very soft and gentle on the device
this is a nice little laptop bag to carry your macbook around in - however , i really dislike the way it closes instead of a side zipper , it is a flap of sorts that you manually tug over laptop and that 's how it stays in place i would prefer some sort of zipper but that 's just me lovely color , though
the sleeve had a distinct <unk> to it when i first received it in the mail -lrb- similar to a plastic smell -rrb- however , it was nothing too bad i have used mine daily for the last three weeks and i feel like it keeps my mac-book safe from scratches and cushions the impact if i dropped my bag great deal too
i love the color of this case and the shipping was super fast it does have a strong oder and my case is already getting dirty since its so light it does fit a little lose but since i have a case ordered for my mac it should fit perfectly with it on other than that the case is awesome
this is a nice pop of color to give my laptop some protection when i am carrying it to work and back the only thing i do n't like is a slight odor that may go away with time kind of like a & # # ; tire & # # ; smell
i like this case it 's plain and simple and that 's what i was looking for in addition to something to store my macbook in i wish it was a bit tighter fit though for my macbook air
overall , i like the case the color is the same as it shows up in the picture it is a nice material , and i would recommend it if you need a nice case for your mac
pretty much what i was expecting it is a nice color , fits well , and does n't take up much space there is nothing amazing about it , but it is a good price i covered mine with scotch guard to protect it from dirt and pen marks my moshi case fits over my mac , which fits in here
i actually have an asus rather than a macbook and it is a little big for my computer , but it is close enough and gives good protection while the computer is in my carry bag
i use this for transporting my # & # # ; macbook air , and it fits well inside of the case it 's worth noting that my air swims in the case a little bit because it is so thin , but it still provides the protection i need , so it 's really a non-issue inexpensive , and exactly what i needed
this case fit my mac perfectly it was not too big like others say there is also room to where it would still fit if i had a snap on case there was a smell to it but it went away within a day or two i would recommend buying this product
had a funny smell like many other people said but let it air out for a day or two and smell went away works perfect with a laptop cover and love the color
in the picture , the sleeve looks like a light blue <unk> green -lrb- and is even called turquoise by the seller -rrb- , but it 's just light blue a very pretty shade , though , so no complaints this thing is the essence of simplicity - it 's a very basic sleeve , and it works just like a sleeve should work be prepared , however , for it to get dirty pretty quickly because it will it 's the kind of fabric that just absorbs dirt and it 's light in color , so that does n't help things
nothing terribly special about this case - it does what it should it 's durable , easy to put the computer in and take it out and it fits nicely in a briefcase or on a table or anywhere it does not button , zip or tightly close - something to keep in mind depending on how you use your computer and where you take it
this was exactly the color and size and texture i was expecting overall really pleased with the price and the no zipper on it it 's an easy slip in slip out and yet feels protective enough to keep your mind at ease
the # & # # ; macbook case is not thick at all it works well to have around the house but it is not thick enough to actually protect it but the color is beautiful and i love
the color is way lighter than in the picture its an okay item for people who do n't bring there laptop with them this item get the computer to over heat it really does n't protect much but its okay
covers my computer well and it has a great color , but it gets dirty really fast it went from blue to dirty in about three weeks and i just put it on desks
this arrived very quickly from the seller in just two days they must have put it in the mail the same day i ordered it quality of the bag is just fine and it fits my # inch lenovo thinkpad laptop perfectly it should be waterproof for spills and rain unless you drop it in a <unk> the bag does have a rubbery smell to it when you first open the package , but it came sealed in a plastic bag so i am sure the smell will go away in a day or so i 've had it out of the bag for three hours and already the odor is much less even just out of the bag it was n't horrible i think this is going to be a nice protective case for my laptop and the price is certainly right i 'm perfectly satisfied
i bought this sleeve for my lenovo yoga # it fits perfectly and it gives me the extra <unk> i want when transporting my laptop the only thing i wish it had was a button , magnet or velcro to keep the sleeve shut however , it folds over enough that i am find with it the price was unbeatable the mousepad i got with it was really cheap , but i have an optical mouse so i did n't need it anyway i just thought that was unnecessary it 's a good laptop sleeve for the price and it fits my ultrabook perfectly
this product smells a little bit plasticky but not nearly enough to keep me from liking it i hung it out the window for one day and gave it a good wash now you ca n't tell it ever had an odor the color and the way it fits my macbook air is awesome i definitely recommend this item
the product was good it was made with a nice material for the price it does have a smell , but that will fade away i am glad that i got the product it was cheap and worth it 's price
i wish it was a little more snug on my macbook pro , but other than that , it 's pretty good hopefully it does n't get dirty as quickly like other reviewers said , but other than that great
i really like the case however the green was a much darker green and it was a lot flimsier then i expected however it was so cheap and i got way more then i paid for
i thought i was ordering a case for the air only turns out it just fits the air im sure it would fit more snuggly on the standard # & # # ; pro but it does what i bought it for and the price was worth it
i like the case , but i wish it was a little thicker i am not sure it would protect my computer at all if it were to be dropped i use it to put my computer in my book bag and i am scared to put too many books in it because i do n't want to squish it
good sleeve , but a little too roomy for my macbook pro retina # . # , i guess it was made for some older models also , there is some chemical smell that i hope wears off over time
i bought this case for my # year old to bring his microsoft rt up and back to school each day the case is well padded and my son thinks it looks cool what could be better than that the only reason i gave it # stars and not # is that sometimes the zipper will stick a little bit otherwise , this is great protection for the rt even when it 's tossed in a high school student 's backpack !
i enjoy the fact that it is convenient and it can slide my macbook easily however , if you have a cover for your macbook pro , it does get kinda tight
as other reviews have said , it certainly has a smell at first , but it wears off this sleeve is super easy to put on , is n't bulky , and is such a great color
i would say that this item is passable for the price certainly protects my laptop -lrb- brand new hp elitebook folio # - which was not listed as a & # # ; choice & # # ; for the size -rrb- from scratches and other incidental damage clearly this is not intended to protect from drops as there is no padding for those intentions i would say that yes the product does still smell like chemicals -lrb- purchased mine in march # -rrb- just out of the <unk> , but that it does fade over time i would also say that i would probably buy a darker color if i was to purchase it again -lrb- the <unk> color has certainly been prone to dirt smudges and the like -rrb- all in all , a fine purchase for the price
this product is perfect for my macbook air # & # # ; . it was a little loose , but after i put the topcase case on it fits the exact way i want it to
i have a # & # # ; macbook pro , and it fits a little loose in this sleeve i 'd really prefer a more snug fit other than that , it 's a really nice sleeve it provides great protection and is made out of quality materials i 'd recommend it to anyone who wo n't mind your macbook sliding around a little in the sleeve
if you 're looking for something with a lot of cushion , this is n't the case for you however , paired with a hard shell , it works great for when you need to throw your laptop in a bag it got here really fast
it is great , protective material i like the design because it is easy to get my macbook out of it i have a # white macbook that fits perfectly , but this there is probably too much space in it for the macbook air or even the macbook pro w / retina display the first time i ordered this , the stitching came apart the first week i had it i <unk> the seller and it was promptly replaced i just took a picture of what happened to it , and they mailed me a new one this is why i give it # stars , because of the prompt service the second product i received stayed completely intact , and it 's been over a year now , so that is excellent it is very dirty now , though , and i 'm afraid to wash it because i can see that the stitching is rather weak in one of the corners
it 's a flap open/close , so not for security if you 're moving often i like the color , exactly as expected and there is a nice <unk> padding , making the product comfortable to place on lap or just carry underneath arm i got mine with a spot or two on it ... but meh , not <unk> about it the packaging could be <unk> though i do believe it was the delivery service that had accidentally partially ripped open the package all in all , i like it a lot , would recommend if you also have a sturdier carrying case to accompany this one if you 're moving your mac from place to place frequently it 's perfect for me as i can just put it in my bookbag and go
i bought this case for my macbook air # inch it is a little bit big for the laptop , i would have liked it to be more snug also i was under the impression that it had a zipper but the grey lining in the picture is just a flap but overall for the price , it does the job well
i love the color and the fabric ! it was exactly what i thought it was going to be , however , i thought it would come with a zipper to securely close the sleeve but it does not so , it would be perfect if it was able to securely close
i ordered the mint case , and it was the same minty color as is pictured online very cute and portable , i have a # inch macbook pro with a skin cover and it fits snugly inside the only disappointment is that the case does n't have a lot of padding and is easily wrinkled when i opened the package , it had creases on the sleeve , and it still has n't fully recovered it 's normal sleek look but overall , it 's a cute case for a good price and i would recommend it
it is thin and cheap , but it fits my macbook air fine and has enough room for a notebook or two it was just what i needed and has a fine price too i do n't know what the complaint about the smell was about , it does smell like new shoes it easily gets dirty though but i would recommend this to others
the case is pretty nice for the money i was hoping it would be just a little bit thicker , but it 'll still do it 's job at protecting my macbook there was a really strong chemical smell to it i 've had it outside for the last # days , and it 's gotten better , but still noticeable i 'm sure the smell will fade with time
i bought a rubberized cover from the laptop itself , but this helps cushion the laptop when i carry it in my backpack love the light <unk> color it does get wrinkled when you do n't have it on the laptop itself but it still serves its purpose
the case is perfect delivery was quick though , the color was off it 's a lime green color instead of the pretty yellow displayed luckily , i 'm not so picky if you 're looking for something simple and effective at a great price , then this is it
light weight but sturdy case it works for the infrequent times that i am transporting my macbook does n't have room for the power cord , but that was n't a concern for me
this case is really a beautiful colour the flap at the top pops out a bit when i close it , but other than that it fits fine , and works for my purposes it did smell very chemically when it first arrived but i aired it out for a couple days and the smell has also generally just faded over time , so am not really bothered by it
i love it because it is simple and keeps my laptop safe while i 'm on the go i would recommend this product if you just need a nice laptop sleeve that is portable and stylish
holds the computer just snug enough to allow a little play i could even put an ipad in i so pleased but for now i just carry a magazine with it and the computer will fit nice and
bought this for my mb pro and it is wonderful it came and looks just as pictured -lrb- very vivid green -rrb- and is super soft fits my pro perfectly and protects it extremely well great quality for the price the free mouse pad was also nice will be buying from this company again
when i first got it , it looked super small my macbook pro has a hardshell case on it and it slipped in perfectly it 's a great buy and worth it i highly recommend it the new smell goes away after letting it vent love my sleeve
the case is just simply amazing it fits my macbook pro with a hard case on it it slips in and out with moderate ease and it works nicely just air the case out for a few days , it smells at first but in general , its a nice sleeve ! the quality is really something to look <unk> too
my only issue is that i wish i had ordered more , and i still <unk> this is not too thin , and does provide some cushion , and works great even if your macbook air has a hard case cover on
this case is good it 's nothing out of the ordinary though it protects it and it does n't smell as bad as everyone says it does at first yes it does smell some , but air it out for a day and you 're good to go
i ordered this case along with the rubberized , hard cover case for my macbook pro together , they make a great combination i have been very pleased my daughter has the same set in robin 's egg blue and is just as happy i really feel like my <unk> protected when i have to take it to work it does not have a place to put the charger
very nicely made and good for a desk mat , too it 's soft and <unk> perhaps not a <unk> protector but it does keep the scratches off i love the color , too
just arrive today ! ! # days before expected ! ! the shipping has been so fast it arrived in really good condition and i love the color highly recommend to buy it it fits just perfect for my
i got this within # days in the mail on a newly purchased macbook air i also purchased a snap on case separately and even with this it fits perfect in this case not too snug , not too lose i love it has a funky smell when it arrives but i have a feeling it will go away with time i use this as extra protection to put in my book bag when i am traveling to and from class
this case is very cute and fits my mac air perfectly even with a case on it ! i love that there 's no hassle of a zipper as stated in the comments below - there is a chemical smell to it i mean , it 's not that big of a deal unless you 're going to be using it as a pillow or something ;
i bought this case for my new # ' macbook air the color is a perfect mint <unk> turquoise blue there were a few complaints about the case having a bad smell and a poor fit to be honest , the case does n't smell bad at all in my opinion , it smells like a pair of new shoes the case does n't have a tight fit , but it 's not loose either i also bought a kuzy rubber hard case for the computer and the sleeve fits the laptop with the kuzy case with just a little bit of slack here 's the link to the kuzy <unk> #
i owned a macair -lrb- # -rrb- and now own a macbook pro -lrb- # -rrb- and the sleeve fits well i actually love the wiggle room it provides because there is great ease in taking it in and out if you purchase this , you 're obviously not looking for something that is # in terms of containing your mac -lrb- hence , the flap at the enclosing -rrb- it 's more so to avoid scratches , etc when you place it in your bag
i love the cool mint color of my new macbook pro case i did ' t expect the product to arrive so fast , two days before the estimated arrival i will order from top case again because they are timely with the shipping and very reliable
perfect fit - seller did a great job getting this to me very quickly this provides nice protection for my macbook air without having to have a special bag for it i can slide in in this cover and put it in a back pack or messenger bag without worrying about it
this case is exactly what i expected it is a good case that protects the macbook pro from scratches and dings the case fits well and the color is as presented in the pictures
this item does exactly what it 's supposed to you get what you pay for , the color is great , it keeps my # in macbook pro scratch free when i throw it into my backpack and it keeps the weight light
i just wanted alittle something to protect my # . # chromebook when i take it with me this is perfect , and very good quality ... very soft and thick enough that it is safe to put in my bigger purse or any bag love the color and how the flap folds out for a mouse pad
this is not a very substantial case , but it is absolutely enough protection and is a perfect size for my # & # # ; macbook air other cases were just too big and bulky for my air i love the bright green color
this is an excellent sleeve bag cover i will definitely buy another one in the near future great price to very very soft keeps my macbook pro in great condition love the color too
it 's stretches out a little but i just washed and dried it and it was back to normal i love it it keeps my computer from getting dinged up when i 'm lugging it around for school
this is exactly what i was looking for i 'm a student and did n't want to carry a bulky laptop case along with my backpack i also did n't want to just shove my laptop into my backpack and get it scratched up either this sleeve was the perfect solution
i love it it had a little smell at first , but just like any new item it is perfect for my mac i also purchased the gmyle -lrb- r -rrb- # in # robin egg blue turquoise matte rubber coated macbook case and its perfect
from the color to the fit it was perfect get dirty pretty easy but can be washed , at least i washed it i love how its exactly like the picture and is nice and squishy
this color is very pretty and makes you feel cool in summer mine is mac air # & # # ; # , it is the right size but it will be better if it can be a little smaller
i needed a basic laptop sleeve and that 's what i got fits my # in macbook pro easily when not in use it folds up thinly enough to tuck away in a drawer
i love the color it is slim enough to fit into my computer bag and not be bulky it plan to purchase different colors to change the look great product for the price it even comes with a mouse pad that fits great in the
i am very satisfied with this sleeve it looks good and helps protect my macbook air i purchased another for a friend who liked mine well enough that she has been <unk> for one for her birthday great to transport your macbook air to
i love the color and the ability to easy flip out tab i have an # in laptop i <unk> bought a larger case so i would have room for my charger
fits my macbook air perfectly . i use it often and it does exactly what it should which is to protect my laptop i have n't gotten any scratches on my computer yet so it must be working fine
i read some other reviews and heard that the material gets dirty fast and other issues however i have mine in all black and i have no issue i bring it to school everyday and it is still clean love this product
i love this case ... it is lightweight but protects my macbook air it fits it well additionally , topcase was extremely wonderful to do business with after my case was apparently lost in the mail , they immediately sent me another one i wish more companies were like topcase
top case is the best company for computer cover cases ! they always have the style and colors i want -- and their prices are the best their products are excellent , reliable , and simply , the best i have tried so many computer sleeves , cases , etc . , -- i ca n't count top case is the top company for any computer sleeve or case this case fits # or # inch macbookair just right i have bought several products from top case through amazon and each one has been exactly perfect and , as always , amazon gets it to me fast and <unk>
i love the color of this case its not too bright and not too dull , its just the right turquoise color my laptop fits perfectly inside it , and thats with a case on it as well the only bad thing about it is the smell , but if you let it air out over night it <unk> down a lot other than that , i love it and i plan on buying another one in the future
above all , i really love this color even if it may be dirty soon , i can endure that i am not a macbook user , so i worried about that , but it fits well my new sony # . # s series laptop
this product makes a good gift it 's inexpensive , but it has good quality the color is nice , too as for the smell , i 'd say it was n't that bad - fits # `` macbook pro -lrb- with case -rrb- nice and snug - laptop does n't move around - color is nice not too bright , and not dull at all - the flap is n't annoying like similar <unk> - somewhat of a bad smell upon opening the packaging , but goes away in a few <unk> : # this is a quality product at a good price a # `` macbook pro fits very well inside , and this case offers good protection -lrb- as long as you do n't drop it off a building or anything -rrb-
i brought this product to protect my mac when i stick it in my backpack during school although it does not have a zipper or any closure , the flap holds the laptop securely and is especially useful for quickly taking out the laptop or quickly putting it away that 's always really helpful at the beginning or the end of class or if i need to get somewhere quickly the material is also very durable and is padded enough to keep the laptop safe without being too bulky overall , i recommend it
i use this sleeve to protect my # & # # ; macbook air when i & # # ; m carrying it in my backpack or tote bag it fits perfectly , and the fold-over top is secure enough to keep all sides of the computer protected -lrb- i like that it does n't have any <unk> -rrb- some reviews mention a strong plastic smell , but after using the case for # weeks , i do n't notice the smell at all great quality & great price
this is not what it looks like first , it said for ipad # , but it is too big for it second , the quality of the butterfly print is cheap they are not as bright and definitely not as neat as they look in the pictures third , this looks white , well it is <unk> white looks dirty when in fact this is the actual colour ; <unk> ! ! !
i use this for my kindle it has enough room to keep the power cord in it too so when i am traveling and need to store it somewhere i use this very pretty and exactly as seen on line
this sleeve is better quality than i thought it would be the design is really pretty granted had i known my husband wanted to borrow my tablet i may have purchased a sleeve with a different pattern but i love it
i love anything with butterfly 's on it i carry my laptop in a case in it , and it fits perfectly i like that it has a handle i can hold
this laptop sleeve fits my galaxy tab # nicely and looks adorable it protects it well it also keeps my husband from taking my tablet anywhere as the butterfly 's repel him . <unk> :
if you purchased the hard vinyl flip cover for your ipad this product is too small the zipper is shorter than other laptop sleeves i have seen and therefore it 's not easy getting the ipad inside because the opening is too small i do like the design and will use it to store other items
its nice but its truly a tight sleeve fit so much so i ended up putting it to the side and buying another one that opens a little differently therefore not as tight yet still
i love the design i think it 's great , but i do n't believe it 's a true # my netbook is about # maybe a little bigger and i can get it in but it 's a tight fit i think i 'll probably get something a little more roomy
this is a good quality product however , too big for the actual size of the ipad although my ipad has a <unk> and plastic back cover i recommend this product for someone who just wants to protect the ipad -lrb- as i do -rrb- but certainly not to someone who will be willing to be `` trendy ``
