exactly as described and advertised this sleek , neoprene case is great for holding a laptop , power cord and a few papers if you need to hold more , you 'll need a larger case with more storage for light carrying duties , it 's perfect ... and it has a peacock design
i get compliments on this case whenever i carry it , it holds my # `` laptop , aux keyboard & mouse , and <unk> cords i am very happy with it it does n't have room for the cooling pad or cds or dvd in order to carry those , i have to pack the keyboard but the price was good and delivery was prompt , i am satisfied with a well made product at a good price , not a common combination in todays ' world
this # & # # ; laptop case fits my # . # & # # ; laptop perfectly it 's nice and snug so it is n't sliding around it has an exterior pocket so i always have my power cord and mouse with me it has a shoulder strap as well as hand straps so i 'm never afraid of dropping it and it 's professional as well as cute what more can you ask for
i love this case i saw it on amazon for my neice , who is a college <unk> wow is it beautiful <unk> for travel perfect size for her laptop and place to carry the charger so easy going through <unk> great price , style and shoulder strap/handle for easy carrying such a great gift for a young lady traveler
this is perfect unless you travel with your laptop on public transportation a lot i do n't plan on banging mine laptop around although i do take it here and there sometimes ... and im in love with <unk> ... my laptop is brown perfect ... beautiful vibrant color
i purchased this for my wife it is a very nice case by all measures i have one i purchased at a local office store for my computer this one is much nicer
this bag is ok for the price it looks nice and holds a lot however , the strap attaches on the sides by a small area and when wearing it pulls a lot not sure i would buy if i knew not good if relying on long strap for carrying an extended period of time
this case is no different from any other brief case i expected a & # # ; notebook case & # # ; to be just that - something that would be more than a carrier of paper a true notebook case should afford extra <unk> in order to protect the notebook/laptop from bumps and shock this case does none of that it should be <unk> as a simple briefcase to do otherwise is misleading i do not recommend this product for anyone who 's seeking protection for a laptop or notebook ! ! look elsewhere , even if it means spending a few more dollars i purchased this because it has <unk> <unk> difficult to find an # inch laptop case i 'm still looking for an # inch laptop case ! !
this was for an alien m # x the laptop fits well , without any hassles clean look , ample room for accessories , and price is a touch high if i were to adjust anything to the build , it would be more padding at the bottom and the edges ; something i will probably add i can not speak to how well the case handles extensive daily rigors just yet
i ordered this bag to fit my hp envy # , and it fits with room to spare on either side i love the bag , but i was upset when i realized that the shoulder strap does not come with detachable clips i 'm not sure if the picture is misleading or if the seller i ordered from made a mistake all in all , the bag works perfectly for transporting my laptop
the case is not heavily padded it works fine for my toshiba satellite computer , but would make me feel uncomfortable about lugging around my toshiba <unk> computer it being a much heavier computer it does have ample space for pens , cell phones and <unk> materials
i really like my kenneth cole portfolio case it was somewhat difficult for me to find a computer case that would fit my giant laptop i searched around for a while until i came across this # . # inch top zip after reading all the reviews i was a little put off by one comment stating that the padding along the bottom of the case was n't sufficient after reading this particular review again it seemed more like this person was just having a bad day and wanted to vent , so i went ahead and bought it anyway the first thing i did when i got my kenneth cole reaction in the mail was check the padding and found a good # inches of padding along the bottom of the portfolio this portfolio provides a sleek modern style with the comfort of knowing your valuables will be well protected
it 's beautifully made with nice materials looks like a $ # + case and cases that usually made to hold large laptops are not cheap it 's slim and even with the adapter inside there is no bulge or space issues the only thing that was disappointing was the non removable strap , but luckily you can tighten it underneath the case and not notice it if you going to be carrying it around like a briefcase i recommend this !
wanted a new computer bag that had a handle so that i would n't have to always hang the bag over my shoulder and have it wear on my clothes this did just the job and it is a quality bag , like name brand bags usually sell for + $ # so i got a very good deal on mine holds laptop and has room left over for a good amount of documents recommend buying it
i own another kenneth cole bag which i paid triple for at the department store a few years ago needless to say this bag is a steal in that regards the bag fits my monster # . # inch asus g # w nicely and <unk> due to the supple amount of padding all around there a many different pockets for me to store my battery cord , external harddrive , mouse and other items with ease the sling is a little thin and can cause a strain on your <unk> torso if you 're carrying it for a lengthy time but i only need to carry it from my car to a client or my house on most cases best part of all , this is a kenneth cole bag so the quality is on the higher side the inside pockets have the standard kenneth cole design and although it 's a cheap bag , the quality is sound
i bought this bag for my new alienware m # <unk> # and at first i thought it was not going to work because it was # . # `` bigger than my laptop but the bag works great it has enough room for all my cords plus my wireless mouse plus my two flash drives plus my two sd cards plus the very front pocket is perfect for my charging cord which is extremely large
very pleased with this purchase not only have i finally found a bag to hold my oversized computer , it has room for the bulky cord and a pocket for a small amount of files , pens etc
i bought this for my husband at first , i thought it would not be a nice as an all leather briefcase , but the canvas parts of the case make the briefcase very durable it is a perfect size not too large , but plenty of room there are lots of little pockets for storage of random things like pens , charging cords , notepads , etc . i think it was a good purchase and a very good price
i needed a bag that can accommodate the asus g # , which has a # . # inch screen this laptop fits inside this bag with no problem the bag is well designed and provides additional pockets for storing other accessories like the large ac adapter brick , business cards , mouse , and other items the area inside the case is lightly padded with -lrb- i believe -rrb- foam to provide basic protection well worth the money
after much research , i bought this to haul around my newly purchased asus p # <unk> , which is a massive # . # & # # ; tablet -lrb- that doubles as a pc screen -rrb- what i did n't count on was that i would be able to retire my other brief case since the front pocket of this is generous enough to fit several legal sized folders while it 's relatively sturdy and somewhat padded , the bottom does n't appear to be reinforced in any special way regardless , for the money you could do much worse , and for my purposes it works perfectly
this case fits my # & # # ; laptop and doubles as a carryall for my personal and business needs it has plenty of room for storage and looks great i did not want to lug around a bulky backpack every day to work
i just got this laptop case and love it excellent storage space and yet thin and comfortable to carry also best price on the internet thanks for the extremely fast shipping too
the case is as promised large enough for my laptop and all my accessories it has ample amount of pockets for anything imaginable the case is very reasonably priced for a case this large
i 'm very pleased with this bag i was having trouble finding a good quality laptop bag for my massive laptop that was n't <unk> expensive , and this one was exactly what i wanted it has a nice professional look and feel about it , with plenty of pockets when my husband uses it , he can actually fit his smaller work laptop in the front pocket with our bigger personal laptop in the back
i have and use this sleeve , since i bought it with my thinkpad x # e it 's not bad for the price however , it is not ideal i now wish i had bought a sleeve with handles and an outside pocket , so that if i wanted to carry it by itself it would be easier also , the sleeve has a lot of extra room / play i understand that the material used is stretchy , but it should be more form-fitting finally , the zipper design is not ideal ; the long metal zipper handles often flop inside the bag , and will <unk> cause small scratches over time it does the job of cushioning my x # e a little more inside my work bag in some important functional ways , though , it 's a bit subpar you simply get what you pay for with this cheap sleeve
thinkpad x # e sleeve case , fits my x # e like a glove , provides a modest amount of protection ... such as if it were stuffed into a carry-on luggage piece not much good for shock protection as if one would drop their computer accidentally for that i would recommend one of tom bihn 's `` brain cell `` sleeves
very good sleeve case for the price small and compact , if you 're looking fo that , fits very well on lenovo x # e no space for adds -lrb- usb folder , cables , etc -rrb- but very good for the needs . good zip also
same product as with the official site , but so much cheaper plus it is double side , you can use the red side or the black side the zip is designed for both sides :
i guess you get what you pay for this was an inexpensive sleeve for my daughters new laptop and boy is it cheap it is very thin and does n't fit tightly on the computer at all other than protecting it from any water spills , i do n't see where it would protect from much of anything else will probably be purchasing a better neoprene sleeve in the near future
the size of this laptop case was a bit on the small side , it barely fits my laptop , my husband got a samsonite one that was a better fit for our # inch screen laptops
i have a # -inch laptop that barely fits into this i have to really stretch it out i am afraid at some point the zipper will just give way until then , i will use it , but i am not satisfied
very well made it would fit a # inch very well i have a # . # inch laptop and it still will zip up , you just have to pull on it a little bit
this laptop sleeve was delivered on the promised date , and was packaged securely the color is prettier then it appears online i would suggest this product for yourself or as a gift . =
after # mos of use by a # year old , this bag looks like crap and the primary zipper is broken there is only # zipper on the front pocket which is impractical and the money we spent should have given us a minimum of a school year this bag cost twice as much as his gap backpack , without a <unk> and it has lasted less than a quarter of the time do n't waste your money
i bough this backpack before i went traveling it looks very spacious on the picture , and i liked the fact that it has a laptop sleeve the other nice part are the wheels that can be put out if needed , that part was handy however , space wise , its not very spacious , cant put a lot inside
perfect for <unk> or an extra bag when flying i have a bad back , so i bought it for the wheels rather than as a back pack the color is great and the monkey is really cute light weight and yet roomy
i needed a good backpack with wheels when traveling for business to carry my computer and other stuff on the plane and still be able to take a rollerboard with me it 's light and sturdy and has lots of accessible pockets
love this bag for so many reasons perfect for travelling with and it has all the compartments you need for everything ! so happy i got it , it will go with me everywhere ! ! ! : -- rrb- -rrb- -rrb-
i love this backpack it 's very sturdy and great quality i was worried due to the light color of the fabric it would get dirty very fast when traveling etc . though to my surprise it stayed like new in case anyone wondered , this does or should , fit under the seat on an airplane it also has a great amount of storage space and really does protect your laptop i would definitely recommend investing in this backpack over any other
the handle for rolling this bag is not in a separate compartment , but in the main compartment of the bag so , the bag is basically open whenever the handle is being used this is extremely poor design
i never write negative reviews , but i will make an exception here i purchased this bag for use on campus to carry my computer , teaching supplies and student papers between classrooms and then back to my office i loved the look and <unk> , but the handles broke before the end of the semester i do not feel i was particularly hard on this item - given it is a brief case designed to lug around exactly the items i was carrying and in the manner you would expect i went back to purchasing a travelpro weekender what i lack in the cute factor is more than made up for in durability do n't waste your
i bought this in september of # i am a teacher and not hard on this bag the handles started splitting by christmas the wheels started wobbling and making <unk> noises when i trek down the halls by spring break you 'll be better off spending your money on milk <unk> attached to roller <unk> than buying this piece of crap bag
the front and a part of the back of the bag is real leather , but the sides , top and much of the back is faux leather unfortunately this faux leather smells like chemicals and it <unk> when it gets <unk> which is a big problem for a bag that rolls on the ground
although the briefcase & # # ; looks & # # ; nice , the leather is so tight with limited flexibility that i can barely get the laptop in let alone other presentations when travelling wish i would have had a chance to look at before purchasing
this bag is just ok it does not have a wide opening and my bigger issue is that your <unk> items are exposed to the weather as there is an opening in the bag
was the handle on anyone else 's bag not straight when extended and a little wobbly like the bag although it is stiff and needs good organizing to fit <unk> a trip yet so anxious to see how it handles . <unk> in have n't used it
i love it was very stiff , and subsequently narrow , at first it has loosened , and holds a lot now i love it looks more expensive than it is lightweight , compact , feminine , wonderful
i 've been using this bag for about # weeks i love the look of it it fits my # & # # ; macbook pro perfectly i love the ipad sleeve as well i plan on putting a leather protectant on it for the winter looks very professional and works well the only thing that could be improved are the <unk> , but they are sufficient
i was so impressed by this order when i ordered it was late on a friday night i had an upcoming business trip the following monday and knew i waited too long to order this even with the # day free shipping i was n't expecting for this item to arrive until tuesday while i was gone to my surprise it arrived at my doorstep on sunday afternoon , just in time for time to take it on my trip i was so happy to receive it earlier than expected and it makes for much easier business travel
i took time to pick out just the bag i wanted this bag is highly functional , seems so far to be well-constructed , and carries nearly everything i need -lrb- occasionally i overpack it , but even then it does a good job -rrb- it rolls nicely and the telescoping handle is very smooth to pull up or release down there are some small pockets for little items , and some of the dividers inside the large section can be removed if desired i love the burgundy red color and have gotten compliments on it from my colleagues : -rrb- i use this bag nearly every day to go to classes and am so glad i purchased it
overall , i am very pleased with my incase nylon sleeve for my # `` macbook it is very well cushioned which really protects my laptop it is well constructed and the zippers work well i was a little surprised on how small it was my only complaint is that the pockets do n't really expand so it is difficult to get the two parts of the power cord into the case
this sleeve is the perfect fit for macbook pro # `` i is a bit expensive but provided good layer of protection to your mac # . thick layer of protection # . side and back pocket accomodate chargers and other cables # . perfect to carry around # . looks good :
case is functional , quality made , overpriced , and is not a sleeve as titled it is a slim case with a main compartment along with pockets on each side to store a mouse , charger , and digital <unk> it 's a perfect <unk> for the mac i looked high and low for a better case and found that this is the best
this case looks great , and works great for a few months after a few months the handle stitching came undone , until it finally fell off this case is not as high of quality that i usually see in case logic products i regret buying , and now i am in the market for a new one
i bought this for my # . # `` laptop this bag will work fine until i can find a pretty one my laptop fits well in the main compartment along with the power cord the front pocket is big enough for my mouse and a few misc things like phone <unk> , a jump drive , etc . so overall , a good sized bag with good sized compartments and good amount of padding
the case works great and keeps my computer protected from the world very thin and compact i use it for my # `` macbook pro the only issue i have with the case is that the strap twists vertically when it 's supposed to sit horizontally inside the plastic clip it 's not really a problem , but for me it 's very annoying does n't diminish the <unk> of the bag , though
this # inch attache fits my # . # `` asus n # <unk> # well seems strong enough to be used daily the shoulder strap is ok , and the extra storage pockets are nice pretty sure my power supply would fit just fine
i was looking for an efficient , lightweight laptop case and this one fits the bill i do n't believe the case should outweigh the laptop the only negative is that i carry a lot of accessories -lrb- cables , <unk> , and such -rrb- and there is n't much room in the side zipper pocket however , i did manage to stuff everything in it and carefully zip it shut so i kept the bag overall , it meets my needs and i 'm very happy with it
great , affordable laptop bag that 's roomy and easy to carry around it only has one big front pocket , but it 's roomy enough to hold a wireless mouse , pens , usb sticks , some blank cds , my power brick , and an hdmi cable the main compartment is very roomy , well padded and holds my # `` laptop , some files , and my ipad it feels nice to carry around either by the handle or the strap the strap also <unk> neatly underneath the bag so that you can carry it around without the strap dangling about the only thing i would like more from this bag are extra pockets
i feel so lucky to have found this laptop case , since i did n't want to spend alot of money but still wanted a sturdy case with good protection for my laptop this one is perfect -lrb- and the price was awesome !
i was having a very hard time finding a bag to fit my # inch laptop this one is perfect i can fit my laptop in it as well as cords and files it has both a shoulder strap and handles which is great for traveling
bag arrived on time and fits my laptop great ! very light and durable , i also saved allot of money on thus bag , because the exact same bag in best buy , for $ # . # ! ! yeah right ! ? ! amazon rules !
the bag is way too big for a # & # # ; laptop the straps , inside did n't work at all for holding the laptop securely no matter what i did , the laptop still <unk> around in there probably would be great if you had anything bigger than a # & # # ; laptop the case was quality material , i liked the look of it it just did not work for my # & # # ; laptop
i saw other reviews about the shoulder strap breaking after a few months and figured it was because they were rough with it i got my case today and proceeded to put my laptop in to test it out and the plastic went flying now time to return this one and try to find a new one not made by this
this case is nice in that it holds the # `` laptop , and accessories very well unfortunately , the metal clips on the shoulder strap are poorly designed and insufficient to carry the load of an # `` laptop one of the metal clips failed , and the case , laptop , and accessories hit the ground it could be <unk> that the case itself is nice , because it did protect the contents fortunately , the failure point was not at a time when the drop could have been more severe , such as on a bike
everything is perfect with this bag -lrb- <unk> space & design -rrb- except it 's plastic shoulder strap joint makes a terrible <unk> with each step you take carrying it on your shoulder not at all recommend for travelling purpose
i was rather disappointed in the quality of the case first of all i purchased the same item several years ago and it had clips on the end of the shoulder strap instead of a slide on strap that could break at any time with a large load also , the quality of the zippers and pouches were <unk> compared with the older version my older case just wore out from use -lrb- i.e one of the zippers broke
seems like is was made to contain a laptop of # inches just fine plenty of room for the laptop , charger , wireless mouse , cat # cable and other miscellaneous doodads plus an exterior <unk> folder however , just putting my laptop in there -lrb- about # lbs by itself -rrb- was enough to break the arm strap after # day of use thank god it happened as i was putting it on my shoulder instead of after i had my arms full or i 'm pretty sure the laptop would have turned into <unk> <unk> the briefcase handle seems to hold up better so far but i think i 'll be replacing this in short order
i had to return the bag there 's nothing wrong with it but it was just too wide for my # . # `` laptop i did not have problem returning and <unk> was credited back on time just have to pay the shipping cost to return , the price for my mistake
i looked long and hard for a laptop case big enough to hold my # . # inch laptop this is one of two that i could find here , it looks better and case logic has a good reputation however i have noticed that to my <unk> that the stitching on the strap pad is broken and one side has almost become detached this leads me to believe that the stitching was not made strong enough to hold against # / # pounds of continuous down ward pressure i have had this for about # / # weeks so i am very displeased that it has done this i treat my possessions very carefully -lrb- you would too if your laptop cost # -rrb- good thing i caught this cause if this would have broken while i was walking it would have most certainly damaged my laptop i will be seeking a replacement and will change the star score if it is better quality than this one , because this could just have been a flawed one
have used this bag in the past with fine results we issue it for basic laptop transport ordered # for stock issued two same day one broke within # hours second has been traveling and is still fine , but we are only about four weeks out strap to case hardware was metal in the past , is plastic on our recent order we noted this in the unpacking and were concerned sure enough , the plastic swivel was the point of failure as the other one is still fine at this point , we are <unk> about returning the rest , but will not order this case again
the case is a very nice one , but it was delivered badly damaged and was <unk> by the <unk> the metal piece by the handle is in bad shape , and i ca n't seem to straighten it out if i can get it <unk> so i can get my large laptop in it , i will use it bent the damage appears to have been done by ups i have no way of knowing what the original package look like or if it was adequately protected
this bag does n't have great padding , but it was a good buy for such a large lap top its bulky -lrb- but all laptop bags for big laptops will be . for the money its a good bag to get my laptop from home to work you get what you pay for
i bought a # / # inch asus computer and none of my current cases could hold it this was cost effective and big enough it is a little cheap in quality but for the cost i can buy another in #
this laptop case would have been really nice except for the fact that the main zipper was defective and would n't keep the main compartment closed oh well , back it goes i 'll still be getting a case logic but one with a lot more reviews
mom bought a new computer with the larger screen i bought her the case and she said not enough room for things she likes to have in with the computer and would have liked to have more protection
the case itself is very sturdy and nice , but the shoulder strap was delivered without one of the metal pieces that secures the strap hooks to the bag apart from the strap being worthless now the rest of the case is nice
it described it self as a laptop and tablet holder and i just do n't see that where they can both be protected properly however i use it anyway and find a way i would have gotten something else is i was able to see the insides better
the item will work but has no <unk> just enough but not what i was thanking i was expecting a lot more for the money it was just an open hole with a sipper very light weight <unk>
not the best looking , but it works doing what i bought it for , protecting my # & # # ; laptop and storage for the charger , mouse , and plenty of paper files i take with me
this bag has lots of room for a # inch labtop the only thing i am upset about is the zipper around the compartment there is one area that sticks when you try to zip it open
it 's ok two different kinds of straps on inside of case not a real good design , but it works just fine should have used two similar straps with plastic <unk> clip together type tie downs inside the case i would not have purchased this case knowing what was used to secure laptop to case it just does not make sense but , you get what you pay for and for the money it does the job
i got this cause it was the only bag i could find that would fit my # `` laptop it has an ok amount of padding , and the compartments are well designed my biggest complaint is that the laptop compartment is both wider and longer than my # `` laptop , and the # strap does n't exactly secure it very well if there were something better available i would go for it
looking for a bag to fit an # `` laptop with a bit of additional room for a large power cord and some paperwork led me to this purchase my laptop fits well , and the internal separator allows for enough room to fit the power cord additional pockets allow for a bit of plans and paperwork , but being a slimmer bag , not a great amount the zippers seem sturdy and feel like they will hold up with time and use the shoulder strap is reasonably comfortable i question the longevity of the stitching lifting the bag loaded with my laptop , the stitching around the handle makes audible <unk> to being put under force the bag itself is padded so thinly that i would never trust this bag to anything but <unk> movements , as a simple bump riding the train seems like it would be too much for the bag to handle this bag in nothing more than functional and the price is cheap if i were buying a bag for my personal computer and accessories , i would have looked for something much more durable with better padding
i bought this bag for my new hp laptop , which is expensive i ordered this because it was not as costly as other laptop bags i just needed something that carries a laptop couple of books and some smaller stuff this bag can hold a laptop and some small stuff , but there is not any room for a book or binder from the photos on amazon it <unk> a perfect match but when i got this bag i found out that the padding around thr laptop compartment was not enough for a laptop also , the carrying strap was not strong enough which created doubt about this laptop bag there are lot of <unk> reviewer complaint about the <unk> and laptop padding , which is true <unk> it today and will find something else that atleast protect my laptop
the side straps are held by plastic clips instead of metal -lrb- the picture shows metal -rrb- the velcro that holds the laptop in place seemed to be a little difficult to fit my size of laptop -lrb- # . # -rrb- it was not a snug fit i would not recommend this to anyone
the bag is of average quality but does its job there are a decent amount of pockets and the interior size is adjustable to fit different size laptops my # . # `` hp pavilion fits in there with plenty of room to spare and there is enough room for cords , a mouse , and other peripherals my only complaint would be the amount of padding <unk> the actual laptop compartment it could be thicker for the price , it is a great case
i had tried a case that should have fit a # & # # ; laptop but it did not i can put my laptop , cooler , wacom tablet , power supplies and other items in this case and it is easy to carry
from the shoulder strap to the handle to the strap on the back that allows one to attach it to rolling luggage , it 's a complete case plenty of storage for accessories and other papers and excellent padding
the case is made of quality materials and the construction will last for many years of travel i needed a case for a # . # inch display laptop but the cases for # inch were just too tight of a fit this case is a little larger than required but the strap and edge guard are adjustable so it is easy to custom fit the case to the laptop it has plenty of storage for all those items you need when away from home would recommend the case to anyone with a large laptop the order was filled quickly and delivered on the date it was promised
this is a high quality bag i am giving it four stars because the strap that holds the laptop in place is not as wide as other bags that i have had i also think that some larger items like the power brick for the laptop really do n't have a nice home without <unk> out or making it hard to close zippers however , minus those it has plenty of pockets and space and the zippers look like they will last a while the strap is comfortable i chose to get the # inch version of the bag for my # inch hp laptop which was a mistake on my part i did so to ensure some extra space but the extra space makes the laptop look like it is swimming in the space provided
for the price , it 's a good product i wish there were more pockets for storage , but other than that it works if you just need a basic case without any bells & whistles , it 's worth the $ # price
priced right and functional minus one star for the strap the pad flips too easily on the strap solid zippers and compartments i use it for my msi gt # and have no problems space wise
the bag is priced very well it is not leather like me previous bag but i am content with it it fits my # . # `` laptop perfectly overall i would say this is a good buy
my laptop is a # . # in toshiba and it will not fit in any # . # in case this one is great also has room for our cords the strap inside holding the laptop in is ok just have to be careful to lay flat and open the <unk> side <unk> is not a problem only time will tell how long it lasts but we <unk> ir for traveling to see our kids and grandkids and not for business i expect long life from it
being a college student i needed a laptop case that is easy to carry , and can quickly be opened and closed this was exactly what i was looking for this case has an amazing side pocket for your mouse , cables , and anything else you could fit in there with room to spare you can fit your # & # # ; laptop in this case no problem and still have room for your charge cable beside it comes with # velcro straps on the inside to hold the laptop down pretty tightly only complaint is the slight squeaking noise you get when you use the strap this could possibly be just from the new plastic expanding a bit but its a hardly noticeable sound
i 'm a messenger bag girl and always have been i kick myself daily for not buying the messenger bag version that said , this is a great bag the price is right , and it fits my # & # # ; laptop with room to spare there are enough exterior pockets for tablets and phones , as well as work folders , and even my padded folio binder
it is a good case so far i have not had problem with it i should have read the reviews a bit more however , the bottom where the laptop sits does not have any padding <unk> fixed by buying sponge board and cutting it to fit all in all good for the money
the bag holds my # & # # ; dell with no problem i kinda wish i had purchased a backpack style , but that is not the bag 's fault heavy to carry on the shoulder more weight distribution with a backpack style , even when carried on one shoulder
i read many reviews online about bags for over a # `` laptop this turned out to be a really nice bag with only one <unk> <unk> ... it topples over to the front because anything you put in the pockets weighs it down and pulls it forward i would love to see a sturdier bottom with something to <unk> the toppling towards the front but , it is a nice bag and i am pleased with it
