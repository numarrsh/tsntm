the item is durable and worth the time spent to order it same quality as the ones found in the stores , but much cheaper fits perfectly on my macbook pro the rubberized feel helps with gripping the laptop and with non-slip for many surfaces
fits my macbook perfectly i would recommend checking your model number before purchasing though the keyboard cover does make it a little more difficult to type however , as someone who has spilled juice on their macbook keyboard , i will continue to use it <unk> it 's not that big of a deal and it makes my four year old computer look spiffy i am very pleased i bought the light purple one and i am considering getting another color for my <unk> mood
the colour of the cover is as true as in the picture it looks and feels like plastic velvet people ca n't tell the difference between my cover and ones by speck i have been using this cover for a year and it has protected my laptop well it is starting to get some small cracks on the edges it fits the macbook pro that has a cd player perfectly and the vents on the bottom allow hot air to pass out of the laptop i love this cover a lot the keyboard cover is not true to it 's pictured colour , instead it is a dark aqua green colour
exact fit and was packaged nicely the case came a day earlier than posted time arrival . it definitely gives me more confident feeling i can move it around without scratching my baby . i personally like this simple color
before purchasing this product , i paid $ # for a speck case which was very similar to this one although the topcase one was way cheaper , as far as i can see it has just as good quality plus it comes with a keyboard cover so overall i thought this was a great deal , and an excellent product very soft too
i love this case i really only bought it for the case - not the keyboard cover but i 've ended up using the cover - why not it will keep dirt and grime from getting in between the keys however , i do n't expect the cover will last very long the actual case , though , seems to be very sturdy much sturdier -lrb- and cheaper -rrb- than other cases i had a different brand of case and it lasted me about year before getting dirty and then lost its ability to properly fit on the computer i suspect this one will hold up better
i love this case , it fits perfectly on my mac book pro it 's rubberized and has a great feel to it it does n't feel cheap i ca n't believe that they sell this case at this price i have friends with very expensive cases and this one seems better and looks better than there 's i got the black one but i just might get another color just to change i 'm very satisfied with the case
i love this product it popped right on , very easy it not only protects my device from my messy <unk> 's but gives my computer an added touch of <unk> blue ` <unk> that makes me happy ! ! the keypad felt really strange at first , and i was worried that i would n't get used to it , but it 's not an issue i adapted very easy , and it stays easily as well
i can not say enough just how much i love this product i am a very clumsy person and the covers have been very durable the keyboard cover even saved me from having to buy a new computer after spilling a drink all over the top of my macbook pro if you are debating whether to purchase this product , it 's worth the purchase and you could n't ask for a better price compared to other covers out there
i absolutely loved it ! the color is more of a lilac than a purple , but still cute the case is very sleek and durable protects the mac perfectly . so satisfied with it ! :
always wanted the purple case had the cobalt or royal blue and it was pretty decent , i did not know why i did not choose purple the first time though
this case is fantastic same with the keyboard cover they do n't slide or come out of place at all , do n't get in the way , but completely protect the laptop i had another case -lrb- a very expensive one -rrb- and it broke in under a year just from regular usage this case is already holding up better , leaves no marks on my laptop -lrb- the expensive one left a ton of marks -rrb- , does n't show dirt , and is worth the value i highly recommend this particular product
i received this case so fast after purchasing it and when i seen it i absolutely loved it ! the keyboard cover fits perfect and so does the case : -rrb- so very cute ! a + +
great case , this is actually the second case i bought from this company not because the first one was damaged , it was n't but because i loved the first pink one i bought i had to have it in another color , purple too ! id def recommend this to anyone
i absolutely love my new case i was debating between aqua blue and royal blue colors i made right choice the color is reach , the quality is amazing my lap top looks brand new with these case and keyboard
pretty cool color and nice fitting around my macbook . fits the old macbook with cd drive like the feel and also the keyboard cover i would recommend it for folks not wanting to spend $ # on speck or high end cases of course you get what you pay for
i originally bought this on december # but it got lot in transit when i contacted the seller when i contacted them they asked if i wanted a resend or refund i choose resend of course and glad i did my mac pro look awesome with this cover i love and so does my family too will definitely buy again in the near future
item arrived on the # th not # th but , i 'm completely satisfied with the service and the product it makes my mac pro look great , really protects the key board and outside
my daughter found it to be the perfect cover for her new mac laptop it comes in a different variety of bright colors , and for me its a relief to know that her computer is well protected from daily use and wear
item came in perfect condition and it fit my mbp perfectly the only complaint is that there 's a slight smudge on the keyboard cover but it 's not a big deal : -rrb- item came a day earlier than expected shipping day as well it was really easy to snap on the case
i am extremely happy with this case it is beautiful and transforms the laptop into a very snazzy item i also really appreciate the keyboard cover i like its appearance and find that the fit is perfect i am happy with the protection that both components provide much more attractive than i expected
the description was way off the cover was hard plastic and not rubberized on the positive note , the keyboard cover was and was a nice color match to the case cover
seeing the bright orange color of the display picture , i was very excited to receive the product for my mac my excitement was quickly replaced with annoyance when i received a black , plastic case for my laptop - black top , black bottom , and black key cover not to mention , the bottom case was the wrong size that might be due to a mistake on my part , but the fact remains - i was sent the wrong color however , the seller was , in fact , willing to let me return it , and also offered me a # % refund if i were to keep it so i will give this product a two instead of a one star because of the seller 's willingness to try and fix the problem ; but i was vastly disappointed upon receiving the wrong item that is a careless problem that should have been caught before the product was shipped
i ordered this because it came in my favorite color the rubber keypad cover prevents one from typing quickly the hard shell has a few rough edges that rub on your wrist area it does fit well and covers the computer nicely for the price it serves its purpose
this case is great , it does its job , protects it and guards it from any damage after # months of use my left corner of the computer started to crack but overall everything is in great condition i would totally recommend others to buy also the keyboard <unk> is excellent !
pretty nice case the keyboard cover is kinda crappy and sometimes presses keys down that you dont intend to i ended up using the case and tossing out the keyboard cover
so not only is my laptop safely protected , but it is stylish with this new case i am also very happy that a key board cover came with it also because i like to keep great care of my laptop for the price this was definitely the best option i know those & # # ; speck & # # ; cases are more expensive , but i do n't understand how they could be any better than this -lrb- and my roommate has a speck case , which already broke after a week , and i have had my case for at least a month and it is still in great condition !
this cover finally made my laptop a laptop - it does not overheat on your lap but protected by the cover it looks contemporary and <unk> chic the keyboard silicon protector is useful if your kids are kind of messy when they use it
very very bright neon orange which is perfect this is our second case from this company and we like how it fits and stands up to our # year old the corners on the bottom half of the case , crack easily otherwise its a great buy
this product was very pleasing the only thing i dont like is the lettering on my keyboard doesnt line up with the <unk> on the keys it came in early i think a day early and it fits very well clips on nicely just dont forget if you want to take it off take off the bottom half first then take off the bottom of the top part next and slide it off it was quite tricky also it was a lot brighter than the one in the picture but i am very pleased not a problem and everyone on campus thinks im boss lol <unk> but they all think my keys are <unk> orange which is crazy ! ! !
looks great and fits great the keyboard cover that comes with it is amazing as well this product is as good as the ones sold in apple the keyboard cover is definitely better than the $ # one at apple
love this cover it 's super bright and orange , which is awesome , and it seems like it 'll protect my macbook pretty well the keyboard cover fits perfect and it looks cool glad i got this
the laptop cover fit nicely and looks great i was very disappointed in the skin for the keyboard no matter what i did i could n't get it to line up properly , thus making it look blurry everything else about the product was fine
gave # stars because color was a little off . same with the red one we got but the orange is wow ... orange feel better now that the keyboard protection is on just have to get used to keys feeling a bit different
snapped right onto my mac and has kept it protected ever since i originally did n't care about the keyboard protector but i really like it because it catches dust and debris and makes it easier to clean my keyboard
this was a gift as a part of a care package for my <unk> niece she likes this case a lot her only complaint was the keyboard cover , which she says is awkward and takes some getting used to otherwise , she 's completely satisfied with it
this has got to be the best thing i 've ever purchased ! it is amazing and it came fast . it protects my mac for interior and exterior damage . i love it and am definitely getting more
a lot of people who ordered this case were concerned about the packaging , and while it is only wrapped in bubble wrap and an <unk> came in in perfect condition it fits my macbook pro # & # # ; perfectly , the color is exactly as pictures , the key cover fits perfectly and i have n't scratched it yet this is a great buy
the case and keyboard cover are amazing the case is doing a wonderful job at protecting my computer and my friends comment on the color my keyboard and they love it the packaging could 've been done better but it arrived quickly and was in good condition
i read some poor reviews for this product so i was nervous about ordering it the case fit my mac perfectly as did the key board cover , i love it the quality is great my mac is so pretty now
this is my # nd topcase for my daughter 's macbookpro she loves to have different colors for her mac and at this price its affordable the cases fit perfect and make her mac so bright and cute , no scratches on her mbp and keeps it looking brand new the keyboard cover is a bonus as its so cute , fits perfect , protects the keyboard and looks so stylish will get a another one soon luv it ! !
i do a lot of traveling , or at least i would like to think i do , and i wanted to protect my computer i was going to purchase the thule hardshell case but did n't want to have to carry around my charger and anything else i might want to keep waterproof this product is basically a zip lock bag , i thought it was more of a roll top closure like dry sacks which i would have preferred i do n't trust it to keep contents dry , and i do n't think it does to much for drops and falls for what i do it sometimes has it advantages , there is extra space so i can store maps and books along with my computer , but i did n't buy a glorified zip lock bag if i had another $ # to spend i would go for the thule hardshell case and just keep my charger separate
i sent this item back because i live on a <unk> and i need something completely water tight the inner pouch seals like a ziplock bag and unfortunately , it was not easy to get it zipped just right i did n't want to take any chances that it was n't quite closed right even when i thought it was it needs a little `` <unk> `` on the design in my opinion
the leather fobs on the zippers began to come off in the first month -lrb- metal rings not welded and metal not strong enough -rrb- a week later the handle failed bag looks nice but it 's crap do n't waste your money
the description of this bag states & # # ; soft leather & # # ; it is only on reading - and on receiving - that it becomes obvious that this is effectively plastic this seems to me to be <unk> and possibly <unk> false advertising very disappointed that amazon allows this form of deception
the bag does look good and the pleather feels real however after two days of lite use the leather came out of its <unk> to the front closure even at this price i expect to get more than # months use with <unk> more than # pounds in it do not buy after contacting the seller this u is the first response i received dear customer , we sincerely apologize for your inconvenience it seems like the screw is not handle tightly during manufacturing ... `` and continues to offer a $ # credit for me to get it fixed this means the seller knows the bag is not made <unk> and <unk> to sell them
just a note this bag is not , in fact nothing on this bag is , leather i bought a leather padfolio branded with my university once it did not take me but a day or two to realize that a decorative stripe on the exterior and the business card holder on the interior , were the only leather parts this bag only takes about two minutes or less to know its faux leather rubber like material it looks great though i got a compliment on it the first -lrb- and last -rrb- day anyone saw it i decided to find a $ # canvas and leather bag this one 's great for <unk> though so keep them in mind
my husband used this bag for about a month before the buckle broke unfortunately i waited too long to try to return it i would not recommend this bag to anyone who plans to put more than a few papers in it
for # dollars this bag is just what i needed the leather looks very well made and is very soft to touch . and i 've had it with me everyday for a month now and it is still holding up great it holds my laptop and i still have plenty of room for a few
overall i like the bag but it failed within two weeks of me using it the rivet on the handle which attaches to a metal insert to support the weight of the contents inside the briefcase failed looks like the rivet material is too thin now i only had my dell # inch business laptop in it along with my kindle and charging cables for my kindle and laptop i contacted the seller and was emailed back within # hours but the email was confusing it mentioned something about if returning after two weeks it was only a partial refund i like the briefcase very much so i decided to save the postage and the loss of my partial refund and simply use the strap instead of the handle i will fix it myself when i get the time to
overall , i really like the look and feel of this bag the color is beautiful and the leather soft the cloth interior , however <unk> the space too much and i would have preferred that the inside be more open and all leather like most people who <unk> this bag , i would have preferred a leather strap instead of the nylon one provided my biggest issue , however , is with the capacity of the bag the buckle on the flap leads one to believe that the flap can be adjusted or the bag adjusted to fit more inside even though it looks like a functional extension buckle , it is stitched in place and does not run through the flap i 've only had it a couple of weeks and the stitching is already pulling away i 'm going to try and fix the stitching myself this is exactly why i prefer to buy things like this in a store where i can evaluate the craftsmanship
aesthetics <unk> good , not bad overall but it needs internal <unk> to retain its overall shape soft in this case was is a little too soft for me i had to use several pieces of cardboard to brace it so that it could retain its shape as advertised in the picture and thus prevent it from twisting up like a garment
i <unk> this bag for a few weeks before buying it it was so cheap that i figured it could n't be good quality , but it is it looks great and people compliment me on it a lot
this bag was not only a great price but it 's perfect for a student or someone using it for business <unk> this was by far the best purchase i 've ever had on amazon if you are looking for a really nice bag buy this
i bought this as a gift for a very close friend of mine who always goes above and beyond expectations initially , i was a little hesitant to invest in this item , just because i 've had bad experiences with buying accessories like these online however , when the package arrived -lrb- on time ! ! -rrb- , my friend was just so happy to see such a beautiful bag it 's gorgeous , very masculine , and the leather looks like it is very durable he loves the versatile compartments and it makes him feel like a million bucks great product for a very good price
i could n't be happier with this bag the leather is top notch its soft and <unk> , great stiching and a lot of room inside to carry everything i need i highly reccomend it
fast shipping and a great quality bag this bag was a gift for my dad to carry his bible and <unk> to church it 's the perfect size i did n't want anything too large like # `` or # `` the leather is very soft
this is a great bag i used it on a # -day trip to japan and it held my canon t # i digital slr as well as passports , maps , etc . the only thing i did n't like about it was that the padding on the shoulder strap kept slipping down from where i wanted it the other minor drawback is the clip for the front flap & # # ; its a little difficult to open and close quickly i am still very happy with the bag and would recommend to others
this bag is a good option for travel for man or woman i like it for on the airplane instead of my purse , then my husband used in in europe for daily sightseeing trips it is very secure with a good side zipper compartment for your phone , no digging inside to find it , and the straps are nice and wide so they do not dig into your shoulder lots of good storage areas for <unk> passes , coins , small bills separate from other money , water bottle , papers , it does fit a lot , likely more than you want to carry around all day my only negative is that the main compartment zipper does not open enough , it is tight for getting out larger items or seeing all the stuff that fits inside but that also helps make it more secure and you do n't have things falling out net , good purchase at a fair price i will have this for years and use often
best city commute bag ever has a pocket for everything and holds a ton i always know exactly where everything is i 've used this bag every day for almost # years and it has held up amazingly well for how roughly i treat it love the separate pocket for a water bottle i would seriously consider repurchasing this exact same bag when -lrb- if ? -rrb- my current one wears out
i 've been using this daily for about six months and love it normally i do n't write reviews , but i happened to see that this has a <unk> # -star rating because of one other comment it definitely fits a normal ipad or even a regular magazine lots of good compartments of different sizes and locations very comfortable to wear , even for hours in a row the orange <unk> is a nice touch , too
this is not anything that i thought it would be it did not fit my <unk> laptop and it is more like a lunch box because it is insulated i am very disappointed with this product
it looks exactly like the picture the only thing i was surprised by was the the inside of the bag was lined in plastic it kind of reminded me of the inside of a lunch box
purchased this for my daughter as a laptop case , however it is not able to accomodate a # inch laptop we did n't return because my daughter can use for other things and she likes jack
the weight of the fabric and design on the bag are wonderful , but i did not like the liner i image that i will eventually remove it or replace
i got this as a gift for a jack <unk> lover the design is very appealing and so far , it seems sturdy the inside is one padded pocket , no separate section for the computer the intent is to use it as a school bag , it would be nice if there was a computer section and an everything else section the little pockets are handy for a phone or calculator or keys , etc . overall , i 'm very pleased with the purchase
i bought this as a gift and she loved it uses it for her netbook and all she other stuff it is wearing well and holding together a plus in a busy young girls life
this fan worked great for about # / # minutes ; after that ... nothing i tried plugging it in to different usb ports on my laptop and i did toggle the on/off switch at least # times but it was just dead returning it to amazon for a refund was very easy though -lrb- no replacement for me ; fool me once ...
it 's made out of cheap plastic and it has already broken after # months the wire to the fan has come up and is getting caught in the fan <unk> the cord which is made of cheap plastic broke and i had to replace it there is no way to secure your laptop on it and your laptop will slide off it does cool partly but the laptop still gets hot this product does not work the way it is described and its a waste of money
this is a total piece of garbage after less than two months of use , it completely died now i am past my return period , so i am screwed please do not waste your money on this garbage ! ! i gave it one star only because that 's the lowest <unk> i can give it it actually does n't deserve any stars
i can say , it is not what i was expecting to work it does not <unk> much air and cools laptop , not sure , even it is working or not , just the use as stand is good but that to has difficult to angle properly
it keeps my laptop cooler , but the angle it sits up at is too steep and my laptop slides off i needed to put two stacks of post-it notes under each foot just to keep the front up high enough also , it is too small for my # inch laptop it -lrb- at most -rrb- will hold a # inch
i thought my laptop would fit better on it , and it is really not great for when i have my laptop on my lap it does do what it is suppose to do , though , and i hate returning items , so i will keep it i guess i should of done more homework on cooling fans , so maybe my mistake
i just received the fan and one of the rubber grips for the <unk> stand are missing i looked in and around the box and did n't find it , so i 'm just going to assume that 's an error on their <unk> it is a little noisy . . not too much that i ca n't stand , but enough to make a difference however , negatives aside , it is sturdy and the airflow is pretty good i have n't used it yet doing <unk> stuff on my laptop but for now my laptop is pretty cool
product is simple and does the job the fans are n't noisy : the internal fan of my dell latitude that 's sitting atop this this <unk> stand is <unk> than the two fans in the stand the blue led lights add a touch of style biggest problem : the small assembly in the back housing the two usb ports was already loose when i opened the box the assembly was dangling and ready to fall inside its housing i was able to gently <unk> in the usb cable and have n't removed it since for fear that the usb port would completely fall inside the housing this was a bit disappointing
honestly , the product has a good design , comfortable and easy to carry however , the usb cable is of very poor quality , at # days one end of the cable is damaged now i have to buy a better quality cable basically if you ask me if you buy this product , then buy it chill well and keeps my laptop running cool does its job well . :
after using it for a few hours right out of the box , i am neither impressed nor displeased the fan is really quiet , which is a plus , but it has n't <unk> my laptop all that much the biggest con is that , like other reviewers mentioned , the laptop hardly stays in place , so you kind of have to find a way to prop it up it 's also not very comfortable if you 're planning to put it on your lap
i have had a hard time <unk> my laptop securely on this cooler at times the one fan is so noisy with vibration noise just shut it off the one thing i really like is the usb slot for a keyboard and mouse i would not recommend this product based on my experiences with it
this works as advertised for our # & # # ; laptop i had to attach velcro strips to the frame & laptop , <unk> to hold keep the laptop from slipping down it would be better if they designed some type of tabs on the bottom to cure this problem the fans are a little <unk> unless there is <unk> sound in the room to <unk>
i received this product in a timely manner i do like the stand and its not a bad price for what i expected . the blue is a cool blue shade and it is lightweight as well
the product is really good , with the look and fan speed but , the size is good for # & # # ; , so its not suitable for # & # # ; laptops unfortunately , i have # & # # ; laptop
does a good job keeping the hp laptop from shutting down after long run times folds up small enough to be portable but does add weight it is worth the
this product works perfectly and looks awesome the only one thing i am concern is size i have # . # inch laptop , and i have a little problem to fix it on this stand
i bought this cooling pad , base on looks and the metal bar frame i have # `` gateway laptop that stays hot fan come 's on computer slow down i hook the <unk> fan pad up , set my computer on top fit good and will make # brackets to hold the fan pad to the laptop so i take it with the computer around the house the blue lights are cool at night it has on and off switch at the back and # usb ports # is for the usb cable that comes with it to power up the fans from the computer usb port my computer been on for # hours now and no <unk> when working on the computer runs much better now this really works i 'm very glad i bought this # . # stars for sure i order another # for my other laptop
great fan really helps to keep my laptop cool especially since it needs to have the internal fan replaced my laptop is pretty powerful and can get hot as i utilize the highly <unk> applications
i bought this fan last month so far so <unk> it was a great price i like that is quiet the blue light is pretty cool my only con is that i wish there was . a strap of some sort that actually attached and held the fan to my laptop that would be a great help when moving around
after reading the reviews , i did n't expect much out of these laptop fans they may not blow incredibly strong , but you do n't need a jet <unk> , you just need quiet circulation the temperature reduced significantly , and i no longer have blue screen <unk> best fan you can find for the price , assuming you do n't need a comfortable lap fan
this product came within a few days and worked very well , except you need to make sure if you plug a device into the other port it uses & # # ; low power & # # ; . i tried to charge my cell phone and missed several calls to say the least
this product is essential to any laptop it keeps it cool , with both of the nice big fans , and looks amazing in the dark , with it 's awesome blue <unk> get it <unk> -lrb- i 'm using it on my compaq presario <unk> # <unk> notebook pc .
i really like this item , it replaces another cooling pad that i used that one of the fans started making noise so it got replaced this seems to be doing a fantastic job and it so quiet , i love it
are you stupid its supposed to fit the # inch computer when the case itself isnt even # inches so so so disappointed never buying anything from you again thanks for nothing :
it is too big for the new macbook pro # , and it is not see through at all plus it is neither a prime item nor a <unk> item i strongly do not recommend this product
i got it in and it fit perfectly on my computer and it looked great but # months on , the case started breaking apart i would find small pieces of it sitting next to the computer on final inspection , there are now cracks all along the bottom piece and small chunks are now missing from it it is a great idea but either the material used to make it is inferior or it is made very badly
this product was not rubberized or see-through as the title indicated instead , it was made out of cheap plastic that did n't even have anyway to grip my macbook pro according to the description , it should fit a macbook pro # inch and it definitely does not the top and bottom pieces are teal plastic rectangles and nothing more the case is also not really see-through as soon as it came in the mail and it was n't remotely close to functioning as a laptop case , i sent it back immediately
i assume that transparent is defined as clear apparently they meant to say translucent , because this case is not clear and it 's an <unk> material , like nails on a <unk>
do not buy this case it is so cheaply made compared to the case i had before its plastic was super thin and flimsy i put it on my computer and two days later the corner broke of after that it just kept falling apart and i would have piece of it everywhere i would put my computer just had to take it off and get something new definitely would not recommend to anyone really not worth the price ... even though it was relatively cheap
a very poor product certainly protects the macbook , but the cover is just falling apart huge cracks at every corner , with two corners now missing <unk> of plastic the little tabs that are suppose to hold it in place are n't cut correctly , so the bottom cover is always coming loose maybe i should have stuck with the speck cases , these are not good quality
i am very disappointed by the quality of this product within the first week small bits and pieces began to break off from the case for no apparent reason in the # months since i purchased this product it has continued to deteriorate and fall apart , crack and chip i do n't understand why this has happened , as it is obviously attached to a very pricy computer therefore there is zero chance that i have <unk> it in any way i loved the color and i loved the idea that this shell would offer some protection for my macbook -- which is why i bought it however , i do not feel that i 've got nearly any of my money 's worth considering the short span of time that i 've had this case
there is no way this will fit way too big it looks like bottom and top go to different computers i ordered based on computer model and size looked nice in the picture though
i really liked this had shell skin case i purchased it in december but noticed two months ago that a part chipped off now one of the corners just did it 's only going downhill from there i 'm assuming the case is really nice with a nice color , but i would n't recommend it if you want something that lasts for any longer than a few months i only take my macbook to school and it 's secured in a padded backpack , so i 'm very disappointed on this product i will have to purchase something else any suggestions are welcome
