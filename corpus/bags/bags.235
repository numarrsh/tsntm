this bag is bigger than i thought i bought it for a # `` laptop , so it fits pretty loosely , but i think a # . # incher would also have a lot of breathing room the large size can be great if you 're looking to carry extra stuff such as books , notebooks , or accesories if you 're looking for a snug fit and a small size , better look elsewhere being a messenger bag , it does n't have a handle , just the shoulder strap take that into account since it can be a little uncomfortable when handling the bag regarding looks , i love it , it 's fresh and different and does n't have that standard laptop bag look it 's lighter in color than it seems in the display photos
i use this bag nearly daily and i am very satisfied with it this bag can hold my laptop , textbooks and <unk> i 've even used it as luggage to hold # days worth of clothes before the # pockets on either side are convenient for wider items like flash cards and <unk> cases inside there is a zippered pouch that can hold laptop cables , headphones and various other things in addition there is a mesh pouch on top of that for other items also there are two slots to hold pens or pencils i am constantly complimented on the design however the dark grey color of the bag did seem to fade slightly there is only one large , ajustable shoulder strap by means of moving the bag but it is wide enough to not cut into your shoulders when carrying heavier loads
my spouse kept losing things : his keys , his wallet , his zune , his gps or he 'd hold all of these up in both hands and <unk> , `` this does n't fit in my pockets ! `` so , for valentine 's day , i got him this messenger bag now he has a place for the zune , gps , wallet , keys , <unk> , notebooks , gaming books , beer , random socks , and the cat he can cram the laptop in there if he has room it 's proven very sturdy and durable , which is good , because it has to stand up to his usage and the cats ' use of it as a sleeping bag it also screams `` smart man coming this way ! `` rather than `` guy with too much crap and needs a purse coming this way ! `` ... i almost want one for myself
i love the bag , however the compartment should be a little smaller because i am petite it `` <unk> `` me also it would be nice if you had a smaller compartment inside for pens or small objects overall it is a great bag
i bought this backpack for my # in toshiba laptop and several books that i needed to carry with me for <unk> class i love the bag it holds several books , my computer , pens , and what ever else i might need i love the pocked on the flap it is very useful for carrying snacks , and <unk>
he loves it says it all for me , boys are easy going on some things but cool is important to teens , quality for mom and i got both i have had case logic items in the past but they were computer type stuff so i took a chance they would n't do wrong and they did n't the shipping was fast and the company was fine , did n't have any issues anywhere
i bought this bag for two reasons : # <unk> 'm cheap # <unk> reviews stated it was huge -lrb- i needed a giant bag to fit my <unk> # `` hp -rrb- it arrived quickly and i was pleased with it i can easily fit my laptop , usb capture device , charger , <unk> , books , and various accessory cables the canvas material is durable and the straps are extremely comfortable . -lsb- ... -rsb- overall , i 'd recommend to anyone and would definitely buy it again
obviously a bag is n't going to be small if you 're trying to fit a # `` laptop in it but this thing is huge if you need to carry around tons of stuff , this might be the bag for you if all you need to carry around is a <unk> , maybe a couple of files , this is too big you could probably fit # or # dell # `` <unk> in there it definetely looked and felt awkward for me and the smell of the canvas is <unk> i actually put it in the washer to see if i could get rid of the smell i ended up getting a belkin messenger bag for the # `` and it 's perfect
i looked alot of places for a case that would hold my gateway p # laptop it holds everything i need it is a big case the only concern is the fact the laptop is set in sideways this would n't normally be a problem ; however the case is a backpack , so the back of the pack is placed across a person 's back if the straps are too tight , there may be a strain on the laptop itself over time this may stress the frame i make sure i am careful when i pick it up this does n't change my # stars ... just something to consider
this bag is stylish , sturdy , and looks great with <unk> styling the only bag i have found that holds my ginormous # `` desktop replacement comfortably without the bag looking like a huge carry on suitcase has some nice hidden pockets too only wish they had added a water bottle carrier on the outside you ca n't go wrong with this one
the perfect all around backpack for notebook/laptop mobility suggest a skin or sleeve for the laptop to provide additional protection very roomy and hip . minimum of special pockets but great for laptop , books , lunch water , etc . and the price is right
i love everything about this the structure is very durable the design is a nice added touch the size fits my laptop and so much more without it becoming bulky the amount of pockets and holders it has is great and the bottle opener has come in handy : -rrb-
this backpack `` case `` fits my # `` hp pavilion with room to spare it has a great look and will look even better the more ` <unk> ' it becomes there is tons of space for other peripherals the quality seems terrific - very durable
it is huge it has a computer sleeve and fits the full size # `` widescreen hp laptop most bags then have very little room left for anything else or look like they are huge -lrb- expand to # or more feet wide on your back -rrb- this one seems to be endless it fits the computer , books , notepads , lunch , extra layers of clothing , other electronics it has a lot of pockets <unk> throughout the bag for storing those easy to loose smaller items it is sturdy i 've had it now for # . # years and there is hardly any sign of wear even though it is carried daily and filled to the brim it does not attract dust or cat hair since it is canvas one of the best backpacks that have ever been in our house
i love this bag i was looking for something a bit different than the standard black laptop backpack , and this one is great i like that it 's big and has a lot of storage space for extra books or notebooks the front pocket is the perfect size to hold the charger cord , and there are a few little pockets here and there that work well for smaller items like my usb drive that is so easy to misplace the straps are well padded and it 's comfortable to wear plus , it looks cool i 've gotten compliments on it already and people are surprised to hear that it 's a laptop bag it 's nice that it does n't scream that for when i need to leave it in the car a good buy
i used this bag on a recent trip i did like the fact that this backpack had plenty of room i still had to fumble around to find things inside but i will have to work that out i was happy not to have to carry my laptop separately i also like the canvas material which made it pretty sturdy i did n't like the fact that it covered my entire back and then some i am short i had to just carry it as a tote bag because of how high it was on my back
i bought this back pack for my self for my trip to sweden to see my parents and <unk> and being on planes and air ports and the trip it self , this back back was very durable it still looks like new it was very easy to handle and good looking too getting my lap top out for the security checks were no problem i am very pleased with this purchase
i had the hardest time trying to find a backpack to fit my # `` dell precision workstation - it 's no thin macbook pro this backpack fits it easily , has great pockets and space and i like the way that it opens at the top - making it harder for stuff to fall out i have n't worn this backpack for any long length of time , so i ca n't comment on how comfortable it would be for that but for the normal activity i 've needed it for it 's been great
i use this bag daily it has plenty of compartments , and the material is very sturdy i 've used the bag for my laptop and as also as a carry-on when travelling even though i no longer own a # -inch laptop , it works well for the smaller computer that i now own
plenty of room but not to big either lots of zippered pockets and the shoulder straps are very comfortable this backpack will hold up , carry your laptop with peripherals -lrb- and more -rrb- , and has a great look too good value through amazon
after the # bags i have now had for various laptops i decided to go with a backpack style with this bag space will never be an issue it fits my # in laptop with space to spare along with various components i may carry including a laptop cooler the front pouch is the perfect size to fit the book shelf styled external hard drives allowing for larger storage -lrb- # + gb -rrb- on hand with your laptop i am very pleased with the quality and the price is just right
this backpack is wonderful it 's large enough to be convenient without being too overbearing it 's durable , comfortable , stylish , and has a good amount of pockets , which is useful for someone like me who gets confused by too many pockets it will keep your laptop safe my problem was ordering it from amazon the shipping date was almost two weeks after i would start school , and the estimated delivery date just seemed ridiculous i went to the case logic website , and though it was a couple dollars more for basic shipping , they shipped it the next day , and it showed up two days later if you love this backpack , order it straight from the case logic site for only a few dollars more , you get it to you in record time
the bag it self is nice , lots of pockets would of been nice if my # in laptop would of fit in the bag the dimensions they give you are for the bag and the space for the laptop is much smaller maybe something they should include ... if they wo n't i will the dimensions for a laptop are # . # . # so in all reality it fits a # . # in computer much smaller size than the bag
i think i 'm in the minority when i say that i dislike the color of this bag i thought it would be a cool design , but when it arrived at my home , i just could not get over the army <unk> appearance also , i 'm not fond of the canvas fabric - it 's rough and just not to my taste i 'm also afraid that canvas might stain more easily than another fabric the bag is also big , so beware however , the organizational ability of this bag won me over , and the quality appears to be very good there are lots of pockets inside and out , and my laptop fits perfectly i love the zippered top for keeping everything protected , and the zippered side pocket for making my airline ticket and phone easily accessible so , i am returning this one for the black <unk> color -lrb- with a poly fabric -rrb- , which is a bit more to my liking
this is a great bag for work items it holds a laptop and a few files it also has a flap on one side , so you can easily slide it down your luggage rather than hauling it around the airport this is very handy this a perfect bag for work travel it does n't hold enough to take a long trip , but for the <unk> work travel it 's perfect i 've received a lot of compliments on the design as well i would recommend this to people
i ca n't say enough about this bag it is made well , the coloring is beautiful and i have received many compliments about it there is room inside for just about anything and everything buy one - you 'll love it too
the colors are actually a little lighter than they seem in the photo - which i like it is a great bag , holds a ton of stuff , perfect compartment for a laptop i use it every day for work and it is holding up beautifully
this bag is the bag of bags it has alot of storage space for additional items you might need to carry along with your lap top it is chick and versatile
i absolutely love this tote ! ! ! it has extra padding inside for your laptop as well as a dedicated space for it inside the tote and lets not forget the obvious , it 's totally fashionable and beautiful i love the fact that i can use this as a all-in-one bag , no need to carry a purse , you 've got plenty of space i 've seen this bag on other sites for around -lsb- ... -rsb- , and once you receive it , you 'll see why it 's very well made , top quality
durable case that protects my precious iphone the lens helps out a bunch since i 'm often taking pictures of printed items for my records this lil tool has eliminated my need for my photo copy machine ;
makes for a nice case for everyday use , and the feature of better <unk> pictures is great for taking pictures of documents , business cards , or anything else small i love taking pictures of business cards and uploading them to <unk> for <unk> , text <unk> , and easy finding later on when i have lost the actual business card i was given would recommend to my mother -lrb- and in the end , is n't that what really matters ? -rrb- my only complaint is that if you have <unk> filled pockets like mine then dust and lint will build up at the edge of the screen but then it is just a simple matter of sliding the bottom and top of the case of and wiping the phone on my <unk>
if you are expecting a conventional laptop bag , then this is not for you only for those who expect an exceptional stylish laptop bag yeah , my # . # `` laptop exactly fits into this bag and still have lot of space not to mention the multiple rooms for cellphone , pen loops , accessory pockets ... still looks compact . a definite buy ! !
the bag is great for its purpose ... to carry a large heavy laptop it is well made and durable the color is not black or any other wild color grey blends in with everthing as with <unk> else i 've <unk> from amazon , it is as described
i am very happy with this bag it is very well made , very fashionable and very well organized i also got an <unk> price because it was a gold box special i 'm exceedingly happy with it i recommend it to anyone
i ordered this because i needed a better way to carry my laptop around campus i figured , for fifteen something plus shipping -lrb- just over twenty total -rrb- that i would be getting a cheap bag ; something that would n't last the semester i was pleasantly surprised to discover that this bag is decent quality plenty of room for my laptop , my cooling pad , accessories , as well as a textbook if i wanted to carry one in the bag too worth every bit i paid for it
this backpack is great for the price there is nothing special about the backpack , the colors are fine , the interior is setup like most other laptop bags it seems sturdy with good padding for the laptop , which is probably the most important thing i guess i gave it five stars overall very simply for the price i have seen many backpacks that are of similar quality , and i have seen many with colors that i prefer , but i have n't seen any for this price if you have a need for a laptop bag i would definitely suggest this one , you simply ca n't lose
solid bag all around but the metal tabs around the zippers ... and there are a lot of them ... are really loud while walking as they <unk> together or against the bag it drove me crazy to the point i cut all of them off and replaced them with a soft fabric loop not as aesthetically beautiful , but at least i did n't sound like a <unk> of <unk> going up the street like it otherwise
i agree with others - only negative is the strap is attached rather than clip on no need for shoulder pad if you are using it for a netbook - if you are carrying bricks maybe ? otherwise very nice case
i looked long and hard for a messenger bag large enough to hold my # . # `` net book , a slim dvd drive , mouse and power cord comfortably without being jammed full this messenger bag is the right size to hold more than just a netbook and power cord alone but not too big to be awkward and bulky the construction quality is excellent the weight is light enough that i do n't miss a shoulder pad on the strap although it would be a nice addition i would wish for a handle strap on the top in addition to the shoulder strap
i bought this bag as a gift for my husband , i bought it as a `` gadget `` bag and it 's perfect he can carry out the camera , the video camera , his psp and tons of other stuff every time we go on vacation it 's very spacious yet little enough to carry it out everywhere comfortably he had been looking for this type of bag for years and this has the perfect balance between comfort and space it has a very good construction and finishes and made all in very good materials i am very happy with my purchase
this bag is a gadget lover 's dream storage for a netbook , mp # players , nintendo dsi , game cartridges , camera , you name it small enough to be easy to carry , yet big enough to hold so much could almost be used a purse -lrb- though not a fashionable one -rrb- , but do n't tell me that cause i 'm a guy has the look of a backpack but not the bulk of one in fact , it may look small but it carries a bunch of stuff really happy with this <unk>
bought my daughter a dell mini # for christmas and a sleeve for it then i thought with the sleeve she would n't have any room to carry anything with her , so i did a lot of research and finally settled on this bag what great purchase unwrapped the dell , the sleeve and this bag when she left we stuffed it with the dell mini , in the sleeve , the discs that came with the mini , the power cord , a couple of dvd 's and some miscellaneous small items they all fit she could have fit more in it like a mouse , etc . very nice design , very practical and not too big to be a bother carrying it i was looking for room and style because my daughter is picky she loved it
i received my bag this week , and am very excited to use it when i go back to college in a few weeks my need was for something to carry my ipad -lrb- in its case -rrb- while on campus , so it would always be with me not only will it hold all of my ipad related things , but i can use it as a ` purse ' to carry my keys , phone , id , pens , etc . one of the best advantages of this case is that it is light weight perfect to carry all day i highly recommend this to others looking for something big enough for the ipad w/case , and some extras
this bag is comfortable , simple , and very durable much less annoying and bulky than my old backpack that i used to cart around everywhere it has excellent padding inside and carries my wacom pen tablet , laptop , and sketchbook along with my pens , extra cords and other wires i need if you 're looking for a cheap but good looking messenger bag i ca n't recommend this enough
i have n't used the pen to create anything on this yet -lrb- and i 've had this for a couple months now -rrb- , but the bag is perfect i have enough room for my # ' macbook pro , along with the power adapter , pens , ipod cord , and lately i 've kept my umbrella in the side pocket just in case it randomly rains definitely one of the best bags i have ever purchased
very happy with this bag , it is well constructed , and a clean basic design heavy canvas and well stitched laptop section is well padded and seperate compartments are excelent for chords and accessories if you need a lot of space , backpack would be better , but this handles light loads easily
this laptop bag is as advertised durable and much more convenient to use than other laptop <unk> -lrb- especially in airports -rrb- which can be bulky and cumbersome i use it for a macbook pro , which fits comfortably in a padded compartment the <unk> is spacious enough for a variety of items -lrb- power supply , paperwork , etc . -rrb- for me , the two zipper compartments work well for quick access items -lrb- passport , tickets , etc . . very pleased with the laptop bag and price
this bag is a good deal for what if offers while there are some other features that might be nice , this bag comes as advertised at a very competitive price i 've only used it for a week so i ca n't vouch for how durable it is but the build looks appropriate so i do n't anticipate any issues all in all i 'm quite pleased with this bag
i absolutely love this bag i wish i could fit tons of thick textbooks in it -lrb- i 'm sure i could , but the shoulder pain would be <unk> -rrb- , but other than that , i could n't ask for a better bag i have n't drawn on mine , too afraid to ruin it , i love the plain canvas i have put a couple of pins in it , though definitely recommend it , esp for college students
it 's ok , about says it another reviewer mentioned the front side pocket for cords or a mouse is pointless ; they 're right other small flat items should be ok ok protector for a cheap price
i purchased this sleeve to protect my # & # # ; laptop as i would be travelling with it frequently this sleeve feels like it was made from quality materials and my laptop fits perfectly it feels soft , almost like memory foam , which adds protection in case it is dropped or otherwise potentially damaged it has a nice extra pocket on the outside which can include the charging adapter and cable plus it has small pockets inside for a laptop mouse and usb stick i mentioned the outside feels like memory foam which unfortunately also means that there is a big chance that over time there will be permanent marks and tears on it overall i would say this is a very nice sleeve at a good <unk> - # & # # ; fits <unk> <unk> outside to protect against <unk> extra pocket for <unk> - the outside will get marks and tears over
i have a # `` apple macbook pro and this works nicely for traveling it has some wriggle room , so it 's not a snug fit however , this works better for me , as i do n't want to have to ` coax ' my laptop into a sleeve , especially when in a hurry no doubt , my laptop is properly protected from all those little extra bumps , especially while traveling ! it has a zippered exterior pocket for storing extra accessories , and it actually holds quite a lot i 've been very pleased with it !
the discription says # . # but i have a # and it fits fine a # `` would also fit but the little inside velcro strap may not fit around to <unk> secure it however , it will still fit in the bag fine looks cool , feels nice and rugged there is a warning label inside that says `` may transfer color to light colored clothing `` so that might suck in the future not a lot of pockets , but the ones it does have are bug case logic includes a sharpie so you can `` tag `` you bag
as everyone seems to agree , it is much larger than the image implies i was alright with that though , so i went ahead and order it so far i like it i can fit tons into it and the straps are padded so do n't dig into my shoulders my laptop fit fine in the laptop compartment , i did n't have to worry about it moving around and i 've got no sleeve for it
lots of room for the laptop good padding for the laptop . very comfortable . several pockets for power supply , mouse , wireless antenna , pens , notebooks better than the shoulder bag that i have been using could be a little bigger for thick books
this is a wonderful backpack with plenty of space for a laptop , power cord , and books it is the perfect backpack for college students -lsb- or anyone who needs the space -rsb- however , it is huge i 'm petite , so it looks really awkward if you are small , i 'd recommend opting for something smaller , unless you want a really big backpack
i love this bag it is so cool looking , feels like good quality , and has plenty of room w/o looking too bulky i have a # `` laptop and it fits w / space has nice pockets the top is a flap , however , so you may want to consider what you 'll be using it for if you tip it upside down , your stuff could fall out but , if you are not going to be using it upside down , then i definitely recommend buying
provides exactly what i wanted it is sturdy and plain roomy inside , the color could be described as olive drab and manly i use it riding a motorcycle and ca n't tell i have it on , and it <unk> a full coverage helmet you wo n't be disappointed if you are looking for practical
case logic usually has pretty good products but this particular case broke on me after only using it for a few days the zipper because really hard to zip and then it flat out broke i would n't recommend this product to a friend
it is a generic sleave that a macbook pro retina # <unk> air would fit in , but is an inch and a half too wide for the computer it seems like it is made to fit a # x # , # & # # ; laptop should be <unk>
my son did like this case for his laptop after a few days of minor use , the outer pocket zipper broke we sent it back and are waiting to receive a different brand of sleeve
i purchased this as a gift for someone with a # & # # ; macbook pro it slid around in the case it felt very flimsy , and there was barely any cushioning i would n't suggest this for a macbook
i bought this for my # & # # ; retina macbook pro it fits the laptop like a burlap sack fits a <unk> it 's at least an inch too big in each direction this would probably be a better sleeve for a thicker laptop
i have a macbook pro # inch with a hard case on it i got the other case but it broke so i thought that i could get this one so it would n't be so tight but it was too big . it was a lot bigger than the # inch it also could n't fit my backpack the case itself was well made and sturdy i bought the case for its external pocket that has a usb pocket inside i gave it # since it was n't the size i wanted but other than that good case . just make sure its the size you want
i really love case logic it 's a beautiful and very functional sleeve , but i do have to say that this sleeve is way to big for my # inch toshiba satellite , everything else is great
it is a good product but i imagined it to be better in design and <unk> it is n't fashion and i used it for little time and change it for other
ordered this for my # & # # ; macbook pro w / retina display it floats around in the case i was hoping for a more fitted case too lazy to return , but i 'm pretty sure there are n't much better option that are less than $ # this is probably why most people just go with the snap on covers
product is good and works as described but i wish the zipper could be opened/closed both directions also , for new # & # # ; macbook pro this is big -lrb- by about # % bigger -rrb-
product was delivered in a great condition but it 's not ideal for # . # inch laptops i bought # for myself and found it bit tight for my hp # . # laptops
<unk> item make a wrong size what you sent to me but it 's ok ... ! the size what you sent to me is over # inch ! ! ! so bigger for my computer but never mind for this ! !
this is a great case but there is only a <unk> size for the # inch and # inch size case here the case has extra fabric on the sides with my # inch macbook inside i like my cases more snug and fit please
a nice case , but one of the zipper pulls broke first time using it they are a rubber material , and it just cracked i have a little clip that i put on there , to replace the rubber pull , but that should not have been necessary on day one
its an good looking excellent case , but my # stars are for the one i received had an small cut out of the box in other words the material is n't strong , and the durability of it is very bad
this is a very nice , well detailed sleeve however , if you 're buying it for acer aspire s # or macbook air # `` , this is going to be about an inch too deep
i like the product a lot , and have no complaints about quality however , a word of caution for all the samsung n # owners ... this sleeve will not accomodate the n # it fits inside , but you can not zip it closed due to the netbooks corners just putting that out there too bad , as i said , i like the sleeve
i bought this for my new # ' macbook pro and it 's too wide i should have measured the computer against the dimensions , but trusted the description it 's not the end of the world , but i would have preferred a <unk> sleeve the front pocket is nice - i can slip in a small external hard drive and usb cable , though it 's a bit tight to fit the power supply
great if you 're looking for a slim light sleeve to carry ur laptop around or put it in bag -lrb- courier bag , soft briefcase , etc -rrb- design flaw is a lack of adequate cushioning at the base , so that if you put down your bag it does n't have a `` hard landing `` i solved it by inserting a strip of foam i cut to fit from a recent electronics purchase absolutely perfect now
although a very nice case , my macbook pro # `` did not fit snug so i would not recommend this for this specific computer there was two extra inches at the top as well as room on either side making the case not very snug
i guess you want your neoprene laptop sleeve to fit like a glove , but it seems just a tad tricky to get my asus # . # `` computer in and out of it , especially for airport security it has to be really jammed in to get the zipper to close otherwise seems like a good product
i purchased this product for a lenovo t # laptop with a # . # `` screen it is a little big leaving enough room for the laptop to slide around approximately half an inch i have not used the pouch for the charging cable as i usually stack it in my timbuk # bag next to textbooks and the pouch seems too small to fit the ac adapter overall it is of good quality and seems to be protecting the laptop like it should i would recommend this product to friends
got this case to transport an asus n # and it fits the computer - just barely the material and construction look very good the case is relatively low-profile compared to some that i 've had so it does not add much bulk to the computer and fits in more bags the accessory pouch on the front for the power converter is a little too snug for the brick that comes with the asus , but would probably work well for a smaller setup
product was just as described i use it for a # . # `` dell e # , so it is a tight fit , but i 'd rather have that than a # . # `` case that is loose i do wish they would make a # . # `` case
fits my # inch asus vivobook pretty well the pocket is a nice to have especially with the extra thumb drive pocket in it the pocket is kind of flat though so i 'm not sure i 'd put my charger cable in there but i guess you could if you wanted to it 's very nice and what i expected
the material is soft and protective although it does n't fit my macbook pro retina # exactly , its a bit big but that hardly matters for the money its a great buy exact fit = # stars i give it #
a perfect case to store and travel with my laptop , there is an exterior zipper sleeve for the accessories -lrb- mouse , charger & cords , usb drive . this case is well constructed , and fits perfectly into a backpack or another travel bag the neoprene protects the laptop from scratches a good investment to protect your equipment when traveling
nice <unk> front pouch comes in handy - it has a pocket for a flash <unk> does n't fit my # . # & # # ; macbook pro -lrb- <unk> -rrb- very well overall : a nice cover that has some wonderful features , but if your laptop is thin or closer to # . # & # # ; expect some extra room
i got this case for <unk> e # <unk> # `` <unk> portable led monitor - glossy black the monitor fits in there nicely , and the case is padded with a soft scratch resistant surface i only wish it had a carrying handle , similar to the attache models -lrb- only problem with them are they are much more bulkier -rrb-
bought this to slip into my backpack my macbook has a hardshell case on it and it still fits in this case there is extra padding around the corners , which i appreciate , and the charger fits perfectly in the front pocket i would want a little more padding on the sides to protect the screen , but it survived a flat fall off a table with no damage so i give it # stars
love having the pocket to hold my power supply only wish it fit my laptop snuggly unfortunately if you do n't own a mac these days you ca n't find such a sleeve
i have tried at least # cases to get the right fit for the asus transformer with the keyboard this one works nicely it was a bit snug at first but that 's the way i like it after a bit of use , it zips without much effort it is also nice to have the side pocket to store the charging cable and my wifi hotspot all is in one place , nicely packed
product was slightly larger than expected ... left about a extra inch on space for my macbook to slide but overall was still a good the outside pocket helps me keep all the necessary items together with my mac
i love this case and especially the pouch that i can fit all the extra stuff like charger , earphones , usb stick without scratching the laptop i have a new mac and this is just perfect ! ! ! i am giving # stars only because they could have included the impact foam this model , other than that is a wonderful case
feels lightweight and durable good quality for the price medium protection for everyday travel like the zipper on front of the case i put my charger in there very handy and a good investment
the case is designed very well and looks exactly as pictured i purchased the case for use with a # `` dell studio laptop which has the wide screen the case is extremely tight for this laptop 's width it does fit , but i would go up a size for widescreen laptops the only other feature that would have been nice to have is a small handle on the top worked ok for me since i was primarily using it for protection during travel , but it would be inconvenient to carry around by itself
terrific case for the price well padded , good construction , reasonably water resistant , does what they say it will do fits my thinkpad w # snugly , but without stretching outer pocket is handy for small items , but too small for the power brick keep in mind that this is a sleeve , not a case it will protect your laptop from scratches and bumps while in your backpack it will not prevent damage from dropping , and it 's not supposed to very pleased with it , would definitely buy another
i bought this for my laptop before it crashed for a second time it was a little big for my # . # & # # ; laptop , but overall was a good sleeve to protect your laptop wherever you go
i wanted a sleeve and wanted a extra pouch to carry mouse and charger maybe thumb drive etc . this case does all that and looks and feels great bought it specifically for my new lenovo y # , which is a bit chunky for a # . # by comparison , and its a pretty tight fit length wise i hope it stretches a little bit with time that 's a minor grievance but could have sacrificed room from the other direction , which has plenty of it to spare , to compensate really only reason its not # is the price its more expensive than similar products , but offers a good sized pocket unlike most
bought this for my # `` # macbook pro and it works perfectly the charger even fits in the zipper pocket with no issues besides some bulk quality is perfect for the price
this laptop sleeve has sturdy seams and durable zippers it is thick enough to protect well , but not bulky it keeps a laptop and accessories safe and together inside a larger bag or backpack
it 's a nice sleeve which hold my # `` asus ul # a , and i think it can a # `` as well since there is a gap , which can fit a larger laptop quality is good , what is good about this sleeve , it comes with a pocket and has a flash memory smaller pocket inside i put my mouse , earbuds , and power cable all inside i wish if it was larger , but it does its job well
