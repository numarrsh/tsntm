im not sure why other reviews were low this bag has tons of room , compartment for my laptop with room to spare i can even put a small clutch , waterbottle , tons of extras i got tons of compliments an work in a professional environment
on installation , which is very tight , on of the tabs broke off , after a few weeks use , the rest were gone to other users reported the same issue , the plastic is very fragile , and the construction with the tabs to frail there are no tabs to keep the bottom bit in place , it only & # # ; hangs & # # ; at the front of the mac useless product & waste of money trying a <unk> case now
i have had two of these cases they are exactly what i wanted , protecting the laptop but not adding any bulk nice looking also but the tabs that hold the case to the laptop broke after about three months of light use the first time i thought maybe i was just unlucky but when the tabs broke a second time i realized it is just a poor design do not buy this case
this is a beautiful case , elegant and stylish however the clips that hold the top part to the screen will inevitably break when they do , the cover simply falls of and is useless this happened after a year i went ahead and bought another one , same thing happened after another # months my store would not exchange it my guess is the clip material is simply not up for the task at roughly $ # a pop , which is what they cost here , it 's pretty much <unk>
i 'd love to love it , but i 've had several of these and with every one , the clips that hold the top portion of the case to the macbook 's screen eventually break why then , you may ask , have i had several incase * does * replace broken units , which is nice but really , who wants a case that keeps breaking
# months out , half the retaining tabs are gone worked fine in the short term , but after a half year of routine use it lost the plastic tabs that hold the case to the computer 's edges no tabs mean no staying on the computer , which makes it pretty useless as a case
i bought this for my # inch macbook air and i was n't looking for spending more then $ # this hit the spot and was the perfect buy fits on perfect but one problem , it is very hard to take the case off once you get it on i had to dig a credit card in an open slot to take it off durable and i have received so many compliments on them will continue to purchase from incase
i bought this case when i first got my macbook air it protected my laptop through airport security , <unk> roads , executive meetings , lazy weekend <unk> -- and got compliments everywhere i went when one of the tabs broke because i improperly attached it , i just had to get another one must use with protective sleeve for transport
more formal look but still very nice appearance the small clips that hold the cover in place are a bit fragile and require great care not to snap off when putting on or taking off the cover high quality fit and finish
i received it and found that it was grey and black , not cream and red the photo you see here is wrong - this cream and red backpack is not ready yet check this out : -lsb- ... -rsb- i will return it right away
this is a good looking bag made of high quality fabric however , the padding is way too light , especially on the bottom , where it is non-existant every time i put my bag down , my laptop makes a thump so , i 'm going to sew some padding in i think
i got this backpack for college in the fall and it is great ! i fit my mbp # ' , ipad , a filled binder , and the charger and it feels super light it has a slim look and it very fashionable i havent used it for school yet but im sure it will be great . it is perfect so far
this backpack is a perfect bag to use around campus it has a great space for you to put your laptop with all of the charging accessories it also has plenty of space left in the main pocket for your books and binders with its # extra pockets you have a perfect space for your ipod when you are walking around campus and the very front pocket is very helpful , just a tad bit small for a secondary pocket all over a great backpack that is very spacious and extremely comfortable to wear around campus
this case is not a snug fit for the macbook pro retina as it leaves some space -lrb- # & # # ; to # & # # ; -rrb- on the edges should n't be too much of a problem tho , since the rmbp does n't really slide around too much if you put everything in a backpack like i usually do one concern is the denim surface i 'm afraid the blue denim may lose colour and stain other items in contact with the case if they became wet a new pair of blue jeans often <unk> color when wet all in all , the case is made very well , with good stitching and zippers
this is a well designed sleeve i am able to fit my macbook pro perfectly , and the front pocket holds my tablet well i am constantly on the go , either at work , taking classes , or substitute teaching this keeps my main items safe and easy to reach
this case is made for the macbook pro . it is a bit loose for the air so beware . but overall it does fit the air and has excellent padding : -rrb- good job
i love this sleeve , but the inside is bright hunting orange i was definitely not expecting that maybe i can sew something onto the inside to i do n't have to be <unk> every time i go to get my laptop
i love this sleeve . its a little bigger for my macbook air , but that 's totally my fault . did n't read the description properly , which stated that this was for macbook pro . it shipped promptly . appreciate it !
i order it and i got it on time and it was just what i was looking for , it covers my mac air good and there are side pockets that help me keep some headphones and all i am happy with the product
i was looking for a navy sleeve for my # inch macbook air and decided to get this one i was n't too excited about the denim , but i was surprised at how great it actually looked in person the case has a nice dark blue look to it , which was what i wanted in a case the material felt well made , and it was a snug fit for my air i recommend that you buy this case if you 're considering , definitely worth the money
this case exceeds my expectations in terms of quality , of both construction and materials the denim is premium and both looks and feels great the zipper on top , which is not pictured , is bigger than usual and seems very durable it matches the leather trim very well , and seems likely to hold up for years the case is of course built for the macbook pro , but i have experienced no shortcomings but a slight loose fit using it with my mba
this macbook air # & # # ; sleeve turned out the ideal solution for toting for my brand new mac not only does it fit with a bit of extra room to accommodate anything you might slip into the outside pocket -lrb- and/or inside for that matter -rrb- , but it does so with very tasteful aesthetics blues with <unk> are my favorite combo for anything - and the orange liner is a perfectly <unk> icing on the cake appears well built of high quality materials all around anyone with an eye for style and quality with thoroughly dig this unique sleeve
i searched around for a while before i selected this case i generally love incase products and was excited to find this sleeve in the dark denim case fits my macbook pro # & # # ; perfectly -lrb- snug with a little wiggle room -rrb-
i waited a little while before writing a review for this product , just to see how good it held up and it is perfect for my macbook pro # it fits like a glove and i 'm always getting complimented on it when they delivered it , i even received a personalized note with my name and asking to enjoy the case this added to the excitement and the feeling that they value their customers i would definitely buy from them in the future for different colors and accessories
it fits snugly in my macpro # . # `` it is very elegant and well made the front pocket gives you an extra space to keep some paper i am very satisfied
bought this for my mba # & # # ; fits like a glove well , okay , a glove that is a hair too large , but that 's fine the color looks better in real life and the sleeve fits perfectly into my tom bihn <unk> absolutely nothing to complain about
this case is great so far it fits my yoga pro # perfectly there is a bit of wiggle room -lrb- ~ . # in -rrb- in the narrow direction but the case is well padded so that should n't be an issue if i drop it the overall quality exceeds my expectations for a twenty dollar case
i will never buy the normal incase sleeve again this one is much easier to <unk> and feels way more durable not to mention it has a pocket in the front for cords or whatever
i bought this sleeve even after reading all the the reviews i have a <unk> protector which covers the entire device so i was n't worried about scratches i make sure i take the cover off by gripping it closest to the spring release mechanism i do n't think it is worth $ # i think bought it with coupons the magnets are a little weak but when i purchased it but i did n't expect strong ones as asus recommends keeping the prime away from magnets **** i would like to edit my comment on it <unk> broke after two months worth of use thank god i did not pay full price on it concept is great , product attachment is horrible i was no rough on the cover as i had kept my prime in pristine condition and was very careful with using it
while this sounds like an ideal cover , it 's poorly made and literally fell apart in my wife 's hands tonight while simply holding her tablet reading in bed she was n't moving it , or anything got the cover on dec # and it lasted until # i 'm sending mine back that just shipped
after some daily use for the past # weeks , the thing came apart do n't buy this product i liked the concept , as well as the color this product was poorly made
its a nice sleeve and looks good the one thing i do n't quite like about it is that is has no back to it so basically you clip the sleep on to the back much like the ipad # smart cover so it does not protect the back of the
i 've been using this cover for over # weeks now and i absolutely love it i 've been looking for something similar to the ipad smart cover since i only wanted the screen protected it was very easy to install and think it works great . i 'm very hard on my tablet as it gets dropped and thrown a lot so far the cover has stayed intact and protected my screen i do think the price is a bit high but it was exactly what i was looking for
i bought this over a year ago and love it . it stays on my prime # and i have had no problems what-so-ever in fact it 's showing its age a little and i came back to this page to buy another
i purchased case for my new macbook # & # # ; w / retina , and it proved to be less snug than i would have preferred i 'm sure that the <unk> # without retina fits much better case does have a very nice interior , and appears to protect the computer finish nicely case also came scuffed , and the material shows these scuffs easily due to its reflective nature otherwise a very nice case , just not for my purposes
the gray cover stains easy with any grease / or anything dirty on a table it is very hard to keep it clean especially if you put it on any table in a public place , as these will usually be a bit dirty
the actual color is shiny , and kind of ugly and the material is like a pillow case , no structure at all i guess for the price it 's worth it but i think next time i 'll save up for something a lot nicer
this item , sold by <unk> power , is not for a # `` mbp i just bought two of them and they are very loose and are # `` x # `` , making them appropriate for the # `` mbp when i put my # `` mpb in , it has about # inch in each direction to slide around but these cases are supposed to be tight i tried a similar one at the apple store and it fit beautifully also , when they arrived , they arrived without any packaging -lrb- the incase sleeves are sold in a cardboard or plastic sleeve marked with the size and other info -rrb- this is probably the source of the confusion , but i prefer items that are new and in original packaging when ordered from amazon directly , they are the correct item , came in packaging and were appropriately labeled they fit perfectly and do a great job of protecting my computer so , be sure to order them from a reputable seller
i bought this sleeve for a # `` dell laptop and it fits very well i was amazed at the price , but when i got it , i saw why the sleeve has a stain in one corner , came in a random gray bag and did n't have an incase paper label on it still a good sleeve , but it was not new
this case fits like a glove on my laptop the zipper operates easily and is <unk> but stitching so that it wo n't scratch the laptop when taking it in and out the padding is sufficient to <unk> the computer when it 's in my messenger bag or backpack and adds as little bulk as possible while still protecting it from bumps i 'm not sure if it would protect from a fall off a desk top but that 's not what it 's meant to do for what it 's designed for , low bulk protection while in another bag it is stellar
this bag got here very quick it is very nice to look at ... last night i used it for the second time and found a tear in the bottom of the bag where the lining is coming away from the seams i can only assume that as i have had only one small notebook and a pencil case in it each time that i have used it that is is not of the best quality very <unk> and upset at the money i wasted buying this ... now i need to go and purchase another one for when i want to actually take my laptop to college with me
i bought this bag for my teenage sister she loves pink and butterflies so i thought this bag would be perfect boy was i wrong - the bag is made with a very cheap material it lasted all of # months before it started bursting at the seams - literally what a poorly made product i really wanted to like it ... get another bag ! !
i <unk> this to replace a different one that my dogs ate , it looked very similar except for the picture and i assumed it would be the same i have a # . # inch laptop that is bigger and heavier than most i guess but even with the added bulk it was still too small for the compartment it slides around in all directions also the picture on the front looked <unk> and did n't have the deep coloring that the picture shows it is still usable and has no actual defects which is why i gave it # stars
i love this laptop bag it is the perfect size for my laptop it is very padded on the inside there is also a strap inside to hold your laptop in place so that it does n't flop around in your bag leaves plenty of room for books or binders if you need them it is also very sturdy and made of very good material
hard to get the macbook air in and out . this case is really nice but its just way to much trouble to put the laptop in and take it out
it 's really flimsy and it 's tough to take my mac in/out of the color is nice , but it does n't really do what i want it to which is protect my mac also , the top of my computer juts out more than i expected , so your computer can get scratched if you 're not careful enough
fits well and is very pretty the leather is slightly thinner than i expected but very soft love how easy it is to slide the computer in and out of the case i would recommend it and the price was reasonable
it 's a simple case , basically one piece stitched together on the sides it feels quite good to the touch , just like regular pleather the fit is a little bit tight for my tastes but i 'm hoping it will stretch out some to conform to the laptop more
when i put my macbook in the case for the first time , it was extremely tight this is leather so it has to be worn in other than the tight fit , it 's a <unk> way to carry around the
i bought this for my samsung chromebook which is the same size like the macbook air but the end has like a bulky end which sticks out but i do n't really mind because i knew that would happen i still love the case because its sleek , lightweight , and professional looking and i did n't want anything with a zipper
perfect , smooth fit for my standard macbook air purchased summer # -lrb- do n't know about retina -rrb- the exterior is sea foam green -lrb- exactly like the picture -rrb- and some kind of <unk> material it looks nice and not cheap the interior is a pink <unk> material that is soft , cute and stylish there 's no funny smells or questionable materials the seams are sewn and <unk> together pretty securely so it looks like it will hold up for a while it 's exactly what the picture looks like and exactly what i was looking for it does n't close so the back edge of the laptop is exposed but this is fine if you 're just trying to protect the cover so you can carry it in something else i would definitely buy this again
the case is much much darker and more see through then expected also , very cheap dirt gets under easily and can be seen through the case with ease it you want the pretty cloudy sky blue color that wo n't show dirt as easily , do not get this ! ! ! i will be buying a different cover as i am beyond disappointed by this one
i got this case for my friend for her birthday in september i saw her for the first time since we left for college in december and she said the top of the case broke i am disappointed in because you ca n't just have the bottom on without the top because it looks weird
i love this case it 's adorable the color is n't quite the same color , but it 's a gorgeous shade of blue and looks great it cracked pretty fast i travel with my laptop a lot , but i 'm very careful with it all of the corners cracked within a couple months
the case is a lot darker than the picture beware when you first get that package , it looks like you got a macbook air case , the way its put together , but once you put the case on your macbook pro , it fits perfectly on the case for the back of the screen , theres a cut out for the apple logo to shine , which does n't show on the picture it kind of weights down the screen so it falls slightly when i close it , but im guessing thats the case with all the laptop cases also the side button where you check your battery life is kind of hard to access since the case is kind of thick overall , it works well
i received my case in less than # days , which was awesome it 's a little darker and brighter than the blue in the picture , but it 's still very stylish it 's clear , shiny , hard plastic that snaps into place and stay secure all the pieces were wrapped in plastic and flawless i have n't figured out how to take it off , but that 's okay for now overall , it 's a great product for under $ #
this # `` mac book computer cover came in such a pretty color . i got lots of compliments ! ! such a low price for what other people are paying over $ # for . very happy with my
the wheels on this bag are terrible within the first # days , one of my wheels had a giant flat spot on it it caused it to make a aggravating noise when i rolled it down the hall i contacted the seller and they sent me another bag the bag ripped at several different places -lrb- the pocket on the inside , around the seam by the zipper , etc . -rrb- and then the wheels split down the middle it was very nice of the seller to send me a second bag after the first one had an issue , but obviously this bag is just not a high quality bag
wheels are already worn down it makes a horrible noise on tile and pavement until today , the only issue i had with it was that it would tip over in front i have been unable to gather any warranty information from this site or the manufacturer i guess the old saying of you get what you pay for is true in this case
this stated it fit up to a # inch laptop , but this is too tight and not what i believed also , the box came all banged up and looked like it had gone through a war nice case overall , but i will not order this or anything from this <unk> again
the initial shipment never made it to my house , but after contacting the company i received it within a few days this was of no fault of the company i have been using the bag for about # weeks now and i love it it 's very cute but more importantly it takes the load off from lugging my laptop and other bags
this is a great bag , lots of room and pockets my only feedback is after you carry it for a while the handle starts to <unk> , if the handle could be made a little more sturdy to endure for the long haul this bag would be perfect
i just recently bought a kindle touch paperwhite and thought this would fit , however it was too small i really liked the idea that you could zipper it all the way around i had to return it
i had the same case for my older , bigger kindle that had a zipper pocket perfect for storing the charging cord and extra batteries for the <unk> the kindle paperwhite has eliminated the need for an external light , so battery storage is no longer an issue i was able to fold up the charging cord and cram it into the super tight , <unk> pocket -lrb- not including the power adapter -rrb-
this is the second one that i have bought i really like that you can zip it up keeps the kindle clean and when it is open and you are reading the kindle it is like you are holding a book
this does exactly what i wanted it to do -- zippers closed for complete protection of my kindle paperwhite . it 's not fancy but it is also not expensive . just what i wanted
this case is horrible i figured based on the price and the picture that the case would n't be that good , but it had good reviews and it was # bucks so i bought it this product does n't fit my macbook air # `` the macbook air fits in the case , but the case does n't close properly with the laptop in there also the case has side holes at the bottom so if god forbid you were to drop the case , your <unk> etc would get nicked on the sides it 's like having a phone case with no protection on the four corners
this case for a laptop/netbook is just not well-made the fabric is very thin and the stitching is missing in places i can barely fit my fairly small netbook into it , and there is no room for the power adapter the closure snap was broken when received not worth the money buy something else . :
nice item and a great deal but way too large if you 're looking for an ipad case , which it states it can be used for yes , you can stick your ipad in it , but it is swimming in it definitely more for a netbook
i was really impressed by the quality of this case i can take this to class , to a meeting , or just store my netbook at home it has a magnetic closure my only suggestion would be a pocket for the charger
i bought this sleeve to protect my surface rt . the case was better quality than expected and quite padded i 've been really happy with my purchase so far i would not use it for any laptop or tablet larger than # inches , though -- i think that the dimensions on the description are actually an inch off
i know this case is meant for tablets , but i bought it to carry books , papers and magazines in my bag it is very sturdy and nice looking as well the inside has some padding and has a pocket on the exterior i 'm impressed with how well it 's made the closure is a magnet snap close
i received this today -- sunday -- and am impressed as it 's a <unk> product , i should n't be i had a difficult time finding a case that would fit my ipad because it has a keyboard this does the job perfectly and with style it looks like an upscale clutch
exactly as pictured would order from this seller again this product does not have a carry handle but is slim enough to be placed into a bag or backpack it has a low level of padding but is sufficient
very cute , i like it a lot , only thing the colors are slightly different in person in person the brown is a darker chocolate brown where i thought it had a gold tint in the picture also , it is <unk> white not a cream or off white as it looks in the picture other than those slight differences i really like it
i was n't really expecting much from this product , as i just wanted a cheap bag to protect my laptop , but this fulfilled my needs <unk> it 's perfect and it is excellent quality would recommend it to anyone
the case is adorable smells a little funny when taken out of package , but smell does subside , and it is certain to get compliments i bought it for my # year old daughter for her mac book pro which it fit perfectly ! ! !
i purchased this case against my better judgement , and after reading <unk> <unk> 's review mr. <unk> is right on the money with his review although i did n't keep the case long enough to find out <unk> , i will say the fabric is very thin and seems as if it will tear with very little effort and light use i did use the case one day to roll from the parking lot into my office and back after just one day 's use rolling through the parking lot , the wheels showed very noticeable signs of wear and tear i returned the case based on my initial impressions of thin fabric and subpar wheels i had to pay return shipping because being concerned with the quality of the case is not <unk> for a <unk> <unk> return with amazon that is disapointing
the space was great in this backpack , but the wheels flew off this is not very durable , i did n't even get through a semester at school before i got a & # # ; flat & # # ; too bad because the design and size were very good
it is ok especially because of the price , but the chrome details on the zipper is not ok too big and ` shinny ' for the color of the backpack ; a less intense color would have made the
had been looking for something that works for both every day use in addition to business travel this fits my large # `` laptop perfectly and allows for plenty of additional space for portfolios , notebooks , etc .
having used a leather briefcase to carry my digital life with me i ordered this in hopes of having a lighter load i was not disappointed it carries everything i had overstuffed into the leather bag and another ipad bag with room left over and , as anticipated , i had less weight to deal with the bag appears very sturdy and we 'll see how it goes , but i am very pleased with this purchase
good bag except for access to the main compartment constructed of good materials and functional have been a fan of brenthaven bags and also have a # `` however , this bag is much more functional and has room for my ipad , camera and cables and such
i 'm in love with this bag incredible construction , durable as the day is long , and i keep finding pockets to use highly recommend this bag the laptop or ipad compartment is easy access for when you 're waiting in like at airport , etc . and it 's a incredibly padded compartment , i know my <unk> is
even though it says it will only fit # inch laptop , it fit my # inch work laptop very well also this is a great bag for plane travel as the laptop slips out through a side zipper instead of having to open the entire bag i have went through many bags over the years , however this one is built to last and has many useful compartments all the prior reviews were very favorable and once i started packing this bag , i could see why well made and versatile
spent # weeks in europe with this osprey <unk> # and had enough space to # days of clothes although it was smaller than i thought the design of its frame reduces a little bit the room inside but knowing how to pack helps minimize this con
i 've used this bag for camping , car trips , and plane trips the main compartment has plenty of space and if you take the backpack straps out of the back compartment you get even more space the day pack is a great bag to bring with you on hikes or to slide under your plane seat
bought this for my husband since he bought me one last year and kept stealing it from me great quality bag , like i said i 've had mine for a year and we 've had no issues with it
i gave this bag # stars because it met every expectation i had this bag is fantastic for a # or # night fly <unk> trip it has plenty of room in the main bag as well as a great little detachable back pack for the daily business excursion i bought it because its perfect for a carry on and if you have to gate check it , just detach the back pack and send your clothes below it 's also very light weight , and the whole bag has backpack straps with a <unk> strap which is great i would recommend this to any overnight traveler
recently took a two week trip to italy with no checked bags the osprey provided ample space with careful planning and packing i strongly recommend this nice looking , sturdy product for you travel needs
i purchased this bag for oversea travel where i knew space would be a premium first trip was for four days and it worked perfectly second trip was ten days and it performed equally as well the zip off day pack works great as a functional backpack for your laptop and magazines not sure this is the right bag for frequent business trips where you need to take suits and pressed clothes , but if you want to take an adventure i highly recommend
fits lots of stuff and has plenty of pockets we will see how well it travels the zip off backpack is handy for air travel because i can put my computers etc into it and carry on the
definitely not # . # inches or even # inches even this case is for ultrabooks # . # inches and under also my ultrabook has a rubberized texture and its too grippy to slide into the case the packaging for the sleeve clearly states its only # inches and this is just false and is directly <unk> by small printing on the back that says max size # . # inches
great quality but not a very good fit , it makes my fingers pain when i try to insert or remove my macbook pro # & # # ; that it was specifically build for i have only used it a few times in past one year , <unk> does n't appear to go away after many usage , i do not recommend this product
this case is a good case ; do n't get me wrong , but the quality of the case when it was delivered to me was not good it came in a big box , full of the air pocketed protectors to protect it from shipping , so i was n't worried initially it would be damaged however when i opened it , i learned that there was a giant crease mark on the flap probably from it being bent the entire time when shipping but guess i 'll live it out since the inside protects it well
this case says it is for # . # in ultrabooks , but it does not fit my lenovo ideapad yoga # the design and quality of the case is fine , but it definitely does not fit my # in ultrabook
less foam and cushion then a neoprene sleeve not a fan of the velcro either caselogic neoprene zipper sleeves seem to be the best for me and my macbook air
this product looks very sleek and professional while providing the protection needed for transport i would give it a top grade for design however , i have a macbook pro # . # & # # ; and i could barely get the laptop out once i managed to get it in i plan on returning this product and purchasing the same product in the # & # # ; sleeve to transport for macbook pro # & # # ;
fits well without a case but expect to take five minutes if you have a case on i wish there was a little more wiggle room so that i could have my case and be able to put it in the sleeve with ease
protects very well against <unk> dust and is falls resistant multiple color but i choose a pink for me and black for my bf and it fits my mac air perfectly preventing from scratches and is easy to carry everywhere
