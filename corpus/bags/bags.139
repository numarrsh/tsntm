notebook sleeve fit my # . # `` older toshiba easily it seems well constructed and the # outside zipper pockets provide room for small accessories like a mouse -lrb- power supply is a tight fit -rrb- i have not tested the mouse yet but it looks like a decent wireless mouse which makes this a good value
at airport check-in , i accidentally dropped my computer the thick foam cushion of the sleeve possibly saved me from a $ # loss the travel mouse that comes with the sleeve makes the package an extra sweet deal
i had a hard time finding a nice-looking case for my toshiba qosmio # . # screen laptop and i came across this one it is well made and the laptop fits well , but there is not much space for anything else in the laptop compartment there is <unk> space in the other pockets and the zipper <unk> is great the bag is well made and it looks nice for a guy to walk around with the only issue is that the shoulder strap gets twisted and there is no way to fix it the strap is just installed crooked , which causes it to twist , sometimes all the way upto the shoulder cushion itself overall , i would <unk> this to anyone looking for a large laptop case
i purchased this bag for my # `` sony laptop previous bags did n't seem to have the room for my computer , accessories , and books this bags stores everything with room to spare the bag is adequately padded and the shoulder straps allows me to carry the bag comfortably if i could add one thing to the bag , it would be a small handle the only way to carry it is by the strap or with both hands aside from this small inconvenience the bag is everything i needed
this bag is one of the only bags available for # . # `` laptops i own a toshiba , but decided to go with this sony bag because of its quality the only issue in # years , has been that the plastic buckle that connects the strap can twist and bunch the strap near the base its not a real issue if you do n't mind it
the only <unk> things about this bag is # -rrb- the side compartments are useless i guess they are for show not use . # the bag would look much better if it was made of leather . # the vaio patch is too small and vaio should be <unk> larger right on the front of the bag otherwise the case is magnificent and i constantly get complements from people when they see it
i looked everywhere for a computer bag for an # `` plus size laptop and the choices are sad i 'm mean really sad there are about three styles and the all look bulky and awkward something that airport security would pull you aside for and check for those `` hidden compartments `` but not this one it is originally designed for the sony vaio but it works just as well for the toshiba qosmio , -lsb- which was my concern and was <unk> -rsb- it just has enough room for cords and odds n ends and for the most part it gives you `` comfort `` . no lugging around bulky carry-on or looking like your moving an office instead of just a laptop this is just what i was looking for and it was shipped to me in a timely and professional fashion and the price was more affordable than going online to find only one choice of bag and one price to pay if i should consider more accessories for my laptop i would probably check here first to see what was offered before spending hours online and checking multiple sites
i had to return this product , as the item i received from vendor `` <unk> `` was not an original kroo case it had a pretty strong smell of glue and the built was flimsy - does nor qualify to be called a `` hard case ``
the case was decent it sat a little funny in my hands while carrying it , but the material was hard enough to protect the computer , yet soft enough to expand a little while holding my computer charger after # years , the zipper began separating from the case , and it 's now useless
this case is n't bad for the money but i kind of wish i would have spent a little more for more protection this case would be ideal as a case within a bag but on it 's own i would n't trust it if it were sat on or dropped i use this for my ipad and it fits pretty well as long as the straps are secured even though they do stretch more than i 'd like all in all , you get what you pay for
this a nice bag for a mini laptop or netbook the only thing is there is not <unk> room for my power chord and transformer to fit in the case with my netbook without <unk> out the sides of the case
this a great case for our asus # ha netbook , but it is too small for our samsung n # the case has somewhat rounded corners like the asus , but the samsung netbook corners are more square do n't think i can get a mouse in the case also , but it is a nice , inexpensive case for just the netbook i liked that it had handles , rather than just the sleeve , so you can carry it standalone the handles can be folded back flat , so it will still nicely fit in a backpack price on sale ca n't be beat
construction quality is great , however , it is designed to fit a # `` laptop like a glove , no space for anything else besides memory cards if you have any type of extended battery protruding from the rear it will not fit you really need to measure your laptop before ordering if they make a case to accommodate extended batteries i 'll buy
i love the case , and it 's perfect for my netbook the handles are another story ... they are not very comfortable on the hand if you 're using it at home , it 's fine though
i have an asus # netbook it fit perfectly very well made , one good hardcase , in side there is space for sd card and power adapter however i would n't recommend keeping the power adapter in side the case because it might damage the screen
i bought two of these my kids love them they are rigid , and sturdy i use them for my kids <unk> there is a little velcro strap to hold the nabi in place , and then there is a little netted pocket for headphones and cleaning cloths etc . the kids love this case too it 's perfect
i took a leap of faith on this fitting my ipad , and i am pleased to say it fits perfectly it is well made and am am pleased in every way as for its original purpose i can say it is well made and well worth the price
the kroo cube case for the # inch netbook is a really high quality case the outside is durable enough for every carry and it fits my dell netbook very snug highly recommend this product for netbook users
this case is just the right size for my ipad # has enough room for charger and cables the handle has hook and loop as a extra it fits in the netting on the back of my cars seat just right very happy with it
this netbook carrier does exactly what i need it to do ; gets the netbook from point a to point b safely the carrier is sturdily constructed i do n't carry anything other than the netbook and a pen and small pad of paper so it 's just the right size if you 're trying to carry a cord , external drive , etc . you 'll need a larger carrier
i was a little disappointed with this case it seems well made , but there are not as many little pouches and pockets to keep the little odds and ends there was plenty of room for my canon # d with # lens , a # kit zoom , and a large flash my main complaint was when i put the pack on - it was really uncomfortable i could n't imagine wearing this thing for an hour , let alone an afternoon i thought it might just be my size - i wear a # jacket , so i had my sons try it on -lrb- they are both # <unk> -rrb- they also said that it was <unk> uncomfortable so i returned the item and am back to looking for my perfect camera case
the backpack had high quality construction , both inside and out ... but the rubberized zippers are very difficult to open other reviews indicated this was only a problem in cold temps , but i found it to be very inconvenient at room temp -lrb- ~ # f -rrb- i had concerns about the delay from the zipper causing me to miss shots , so i returned it also , ladies beware : the bag is very large
i had to return the bag as it did not fit my dell studio # laptop ... even with the battery removed i had nothing else in the bag yet it did not zip closed with my laptop inside the bag looked nice and would have been great if it has worked
frustrated trying to find a nice backpack that could hold a camera and pc this one works , but i would like something <unk> pockets for all the wires and accessories that come with cameras and pcs it is well made , does a good job protecting the gear , but it is not perfect to to grab gear on the fly more of a practical pack
i like the backpack it has enough room to hold my camera and accessories and the laptop and accessories my only real complaint is that the additional compartment is a little small i was hoping for something with perhaps a little less camera space and more free space still , it accomplishes the goal i have for it
this backpack is very nice i 've had it for about a month now it fits all my gear just fine but there is n't much room for anything else if i wanted to put other stuff in it it would be nice if it had a clip that connects the shoulder strap too the zippers have a waterproof seal too all in all it 's a great backpack and i 'd recommend
i carried the loaded bag all through italy on a recent trip and it worked well fully loaded it is heavy but actually was easier to handle than any other loaded bag i have ever had it was easy to carry and all equipment was stable and secure
crafted thoughtfully , has a lot of room and good support for the back still may be tight when you open the front zipper to take the camera out and the opening not so smooth at all time
the bag was nice looking and very well made with lots of space for additional lenses and accessories i carry my camera around to a lot of kids sports and activities and it was just too bulky to carry around all the time i had to return it and go with another brand that was smaller and still housed my # mm lens
positive : as described - very strong bag yes the zippers are a little stiff but do n't let that stop you from buying the bag i have had zero issues with them and the other zippers are very smooth negative : chief complaint is there is not much room for ` personal ' things but i was aware of this before i bought the bag it could also use more ` pockets ' - there is a lot of unused space that i think they could have <unk> on
received mine this week used it twice for field events like the opening on the side like the materials used camera portion a little to big fo me will just have a d # , # , d # , and a flash in it would have liked to have the `` non camera `` portion of the bag a little bigger my # inch hp fitts in it overall a great bag
this is an awesome carry around bag it is large enough to hold most gear for a normal shoot it is a little large though the build quality of this bag is great i can see myself carrying this bag for a long time to come a # inch laptop is a little snug though
overall i 'd say this is a great <unk> bag the only thing i wish it had was a way to store more accessories , such as batteries , power cords , etc . it has one large storage area but it 's like having a <unk> with only one drawer to put you pants , shirts , etc , into that 's a minor thing , though if you 're looking for a way to carry along both your computer and <unk> i believe you 'll be happy with the purchase
construction quality is wonderful on this backpack the weather sealing is well done and the zippers feel sturdy it fits a reasonable amount of equipment , and the side door is <unk> be careful , though , if you own a larger camera my # d mark iv barely fits in , and will not fit in at all if i have a tripod foot mounted to the bottom of the camera
i 've had this bag for almost # years now ... and as a professional photographer i have put it to the test during this time very well built , durable , love the water resistance and zipper seams holds pretty much all i need for any given shoot ... although when fully loaded it is heavy ... but that is why i prefer the backpack style highly recommend for anyone ... professional , recreational , etc .
i was looking for a combination camera/laptop backpack and my local camera store recommended this one i 'm glad they did it fits all my camera gear perfectly and has lots of padding to protect it my laptop also fits well and the storage pouch holds all my laptop accessories along with headphone case and ipod for traveling it is not too heavy when fully loaded which i have read is a complaint of other combo backpacks the best feature is the easy side access for your camera after using it for a while i would not recommend any backpack that does not have quick access to your camera like this one does the zippers can be a little stubborn at first but they quickly operate smoothly without problems you wo n't regret getting this backpack
this bag holds everything when i 'm out shooting and want to upload to my laptop i can now carry everything in one bag i love this bag and plan on using it for many many photo shoots
i got this bag for a <unk> in east africa originally , i was going to go with a tamrac bag with more space for camera lenses however , i opted for this one because the `` <unk> `` opening on the side is a great feature it allows you to quickly pull your camera out to take pictures , without having to take the entire backpack off and go through the front zipper this is especially useful when hiking in <unk> , where you probably do n't want to have your camera hanging around your neck the entire hike in addition , the backpack feels very comfortable , and even with a camera body , three lenses , and a book , the bag feels surprisingly light when on my back
i tried on a friend 's bag and even though it was big ... for some reason , it seems to hug the body more and feels slimmer it holds my laptop and the storage compartment on the top is roomy enough to carry a lot of stuff it 's durable and it fits well , even on my # ' # & # # ; frame the carry handle on the top is great and solid does n't feel flimsy at all the side access pocket is a nice idea , but i have n't had to use it
i travel a lot for work -lrb- have been to # states -rrb- and need to bring my work lap top bringing my t # i was always cumbersome this bag is great for my camera equipment and my laptop this bag has been on a # , # and a # without any problems going under the seat in front of me when in a regional jet , the bag did not fit in the overhead compartment but did fit under the seat in front of me there are a lot of zippered pockets for items such as extra batteries , cards , manual , etc . the side zippered door makes accessing the camera easy if you travel with a laptop and want to bring your slr and extra glass , this is a great bag to have
great price for backpack a little large for my size -lrb- i 'm # ' # `` -rrb- but holds everything i need and it 's well built easy side access to grab camera it 's perfect for going places
the case is okay if you are carrying nothing else but your laptop there is a section for putting your cables but do to the fact the case is not very deep , if you put the cables in the case the case will not zip close if you would like too carry every thing that goes along with your laptop i would recommend getting maybe a # x # carry case
we bought these as cases for some <unk> tops we purchased from another site online -lrb- and while they sucked -rrb- these are probably going to work great for their tablets while we travel
this was ordered to store the nabi # and for the price works very well compared to the case nabi offers for their product this case gives extra room for the nabi as well as storage -lrb- room -rrb- for additional cords and accessories
this case is ideal for protecting your netbook it holds my computer , data key , and battery and you cant beat the value while the case is not extremely hard , it is sturdy enough to endure everyday accidents
i bought this case for my netbook it fits like a glove i ` ts hard enough , easy to cary , big enough for my netbook , mini mouse and charger i just love it
for the price , this is a very stylish and functional case i use it for my asus eee pc and it fits perfectly it has slots inside for flash drives the charger fits fine in it , much better if you take the time to wrap the charger correctly though instead of stuffing it in the pocket the case is very sturdy
i bought this case for my daughter 's nabi tablet it 's great for protection and i really like the handles ; they have velcro that keeps them together when your carrying the case
fit the nabi # and had plenty of room for headphone storage and accessories ... love it ! the handles have velcro and fold down so it slides in my toddlers backpack nicely . :
fast delivery and the bag worked out great for my sons nabi , a little big , but that gives us room to add the cords and other <unk> we carry for
i really liked this case for the first week i owned it ... but it gets dirty and it is not <unk> i am not really sure what to do besides buy another bag if you are not planning on using it alot it should be fine ... but it took one week for the handle to get dirty ... and within a few months it is all dirty if dirty doe n't bother you ... get the pink it 's cute but the next one i order will be in a different color
i really wanted to love this case the inside is great , the size is perfect , the & # # ; <unk> & # # ; of the shell is great that being said , the zipper broke in the first month , we can still use it , but we had to rig up some <unk> 's and it is true , as mentioned in other comments ... it smells it comes with a strong smell and it really does n't go away quickly , you do need to air it out a bit
the size is perfect - it holds my asus netbook , charger and day planner it is much more durable than the case that came with my netbook , except that it is hard to keep clean i have to think twice about setting it on the ground at school , etc . i would still purchase it again knowing this
this case is the perfect companion to my daughter 's netbook . it has a big net pocket to hold the power cable , and a <unk> wallet for sd cards the case is not as hard as i would have expected , but i feel like it provides adequate protection for our purposes
these are very cute netbook cases that will provide great protection to standard size netbooks note , however , that the size is limited and the case will not fit netbooks that have a # cell battery that protrudes slightly from the back - the inside of the firm case is too small i will have to return mine for a slightly larger case
i bought this for my very young daughters little learning laptop , it perfect for her -lrb- # -rrb- she stores her headphones and charger in there too and seems to be very durable
i bought this case thinking that it will have a hard shell but i can pinch the case since i was looking at a lot of cases when i decided on this one , it must have been my own fault in thinking that this was a hard case it 's not just letting the next buyer know this it did fit my asus # . # inch netbook fine -lrb- with a little more room to spare than you would have thought -rrb- , so it should be fine for other approximately # inch netbooks i will be trying to <unk> this case contact me if you 're interested . :
this bag is perfect for my acer aspire one it holds the computer and the power cord -lrb- but nothing else -rrb- the case could be just a smidge deeper because you have to hold the top and bottom together in order to get the zipper to close when the power cord is in there other then that - it 's perfect the pink color is n't quite as shiny as it appears in the photos and that 's a good thing i would recommend this product
for all of you pink lovers out there - you will love this case case is very sturdy with a soft black inside shell and hard outside barbie pink shell case zippers and the handles have velcro on them which makes for easy attaching inside has a small area for storing # flash drives or other , and a mesh area the width of the case for transporting papers , thin <unk> , etc . if you love pink - you wo n't go wrong with this one
the slightly stiff outer material is perfect for protecting the netbook inside the handles are comfy and have velcro to keep the soft handles together this is ample space inside the case for a # `` netbook + power cord and external mouse around the edge of the interior great price for the case
wanted a little more protection for my ipad # when traveling than just the smart cover . ipad fits perfectly , plenty of room for cables and accessories perfect item for what i needed
i bought this for my wife 's sister , she loves it with the color and everything its padded so you know that the laptop is protected inside happy with the product
i just received this item and i have to say that i 'm not very impressed the hinge in the middle kills it for me i planned on using this with my work laptop and with my wireless keyboard that goes to my pc connected to my tv but the hinge in the middle is a problem it folds downward and it does n't lock so if i pick it up with one hand it folds up or if i lay my hand on the side of it i get that it folds up for easy storage but it should really be able to lock in the open position for it to be useful
i bought this to use with my htpc it 's just slightly too small to comfortably fit a keyboard and mouse it also has a hinge right in the middle that loves to collapse and send your mouse off to the floor this also forces you into uncomfortable <unk> to make it work i ended up buying the & # # ; palm sized mini # . # ghz keyboard & # # ; and for everything but gaming that thing is incredible
be wary of this product it does n't seem too well designed * the thing folds so the keyboard surface is out so if you have skinny legs it will not stay flat when seated instead it will fold in the middle <unk> both keyboard and mouse * the mouse <unk> are just poorly attached wings they do n't clip on securely * there 's nothing to catch a mouse or keyboard at an angle if you want to angle your legs at all , things will again just slide off the bottom edge
the plastic is sturdy and it works for its purpose one negative is that the large hinge in the middle does not lock into place , so it can fold up when you do n't want it to even with the mousepad attached , the length is a little short for our full size keyboard and mouse
i like this product ; for the most part , i would not change a thing the one thing i would change , is i would add a normal mousepad cover to the mousepad my mouse has a tendency to slide off when i shift on my couch easy enough to buy one , cut it to fit , and then glue it on , but still the only other thing that gets annoying sometimes is the hinge in the middle of the desk if the hinge was facing the opposite direction , it would not be an issue ; as it is stands , the desk sometimes folds a bit at the hinge as a whole , i like this product ; not too sure it was worth $ # though my computer definately stays much cooler than it did before *** addition made april , # *** wow , so , # years after i bought it for $ # . # , i see the price has jumped to $ # . # i would definitely not pay that much for it , you can find something similar -lrb- and cheaper -rrb- at best buy
i like the compact option when this is broken down and the option to add one or both mouse pad <unk> i do wish the mouse pad pieces held a little more securely , but overall they work fine the surface has <unk> so my keyboard does n't slide around
at first i really loved the case for its look and feel ... even though it was on the heavy side i did not care as the case is definitely a head turner ! after few weeks of usage . i noticed dust getting stuck in between the case and the mac causing scratches on my brand new unibody mac : -
after approx . a week , the satin finish started to peel off the areas affected are on the underside , on and around the feet , where the computer gets the <unk> it has n't affected the function of the case , just the aesthetics
fits perfectly to my mbp # `` only drawback is the heat . it seems to keep in a lot of heat , i have to keep the laptop at an angle more often than without the case if not for that , i would have given it # stars worth the money ! !
this is a really , great high quality case except for the four grooves in the bottom section near the front there are two grooves on either side of the trackpad that are about half an inch wide that are sharp on the sides they constantly scratch the insides of my wrists and inner arms when i type i think i 'll try to file it down because aside from this , it 's a wonderful case and i do n't regret purchasing it at all i do n't have to worry about my mac getting scuffed up and i know even the case is safe from scratches
product as specified very happy overall with the look and the fit , although the case does add a surprising amount of weight to the laptop very happy with the speed of service offered as well
this is a great product and will certainly protect your very expensive macbook pro <unk> is <unk> and feel is <unk> stylish - -lrb- i always get questions about about my hot purple cover # - # easy <unk> a <unk> orange <unk> to keep it <unk> are very <unk> like a <unk> to keep clean -lrb- it gets smudgy from even the smallest touches will most definitely add weight to your <unk> to take the shell <unk> gave it # stars because it gets smudgy it does n't bother me that much , however it is a down side to the product i read that the clear speak products scratches easily i thought it was better to have smudges then scratches and i am glad i went for the satin buy buy buy this product ! ! ! for the love of all things holy ! ! protect your macbook ! !
i like this case , but the satin finish on the top comes off really easily i like the color below it better anyway , so i just tried to scratch it off when it started pealing on its own a good product , though does the job to keep the computer safe from scratches
one of the clips did not latch perfectly in my macbook pro other than that , the products holds tightly to the macbook pro and do not leave a scratch on the sides when you take them out
i found this to be a good cover for my macbook , wish that i had known that you can not use a laptop lock with this product before i purchased it fits well not loose at all all in all a good buy
i would recommend these cases to anybody it seems to be high quality protection that satisfies my dad while giving me good access to the ports , and keeps my beautiful macbook pro nice and clean on the outside the satin finish makes the case less slippery than the older kind had been , which is really good i like how even though it is a hard case , the satin finish makes it feel sort of rubberized enough to feel comfortable it should n't make the laptop too bulky for your bag because i can fit the laptop easily into the # inch space in mine easily as an added bonus , i get to have my laptop be my favorite color , purple , right along with the protection it deserves the apple logo even glows purple through the back it 's a good gift for a clumsy <unk> college student like me because it 's both a need -lrb- protection -rrb- and a want -lrb- color -rrb- even though it 's not cheap it 's a great buy the only downside is that it gets a lot of fingerprints but it 's nothing that cleaning wipes ca n't take off , so just buy some of those
i saw this product on the macbook pro -lrb- unibody one -rrb- at work i saw how snugly it fit and how solid it felt on the mbp i had to get one immediately , and i did it 's been on my mbp a grand total of # minutes now , and it feels like it always should have been there i especially like how the top is translucent enough to let the apple logo show through i highly recommend this product to anyone with a unibody mbp
this case is great i originally purchased one from the apple store and apparently it was not for the correct generation of my mac book , which they failed to tell me this one fits perfect and snapped on fairly easily it looks really sleek as well as a technical note it has enough venting on the bottom that the computer does not get any warmer than usual and all of my ports are still accessible
i first saw this brand on one of my friends # inch macs i just upgraded to the # inch macpro and love the computer , but the case is very easily scratched - i drag my laptop everywhere the fit and <unk> is great - satin soft touch makes it easy to hold i have been using it a couple months now and it looks new and have had no heat issues everyone who see it so far - has asked about it and seem to like if you want to give your mac that little added protection and add a little color it is a `` must buy `` and as always amazon had great price with outstanding service
when an apple genius replaced my old macbook pro with the new unibody macbook , my old case no longer fit it was a red hard case also made by speck and had originally required a little filing on a corner to enable the computer to be completely opened this cover fits like a glove and snaps on with no problems a cloth is included to clean the mac and the cover before installation the finish has a little grip to it and helps prevent slipping on a surface or sliding out of one 's hands this is a highly recommended product to protect the mac 's finish from scratches the actual color is closer to cranberry than the brighter red in the photo
i think it was definitely worth it , the material feels nice although it is easy for it to look dirty since any grease on finger tips will leave a trace
be aware that sliding the laptop in and out of a tight bag or sleeve is more difficult the case scratches almost as easily as the mac itself , but it offers great protection and is very easy to snap on it adds a little more weight than one might expect , but again , the protection is very worthwhile and the color is great
i love my new macbook cover it was so easy to put on and works so nicely i 'm very satisfied i wish there had been more color choices as i 'm a # year old and did n't want <unk> or pink , but neither did i want black the red is okay though , i nice deep shade of red , not bright red the satin cover is real nice , although my cat gets hair on it that i have to wipe off , but i 'd still rather have it than the smooth one it 's got a nice grip to it and i 'm not going to drop it it truly looks like part of the computer , as if it came that way i highly recommend it
i bought this , seeing as it had five stars and was the most expensive , and was severely disappointed it came in on schedule , only a day after estimated day the size was horrible - it is so hard to snap on and actually cracked my computer the material gets easily dirty and the gaps does not cover the outlets correctly you should not get this product - i was frustrated to tears trying to use it and i will return it if a professional has a hard time putting it on for me
i bought this product about a week ago i was so excited for it that i had it next day air delivered to my house upon arrival , i put the cover on with ease over a period of use , i realized that when i would close my macbook , the top piece would kind of show the bottom off it would make an annoying clicking noise when i would transport the device i am very glad that i kept all of the packaging so i can rma the
it fit perfectly to the macbook and protects it without making it heavier or hotter but the plastic had one flaw , and i would n't have any complaint it were in other place than were the apple lights up it had a dark dot inside the plastic just where the apple of the macbook lights up and it looks bad even though its little you can noticed it in right away and it cant be cleaned or removed ; you would have to make a hole in it
i just received my speck seethru satin love the color so far i like the product it went on easily and i took it off to see how hard it would be and it seemed to be removed easy too it does add a little bulk to the computer but not like i thought it would i bought the product to protect my macbook while i take it to and from school and it seems like it will fit the bill over all i really like the product and would recommend to anyone who wants to protect the macbook
this item is great it protects my mac and it 's cute , too i love the satin look the only problem i have with it is not being able to get rid of fingerprints but other than that , it 's a great product
good protection for your macbook adds a little weight but not too bad the case show fingerprints after a little while , but just wipe it off and it looks like new
snaps on perfectly , it is a hard case , but has a nice softer touch to the fingers overall works very well i have kids all over the house , helps my piece of mind the color is not so bright and looked very nice packaged once out of package , it gets finger prints and does not appear as bright hey , but it is still purple most importantly does a good protection job
i 've had this now for a little over a month no issues with dust collecting between the cover & my mac , no scratches i use my mac everyday as my office computer , so it travels with me and i was concerned about banging and scratching it up , but with this cover i have no worries easy to take off and put on the only drawback , as stated in other reviews , is showing fingerprints , but if you clean it they come right off , small issue for me compared to the protection it gives
this product i put on the new macbook pro # `` it fits perfectly fine even though the people at apple told me it was not made for the newer pro the hard shell is great on my macbook and is n't really flimsy it looks nice and the apple logo when the computer is on shows through the black nothing has happened to my macbook so far and i like the protection it adds to my computer
this fit 's so nicely , and does n't make the computer bigger at all i would really recommend it , especially if you are like me , a little clumsy , etc . just makes me feel like my large <unk> investment -lrb- my mac -rrb- rests a little safer
this works great , much better than the older speck cases , on par with the incase version this works great on the new # `` macbook pro with one exception , the lock slot is covered so if you plan on locking your laptop down you 're out of luck , unless you want to drill a slot of your own into the speck case remember to clean regularly , like all hard cases , particles gets caught in between the laptop and case which will eventually scratch
love the case deep red color the apple logo shines through the case fit perfectly , does not add bulk i have the small black incase bag and it still fits easily in the case it does attract fingerprints but not as much as the speck <unk> cases very happy with
really love my case , it looks amazing in red ! ! ! you can snap it on and take it off really easy , at least i did n't have any problems with mine you do have to do it at least once every couple of weeks to remove the dust because if you do n't it will scratch your mac ! ! i definitely recommend this product ! ! !
the coolest thing about this cover is that it comes in yellow i certainly do n't know of any other company that makes a yellow satin cover for a macbook # in aluminum unibody not only is it very pretty , it also has a practical use who wants to get a lovely new macbook dirty and scratched this thing is great i love it as far as i 'm concerned , there are n't enough yellow things in the world note : the nice thing about this cover that separates it from so many others is that it has strategically placed slots in the back and on the bottom to allow the computer to cool other covers do n't have these , which will cause your macbook to overheat
this product is an excellent hardshell cover for the aluminum unibody macbook fits perfectly and look great it is partially translucent so that you can see the apple logo and all the other lights -lrb- such as the battery indicator -rrb- through the plastic really neat , and the satin texture helps with gripping the unit when moving around the only problem i have with it is that when it gets dirty , it is very obvious i have several hand marks on mine that i need to clean off either than that excellent product : -rrb-
