this backpack holds everything and it is cute the only thing is that it is a little bigger than i expected so it makes me look like a little kid -lrb- i 'm # ' # -rrb- also the zippers run smooth but not as smoothly as they should
i really like the style it looks great , and i 've gotten lots of compliments my only complaint is that the zippers are a little cheap , so you have to zip very slowly to prevent the zipper teeth from <unk> also , it had like three different tags that said & # # ; hot style & # # ; that i removed it greatly improved the look of the bag
super cute , i get a lot of complements fits my books and folder and some snacks for college smells a little weird , but for the price and quality i can easily overlook it
wow , i love this bag i got it to replace my old school bag that i was just completely tired of , this bag has the perfect amount of pockets and i love the main zipper compartment i was worried a little about the size being to small for all my books and big binder , but it 's perfect size the straps are <unk> comfortable on my shoulders even with all the weight in the bag great durable material all around the bag do n't be fooled by the lines on the side though , those are n't water bottle holders like i was expecting , but that 's definitely not a problem for me personally . # stars wonderful , cute , and very functional ! & # #
everything about this backpack is as described in the description the colors are just as pictured and i 've had it for about a month now with no problems at all the very front zipper is a little tricky to close sometimes , but other than that , this bag is greater than i expected , especially for such a low price
i was planning to buy a bag for my laptop that i could bring around to school then i found this and i 'm very pleased with this purchase i got the black one the quality of the material is also really good so i do n't see it ripping or breaking anytime soon my only worry about it before i bought it were the straps on the back there were n't any pictures of the back and i did n't want the thin ones since those rip easily and are very uncomfortable if the bag was filled with books so i was very pleased when it came with the thicker straps with the padding it 's extremely comfortable and cute would n't hesitate to buy another one as a gift this was a great purchase and would recommend it to anyone looking for a good-quality laptop bag that 's stylish and can be brought anywhere
i tried # different camera bags to find one that : # -rrb- fit me ; # -rrb- would hold all my equipment with a bit of room to grow ; # -rrb- was n't too heavy i 'm # ' # `` and the backpack fits me perfectly i love the back support it 's comfortable enough to wear through an airport and hiking , and fits under the seat of airplane it easily stores a nikon d # , with # lenses -lrb- # , # , and # mm lens -rrb- , # batteries with charger , rain cover , and has space to spare
the small tenba <unk> is the most durable backpack i have ever encountered i carry a d # nikon , two zoom lenses , filters , lens cleaning <unk> , a nikon flash , an instruction book the backpack is heavy , but , i do n't see how a company can manufacture something of this quality and it not be heavy i particularly like the ability to arrange the interior to securely pack my equipment i considered the medium , but it would have been too much space i am # ' # & # # ; tall and weigh # and was able to adjust the pack for a comfortable fit the only improvement i would suggest is a place for a water bottle
i purchased this sleeve for my macbook pro # `` but it does n't fit as well as i would like i was hoping for the fit to be snug but instead there 's about an inch and a half of space all around i do like the pocket and that i can carry my flash drive and power cord with me as well
the sleeve was too good it fits my hp dv # t -lrb- # -inch -rrb- perfect the sleeve has some extra padding at the bottom which makes it robust n i hope it will last long also , it has a additional pouch in the front to hold some paper plus a usb drive but not good to hold ur battery over all , the product is good and i would recommend to anyone who is looking for a laptop sleeve for # -inch notebooks
i needed a large laptop carry on bag or sleeve for my dell # `` laptop i was looking at a number of them until i found caselogic it fits with room to spare . and the small <unk> area on the side is good for the all the items i need to carry with me
overall , love the case stretches enough to accommodate extra parts -lrb- cords , mouse , etc . -rrb- light yet durable will cushion the lap top from everything but a direct drop onto concrete do wish it had some type of handle ... # `` lap tops are heavy and this can be quite bulky to deal with , especially in the airport security setting wish it came in different colors too would buy again
i have an hp pavilion dv # , which has a # `` monitor this case is just the right size for this laptop there is enough room in the secondary pocket for power cords , antenna , and memory stick the build quality is good i would recommend this case to anyone who has a similar size laptop
i have an hp pavillion dv # , and this case is perfect for my laptop the width is almost exact which gives it a <unk> fit which i like the inner material is soft and the front half pocket fits my huge adapter , as well as my wireless mouse perfectly
this is a beautifully constructed bag and the leather is wonderful and it appears to be able to withstand some wear and tear however the four stars instead of five is really due to my <unk> because it was too small for my laptop i would have kept it but i had to send it back in exchange for something i could use i definitely would have kept it if my laptop had fit though because it is a well-made and sharp looking bag
the bag is very light i have room for my laptop , <unk> and the front pocket is good for your phone , wallet etc . i travel weekly and the bag has kept up
this bag is great for a commuter , it has two large pocket in front and plenty of room on the inside , also fits my mini laptop with ease only downfall iit us a bit heavy because it is leather , but has handles & long enough strap to wear <unk> across chest
purchased for my wife who is a professor at a university very professional and very classy leather bag very well made and very functional my wife loves it and people ask her about the bag all the time
this briefcase style purse is gorgeous and is very well made i have the sand colored patent leather one it is roomy without being too huge i am an attorney and it does fit legal size documents various outside pouches for easy access i think that this brand is the more `` <unk> `` branch of mcklein
i bought this to give as a gift it is a very beautiful bag . buyers be aware that there are different sizes and check them before you buy sad that they do n't have the interior organizer pockets anymore but outer pocket has organizer pockets , which will do good very stylish and good quality
nice bag with the perfect amount of space fit my macbook , ipad , # folders , and a book front pocket is great too slots for pens , a pocket which i used for phone , <unk> , and charger , and more space for misc the large bag that was sent by mistake was too big but the medium is perfect i use the shoulder strap and it has a nice grip so that it that does n't slide love the red
i really loved this case except for it being sewn together so the front pouch on the one i got was terribly crooked and not acceptable wish they had offered an exchange option as i would love one that was properly made
i have a samsonite bag like this -lrb- so i thought -rrb- this bag is a mere shadow of my bag all the same features & looks but not the same <unk> it is not as well padded nor is it as big on the inside main pocket it will do the job but for what i paid i got took this bag is worth about $ # not $
i was somewhat nervous , as this case was only around $ # , i thought i was going to get burned it is high quality canvas , and is a perfect size it has held up going to work and back on a daily basis i would definitely recommend
i looked everywhere online for a nice purple laptop bag with a shoulder strap and finally came upon this one i decided to buy it because it was purple , and not too bulky now that i received it , i am super happy with my purchase my laptop fits perfectly and there 's even enough for for my charger and other stuff this is perfect for school
very nice case for the lap top it fits real good and i love the extra pockets for disc and mouse and any file folders that i need for the day put together real good
i really like this it is cushioned and i keep an extra laptop in it for protection and i like the straps in the inside that keep it in place and the pockets to keep anything else that you might need i would buy it
have arthritis and shoulder issues need something light weight holds up to a # in has room for charger and other stuff i use this for class and have travel as well it hooks nice on suitcases and not cumbersome when going through security color is nice two we have # in the family
i had shopped the bricks and mortar places and could find nothing but a bag i hated this bag really fit my # / # inch laptop it is light and well made and i love the purple color
it met my requirements it was the color i wanted and it was the only one that had a built in strap in the back to attach to a rollaway luggage for security
my daughter bought this case for me , we travel for our job so we needed a case for the little laptop this one is sturdy and very nice it has a safety belt to hold it in best all it is a wonderful purple my favorite
i received the case in a timely manner it was exactly what i expected and i am happy with it i wanted something other than black and the color is nice there is plenty of space for carrying accessories and the laptop secures simply and securely i would definitely recommend this product
i bought this case when i bought a large screened laptop the bag holds a # . # inch laptop with room to spare all around there is sufficient room to stow cords , papers , etc . inside and then add a book in the side pocket it can be worn as a shoulder bag the purple is <unk> the color is professional without black , but has the stain resistance of black helps the case stand out in a crowd = = like under a table
made well with extra compartments room for my laptop , cooling pad , cords & gadgets as well has a velcro strap to help keep the laptop in place and if you want it for smaller items has a removable divider for the bottom love the color , a rich dark purple the metal pieces seem strong & durable , easy to add & remove the shoulder strap
this bag is very user friendly it 's light weight , not adding extra weight when laptop is inside it has an adjustable shoulder strap , making it easy to carry comfortably hard plastic on the bottom so when not in use , it can be easily set aside without worry of losing it 's shape i would not only recommend this particular bag , but am purchasing another one as a gift for a friend
i love the color my # . # inch toshiba fits in it with not a lot of room for anything else , but the outside pocket is plenty big enough to accommodate the cord and other accessories shoulder strap is comfortable and you can put it on the handle your rolling suitcase when traveling seems well put together
this laptop case meets my needs perfectly ; it has ample room for my # . # laptop and lapdesk as well as for all the accessories i love the color and it is very sturdy i usually put it on the floor in my truck and it has stood up very well
great product , light and functional , i miss the compartments with zipper so that multiple small accessories are not <unk> around in the bag , but nothing a couple of ziplock bags ca n't fix
this was an updated version of the sling pack that originally came out # years ago i liked the original one better as they made some changes on this one that seemed like it lowered the quality overall the zippers feel cheaper the materials for pockets feel cheaper even the <unk> feels cheaper i still like it the design and am happy with the purchase , but i would have paid twice as much for the original
for any designer with its own # `` apple macbook pro the bags such like this are useful although is somehow hard to carry around more than # kg on the back this incase pack is my portable office and i can work <unk> and visit a client with my `` office `` on my back
picked up for my wives hp <unk> the case is flexible and provides a snug fit with the extra sleeve of the tablet on or off the extra pocket pocket provides ample space for all the accessories
i bought this to travel with when i go places with my # inch tablet has room for my cords , flash drives the bright orange color makes it easy to find
i choose this because of the color i know that a thief can pull the comp out of it , but <unk> are less likely to steal bright colored items in a grab and run , according to <unk>
i bought this and a handful of other cases ranging between $ # and $ # just to check them out i have a simple black neoprene case that i originally got for my ipad # and it has given me significantly good service it was wearing a bit , so i wanted to see what else was out there , but did n't want to spend too much this case is quite nice it has a side pouch that zips up it is great for power cords and whatnot on the inside there is something that looks like a business card holder with two sections -lrb- not sure what it is for , really -rrb- there is also a neoprene lip on the inside to hold your ipad back , i guess it 's a nice little pouch at a heck of a good price -lrb- i got it around # with free shipping through prime -rrb- i highly recommend
holds an ipad and a galaxy # . # tab at the same time , as well as both chargers no noticeable wear after a couple long trips and the kid playing with it like a <unk>
the shoulder strap does not use the same buckle system that other bags use the design for the shoulder strap uses only a long piece of velcro if you want to shorten the strap , you have to reduce the velcro overlap reducing the overlap reduces the strength of the strap if i am to place a piece of valuable equipment in this bag , i want the shoulder strap to hold this bag works for people who are at least # feet # inches tall
i was given this as a gift i found it to be very bulky it was super cute and i was sad to return it but i had a tablet , a notebook , some pens and a bottle of water and i found it hard to close because everything caused it to <unk>
the colors on the butterflies are bright and beautiful and the bag was the perfect size for my # `` macbook pro + some books and notebooks i liked the front pockets with the dividers there were a few problems , however # -rrb- on the first day using it -lrb- # rd time closing it -rrb- the string in the top flap broke , <unk> it impossible to cinch closed # -rrb- it arrived with a small stain -lrb- which i was willing to overlook , but the other issues <unk> that -rrb- # -rrb- the strap is not really adjustable , since if you change the velcro , you just end up with <unk> areas of velcro i 'm # ' # `` and found the bag hung lower than i would have liked it was pretty
the color and design look better on the website then in person it is not a bright purple unless there is light shining directly on it , the design is just a little <unk> looking the bag it self is nice
overall it is a very nice bag , the main issue was it was stained with a glue like substance i should have returned except i needed to use the bag the day after it arrived without the stain it would have been perfect lesson learned , do n't wait until the last minute to order anything
got this as a gift for my sister for her birthday , and she absolutely loved it the price was n't too bad , considering amazon does free shipping over twenty five dollars the bag is super cute , too it fits her # `` laptop with room to spare the shipping was in the time limit , but i did n't like that it took three days for them to even ship it out of their warehouse once it did , however , the package was on my door step the next day i liked the bag so much , i plan on buying my own
i wanted to buy a really nice gift for my niece , and she is quite picky after a lot of research on various sites , i finally bought this bag , and it was well worth it everyone who saw it loved it the design looks really smart and the construction appears to be good the only reason for my # star is that the floral design color is more on the <unk> side than purple , not sure why others did not mention it also , the strap could use a little more padding as one person mentioned however , i would recommend it to others
it 's is hard to find a cute bag without it costing a lot of money it is very nicely padded if you want something that is going to last a long time than i would not recommend this one it seems like it would not last more than # months since i only need this occasionally this works great for me
the bag is very nice , but much bigger than i had thought it would be the design on the flap is lovely my computer would n't fit into the area designed for it , but it did fit in the front of that slot there was still some padding i returned the bag because i thought i would like the bigger size so i could put other things in , besides the computer but it was really too big for me if you want to take lots of stuff and carry only one bag , this would work for you
a little bigger then i expected and lots of space . . but i didnt realize it was for a laptop and wasnt exactly sure what i wanted lol i just know i loved the design and its really come in handy
looks good , works great room for everything i need and then some wish it had short straps so it could be carried like a briefcase , but the strap is nice and long to go cross body for more security
i wanted a laptop bag and even though i would like zippers , this has velcro it is roomy for all sorts of things and i 'm hoping the seams hold up with all the stuff i have in it
the cafe <unk> is very unique have already received a few compliments , the shoulder strap is wide and comfortable and does n't slip very easily like some do the interior space is adequate , room for a small laptop , binder , pens , pencils , etc . material and stitching seems sturdy and looks like it will stand up to good use
i purchased this bag and it looks exactly like the picture i wish the shoulder strap had more padding but it 's still good for the price and most importantly my oversized laptop fits !
this is a good <unk> bag right now i am <unk> it as a bookbag but during the summer probably as a laptop bag the only ` problem ' is that the bag does not fit into my locker i do not if there is too much stuff in the bag or locker or what the laptop bag has plenty of pockets for my pens and pencils ect the design is very pretty all in all , i would totally recommend it
sweet floral pattern , quite girly and pink yes , it really is that pink <unk> it does not go over the edge to <unk> , but stays in the <unk> land family of little girl pinks the bag is a bit on the large and chunky side which is not quite in keeping with the size of child you would be buying this messenger bag for it would hold a really big laptop and tablets just swim in it the good features are the adjustable strap , the places for pencils and extra books -lrb- really big books -rrb- , and the <unk> padding the <unk> currently using it is quite happy
i ordered this bag as a gift for my daughter the purple is more vibrant in person , which is nice and it 's a good size it appears to be constructed well
i love this bag , it was everything i needed with the padded laptop area and another for my book and notebooks i can put my pencils and other things also , this is an all around great bag for school , and if ever , i will probably take it if i was traveling very pretty , and the bag is just as vibrant as it is shown in the photo
i ordered this at the same time i ordered a new # + laptop the specifications made me nervous as i knew it would be a tight fit it fit perfectly ... the bag is of quality material and workmanship , the colors are vibrant , and the pockets inside the lightly padded interior are well designed it is comfortable on the shoulder ... not too bulky , but substantial enough to protect my laptop the design is fun loving but professional
i love this bag butterflies , butterflies , butterflies ! ! ! it is very spacious for my daily papers i need for job i can store all my supplies without <unk> description of the bag was exactly as described , measurement and all the adjusting <unk> is a plus also , for a comfortable fit on my shoulder mygift will be hearing from me again in the future
i bought this for my daughter so she will have the convenience of taking her laptop to school she loves it very stylish and all of her fellow students comment on how pretty it is
got this for my wife and she loves it purple is her favorite color along with butterflies her favorite ... ordered it on a thursday night had on saturday afternoon # days later ... good quality for the
all the other <unk> of this bag cost three times what this one costs i do n't know why , but i was thrilled to get it at such a good price it 's more than generously sized for my # z ultrabook , leaving plenty of room for the computer , the power supply , a mouse , a lapdesk and my kindle with it 's charger and probably a few other things it seems quite well made and nicely padded it 's attractive , neutral colors that are n't going to make anyone <unk> and <unk> over it , but i 'm pretty conservative about this sort of thing , so it works fine for me the strap is well padded and comfortable i 'm very pleased
bought this for my girl so she can carry her laptop to work it does exactly what we had hoped for and more her # inch laptop fits well in this bag and she also ditched her purse and just put everything in this <unk> bag with all of its compartments and as always , shipping from amazon is always worry free and speedy
this bag is great functional , roomy , cleans off easily , multiple front compartments make it very functional its <unk> down enough for the office but the butterfly adds just the right amount of fun i bought it to replace the standard black company issue bag
i have a # . # & # # ; sony vaio that fits in here just perfectly , even with a micro usb in for the mouse i wanted something that i could use as a messenger bag while traveling the handle is long enough for that , but also comfortable just slung over the shoulder like carrying a purse the design is beautiful and functional
perfect to haul my macbook pro # & # # ; , ipad , cord , wallet , phone , and everything else i need i do n't have to carry a purse during the week now that i have this case
i got one of these bags from my husband a few years ago and loved it very nice looking , high quality , very well constructed , lots of room , well designed -lrb- a place for everything -rrb- a month or so ago my laptop -lrb- in this bag -rrb- was stolen and i needed a new one i am the type of person that likes to change things all the time and likes variety , so this could have been a great opportunity for me to get something different however , i came straight to amazon and bought the exact same bag without hesitation ... it 's that nice a bag
will be a great addition to anyone who has to go to multiple points to work or study will accommodate a laptop with room to spare for <unk> , books , writing utensils with room to spare the exterior will wipe clean with minimal effort
i bought this for a christmas present for my sister ' n law who just <unk> a laptop for christmas and she loved the bag it is holding up quite nicely
i was moving and needed a way to transport my laptop , but i did n't want anything fancy i love this bag , it is sturdy and lightweight and it easily fits my laptop with all the cords and extras the shoulder strap is nice and long , which is something i really appreciate the decoration is subtle and feminine without being too much -lrb- not a very girly girl here -rrb- the price was great and it is exactly what i needed
i purchased this laptop case as i received a new laptop for christmas and my old one did not work with my new laptop it was perfect - has all kinds of pockets for my pens , mouse , cords , etc and plenty of room to fit my laptop and cooling fan all in the same bag very light weight and the strap is comfortable - no digging into the shoulder when carrying it
ok when this bag came i was completely surprised its so much bigger than i expected it to be and there are little compartments to store things in i got it to carry around campus and its perfect for that
i bought this about a month ago to replace an old messenger bag i was using for my laptop and i love this thing it perfectly fits a # `` macbook pro and kindle along with my clutch when i add anything more than that it gets a bit bulky the front pocket is the perfect size for envelopes and the drawstring on the big pocket is a nice touch the only thing this back really needs is a small <unk> for keys & phone -lrb- things that go in and out of the bag a lot -rrb- but it is exactly as advertised and the design is very cool
color and pattern were exactly the same as pictured very rugged , tons of storage , and holds laptop securely this was a gift for a female friend who loved it i will be looking for one in another color for myself
bought this to carry my kindle and ipad plus accessories and i could n't be happier there is plenty or room and it is easy to carry colors are beautiful and the bag is excellent quality
i <unk> the description of this case , but am glad i did because it works well anyway the whole bag is padded , so my # . # & # # ; laptop fits into the front of the bag i 'm using the more insulated area where the laptop is supposed to fit for cords , cables , etc . great looking bag , nice and safe padding , affordable price
very happy with the bag as well as the speed it got to me if you are looking for a a computer case with several compartments to allow for other items , such as music players , tablets , etc . to fit in one case - this is the bag to get
this is the second laptop bag we purchased for coworkers in the office the features are great , there 's enough padding in them , the strap is comfortable and there are a lot to choose from again , this is the second one purchased , once more coworkers get wind of these purchases , i think we will buy more
while the shipping took a while -lrb- it came ` on time ' , but i still had to wait # days -rrb- , the product is exactly what i needed and exactly as described my laptop fits like a glove , and it has ample room to hold all the accessories plus more the strap is comfortable and sturdy and i hope to use this case for a good while
i did have this item at # stars , but i 've now owned it for less than # weeks and the strap snapped my laptop is not heavy , and the only tension was this being around my shoulder do n't waste your money on something cheap go with something higher quality and you wo n't be disappointed like i am
on <unk> # i purchased this for my college age daughter as a xmas gift and on feb. # , she came home with it complaining that the strap had completely torn off the only thing she had carried in it was her # `` computer to and from class i immediately went to amazon to check for a return with the vendor and the last day i could return it was jan # -lrb- the day before -rrb- a product should last more than a month and if it does n't , i should be able to return it for a full refund i am a very unhappy customer will not buy from this vendor again
the very first time i used the bag , the strap broke the part that the clip clips onto that was sewn into the bag came right out i only carried it from the inside of a building to my car looks nice , but not made very well
this laptop bag is not quite what i expected my chromebook fits well but there is n't enough room for the charging cord and mouse without oddly shaped bulge sticking out could use more padding for safety of the computer
the bag look really bright and nice on line , but when i received the item the colour was n't to my standard . to the sellers <unk> the problems i encounter with you guys it had me
it fits my # . # inch laptop perfect its a gorgeous design do n't have any problems with it its not the most secured bad but it has enough padding in the event of minor drops and hits
it 's is lightweight and has the necessary compartments to make carrying everything necessary easy i especially like the padded portion of the shoulder strap it makes carrying my computer a little more comfortable
this is a very colorful , cute and useful item <unk> smell of rubber lingers for a very long time be sure u hang item out doors for about a week to air out
i love this case it holds my laptop and and reader in addition to all the wires and cables i travel with it often and am extremely happy with it the color and design are perfect for the purple lover
as a girly girl i like pretty things this is very girly but does a great job holding my toshiba # . # screen laptop , loving the side pocket for mouse and cord ...
it was a wonderful surprise for my granddaughter , who at christmas received a laptop this case made it possible for her to carry her laptop without the fear of slipping out of her hands and breaking the quality was excellent and very durable
the bag is amazing the material is soft and a great way to not only carry your computer , but also protect it from scratches i love the design that is visible from any side there is also another pocket to carry <unk> other items the shoulder strap is adjustable from both sides and the padding is extremely comfortable overall , great product !
do not buy this is the second speck case i bought for my macbook pro # & # # ; -lrb- first time thinking i just ordered the wrong size -rrb- i was wrong this item will not fit your mac i would advise going to an actual store -lrb- best buy , staples , etc . -rrb- and buy one so they can help you plus it came damaged and scratched when i opened it
i was very excited to receive this case because my husband was super satisfied with the one he had ordered a week prior the satin touch makes the case a little bit softer and the minute i put the <unk> on the edges started to crack it is not been long and i have n't dropped or been rough with my computer and it is barely hanging on would love to get it replaced but having trouble with getting a response i inquired awhile back and still have not heard back needless to say i am not very happy
it cracks and i 've been using it for only about # weeks what 's the <unk> point of buying a case that probably needs further encasement and protection i do n't get it
