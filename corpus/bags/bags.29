i did not know what to expect when i <unk> the case , it was cheap , light weight and not very wide it is terrific for <unk> case it holds all the components and extra papers too i recommend it highly
this case is perfect it has been so hard for me to find a carrying case for my huge -lrb- # inch -rrb- laptop i wanted a sleek plain case that will be easy for me to carry around my university and the bus system this case is perfect for that and it even has extra pockets and room for pens , paper , etc . , without adding bulk to the case i highly recommend this laptop case to anyone with an oversize laptop
i purchase this for my husband because he did n't have a case for his # inch computer he opened it and his face lit up and he is happy with the case thank you for the fast delivery
what a great buy perfectly happy with the case for my son 's new laptop very professional yet not bulky the laptop is slightly over # inches but yet it fits perfectly can also hold charger , mouse and other small accessories
this case fits our # `` laptop perfectly it would be nice if there was a little bit more room to fit our cords , but it works fine for what we need it to
i found this case to be roomy enough for not only my laptop but accessories as well light weight and not as bulky as my previous case that i paid over twice as much for
my son loves this he needed something to carry over his shoulders he was on crutches , but does n't stay in one place for very long this was good protection for the computer and good carrying device for him it was nice and very inexpensive thank you amazon
i bought this for my new laptop and it is perfect i take it went i travel and no more worries all the cords fit into the top flap too
i thought i had already submitted a review for this case and at first i would have given it # stars based on the case perhaps being a bit too snug well , i 've had the case for # or # months now and i 'd have to say the case fits my # & # # ; hp laptop very well it is snug but taking the laptop in and out of the case is no problem the carrying strap and handles seem secure and the padding is probably enough to protect the laptop if you might happen to bang into something like a door frame -lrb- just a guess -rrb- i suspect you 'd be less <unk> if you dropped it onto a hard floor however , i 'd say it beats most neoprene sleeves that are around the same price point and it is much more versatile the main pouch is covered by a velcro secured flap and it 's big enough to hold the power cord and a few other items there 's also a sleeve on the back that could hold a few pads of legal sized paper for the money i give this case a solid thumbs up
i use this as my computer bag at work a lot of times my laptop is always in the trunk getting cold around here and there in this case has protected it , works like a
my husband bought me a new # inch laptop and i wanted to keep it safe when i took it on trips i looked into several different others and looked at reviews i also went to different stores to look at what they had i found this one to be the best and the price was good it works well for me
i bought this as a gift for mom who recently purchased a # `` laptop apparently # `` laptop cases are extremely hard to find `` <unk> `` . best buy had some , but as usual were crazy overpriced this is a simple , functional and well priced laptop bag if you 're not trying to make a fashion statement and just want something to lug your # `` laptop around in , i would highly recommend it
i read other buyers ' reviews about this product not having enough room for their stuff , but i have no idea what they wanted to carry i have my # & # # ; laptop , headphones , power cord , a dvd movie , notepad , operating manual , and have plenty of room for a couple more things the case is perfect size , more convenient than one of the big laptop carrying cases , and the price is great i could not be happier with this purchase
has plenty of pockets and slots for you to place your gear also has a decent amount of padding for your electronics the build quality is really quite good and for the price it ca n't be beat
we were very pleasantly surprised by the good looks and versatility of this computer case it holds our # `` laptop and all the accessories with room to spare it far surpasses our expectations for the price being charged
needed light case to carry laptop to/from home and office the bag fits # & # # ; hp laptop perfect the outer pocket also fits cord if need best part is that the bag itself is lightweight , yet durable
this laptop case is great i was skeptical at first , but when i got it , you realize how nice it really is it 's a # inch case but fits my hp g # . # inch laptop without any issues there is room in the front for cds , pens , charger , and it 's not too bulky ! great item
this is a nice case for my oversized laptop , even though it 's a bit snug but it protects it well during transport also has room for my cords and mouse perfect for my needs
i would definitely recommend this product it was delivered in a couple of days and received exactly as shown a nice quality , affordable case with inside and outside pockets . - perfect
this is a moderately priced notebook case and works wonderfully with my # inch dell laptop the shoulder strap feels very secure and the case is sturdy and has enough padding to protect the computer
i got a new hp # . # `` laptop , and none of my old computer bags were large enough so after reading all the reviews about the kensington sp # i ordered this <unk> i really love it it 's lightweight , compact , and well-made the # outside pockets are narrow -lrb- no gusset -rrb- , but i 'm not planning to carry lots of stuff there is a divider inside the main zipper portion of the bag to seperate the laptop from any paperwork , and the interior is nicely finished , too for an inexpensive bag , i 'm impressed kensington k # us sp # -inch classic sleeve notebook case -lrb- black
arrived earlier then expected first of all this is a great bag i was looking everywhere for something under # bucks since i just bought a laptop and found this online gives my # inch dell laptop enough room with space to spare outside the case there 's a place where you can place your charger , some folders or papers and other useful items i put the sleeve on and it looks great padding is great and fabric looks stable i 'm sure this will last a long time i would recommend this to other costumers
i did n't know what to expect before it arrived , but i am now very pleased with the quality and price perfect for my computer the handle and the pouch are necessities for me do n't know why others do not always have these features
just got the bag today and i really like it so far it fits my # . # & # # ; lenovo laptop and there 's enough space for the charger and a few other little odds and ends the canvas seems pretty durable and the shoulder strap is very comfortable
a little tight of a fit for a # inch laptop i ordered another laptop case and use this to carry my business files very handy and very satisfied with the quality of this product
when i saw the brand name , i felt confident that this would be a great bag it 's not very little padding and , as i stated in the headline , the handle tore off with only a weeks worth of use
piece of junk it will probably last # months to a year but for $ # what do you expect fabric in poor quality little to no protection -lrb- padding -rrb- from the outside to the laptop compartment but you get what you pay for to much trouble to return it so i will use it until i ca n't stand it any longer nothing at all like the last kensington bag i purchased for my wife a few months
it was cheap when i bought it that should n't mean much but it was compared to a targus bag i bought prior the cloth loop holding the shoulder strap came undone and the bag nearly took my laptop down a flight of stairs speaking of the shoulder strap , it 's not terribly comfortable this is probably a decent light-duty bag , but if you intend to carry anything serious like a laptop and books , look elsewhere
i own a # `` macbook pro and i would agree with the first reviewer that this has good compartment design and handy extra pockets for items such as cds , flashdrives , the mac power charger , etc . it is n't <unk> either so it 's easy to grab and fit anywhere the padding is quite sufficient for light-weight banging around -- in and out of cars and on <unk> airplane seats , etc . -lrb- sounds like a john <unk> <unk> movie , right ? -rrb- but , seriously , i would definitely recommend this for any situation , other than checking at the airport
i am a frequent traveler that desire to have the easy check-point feature the bag arrived without issue however , it is poorly constructed the <unk> attachment broke within a day of use the zipper tags are falling off otherwise the bag is nice and performs as
i was disappointed that this bag was n't made with the quality i 'd expect within # wks , the shoulder strap broke - first the metal mechanism and then the leather loop that attached it to the bag i was carrying a laptop , about # inches in paper <unk> , and pouch with cables -lrb- headset , power cord and small mouse -rrb- which is a typical amount to carry in a work bag the handles were n't long enough to go over your shoulder , so the only way to carry the bag is in your hand i 've returned it to amazon
i bought this bag to use everyday at school , work , and travelling i got it because i was fed up with all the other bags i would buy for really cheap and then would fall apart after a few months or even weeks i figured i could spend $ # every few months on new bags or $ # for one that 'll last it was n't worth it one of the handles is starting to come apart at the seam from the body of the bag it is not strong enough to handle the stress of books , a laptop , and files that i carry around in it i will need to return the bag after only a month if you do n't plan on putting a lot of stress on the bag , however , the compartments are lovely and make organizing my mess of things a lot easier on the go it has nice pockets for cell phone , pens , flash drive , makeup , power cord , and more it 's a nice material and design that is extremely functional
i travel extensively , so i bought this bag to help speed me through tsa it has works great lots of room for all my electronics and pockets for all the odds and ends
just like others who <unk> about this bag ... the shoulder strap broke within weeks of use ... it 's too heavy to use without the shoulder strap - probably too heavy for the shoulder strap design it has a lot of nice features but if you need a bag to do a lot of walking with , do n't buy this
this was over priced and cheaply made ... the second time i used it , a leather strap that connects the shoulder strap to the bag broke this bag is also very heavy i 'm sure you can find a sturdier bag that weighs less and is more durable
i really liked this bag when i got it it has a lot of compartments and everything fits nicely this bag was great until i used it to travel the first time and as i was waiting in security the bag strap broke i had to carry it for the rest of the trip by the # short handles which was really a hassle since its over a period of time i am not able to return it , so now i am stuck with it
this laptop bag is very nice . very well made with lots of pockets its definitely solidly constructed the only downfall is that its really heavy once i put my laptop in it without any other paperwork , it felt like i was <unk> <unk> i bought it because of the price and i really liked the color combo , however , knowing how heavy this is and how much i have to lug this around ... its a bit cumbersome
loved it when it came it has plenty of pockets to keep everything organized however , the loop that the strap connected to broke i 've been able to fasten the strap onto another part but that is only going to be temporary it wont hold for too long i would use this to carry my laptop and paperwork home on the weekends and on less then # business trips since purchasing i 'm not hard on it at all my co-worker bought the same one in brown and a different part of her 's broke too -lrb- also involving how the strap connects -rrb- next time i would be better off spending more money getting a better quality bag
perfect as i travel a lot i hate taking my laptop out - this is so convenient i also love all the pocket space so when i go to facility after facility , everything remains organized
when i was ordering this bag i had my doubts that it would be worth the cost i was very happy when i received the bag it is very well made it seems to be very durable update : # / # since receiving this bag i have had to send it in for repair once after the leather around the shoulder strap rings broke repair was fast and the bag looks great it does get very heavy with my # . # `` laptop & cables , my padfolio , and various pens , highlighters , folders , etc in the bag no problems with airport security and nicely slides over the handle of my suitcase during travel since the repair i have seen no signs of deterioration and still looks great & professional
<unk> by the looks i was getting at the airport , this is a must-have bag after standing there for ages watching everyone unpack their laptop bags into those plastic bins , i was able to unzip one zipper , lay the bag flat on the belt and walk through the scanner pick up the bag , give it a zip and walk off while the people who were in front of me are still <unk> one man caught up with me and asked where i bought this bag a million pockets -lrb- that 's almost true ! -rrb- and three compartments will hold everything i did n't bother with a purse - i just put my things into this bag because i had room to spare love the green - so rich and pretty but easily gender neutral
hi i am currently <unk> my <unk> legal nurse consultant license , and am going to need a briefcase to carry my screening tools and hopefully future cases that i will be <unk> <unk> with this briefcase is light , great looking and has a laptop compartment that makes checking in at airports a breeze i can not wait to start using it
i 've used this bag for frequent travel for # years and get lots of compliments it 's worn very well but it 's heavy before you even put anything in it the laptop section ca n't have anything but the laptop in to go thru security , which is fine but that section is way too <unk> for even my older , thicker laptop it results in a lot of wasted space , which would be even worse with a newer , thinner laptop on the good side , the outside pocket is great for boarding pass and passport , and one section has a ton of pockets for everything you might bring it zips open accordion style making it easy to find things i also love the velcro strap on the one side that lets me secure it to the handle and sit on my wheeled suitcase i 'll be getting a new laptop and will definitely be looking for a new bag to help lighten the load and make better use of space
this bag is incredible all the pockets it has it will be used often in my travel for work just hope it does n't fall apart like others were saying the bag comes with a life time warranty from the manufacturer
i love the color of this bag . . and the stripe lining is very pretty and adds a nice extra the bag functions great ! its alittle on the heavy side but other than that i love it ... lots of
bought this to lug a laptop , my kindle , books , and papers it has so many compartments it is all you need i get lots of compliments on it as well love the bright pink i did spray it with a fabric guard and have no issues with dirt sticking to it
it 's a nice bag several compartments and the zippers work well i was looking for an everyday bag that would go through airport security without my having to remove my laptop i 'd shopped around but most tsa approved bags were black and boring and more than what i needed this bag suits me and my purpose , everyday carry with occasional flying it is well made and i expect will hold up well for my needs it may not be suitable for the frequent flier it 's also a nice looking bag and easy to carry
very roomy with tons of pockets for all the papers i need for school love the small zipper pocket inside to hold my flash drive and <unk> enough room for my charger and mouse to fit with my computer
lots of pockets , flexible , attractive , and useful i do n't know how durable it is -lrb- since only time will tell -rrb- , but i adore this bag and am considering purchasing it in a darker color for winter
this laptop bag is perfect for travel the computer fits securely into a compartment with a velcro top there are multiple compartments to stow folders and notebooks , along with other essentials like note cards , pens , and my trusty phone and kindle there is a shoulder strap that 's nicely padded , and an opening so the bag will loop securely over a rolling suitcase i love the pink and brown combination the pink suede looks nice while remaining professional
this laptop briefcase is fabulous ! you still have to take your laptop all the way out and open it , btw it is beautiful and very roomy i 'm very happy with the way it was made , how it looks , and the price i paid
i had been looking for a professional and feminine bag for a while , and was excited to find the mobile edge bag the bag looks sharp , and the pockets are well designed , but the product itself has some issues i had the bag for # weeks , and the top handle broke i do not overload my bag , so there is no reason for this to have broken also , the zipper pull broke after # weeks i love the look of the bag , but not thrilled with the quality
this is a nice travel case it holds my laptop which is n't small -lrb- there is n't an awesome place for the cord but i make it work -rrb- plus there is a full case compartment for folders , papers , pads etc - not terribly spacious but can hold several single notebooks or folders then the front has # compartments perfect for pens , phone , accessories etc . lots of pockets exist within each compartment - very nicely done this is comfortable for caring around and i 'm thrilled this looks feminine and holds a good amount
i am a small person -lrb- # ' # & # # ; -rrb- and it was a pain trying to find a small laptop backpack that would fit my # . # & # # ; laptop most laptop backpacks are huge and make me look ridiculous this backpack was the perfect size , with lots of other compartments and pockets to hold everything i can possibly need the only concern i have , is that the laptop compartment on the inside is made of this scratchy plastic material i used to have a dell inspiron laptop that has a silver matte surface the scratchy plastic <unk> up the silver it was an old laptop that i was going to be replacing soon anyway though , so it was n't too big of a deal i did n't want the plastic to <unk> up my new laptop , so i took <unk> with my new laptop and sewed a microfiber case to put inside the plastic one the <unk> accents on this backpack is not really my style , but at least the backpack is black way too many products made for women are pink nowadays , so i 'm thankful that this is at least black
it does fit a # r dell -lrb- # & # # ; w laptop -rrb- its a little snug , but it fits and i do n't have to struggle with the fit of my laptop . that includes with a laptop sleeve on works perfect for all my attachments as well -lrb- mouse , backup hard drive , card reader , usbs , etc . but it would be nice to have a seperate compartment for folders that i have i can manage placing them in the bag , but there is no specific place to put them its also light weight , no matter how much electronics i have in it
this is just thr right size to fit under seat of plane but not much room for incidentals if you are going over night a little heavier than i thought it would be but very efficient for security you just unzip and lay it flat instead of fumbling to pull it out and then put it back in i am not in to patent leather but it was the only selection for women in the backpacks , but i bought it <unk> for the <unk> of going through security and it definately meets that requirement
the amazon description should have said that this mobile edge model is designed for women i am petite and found that the straps stayed on my shoulders much better than previous laptop backpacks i have owned it also seemed lighter to carry even though i had more in it than in the backback i had been using the scanfast feature worked great -- i just unzipped the compartment and was not asked to remove the laptop at the airport checkpoints note - this backpack does not have a water bottle holder or a waist strap
i saw a woman carrying this bag at a convention & it immediately caught my eye i asked where she got it and did an online search the next day & placed my order lots of pockets and compartments to store various items light but <unk> & very stylish love , love , love it
so i spent quite a bit of time looking on line for a new backpack after my old one died i just got it last week and took it on my first business trip today so far i love it , it went through security super easy and saved me a bit of time and headache of packing and unpacking my laptop hopefully it will keep me as happy as i currently am
i am very pleased with my purchase i 've researched many different checkpoint-friendly bags before my purchase this bag is light weight , has enough storage space for my needs and is stylish i have received many comments on how pretty the bag is -lrb- even guys have commented -rrb- i was very pleased with the ease of going through security , just zip open the bag and send it through directly on the <unk> i would definitely buy this bag again
when i fly , i use this backpack to hold my gps , camera , cell phone charger , snacks , jewelry and a book as well as my laptop just need to unzip the computer section and open the pack when going through security my arms used to ache from carrying all these gadgets , but now travel is relatively painless
this bag is amazing , light weight and an essential travel tool i have used it for all of my day trips and fly through security less hassle and less <unk> since the bag acts as it 's own holder for your computer remember that it can only be your computer in the pouch ... no additional batteries or cords bag is stylish and design wise the only thing i would change is the logo . . ugly buckle !
this backpack/laptop bag is awesome light weight and room for lots of stuff in addition to the laptop it says that it fits a # . # `` laptop but my # `` widescreen fits without a problem , and i am sure a # `` widescreen would fit in it too the bag itself is very lightweight so to carry it with a laptop is n't a chore i wanted a bag for my laptop that not only carried the laptop and other stuff , but looked good too , and this one delivers the whole package also , the fact that it is a checkpoint friendly backpack , meaning you do n't have to unpack your laptop at the airport checkpoints is really cool just unzip the bag , lay it flat and through the scanner it goes makes getting through the checkpoints with a laptop so much easier and faster i love this bag ! ! ! !
i 've been looking for a laptop backpack for awhile . . but wanted something stylish as well as reasonably priced i love the look of this bag i have a bad shoulder , and it is not irritated by the weight of this bag , and in fact , i 'm very comfortable carrying this bag
bought this because i had to travel to ireland for business and was tired of lugging a heavy computer bag through all the airports met all my expectations no issues going through security ; sometimes security for international flights is <unk> very light weight and sturdy made running through airports less stressful i am vertically challenged -lrb- less than # ' # & # # ; tall -rrb- and it fit perfectly
i bought this case about a year and a half ago my first impression was that it looks kind of cheap when brand new the accents are a super shiny patent leather i was n't in love with it , but it is very convenient and i did n't feel like returning it , so i started to use it and boy , if i thought it looked cheap before , it 's even worse now after a year and a half of not overly excessive use -lrb- i probably made about # trips a month with it -rrb- , it is basically falling apart all the patent leather accents are cracked , the seam threads are unraveling , and worst of all , the handles are rubbing off on all my clothes when i sling it over my shoulder i 'm ashamed to carry it i would n't buy it again if i could , and may not buy other me products because of it
i purchased this briefcase # months ago , and it was <unk> me fine until i noticed just this morning that the fabric along one of the front seams was torn i had not checked this bag into any <unk> , had not tossed it or treated it poorly in any fashion i was using it as my main briefcase for work so i took it with me to the light rail only unfortunately the return date has expired be aware that the return policy is n't friendly to the consumer as you will only receive a partial refund and will have to pay shipping costs
i really liked the looks of this bag when i selected it however , it is cumbersome and both the straps split apart after only # trips it could hold a great deal but was not comfortable or efficient to travel with
i returned the item because the zipper on one side would not work properly it was very sticky and difficult to zip if i am going to spend this much money on a bag i want it to at least be in good condition once i got it in hand i also felt like it looked cheap and cheesy the `` patent leather `` looks like vinyl and i personally just did not like the style it was a little too flashy if the zipper was working i probably would have kept this bag but returning it was very simple and i am glad that i did i ended up purchasing a samsonite bag at office depot that is real leather and looks very nice
i travel every week with work and this bag makes getting through security at the airport a breeze the size is perfect for carrying back and forth to the office and it fits perfectly under the seat in the airplane perfect bag for those that travel often
i think i 've had this for about a year - wanted to get through security faster with a laptop it works well for that purpose the bag is somewhat bigger than i expected - i have a # in laptop and there 's more than enough room for the computer , some peripherals / cords , files , and various and sundry office supplies sufficient pockets / storage two pen holders , id card holder , <unk> holder , wallet holder which are in the smaller pocket you see in the front there are two main compartments - one for the computer and one for files in terms of smaller zippered pockets - i think there 's a little one on the outside , and one or two zippered panels inside but i do n't use them that much also comes with <unk> purse which is nice for going out just so you know , it is not real leather and the faux leather trim will fray
i had my doubt about what time it would really save to be able to leave my laptop in the briefcase , but it really does it 's so cool to just be able to unzip the briefcase and send it on through , on the other end i just have to worry about my shoes and zipping the bad up once again no more worries about leaving anything behind i am loving it
extremely pleased with this purchase the bag is attractive and fully functional , on all counts perfect features for the laptop , as well as additional features for other , personal items delivered very quickly i would buy again , if needed , and i have already recommended it to several people that i know
i really like this product because it looks very stylish and fits perfectly on my macbook pro # `` it protects my laptop really well , does n't scratch the body , and the material is soft and smooth and is lined really well inside it does a good job of protecting my laptop from <unk> i use it primarily as an envelope or sleeve for my laptop which then goes in my laptop bag or bike messenger bag i only wish it came with a pocket on the outside for me to put accessories in the price is a bit high , but i am very pleased with the product there are no other macbook pro sleeves that look and feel better than this and it does not have a strange smell either
great fit and feel the inside `` wings `` keep the computer inside and protect it from the zipper and you do n't have to remove your computer from the case when you go through airport security - or at least i never have however , to be clear , this case will not protect your mbp from anything more that scratches it is n't hard or thick or spongy ... . . but it does a great job inside a backpack
decided to spend a little extra $ $ on a sleeve that would fit perfectly ultimately , i think it was a good decision the fit is nice and snug there is an interior pocket so the zipper never touches the computer the material feels of high quality and the zippers never snag it looks a little better in person vs. the picture online regardless , it is a rather bland color gray and way more conservative than some other options although , if you 're walking around w / a + $ # computer it might be better not to have the case scream for attention the sleeve is not bulky so it fits well in my other bags also , i it feels comfortable enough to just carry in my hand w / my portfolio
this laptop cover is great ! it is decently priced , and far exceeded my expectations of a laptop cover it also looks very nice and does not add too much extra weight to the laptop
tight fit for a macbook pro # `` purchased jan. # the inner sleeve holds the laptop very well and the outer microfiber material does n't allow it to slip and slide all over the place excellent because i bring my laptop from class to class and it 's easy to get it in and out of the sleeve the keyboard cover it comes with is very thin and is made to cover the keyboard perfectly -lrb- i feel it could be a little bigger for easier placing -rrb- also , just a note , the material itself is very soft but picks up everything , lint , dust , flakes of random stuff , you just need to brush it off well all-in-all , it suits my needs perfectly , it 's also very thin so it does n't take up much space in my bag and it keeps the laptop from being scratched up or damaged
i had one of these a year ago , and lost it had to go through a lot of effort to get it again , but its really worth the money fluffy and find , goes well with my hp # . # `` even with a thick battery and you can put the mouse inside , if you really insist
this sleeve feels nice on the outside , is somewhat padded -lrb- does n't require much , it is just a sleeve after all -rrb- , and holds the macbook perfectly i have the new # -lrb- which is the same dimensions as the previous few years -rrb- and it fits tightly inside the sleeve the lip that covers the front is excellent as well , i never worry about it slipping out until i manually pull it out it also comes with a cloth to lay over the keyboard not sure what the functionality of it is , but i use it anyways i would suggest this sleeve to anyone with a # `` macbook pro i love it
i bought this item for my new macbook pro , i did a lot of research before i decided to buy this one i 'm so happy that i did it 's the best way to protect your mac it looks nice . and it seems to be well made . beside it fits my macbook perfectly
i bought this to protect my husband 's new macbook pro during travel while keeping it minimal in bulkiness , as many sleeves have so much bulk in padding that it takes up a lot of space in a briefcase this did the trick and is exactly what i was hoping for it literally fits like a sleek , smooth glove , and the grey color is very classy and attractive i would definitely buy this again
i got one of <unk> to go with myasus eee pc # <unk> # <unk> # . # -inch intel atom netbook computer -lrb- black -rrb- and it fits fairly well there is some space around the edges but that does n't hinder the case 's ability to protect the computer they reason i only give it # stars is that it feels a little flimsy i have a neoprene case for my other compute and it just seems to provide more protection
i purchased this built ny # inch netbook sleeve in fiery orange for my dell mini # with a # cell battery there is plenty of room in this sleeve for my netbook with the large battery -lrb- the dell # cell battery sticks out of the bottom of the netbook -rrb- i can also fit my power adapter in the bag if needed i like the zipper design on this bag -lrb- avoid scratches -rrb- and i love the color it is very bright orange with a <unk> hue i am able to put my netbook in my purse and feel like it is protected from dirt and from getting scratched i would recommend this sleeve to others and will purchase other built ny products from amazon
keeps my # `` netbook snug and secure color is great i was expecting a bright orange , when it 's really a nice <unk> shade of red : -rrb- gon na get one for my regular laptop
i love this product when i got my hp netbook last feb , there were n't many sleeves out in the market for a small laptop i bought the fiery orange and it 's nice and stylish for my netbook and it fits snugly i love built products i have n't washed this sleeve , but i have their lunch box and # years later despite all the <unk> , it 's doing great
its a very nice fit i got it to put in my net book and i was pleasantly surprised it could fit other <unk> too and a small portable keyboard the price was excellent and the product came in fast and neat all in perfect condition
i got this on the chance it would stretch to fit my # . # `` hp netbook not only does it fit , there is extra room in it there is more padding than i thought there would be , it will keep it from being scratched up and getting banged around in my bag i love that it is check point friendly , should help the hassle at the airport hopefully i gave # not # because it is definitely on the large side not as fitted as described
the design is very cute and it seems like it will do a good job protecting my netbook from everyday bouncing around in my school bag however , it only just fits the asus eee pc # ha it is a very tight fit and i am scared the zippers will scratch the side of the netbook technically , this is a # . # inch netbook , which may explain why it does n't fit in this sleeve designed for # inch netbooks if there was an extra # inch of space , i would be more satisfied so if you have a # . # inch netbook , you should look elsewhere for a better fitting sleeve
this my second built ny laptop case and it is perfect i travel a lot and you do n't have to take the computer out of this case for airport security screening my other built laptop case is about three years old and still looks new , as do the lunch bags we have , the wine bags , and the other items i have given friends as gifts
i bought this for my first generation ipad , and it 's perfect it fits tightly enough that the ipad does n't move around at all , but not so tight that it 's a struggle to get it in or out the case is very well made and very attractive it also fits inside a larger bag when i am carrying other things i have a lot of ipad cases and sleeves , and this is my favorite it 's absolutely perfect , and a great price
got this for three bucks from # th <unk> electronics via amazon and received in # days nice fit for my asus transformer android pad with the keyboard attachment very well made case and my wife also loves the colorful design
i really like this sleeve it looks nice and it feels very sturdy my acer netbook fits perfectly , although there is no room for the charger -lrb- not a big deal to me , though -rrb-
fits our # inch dell mini perfectly and looks great the stretchy fabric allows for room to add a cord or <unk> to the sleeve if needed makes it easy to grab and go
this case is perfect for my ipad # <unk> cover it fits great protection is wonderful price -lrb- about $ # including shipping fee -rrb- is awesome if you are looking for a case for ipad # , this is the one
this case is not only beautiful , it is great for protection beware that it is designed to fit very snug for maximum protection , make sure the dimensions are correct ! for it will fit exact i use a built case for my cannon camera and it has saved it on <unk> occasions from accidental drops on a tile floor and concrete ground
i just purchased a new net book , the asus eee pc # ha , and i was looking for a sleeve so that it does n't get trashed when i transport it in my bag this sleeve is adorable and perfect it fits this net book like a glove , even with the logitech mouse usb still attached the person who reviewed and said this was a poor fit for this laptop , i am not sure what you expected i wanted the sleeve to be as snug as possible it has a little stretch and is truly adorable
i purchased two of these sleeves , one for my ipad -lrb- i have the first generation ipad -rrb- and one for my mothers ipad -lrb- she has the second generation ipad -rrb- and they fit like a glove
my ipad is in a hard candy sleek case and the ipad + case fit into this sleeve nicely width-wise , it 's a perfect fit <unk> , there is about an inch of room to spare it 's a great , cheaper alternative to ipad specific sleeves
i was nervous about this fitting my samsung nc- # netbook but it stretches to cover it nicely it 's a <unk> snug , but not at all difficult to put on or take off and it does n't add to the overall dimensions of the netbook much at all , which is fantastic for fitting it in my purse i also like that it opens at the narrow end - this makes the netbook much easier to handle when pulling it in/out of the sleeve i have seen a friend struggle with fitting their nc # into a sleeve that opens on the wide end overall very happy
