i recently started bringing my ipad and keyboard to work to use during my lunch break i wanted a case that would hold both , but would be portable enough to allow me to take just the ipad and keyboard rather than the whole backpack when i left to go write this sleeve is exactly what i had in mind both items fit comfortably inside and sleeve is easy to carry the seller shipped the item promptly and i would happily buy from again edit : just want to update this say that the sleeve is also perfect for the samsung # `` tablet and gives it the necessary protection when i put the tablet in my backpack
i searched hi and low looking for a kindle dx sleeve and to my surprise there are not many options it turns out that this fits the kindle dx perfectly i would assume that other hp mini sleeve with other designs would work equally as well the inside is a nice microfiber material too
this backpack fits my approx . # & # # ; laptop and everything else i need it to hold i 've used it for about four months now and the material and zipper has held up to the heavy books and <unk> its not waterproof , if its claimed to be then the waterproof coating must have worn away after the first or second down pour it 's been carried through there is an additional large inner lining that serves as a pocket which i can no longer use because the seams have come undone not a big deal since it was n't very useful to me and the bag as a whole is still fine
i bought this backpack with the intention of using it for college and also as a way to lug around my laptop it works wonderfully and the backpack itself is pretty durable it 's not too big -- which is nice since you more often than not do n't need to carry nearly as much stuff around as you did in high school but it also fits a laptop however , my laptop is fairly large and heavy so i actually do n't bring it around with me as much as i thought i would however , if you have a mac it would definitely fit and be protected in this backpack the backpack is comfortable too , no stress on the shoulders it 's rather plain , so i have decorated mine a pit with buttons and whatnot and i love it
this is a great looking backpack currently , i am using this as my main backpack when going to class it is sturdy , fits all my folders along with my rather thick gaming laptop moreover , i have gotten many compliments for the backpack from friends and <unk>
i really like this backpack it is stylist , light and fit my # . # inch macbook air as well i carry it to college everyday and it is durable it can fit in a a few files , notebook , water bottle , pencil case and my mac air the bottom of the bag is made with rubber and it gives extra protection on my mac i highly recommend this backpack for those who prefer a stylist and not so bulky laptop bag
do not buy this bag after purchasing it and before receiving it , i read more reviews and regretted buying it i learned that the straps have to be buckled for you to pick it up because both the handle and shoulder strap are on the flap of the bag despite finding this out and having read reviews that the buckles break easily , i decided i would give it a try i received it the next day and the buckle was already broken turns out the leather piece is just glued into the metal buckle and one of mine had already come out i was planning to use this bag to carry heavy files so there was no way it would have lasted and i 'm glad it was broken now so i can take it back also , i thought it would be more spacious because its so wide but there are multiple dividers that take up a lot of space so if you are looking for a bag that is spacious , can hold some weight or will last many years , this is not the bag for you
today after slightly more than # months of use one of the fasteners on the carry handle detached from its mount the mount is two small bolts and the back plate is sandwiched between two layers of leather so there is no easy way to perform a diy repair this should not happen given my light use of the bag overall the quality of the bag 's metal components is not what it should be they are clearly an inferior , <unk> metal as you can readily <unk> by how easily their surfaces are marred this was an obvious <unk> measure and given the retail price of this bag it is not justifiable i would not purchase this bag again or recommend it to others
this bag met every expectation i had for the price , i cant imagine a better purchase one note for those who are picky you can notice that the strap attaches to the top of the & # # ; lid & # # ; so all of the weight of the bag when carrying is on the latches that hold the lid closed i 'm worried that these could eventually break , but they seem pretty solid
this is a great product i looked forever to find just the right briefcase - and am so glad i got this one it is such high quality it looks even better than the pictures show it even smells good i also like that it stands up on its own and it has a lot of separate compartments for organization there is a padded laptop compartment too if you 're looking for a briefcase to impress , just buy this one - you 'll be glad you did
the bag came in great shape , much better than i expected from the pictures the bag is not as shiny as it looks in the picture , which is good the leather was nice and rich and the grey buckles worked nicely with the brown leather there 's plenty of room for organizing files and the interior looks great overall , i am very satisfied with this bag :
had this bag and within a couple of months the seams starting ripping and the zippers broke while the bag is roomy and has lots of pockets , the quality is very poor
overall i like the laptop case , the extra pockets are helpful for organizing files and paperwork the problem with the case is that i still do n't get through airport checkpoints w/o removing my laptop from the case what 's the point of having a tsa checkpoint friendly case ? ?
at # bucks this thing is a steal it 's got a very durable design and the materials used in it are perfect the bag splits open with the help of a zipper and you 're ready to get through your tsa checkpoint without a hitch i use this bag with the shoulder strap almost every day and there 's no wear on it besides some small paint chipping where the latch meets the clip i 've got to say that i am very pleased with the build quality of this product i 'd have paid $ # in the store if i saw how good a build this thing has in person before i bought it forget the others , you want this bag
i bought this for my sister for christmas and she was thrilled when she opened it christmas morning it fits her laptop and her charger just fine and she says it feels secure in there and padded so it wo n't be damaged
this computer bag is nothing short of an amazing value other comparable tsa compliant bags with this kind of storage capacity are listing for # and # times as much money without offering any additional benefits worth noting additionally , my computer has an oversized battery that protrudes from the back of the machine , and it still fit comfortably in this bag there is room for all of my accessories in addition to quite a few documents and other odds and ends you will not be disappointed with this bag
this bag is just what the doctor ordered it 's well padded with plenty of compartments , pockets , & storage for any laptop user 's needs i carry extra network cables , a mouse , and removable media drives so i have a place for all of these things with room to spare what was real important to me is the fact that the shoulder strap connections are all metal -lrb- not plastic -rrb- a secure strap that will not break is priceless in my opinion so compared to many other bags i 've seen in the $ # - $ # price range , this bag is a steal mine weighed in at about $ # , so i 'm very pleased with this purchase you ca n't go wrong here
and i liked it so much i bought another one for my work notebook i really like the checkpoint friendly feature and it has pockets for all the misc <unk> drives ships faster than i
warning : this case is slippery and big i had a macbook air in this case because the case was extremely roomy and the material was slippery , i opened the bag once , with the bag tilted a little bit and the laptop slid right out and onto the ground it smashed the side of my laptop and messed up the hardware pretty bad if you want this case make sure to be extremely careful with it
i assumed there would be equal amounts of padding on the top and bottom halves but there is really nothing on the bottom i guess i was hoping for more protection
the case itself is quite useful and an <unk> addition to my attache case i enjoyed using it for # to # weeks unfortunately , one of the handles came loose and now requires repairs
i gave it three stars because the description does not fit . so this is too big for the macbookpro with retina display . so they need to adjust the description because the retina pro <unk> around the
good but the handles are breaking off already it is annoying to carry it without the handles because i am afraid they will break of i hold then for too long
well , it ' s okay for what i got , but i ordered one with an outside pocket , and that is not what i got the one i received had no pockets
i bought this laptop sleeve for my macbook pro retina # . # overall quality is good but my macbook slips inside it even when using the elastic strap no padding on the bottom half no pocket for storing the charger a bit heavy
i like the fact that the case is compact and the outer shell is stiff the laptop fits inside just fine with some wiggle room , but can be held down by slipping it under the interior band that goes across the width of the case it 's a nice slim case which can fit nicely in your backpack it does not have any pockets for anything else , but then again , adding some will likely make it bulky and diminish the sleek appearance of the case
very handy to have - fits the hp notebook # nicely this is a good product after # different <unk> of cases that did not fit finally we found this one , and it works out well
this product is a very nice fit for a macbook pro i would suggest that the company consider adding a shoulder strap to this product if they did then i would love it
i recently used this laptop case on a trip to europe it was great because it has handles , is well padded and very compact i only wish it had a little more space in it to accommodate all of the accessories <unk> well , i supposed you ca n't have it all but yes , i would recommend this case anytime
i use it for a toshiba convertible laptop , it fits my # . # in computer well , just a basic shell with no frills inside is smooth but not soft and works well
i originally purchased a sleeve to carry my macbook pro # `` in unfortunately , it slipped out of my hands and landed hard on the concrete sidewalk on my way to class the resulting dent cost me $ # to replace the dented screen i promptly began looking for something that would give my laptop more protection the case logic qns- # is a solid case that will no doubt protect my notebook should i have a similar clumsy experience the case has a sturdy exterior , especially around the corners and a strap that locks that notebook into place it 's a bit bulky , but that should be expected since there is always a tradeoff between more protection and sleekness i wish it had a shoulder strap but and some pockets but otherwise , it 's a great value for those who are looking for a case to offer maximum protection
this item came on time and it is great it carries my # ' macbook perfectly and i love the handles i only wish there was a pocket on the side for my charger
my mac book pro fits in very nice i really like the concept of the whole thing with bag handles to carry it . the reason i took a star off was because the surface on which the laptop sits does n't have the same amount of padding as the top part does other than that very nice
light , durable and easy to carry only downside is that the shell is n't as hard as i 'd like it 'll do the job though if it falls a foot or two
my co-workers have been admiring this laptop case which fits our hp laptops perfectly they are # inches <unk> -lrb- # x # . # `` and about # . # `` thick - anything bigger will not fit -rrb- it 's better than anything that was available through our company 's office <unk> and worth the personal expense i may even buy one for my home computer the materials are great i do n't panic when i bang the case against something . # stars instead of # because i would like it if it had a detachable long strap for the shoulder
great case ! it has padding and is very sturdy the outside is made of a strong hard nylon type material that makes it hard the inside is smooth and one side has padding to protect the macbook it is also easy to hold , i just wish it had hooks or space for hooks to carry it like a purse ... ;
this is a sleek-looking carrying case that is just large enough for netbooks that are around thirteen inches there is a nice amount of padding to protect your netbook the handles are a bit close to the zipper so your fingers might feel uncomfortable overall the fit is snug but the protection is adequate nice choice for netbook owners
this case is nice - small and does the job i like the fact that one side is firm with ridges for venting underneath and the other more padded -lrb- on the inside -rrb- the handles are nice , yet it fits fine in a carry-on i wish it held the macbook pro retina # & # # ; a little snugger - there is some & # # ; play & # # ; along the long side when the computer is in the case
regardless of the cost this case was designed to be practical and sufficiently professional looking the two things i like best is that the design really does protect your laptop from drops and jarring bumps and as a bonus it was made to use the laptop while still sitting in this case which i find <unk>
i do have a netbook and it fits nicely in this netbook sleeve it is durable , stiff , and will protect from bumps and jumps that may happen while transporting my netbook i sometimes also use it to transport some of my personel devices at <unk> like phone , ipod , and beeper it fits into my briefcase or big purse the only added recommendation i would have for this product would be to include some extra tight fighting pockets for pens or maybe a computer <unk> the price is very reasonable i am not someone to buy top of the line products i feel like this sleeve will do the basic job of protecting your netbook , even if i do n't feel it is top of the line , it is a great buy for the price i would buy from this product line again
product as advertised very nice construction and will fit most # inch laptops fits my # retina mac nicely with some room to spare would be putting this inside a backpack when i travel
i like this case for travel when my laptop is on me ; i would n't toss it in the trunk of my car in this case , nor would i check it in my luggage in this case but as long as it 's not being thrown around , i 'm very confident in it the only thing i 'd change about it would be to add a shoulder strap
i was considering buying a much more expensive case for my macbook air , and i 'm so glad i found this one it 's not much more than a padded sleeve , but it 's sort of rigid and the carrying handles are nice to have it 's slim , so i can put my laptop inside and plop the whole thing in my purse when i know i 'll have to wait somewhere for a while i would n't want to toss this case down a <unk> with my laptop in it , but for everyday bumps and scuffs it does the trick
this case is slim but fits my macbook , giving it protection when i take it out of the house one thing that would make it better would be to have padding on both sides , not just one also , as other other reviewers have said , the side elastics do need to be moved out of the way when closing the case - no big deal
bought the case because it had handles my yoga pro # fits and the foam helps keep it from sliding around inside i can throw in the power supply and an external mouse . the best part is i can keep the laptop in the case when i use it
excellent case , good fit , and material is ok , arrived well and on time , not much cushion but lite , do n't have space for the charger so it is good for mobile use not for
this case does exactly what it is designed for at an excellent price -- serve as protection and easy transport of my new macair it does nothing more there are no pockets for accessories or power supply , or a cable a small pocket on the exterior would have gotten the product # stars at $ # , it fills the bill perfectly with adequate protection , <unk> , <unk> in and out loading of the macair , suitable handles , and acceptable appearance
i picked this one so that i could carry my laptop around using the handles and also open it up and use it without taking it out of the case the case is light to carry and the cushion inside is perfect there is also enough room to hold the power cord inside also wish it had come in other colors but black is standard
now , i 've had this case for about a year or two and it has been great my # inch macbook pro fits perfect inside , it also has a rubber band type thing inside so the laptop stays in place while you 're carrying it the only thing i would say is kind of annoying is trying to clean the case at times it may get dirty and due to the material , it will be tough to get some stains off packaged perfectly as if it came from best buy item as described
this is the perfect bag i purchased it for my chromebook laptop computer the best part about the bag is that it has two zippers , which allows for easy opening and the computer to stay in the bag to be used light weight even though perfectly padded ideal carrying case for my use worth every penny
i could n't be happier with this carrying case it 's high quality i feel like my mbp is safe inside it of course , it has no extra room for charger , or other junk , but that 's what i wanted was sick of lugging around my old bag that got filled with garbage over the years this streamlined minimal bag makes that impossible i 've gotten several compliments on this bag too
wanted something to carry my # & # # ; macbook pro in that had handles it 's small like those slide on covers but sturdy will fit in a back pack if you feel the need to carry it that way
why buy an expensive computer then a cheap cover to protect it i 've never understood that logic ... but that 's my husband 's idea this is a great alternative for a couple bucks more than a cheap cover this does a proper protecting job handle is great , and i 'm not worried the # yr old is going to ruin the macbook excellent in the car and in a backpack
great for sony <unk> does not have room for charger , which was not a problem for me i feel it protects the computer keeping the space - in a backpack , etc - free and with the possibility of directly carrying with the handle
i bought this to carry my mac around both inside my house and to meetings , where i need it to take notes and minutes getting older means the occasional fall , which can be disastrous to both body and computer very easy to use while still in the case , with ridges under the computer to allow air in and heat out also plenty of padding to protect against dropping it on my <unk> tile floors and elsewhere the color black was the least costly , so that 's what i got it does n't hold accessories , but most of the time i do n't need the ac cord
the product arrived on time and it 's worth the money i like it because it has a handle to hold so good for travel the bad thing is that it does n't hold the battery charger overall i 'm very happy with this case and will recommend to everyone
great case for my new mac air ... soft , light and it fits it so well ... of course not to forget the speed of shipping it from amazon ... makes life much easier .
i bought this for an # . # inch netbook and it is perfect for it it does not have any pockets so i like the extra room to put stuff alongside my netbook it is nicely padded and yet not bulky the only things i would <unk> is a long strap and sometimes the cloth tabs get caught in the zipper all in all it suits me and my needs and i like it
i bought this for my lenovo thinkpad yoga and it is perfect i wanted something to help make carrying my thinkpad yoga easier and safer and this did the trick i did n't want any pockets or & # # ; fluff & # # ; just a slim sleeve like case the padding and protection inside feels actually useful i would recommend this to anyone with a thinkpad yoga or similar hybrid or tablet
this is a lightweight bag with a semi-hard shell it is designed for carrying the laptop without many accessories perfect for a college campus if you need a suitcase this is not for you i would highly recommend this for college or commuting
i keep my samsung # & # # ; laptop in this case almost all the time it has enough room where i can leave the charger plugged in , so i work right out of the case
i am a high school student who carries my books and laptop in my backpack all around campus this computer case is hard enough that i do n't worry about my computer getting smashed or broken while in my backpack it is small enough that i can fit it into my bag , and the handles make it easy to pull out of my bag at any time it is also very light this is a computer sleeve , so do n't expect any place to put your computer charger or anything extra besides the computer itself overall , this is a great product for a low price
this case was exactly what i wanted : enough protection to carry my laptop just in this case , or to use it as a sleeve and to carry it in my backpack along with other books and supplies i own a macbook pro # `` , and it fits like a glove i 'm glad i bought this case/sleeve with the handles -- it 's very useful update -lrb- nov # : the case is still in great condition i use this sleeve pretty much every day , and so far only one side of one of the handles is beginning to tear i 'm glad i got this a year ago
i got this for my son 's mac book pro & it is awesome excellent quality & sturdy i have bought case logic brands before & have been very pleased , especially with their lifetime warranty you ca n't go wrong with this case
this case is fantastic , i absolutely love it i was skeptic at first about buying something like this on the internet but i was definitely very lucky it 's the best case i 've seen so far , looks good , perfectly padded interior , fits my macbook perfectly , and provides all the cushion and protection i need what i like the most is that there 's no need to take the computer out of the case , you can just unzip it and use it in the case then you zip it back and you 're ready to go i am a college student and this case was a great choice for me would definitely recommend to everyone
the reviews have been so <unk> , i do n't have much to add regarding technical aspects of the case the highlights for me are that it is great for my new macbook air # `` it is true that there is not much room for anything other than the laptop i can squeeze in a magic mouse and the power adapter , but that stretches the case and i prefer to have it lean and mean plus , if you include only the macbook , you have the top padding firmly against the side of the computer it 's nice for carrying the macbook to the apple store for a <unk> or a one to one session or , as another reviewer suggested , to a <unk> i think that it 's actually nice that there 's not room for anything else , because it <unk> you from lugging around everything but the kitchen sink -lrb- which i tend to do with my larger computer bag -rrb- overall , there is no question that this is a five-star product
it was exactly what i was looking for my lap top fit perfectly , and it was not too heavy <unk> to carry i went to a couple of store in my home town , and did not have any luck m <unk> <unk> put me to the web page for the case
a sleek carry case for your macbook i have a hard case on my computer and then still use this case for when i take my computer somewhere for extra protection fits inside backpacks and other bags and if you do n't have a bag , the handles are perfect for carrying it yourself ! i bought # more for my family and their macbooks looks great and you can even keep your computer inside this case while you are on your computer would recommend this to everyone
when i purchased this case i also purchased a cover for my new macbook pro i 'm glad i waited to look at cases and covers until i got home because apple <unk> insanely i like this case because i can use it to use my laptop while it 's inside of it it 's also pretty light and easy to slide in a bookbag if you 're heading to class
just got a macbook pro and didnt want the exterior getting all scratched up when i brought it back and forth from school this case does a good job of offering some added protection , although i might get another carrying case to put both inside of
it fits perfectly in my backpack and giant purse it 's cushioned on one side -lrb- i do n't know why that is and would have preferred cushions on both sides it 's the perfect , easy to grab handles and it 's sleek , so no bulky carry-ons there are no pockets though , so the charger does need to be tossed in my bag separately
buy this i am sooo happy i get to buy this product ! very light and fancy case when they say its a hard case . it is a hard case ! ! they have foam inside that will protect ur computer got ta have this i have to <unk> this out because this is a good product and i will buy this again and again ! ! : -rrb- -rrb-
it is nicely padded to protect my computer opens up nicely so you can use computer within the case i have a # & # # ; macbook and it fits very well lightweight and easy to carry
i love this case it 's good quality , not expensive -lrb- unlike the cases from the apple store ! it 's still small enough so i can carry it in my backpack but still has a handle so i can use it separately as well overall ... love it ! a great buy
this case fits my macbook like a glove and is small enough that i can put it in my backpack i highly recommend it if you are looking for something small that can be easily moved around
was what i was looking for light weight , little added protection and the handle makes it easy to carry works great in your lap the only issue is the side straps getting caught when you close the lap top but easy to adjust to once you realize it using it with a toshiba # inch portege
# mac pro notebook , perfect fit and price was good too no room for anything else in there except perhaps a smaller plug -lrb- the oem plug that comes with mac pro notebook is large -rrb- not just a sleeve , it has carrying handles , which is what i like you can also open it and use it , like at the airport , etc . without taking it out , just open the lid and flip it back not solid hard , but flexible hard , one side has additional padding , but still the whole thing is not oversized , it fits the mac pro notebook perfect
i have the hp split # . # inches and it fits perfect in my new case the case was delivered timely and quality is far more than i expected for the price i 'm pleased with case
this case holds my dell # . # `` <unk> perfectly high quality , surprising with the low cost it 's lightweight i like that i can work on the laptop without needing to remove from the case - it holds it perfectly in my lap very happy with this purchase
this case works great and is exactly what i wanted after using it for a while , i found two things that i wish it had i wish that it could better accomodate the magsafe charger being used with a macbook while open in the case , and i wish that it had hooks for a shoulder strap other than that , this is perfect
i am so happy with my case logic carrier my late # macbook pro # ' fits perfectly i would definitely recommend this product to anyone who has a # ' mbp my only problem is that i wish it had an over the shoulder strap , but all in all , it does what it 's suppose to do it protects my computer while i 'm on the go
great stylish protection for my toshiba portege ; might be a little flashy for a few - particularly if you carry this around for work fits my toshiba portege laptop snug ; would be nice if they could squeeze in a small pocket for a mouse
i ordered this bag in light blue after watching the video and when it arrived i was so happy to look at it it is such a cute sleek and light weighed bag it is just so awesome i will fully recommend this bag
i can put my macbook pro in here , and then put the whole case in a medium-sized tote bag , which is great when i 'm traveling it feels very sturdy -- sort of like <unk> hard-sided luggage , so i know my laptop is protected and the color is so pretty
this is an amazing product love the color and how portable it is fits great with my macbook pro # ' i was a little concern it would not fit my mbp since it has a speck cover but it fits <unk> a + + . . ! ! great buy and fast shipping with amazon
bag 's quality and durability was not what i expected strap separated -lrb- rubber and nylon -rrb- & bag 's nylon frayed never used the `` checkpoint friendly `` functionality was easier to take my laptop out and place it in a separate tray
the bag may look great , it suffers from a fatal flaw the one handle is positioned in such a way that all the weight flops out from the top at a weird angle , making it really difficult to hold and carry comfortably to make matters worse , the stitches in the handle started coming loose after just a few weeks after only a month i threw it away and bought a new one
i loved this case when i received it unfortunately , two months later when on a business trip , the handle pulled out of the case i have written to the manufacturer for a refund ... still waiting for a response
at first glance the mobile edge # `` scanfast messenger bag # . # looks fantastic but when it comes to using it omg - it stinks no doubt the product is well made but with only one handle the bag is completely unbalanced it 's either rubbing up against your leg when you walk or it 's dangling awkwardly away from your body and smashing into everybody when you 're zipping around an airport or confined space with lots of people i ca n't image taking it on the subway during rush hour you 'd probably get in a fight after smashing it into a dozen people because it protrudes so far away from your body obviously the engineer that designed it never used it while commuting or for any serious travelling oh well , hopefully this review will give the manufacturer something to think about - like two handles make the thing balanced hey , that could be the # . # version i 'd buy one in a heartbeat
i had the previous model from this company for # years , so i bought this new one once that one wore out it is good , but there are a few issues the zippers are sticky i am hoping this will wear off after some use , but it is pretty annoying if you open them fast enough , they usually do n't stick not enough shallow pockets those two pockets on the front narrow and deep , so if you put small things into them , you will basically have to empty the pockets in order to dig things out there are very almost no pockets or compartments where you can put small things without losing them do n't even bother with the water bottle holder , you have to be a <unk> to get the water bottle out while wearing the backpack it seems to be a robust backpack , but that can only be measured over a long time
bag looks great and seems like it has useful features however , the pull on the zipper to the main compartment pulled out contacted company and they asked me to send it back it has been gone over two weeks and have heard nothing from company
this backpack was the best i 've had until the straps -lrb- hand and shoulder -rrb- started to crack the handle has started to crack and i fear it will not be too long until it gives one of the shoulder straps has pulled apart at the seams and the inner padding has started to pop out and since i only have my # -inch dell laptop and my dell tablet along with ac chargers it is n't like it is carrying a very heavy load so a bit disappointed there but it has so far been able to carry most of my essentials at the office and while traveling however , i will consider getting another since , again , this has been the best backpack i have had so far
the bag is good and seems quite durable however , already when i got the package i realised it was much bigger than what it looked like in the picture after just two uses i realised it was not practical for my purposes -lrb- daily commute and traveling -rrb- as it is too big and quite heavy even while empty , let alone once you pack it check-point friendly : did n't have to get my laptop out while going through <unk> and another international <unk> of <unk> of <unk> laptop will fit with cables and <unk> heavy , even while <unk> possible to attach to a <unk> bottle
i ca n't wait to travel through security the bag opens wide enough so that your laptop is on one side all by itself - so no need to remove it my new # . # `` laptop fits perfectly , and there are lots of spaces for all my other `` stuff `` . well done to the manufacturer
i was on my way to a business trip in michigan and going through tsa can be <unk> to say the least the mobile edge scanfast checkpoint is just that since the velcro strap keeps my # . # & # # ; notebook snug but visible to tsa preventing me to have to take out my notebook while <unk> and while holding up my pants its also durable with plenty of pocket room for all my things like cellphone keys and such . i travel a lot and this bag has been to michigan california florida as well as ny i love it and would definitely buy it again and recommend it
we purchased this for our son for christmas it is what is described and more very well made we truly have no complaints fits a # . # inch laptop perfectly
i have a pretty massive laptop since it needs all sorts of fun programs and stuff for work trying to find a backpack for my tiny frame -lrb- # ' # & # # ; on my best days -rrb- was pretty hard this is a bag big enough to hold my dell # . # & # # ; large screen laptop plus a binder , my mouse , cords , and probably my keyboard if i wanted it 's heavy with all that in there , but definitely can handle the load nicely padded and back zips open flat for tsa <unk> pros : so many storage spots - literally over # zippered compartments cons : zipper pulls need to be stronger i am not <unk> -lrb- see size referenced above -rrb- but broke a zipper pull for the main laptop compartment the first time i opened the dang thing
the back pack is very good , it will be better when my shoulder is fixed and i carry it on my back but it is comfortable on one shoulder plenty of room , and the # . # inch laptop fits well i am very
i 've had # different backpacks for my # . # inch backpack and this one is the best of all the scan fast feature securely keeps the laptop in place unlike the other backpacks i 've had the only negative is the lack of a strap across the back to hold my backpack on the spinner suitcase the abundance of pockets are great but i tend to fill them up !
i actually love the design and the roominess of the bag i was able to carry my laptop , a few files , and pens/pencils easily unfortunately the handle broke , and using only the shoulder strap felt clumsy i re-ordered the same bag , thinking that i had overstuffed the bag , and i would be more careful in the future sadly , again , that was not the case and the handle broke on the replacement as well , even with very careful use and after only a few months i will not try again with this model so sad , because there is no way to repair the handle , and a laptop case that ca n't be carried easily sort of defeats the purpose
