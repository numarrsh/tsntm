i purchased it for my husband who travels quite a bit and needed a bag that would fit his new # . # laptop he loved it was able to fit it , ipad , and everything else he needed to <unk> his business it is like an office in a bag and could have easily fit a larger laptop padding all around including the bottom , so no worries if it lands a little harder than he intended he normally does n't like backpacks , but the straps were comfortable even has a cellphone bag attached to one of the straps for easy access went on his first trip with it and said worked like a dream would recommend it to anyone who is on the go good bag seems like it will last , quality product and design
i really like this pack i have a # `` laptop with a full keyboard it fits with room to spare there are many pockets and it is pretty sturdily built . for as much space as it has though the padding is not all that great i dropped the bag with the laptop from a table which is a little over # ft and the laptop case cracked other than that the bad has performed well no signs of wear in the seams or anything
my # inch laptop fit perfectly with with # textbooks and a jacket this bag is pretty spacious the padding allows for comfortable carrying and so you do n't really feel the weight of what you 're carrying except after a while awesome bag , you should really buy it if you 're looking to carry a laptop and textbooks perfect for college
this backpack is as advertised i like all the pockets and i like the flap that covers all the zippers it is bigger than it looks in the picture and feels huge compared to an old targus backpack that i have i bought this to fit a dell studio # and it fits with plenty of room
ive had this bag now for about # / # years and it has withstood a lot of travel miles i use it to hold my # . # inch laptop with a cover over the laptop and it fits perfectly the mesh in the front has torn but everything else about the bag is in great working order i gave it # stars because the third strap for the bag goes across the waist instead of the chest , and that third strap is hard to adjust
the quality of this product was far better than i expected it is totally functional with many cool features it has a <unk> feel and a sleek look i highly recommend this product
i really love this backpack it is well built does n't feel like everything is going to fall out like my last one did it holds my laptop and a couple of my rather large college books well worth the money
this bag is awsome way beyond what i needed im not a big <unk> who goes flying the world or <unk> but if i did this bag would still be more then enough the price almost made me feel like i was stealing the item
at first i was surprised how big it was i though it would be only used on the weekend to lug my computer around to play games at a friends but i have been using it on a day to day as my gym bag it fits perfectly in my gym locker and is not too big to fit on my lap when i commute to and from work by bus my asus needs just a little <unk> to fit , but i never feel like it is unprotected i am also able to fit my <unk> keyboard in it also which was a worry for me
i have been very disappointed with this backpack it replaced a targus pack that was over # years old after a year , this mobile edge pack is literally falling apart at the seams specifically , the seams on the divider between the main and front compartments are coming apart at the top of the pack the disappointment started even earlier , however the mesh pockets in the interior of the front compartment proved to be of too poor quality to last even a few months i will not buy a mobile edge product again
my computer is # . # `` and also very thick it is hard to find # . # `` backpacks that are also thick enough this is a great backpack and it fit the computer perfectly
this is the best bag ever made by mobile edge i have had mine for # years and it gets tossed everywhere . it looks almost as new as the day i got it it holds everything i need and then some if you want the best , this is it
this is my first backpack since i went to college in the mid # 's that being said , this is constructed better than most cars today double stitching , heavy gauge zippers , multiple use compartments , and a reinforced back panel with plenty of cushion the shoulder harness is well padded and adjustable to most any size the only thing it has that i have n't figured out , is the multiple loops running from the handle to the middle front of the pack very impressive craftmanship
i ordered this pack to replace an <unk> one this pack is awesome ! it has space for everything it was shipped promptly , and i actually received it before the due date it is very nice looking , and my laptop is safe and secure inside
everything is excellent the only reason went i do n't give thus item # stars is because of the strings that open the zippers , they are not held by anything and they fall out , and that makes it hard to open
this backpack fits my dell xps gen # like a glove and also has plenty of space for other peripherals and/or books excellent style and functionality very comfortable even with the bag containing my laptop and textbooks definitely get this if you are planning on getting a large laptop
love this bag because of all the pockets , size , versatility , durability , and much more this was my second identical bag the first one i got # solid years out of it
sometimes good , sometimes bad , this thing is huge great for long trips , but can be a bit cumbersome when just using as a laptop bag for work overall it 's high quality with lots of spaces for lots of stuff when i bought it , they were offering a $ # rebate from the manufacturer , which i actually received promptly mobile edge keeps their word
i read the reviews because i was having trouble finding a backpack to fit my # inch alienwear they run narrow rather than huge like the asus <unk> this backpack was perfect and fits it pretty good i do have to bring the top material over the corners but the zipers do n't touch the laptop at all it fits my cooler and keyboard too in the first two zippers the padding is really good and makes me feel safe with it in there i do have to admit for me it becomes a very very heavy backpack but i am much more impressed and happy with it than i thought i would of been thanks to the review person who said their alienwear did fit
falls over way too easy and the handle is not very solid i noticed i was having issues with my lap top when i started traveling with this bag i stopped using the bag and the problems went away
i purchased the rolling laptop overnighter because of the convenience of being able to remove the laptop quickly to go through airport security also , this overnighter has sufficient storage for a shirt and pair of pants to change into at the end of a long flight the case worked well for my first trip , but at the end of an <unk> international trip , the telescoping handle is loose and sloppy the rest of the case looks and operates like new unfortunately , the case does not have the shoulder strap hardware pictured and when the telescoping handle fails , it will be useless
the bag itself is well designed the side opening for laptop is convenient for airport security the only problem is the retractable handle this is the part that gets the most stress and was damaged -lrb- bent -rrb- after a few trips for future purchases , i think the decision begins with the handle design and its robustness , and this type of handle , which is common and presumably lower cost , is not appropriate for a business traveller
this is a sturdy case and it is easy to remove your computer from the side in airports the only design flaw is the bottom of the zippered storage area which consists of just a flap that opens to the top of the computer storage envelope therefore smaller items get trapped between should have been a completely separate storage area from the computer slide in area
i liked the space in it the side computer area is good i wish the handle would lock down at different heights because the locking position is too high for me the wheels could be better also would be better if they were # wheels
while it does have room for clothing , it lacks other storage provided in my previous bag it has no small zipper compartment for an umbrella it has no outer mesh pocket for drink bottles it has no pockets in the front section on one side of the inner compartment the section for the computer is adequate the wheels do n't seem as sturdy as my old bag which lasted # + years not as versatile ; it does fit fine under the airplane seat i do n't think i 'd choose it if i had to do it over
i purchased the bag for everyday use in addition to travel i received it about a month ago and have used it already on travel the bag seems sturdy , although the zippers may be of concern after continued use the airport bag irks great , and it is handy as a separate take along bag when you are t your destination the overnight feature is useful , but you will have to be creative to fit a full outfit for one night overall , i would recommend the purchase so far it has been a good deal for the price
this bag is ingenious in its design it has a convenient slide-in on the side for a laptop/tablet durability will be <unk> later decent bag for the price -lrb- so far -rrb-
i travel a lot and i really like this bag -- it 's light and durable -lrb- and very convenient for going through tsa checkpoints since you can slip the laptop out the side -rrb-
this bag is very functional and holds alot i use this to carry my supplies for my traveling dental hygiene <unk> i put the supply containers in the large compartment . which can also be used for clothing even with the bag full of supplies and papers i am able to transport the bag from the back of my car to the building the carrying handle on top is very useful the bag rolls easy , the telescoping handle , is long and functions well the bag does not tip over with paper in the front pockets because it is balanced with the supplies in the large compartment i can also use this bag as a carry on when i fly i would recommend this bag .
looked at on similar at a luggage store name brand that was # . # this one is much better and has lots of room for files and extras great access quickly for computer with nice padding room for a change of clothes as well love it and rolls well
we bought this for our son who is a pilot plenty of room for a # day stay easy to handle very durable and the wheels are sturdy also we looked around and this was the best we found and the great price shipment was fast
i have had this less than # mo . . and the zipper that holds my books has completely broke . . and its not like i ever over pack the bag . . very very
zipper failed on first trip too small for # `` laptop back pak straps suitable for small person or child , too short for adult and padding does not extend far enough for comfortable carry
the title says it all this bookbag seems like it should have a lot of space inside but it does n't and it 's unnecessarily too heavy do n't expect these rolling type of bookbags to be light as a feather , but it was too much the jansport was more roomy i got for my second child and it was n't too heavy
i was excited at how lightweight this bag was and thought i would just love it however , i quickly found that this bag is poorly designed for carrying laptops -lrb- full sized weight -rrb- or anything tall and heavy it is designed to lean at an angle that causes it to fall backwards all -lrb- i mean multiple times per day -rrb- the time when there is anything heavy such as a laptop in it i am surprised that my laptop has not yet met its death due to this bag falling over i now have to remember to prop the bag against a wall or desk to keep it from falling over and damaging my laptop this bag would have had potential if they had not designed it with such a diagonal lean and nothing at the bottom to balance the weight
this is the perfect size bag for my dell laptop . it is very lightweight yet it has a extra sleeve to protect my computer the handle for rolling it very easily moves up and down
it 's only good to carry a laptop but if you have some documents to carry there is not enough room the front compartments are okay , the zippers are good but generally if i saw this backpack before would n't buy it
so i received this as a gift from my gf , and i love this bag functional , tons of pockets , rolls nice , it 's just a nice bag yet , my handle would only extend once , not twice like i thought it would n't reach close to my waist so basically it was just about worthless as roller i 'm gon na return this and hope to get one that is a # <unk> extending handle instead but definitely a well put together bag
this wheeled backpack works best for light duty use it falls short on space , organization , and access it does not fit # . # inch laptops easily and if you try to use the included laptop sleeve it does not fit a one inch improvement in the height would help
so far so good i purchased this bag about # months ago and so far it shows no wear and tear i use it to lug my laptop and # or so books with no problem it is a heavy and makes a louder noise when rolling than other backpacks that i 've had , but i attribute this as a tradeoff for the quality and durability of the bag this is my # rd rolling backpack in # year , and if i can get # years out of it i will be happy so far it seems worth the price -lrb- almost # bucks -rrb- but that remains to be seen oh and the backpack straps will drag on the floor and get frayed if you are n't careful to tuck them in properly
the zipper on the middle pocket disconnected the first day i used it i got it back together , but every now and then it still breaks loose also , it is not very comfortable as a backpack
the backpack is good , but is heavy the wheels are too hard and cause a strong noise they should be coated with rubber or the like , to reduce the noise
i have used the <unk> tsb # . # rolling notebook <unk> # month in my last travel the bag has a good design and is well built it is extremely easy to put it into and taken out of the plane 's overhead cabin because of the two wheels , for small plane , it can be stored under the seat the two shoulder straps are wide , so it is comfortable my only and biggest complain is the wheels are not noisy but very noisy rolling on hard ground it make me feel very embarrassed to roll it , or i have to walk very slowly i think the reason is the material of the wheel maybe too hard i may return it
got this bag for my wife to help with nursing school ; big books it is just a little to small to carry all her books but she does not need them all every day so she carries only the ones she knows that she will need for the day the handle is great and the wheels roll very smooth the flap to hold back the shoulder strap is a little awkward when going from back to roller mode , but overall a great solution
i bought this mainly because i travel a lot with my laptop and walking form terminal to terminal at airports gets to be bit much lugging around all the weight this backup does the job perfectly it 's pretty big as well it stored my # `` laptop plus a bunch of other things nicely it has a flap that can be flipped if you are using the shoulder straps so you do n't ruin your clothes with the dirt on the wheels the one downside to this is that it is a little heavy since it has wheels and it rolls , this is not a big deal to me , but if you plan on carrying it a lot , this could be a problem
i have had the targus rolling notebook backpack for almost # year and use it every week to carry my laptop , work papers , lunch , snacks , etc to the office i commute by train with # to # minute walks through <unk> and city streets on either end i 've taken it through rain and snow and it still looks new and keeps everything dry it 's taken a lot of abuse over this time but the wheels still roll smoothly and it is easy to get over curbs other reviewers mentioned inadequate laptop padding but i 've found that my laptop is well padded against normal bumps and jostles it holds quite a lot and is good for day trips my only somewhat negative comment is that if you are petite , you will not be able to comfortably use it as a backpack when fully loaded larger individuals will not have a problem with the weight when using it as a backpack and pulling it is no trouble regardless of your size
this backpack is great so far i 'll see how it holds up after a couple years but so far , so good holds my laptop , my tablet , my cords , pens and air card my only wish is that it had a small , long pocket to slide my airplane tickets and receipts into
i bought this bag as an alternative to my old carry on backpack that i had there are many things that i liked about this bag wheels roll smoothly zip are very smooth lot of storage options i use this bag for my daily use to carry # of my laptops to work so far i found this bag useful what i did n't like about , the design of shoulder straps they tend to give back pains when your carry it for a longer period overall , my rating for this bag is ****
this works perfectly for why i purchased it room for my laptop , files , lunch and gym shoes everything fits in one bag can roll into work in one trip lots of different compartments if you like that
i have been using the rolling backpack for a couple of weeks now in airports , office buildings , asphalt streets , concrete <unk> streets , etc . pros : great zippers ! , plenty of room , well organized , nice laptop padded cover included rolling wheels work well nice <unk> handle to be flexible for folks of different height levels converts very easily between backpack and rolling modes nice wheel cover that velcros easily over the wheels in backpack mode or contains the backpack straps when in rolling mode cons : only complaint is that the wheels sound loud when i roll the bag down the street i do n't know why this is or how it could be <unk> maybe the wheels could be made of a different material perhaps i have to `` break in the wheels `` . otherwise , i 'm happy with the rolling notebook backpack
bought it primarily to walk to bus to commute to work only downside is the size ... bigger than i `` pictured `` -lrb- even though dimensions were provided -rrb- compartments well laid out , easy to get to like pull out pc bag , especially for airport screening
for the past ten or more years my wife and i have gone away for up to one month with only carry-on luggage this usually consists of one # `` roller , with a smaller bag attached to it this is what we bought when our older rolling backpack died the bag seems well made , with no defects noted plenty of compartments to stash things in , strong wheels and comfortable handle our computer fits , if we want to take it and the bag can double as a backpack for short off road trips
this is a really useful backpack generally quite spacious - held more than i thought it would , although there are a few <unk> # . it could use better padding on the shoulder straps and back area when carrying it over-the-shoulder , the rolling mechanism is a bit uncomfortable , and # . the largest pocket could be a bit bigger at the top really , though , for travelling -lrb- i took mine to india on business -rrb- it was great
this pack holds a bit less than the one it replaced and it is a bit heavy even when empty it all depends on how much you will carry versus roll great for rolling through airports or waiting in lines as it stand by itself quite nicely
backpack is well made quality of zips and overall material is good quality of shoulder straps is not as good as the rest of the bag so if you plan to carry it on your back a lot then this might not be the best choice wheels and telescopic handle are good quality although the wheels make a lot of noise while rolling the backpack on the pavement -lrb- unless you are on a smooth floor or inside an office building etc -rrb- enough space inside for two laptops and some accessories laptop can be kept in a separate sleeve so pulling it out at the airport is easy overall a good buy
i travel a good deal with work and needed a computer bag that would hold my work files , a laptop , hardcover book , cell phone , organizer , etc . wheels and back pack straps were a requirement after # trips this bag is meeting all my expectations it has smaller outside and internal pockets than my prior bag , but i find this helps me stay better organized and i do n't have to search so long for items another plus is it fits in the overhead of smaller regional jets so far i have n't used the back pack straps , but i think they will be ok all in all an excellent bag for the money , well designed and hopefully sturdy , but only time will tell i would recommend it to a friend
i ordered this backpack after reading reviews posted at amazon the backpack was listed locally for well over $ # , so this was a good purchase for me there is a sufficient amount of room in the back -lrb- larger -rrb- space for your computer , and a padded jacket , too the wheels roll smoothly , and the straps are wide and well padded i was looking for a comfortable , functional pack for my day commutes in seattle , and this is perfect for that the only reason i did n't give it a # star is because if have an item that is wide , it will not fit because of the dividers between the book area and the computer area other than that , this is a fine purchase
the bag is everything i wanted for travelling short distances by airplane it has lots of pockets to store items in and the bag to put your notebook in is fantastic - probably would have preferred a <unk> bag for storage but this one is adequate the wheels and the handle are excellent additions to make this an easy bag to take using the wheels and also to have the backpack alternative when walking longer distances
i selected this backpack for my daughter , a <unk> technician , as a gift married with a young son , she has <unk> decided to return to college and <unk> a nursing career she is a very active person , and needed a rolling backpack that would handle a wide variety of weather - heat , snow , rain , etc . this backpack deals with these <unk> books , laptop , <unk> , etc . all fit very well , and the load is balanced through all terrain the construction is tough , the materials top quality targus sport rolling backpack case designed for # . # inch notebooks -lrb- black with grey accents <unk> rapidly delivered my daughter 's gift within # <unk> , however , they were provided the wrong address by amazon and delivered it down the street fortunately , this <unk> new my daughter , and kindly brought her her gift i will be more <unk> of amazon 's shipping documents
excellent , extremely satisfied fit my laptop perfectly along with my workpapers as sufficient compartments for power cords and mouse pretty light weight in comparison to the normal wheeled laptop bags would suggest to anyone
this is the best backpack it 's the second of it 's kind i 've ordered the first lasted # years with daily use in and out of airports , stuffed under airplane seats i kept the older one because i will still use it for lighter travel well organized , perfect size , the rollers really work
i had a great deal of difficulty finding a backpack that is large enough to hold my laptop computer , along with the textbooks i need to bring back and forth between home and college additionally , as a woman , i needed something that would not be too heavy to lift into my vehicle or carry up stairs at school this backpack is the perfect size , and the weight distribution is such that it is not impossible to carry up those stairs
this is a great item , review pictures let see everything that you would want to know about the backpack , along with the fact that i recived it alot sooner than was <unk> to me looking <unk> to getting alot of use out of it
this backpack is for my # year old son ; he likes it so much and lots of rooms for all his school needs , good price half price then other brand with the same needs
what a perfect bag everything fits wonderfully with room to spare rolls easily , carries easily , helps me speed through security checkpoints when traveling just love the darn thing had bought it on impulse while at an airport somewhere -lrb- when the case provided by work finally drove me insane -rrb- , but was very glad i made the purchase after a few years of near constant use , it still looked just like new and was appreciated on a daily basis my car was broken into a while ago and the bag stolen work replaced the laptop that had been in it , but i 've been missing the bag terribly how happy i was to find that it 's available on amazon am ordering it right now and am thrilled that i 'll be able to use it once again
this bag is a million times better than my previous laptop roller-bag and i 'm glad i made the switch it 's very easy to use , very rugged and durable and it feels comfortable whether you 're dragging it or wearing it on your back
this backpack is perfect for travel or just to go to the office i travel a lot and the removable laptop case makes it so easy to remove your laptop for airport security it has lots of compartments and is a great mobile office
this bag is durable it 's actually spacious , since my son has a lot of stuffs that he needs to bring everyday now he does not have back pain because of the rollers
purchased this item to use as a `` briefcase `` as a claims adjuster found the identical item for twice the price at best buy but returned it to order online at amazon many pockets provide exceptional storage computer case can be removed separately to lighten the load when it 's not needed carrying handle , back-pack and wheels with handle make it quite versatile no matter the terrain highly recommend this to anyone who needs a sturdy product that needs to be mobile
i bought this bag for work because i have to take my laptop home with me everyday and i use it as either a backpack if it 's lighter or a rolling bag if i fill it up it can fit a lot of stuff and as a backpack it is very comfortable i really love it it exceeded my expectations
a fellow coworker recommended this backpack it holds everything you could need it is comfortable to wear over the shoulders and quickly changes to rolling on wheels when needed i have recommended this to other coworkers who struggle with the one shoulder laptop holders that weight them down save you back and shoulders with this ergonomic great backpack
this product was easy to purchase because the information was readily available i bought this for my techie daughter who travels for her job she was killing her back and shoulders carrying her laptop and tools to each job , but now she can just wheel everything to each location she loves it and i 'm so happy to have come up with something to help her avoid <unk> back muscles by the way , it really does fit under an airline seat
i have owned # rolling bags and this is the best by far i have had my bag for # years and not a single problem i just wish it was a little bigger . : -rrb- i will buy this bag again and have told several friends to skip the crap and get a targus
this is my favorite rolling backpack it fits great under the seat on flights in fact i bought this to replace one that had issues with the zippers targus has since replaced my original one , so now i have # because i did n't want to wait
i also have the <unk> version but this makes those long <unk> in the airport much easier instead of lugging my backpack , i extend the handle and go i love this bag and my back loves this bag !
purchased # months ago and used it constantly ever since the handle broke and i can not get it replaced or find a way to get it repaired the <unk> gould co. makes it -lrb- or one of their companies -rrb- and sell through <unk> i purchase through pc connection they send me to gould -- who sends me to <unk> -- who do not want to have anything to do with it
well , i have actually had this bag for # years over that time the handle has been a pain sometimes it extends and sometimes not try standing in the rain trying to battle a bag the wheels also no longer turn properly finally a week ago the whole top portion of the handle snapped it no longer is good for anything i tried calling customer support i would advise anyone out there against going through this stick with a smaller size of bag and obviously a different company
this bag has the perfect layout and assortment of partitions and compartments the price was great imo but ... the telescoping handle does n't stay up you extend it , take a walk and the thing collapses as you walk along the little spring-loaded buttons which are supposed to lock the sections do n't hold - making it useless as a tote and too heavy as a briefcase
the bag is self was very nice the problem was the telescoping arm would not stay in the open position , kept closing up by itself plus the length of the <unk> was not long enough for a # ' # `` person i returned this bag and found another swiss gear style with # `` <unk> that works <unk>
i was looking forward to this bag soooo much after reading the reviews well , i received the bag yesterday and would have loved it if the handle functioned properly the last stage of the telescope only worked some of the time i tried wd # but to no <unk> good thing amazon has a great return policy i am <unk> an overnight computer bag choice
so i travel for work ... a lot this bag seemed to me to be the perfect answer after using the <unk> version for a while , which was killing my back yes i stuff it full , it 's my office on the road now i 've gone through three of these in just over a year -lrb- purchased and returned at an office supply store -rrb- the weakest part is the extendable handle , which i have n't had too much trouble with on this slightly newer model but quickly fell apart on my previous two on my latest version the handle is still tough to extend but the seams are coming apart and the faux leather is ripping on the front a good idea but poor materials and workmanship might do the trick if you do n't live and work out of it but i would not reccomend for the serious road warrior
in anticipation of a heavier travel schedule last year , my wife and i went to office max last may -lrb- # -rrb- and brought home # wheeled computer bags -lrb- samsonite , wenger patriot , and us luggage -rrb- we packed my computer , travel gear , camera , # change of clothes , and necessary files into each bag the wenger patriot did the best job of holding all the gear , so we returned the other bags and kept the wenger this has been a nice bag for quite a few travel miles in # however , i have concluded that the patriot is actually too big for an overnight or an everyday bag , and if i had to do this again i would get the smaller metro or potomac also , in december the handle broke -lrb- # months old -rrb- i contacted the wenger customer service number and had to leave a message ... lesson learned , they do not promptly return phone calls however , if you punch `` # `` you 'll get through to somebody who will direct you to a live customer support person the lady i talked to was very nice and has offered to fix the bag i 'll <unk> later and tell how it went
the wenger case lives up to its `` swiss army `` connection capable of carrying a decent sized laptop , and a portable printer , with power supplies , etc . and there is still room for personal items a great case with a single flaw build quality is top notch , and well engineered , save for the telescoping handle the latches <unk> are apparently a weak spot my wifes -lrb- a xmas gift -rrb- failed - of course - three days after the amazon return time limit of course , it may simply be the case is capable of holding a heavier load than the handle can handle
everything about the capacity and the strength of the stitching is well-made unfortunately , the arm of the bag pulled right out , so there seems to be some construction issues with this bag
this <unk> is great for the space it has i found the telescopic handle to be a little `` shaky `` ... is not very sturdy or firm i guess the manufacturers can make a little investment on that apart from that it is a good buy , but if you are like me , i would have spent a few more bucks on getting a product which has everything right this shaky element tends to give this <unk> a `` cheapy `` look
i recieved this bag as a christmas gift wenger replaced my bag under warranty it 's a lifetime warranty , so nobody is out of luck these cases are expensive , so let 's make wenger put them right my replacement bag is n't much better i 've found that if you snap the handle up quickly while holding the button , it sometimes will extend normally
while the case itself is sturdy and funtional , potential purchasers should pay close attention to negative consumer comments about the handle i did not , and now regret buying this product the handle is often difficult to raise and lower it gets stuck in the up , middle , and lowered position we have other rolling cases , by other manufacturers , where the <unk> handles work great i expected more from swiss gear
this bag has plenty of space to hold all of your items the best part is the second small bag for the laptop just take that bag onto the smaller commuter jets and check the larger bag i would buy another one
this was just the bag i needed for work i used it as a carry on and kept a change of clothes in it just in case my luggage was lost -lrb- which they did ! -rrb- it also holds numerous amounts of files and its nice to have a laptop bag for those quick excursions all around , great bag well worth the money
# out of # only because it is a bit heavier and larger than the ` perfect bag ' however , it is very well assembled and <unk> its sub $ # price tag
pros -- holds everything one needs from home to office with space for more the file compartment is sturdy and opens without tipping the entire case the separate laptop case is handy for transporting it separately and storage inside the rolling case as well cons -- the expanding handle does not always snap into the full extended position with out several tries
i love the case and it suits my needs very well i am a road warrior and i carry a lot of documents and manual etc . the only thing i can say negative is that there is no optional shoulder strap there are times that you just ca n't roll it and when that happens if you have the case loaded up it is not really manageable to carry it by the handle i would definitely buy again and -lsb- ... -rsb- was
i love everything about this case except the last stage of the telescopic handle sometimes does n't expand after i returned the first one i got , i read reviews by others complaining about the same issue still , i liked the case enough to give it another shot although the handle on the replacement case still is n't perfect , it is much better i just have to hold the latch down until the handle is completely extended only other criticism is i wish there were better pockets to store my flash cards , memory sticks , etc . all in all , i am quite happy w / this case and would recommend it
i wo n't actually be travelling with the case until next week but it is wonderful for going back and forth to work plenty of room for all my papers as well as the computer i especially like the separate removable case for going to meetings it seems very stable , easily going up and down over curbs without tipping over my only complaint is sometimes the button on the telescoping handle does n't fully release and it takes a couple of tries to get the handle all the way back down
i saw this computer case at office depot for over $ # , - , went on amazon.com and got it for half of the price it is a great computer case , the zippers are working well , the computer # `` fits perfect what i like most about is the flexibility of this little wheels , it does not flip over and it is easy to go around with
as has been noted by many reviewers , this is a very large capacity # <unk> system with several nice features marred by a mediocre telescoping handle however , since there is n't an equivalent bag on the market with a great telescoping handle , what are you going to do like many things in life , you learn to work around it the two bags combined are also surprisingly light given their vast capacity i examined several equivalent products that could not contain as much and yet weighed quite a bit more overall , if you need to cart a bunch of stuff around , this is about as good as it gets
i use it for two laptops and still have room for many accessories , cables , papers , etc . . downgraded # star because the telescoping handle does collapse on its own occasionally and is a little snug in overhead storage on american super # 's other than that , great product so far
purchased this for my dell # `` laptop threw away the inner bag for a # `` and simply slide my # `` into that compartment slot fits perfect and does not get scratched or banged well made product and lots of additional storage for papers , disks , power cord , mouse , etc . once heavy laden with all your gear do n't break your back <unk> to carry it all , just pull out the handle and roll it from your car to the building and down the hall
this is the second computer case in our office and the envy of all great value , strong construction and it does fit in the overhead of a # and is within the size limits of most airlines
i have never been able to carry my laptop and other materials to work together either the case broke or the laptop was compressed so tightly that there were eventually key impressions on the screen finally when i bought a new laptop , i decided to get a larger case to handle everything this case is big enough to carry all the items that i need to get through a long shift with the exception of the thickest of books -lrb- i could even carry those if i put my laptop in the extra bag which is included , but i just leave that at home . i have to give this bag five full stars
