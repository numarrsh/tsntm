perhaps i received a defective bag , but the handle on my bag frayed and came loose with just a couple of days use it 's not like i was hard on it - i only took it to and from work twice the bag design seems fairly good the computer fits snuggly in the bag the bag looks attractive however , it does n't appear to be robust it 's probably best to consider another product
i loved this case at first - sleek , small , stylish plus i loved the handle but after using it for # months the handle has broken and the zip is on the way to an early death if only they made it slightly more durable it would be
after using the bag for about # days , the handle started to rip my laptop is about # . # lbs and it just could n't hold it for more then a few days it is really upsetting since the case itself is very thin and and nice now its just a sleeve with no handle
seemed like a nice simple case that fit perfectly and was slim but still had some padding this was the second one i purchased and , just like the first one , the handle broke in three months with minimal use and only a # pound laptop in the case unless you never intend to use handle -lrb- there is no shoulder strap -rrb- i suggest avoiding this despite how good it looks
despite some contrary reviews . this is the most wonderful sleeve/case i have ever had the handle is more than adequate to handle the weight of any of the hp <unk> it fits my hp folio like a dream and is extremely secure i liked it so much that i tried to find another one for my hp spectre this model was sold out and i was forced to get a white one instead
shipped quick and in great condition the case fit perfectly and matched the laptop perfectly as well -lrb- same stream pattern design -rrb- i like that it was genuine hp merchandise , as i know it will be good quality and fit the unusual # `` size
you 'll be hard pressed to find a better case at a better price than this case here it 's perfect for my # `` hp laptop and i 'd recommend this product to anyone who 's looking for a great case , regardless of price this one just happens to be very affordable
this black stream pattern is great product , it fits perfect for the laptop and also the material protects the laptop on a # percent the only problem is that it does n't have a space for the charger
the sleeve fit my laptop which has the same design snugly , was like it was <unk> for it . perfect fit there is a plush black lining inside which surprised and pleased me the opening zip was not where you would expect it to be this took some <unk> used to but is alright , nothing negative with the laptop inside the whole thing has a slim profile which makes carrying it inside my <unk> bag easier
highly recommended by someone who is rather picky about design the case fits my hp laptop perfectly , which i expected i was pleasantly surprised by the stretchy material of the outside pocket -- it holds the bulky cord well it 's nicely designed and very easy to take the computer in and out i 'm usually in a hurry to pack and unpack for classroom use and i really love well-designed products that make things easy even though it 's a sleeve , the handle is really nice for easily slipping it in and out of my briefcase , without taking up any extra room it 's well-made and looks as if it will hold up to daily use i 'm going to buy another one for my husband 's dell
this is a great sleeve for a pavilion dm # it does n't quite fit like a glove -lrb- there is about an inch and a half on the side -rrb- but the bag is very well made i was n't sure what to expect since i 've never bought a sleeve before but it could n't have turned out much better the pocket is plenty big for my wireless mouse , power cord , and even a mousepad it fits well in my backpack
it is a little large for the hp dm # but is no problem can hold accesories i have n't had any problems with the handle good shipping , good bag , good buy
this little sleeve does a great job protecting my laptop computer fits my laptop like a glove ... <unk> have a hp pavilion dm # -lrb- # `` -rrb- ... then this is the one for you great graphics -lrb- black stream pattern -rrb- on the sleeve match the neat graphics on the laptop has a storage compartment for those extra items and a handle which make it convenient for carrying a great sleeve for the money ! !
<unk> is excellent i love it i have an hp laptop # . # `` and fits perfectly i highly recommend it me <unk> mucho <unk> una laptop hp de # . # `` y <unk> perfectamente lo <unk> mucho
bought one of these in january # it lasted a year , finally gave out because i broke the zipper i ordered a replacement in january # where one side of the handle connects to the body became badly frayed ; if it had continued , that side of the handle would have become detached i spotted this within a week , and amazon.com promptly shipped a replacement well , lo and behold , the replacement has the _ exact same problem _ , albeit not discovered until # days after the warranty expired i 'm not hauling around anything excessive , just the laptop , charger , and a few small , light odds and ends this case mostly protects the laptop between home and work and nothing else it should n't break so much
stay away from this sleeve no matter what other reviews say about the bad handle , etc . . the zipper is on the side ? ! what in hell was the designer thinking , or furthermore , what in hell was hp thinking for manufacturing this sleeve ? ? do you know what will happen if you fail to zip up the zipper ? ?
i bought this sleeve because of the price , the handle and the brand the retractable handle did not last a week , this happened while i was using it as a result my hp # . # `` computer suffered minor injury , but the sleeve should have lasted much more next time i will buy something of this sort at a local store to make sure the handle is <unk> attached to the sleeve i am highly dissapointed of this product
i bought this case for when i go to class this semester , that is only one time per week i have not been rough on this bag in any way , but my handle is almost ripped completely through i do n't think my laptop is very heavy , it 's an hp envy , so i 'm not sure that this case is very durable at all it may have been just this one , but i decided to replace this case with one that 's not from hp
first sleeve lasted a few weeks , handle broke , amazon replaced it , now the newest sleeve 's handle broke buy something like this locally so that you can keep getting replacements or exchanges , i 'm out of luck now
alright , i usually never leave negative reviews , but the retractable handle broke after # month use i only use the sleeve # days a week to bring my laptop to school and back the sleeve is good , however , if you do n't mind having a broken handle after very little use , do not buy this sleeve and buy something else the sleeve is very good because of the handle , but this was very disappointing because of how fast it broke
i rarely write reviews and had to for this one the bag was the right size and form for what i was looking for in a notebook sleave -lrb- which i used for my laptop -rrb- only problem is the handle unraveled after about # month of use and now the nylon wire is exposed and is <unk> to hold without the handle malfunctioning the bag is great hope this helps
i had an hp case that fell apart after two years do i needed a new one this one started to tear on the handle after about a week i am too lazy to return it , and it still holds my laptop , but it looks like torn up
i really liked this sleeve when it first arrived ... fits my hp envy # like a glove and not bulky however , after about # weeks of use , one side of the handle started to come apart at first , it looked like it was just fraying where the handle retracts into the case however , it 's progressively <unk> with only a small band left holding the handle to the case it 's to the point where i 'm afraid to actually hold the case by the handle overall , a bit disappointed ... the handle should have been designed to hold the load of the computer on the plus side , it was a pretty cheap case i just wish my return window had n't expired because i would be sending it back or replacing i guess you get what you pay for
i like the fact that it is very light and that pocket on the front comes very handy as well it protects my laptop and i can take it anywhere i 'm very happy with this sleeve
i purchased a # `` notebook and wanted a case or sleeve to put it in when i travel did n't think this was a hard size to fit but it turned out to be difficult to get a case the ones i tried were either too big and the laptop slid around inside the case , or they were too small to get the computer into tried this sleeve as a last resort although i wanted a case with more protective padding , the fit on this sleeve is perfect for my laptop it has handles -lrb- no strap -rrb- and a zipper pocket on the outside that 's big enough to hold the necessary cables and mouse there is some padding inside which i think will be ok as long as the computer is n't handled too roughly glad to finally find something that fit
the case was of good quality , the price was right and it was shipped timely i like the fact that the case has a handle and provides added protection for the laptop
the case works well there is n't any extra cushion to it , but it fits my laptop and protects it well front pocket is n't good for much , and the material starts to stretch over time i like it , and it 's worth the price i paid i would n't pay full price for this though
this is a great little laptop case for the cheap price the handle on the top is really convenient when you are transporting your laptop outside of your backpack or messenger bag the front storage pouch is made out of stretchy fabric so you can cram a lot in it if you need to plus , if you leave it empty it does n't add much thickness to the case the material is n't super thick like on some other neoprene cases i have seen , but it provides enough protection for minor bumps and bangs also , it has a low enough profile so it does n't <unk> the available space in your bag this product is perfect for an hp envy # laptop
i bought this case after reading reviews about its compatibility with the hp envy # , and without a doubt this is the carrying case to buy for it the laptop fits perfectly , and the front pocket is just the right size for the laptop 's charger and adaptor . # stars for sure
i am very pleased with this bag it is small , <unk> and just perfect <unk> for my # `` dell inspiron # z would definetely recommend advantages : cheap , good looking , has a lot of space for <unk> storage -lrb- for small # `` bag -rrb- disadvantages : there are non actually ... :
this is a real soft and cool looking sleeve keeps your laptop from getting scratched keep in mind that this does not support from falls or bagging up against something it 's just a sleeve
i needed a bag to transport my laptop to and from work - and this bag was great perfect fit and the zipper is strong there is also a large pocket on the outside to fit whatever you need -lrb- fit my kindle and a dvd -rrb- i would suggest getting this bag
my wife loves this bag and her new laptop would highly recommend this to anyone who is looking for a <unk> way to store their laptop when not in use if you want real protection you should probably look into the larger leather cases or a hard case if they exist for our purposes this works great around the house and office
very compact perfectly fits my # inch dell laptop i had a special requirement where i had to store # laptops for dr purpose in a box to stores at offsite location
i purchased this sleeve with the hp envy beats edition -lrb- # . # inch screen -rrb- i accidentally ordered two of them , but i 'm keeping the extra due my initial impressions and the fact that the sleeve holds my older hp dv # series -lrb- even with an over-sized battery -rrb- - retractable handle : no dangling <unk> pocket leaves room for an a/c adaptor and/or usb cables for other <unk> : seems to be very well-constructed with precise stitching and seams i ca n't speak for how it will hold up -lrb- i 've used mine for a week -rrb- , but i will update my review if needed - size : i doubt any # -inch laptops would fit , but i love the size of this : it fits so easily in my backpack or tote bags -lrb- the reusable grocery kind -rrb- - price : i had several <unk> and i still paid far more to hp <unk> than amazon charges definitely shop around ; i could n't find anything i liked in stores and those prices were double the price of amazon and others
i like that this messenger bag fits close to my body , versus other messenger bags that flop around and bounce against my hip while i 'm walking it 's amazing the amount of stuff you can fit in these as well sometimes i 'll go to the grocery store and will bring just this bag and tote home over $ # worth of groceries it does a little cumbersome when it 's fully loaded with heavy stuff though , and it can make my shoulder ache since the load is unbalanced but for everyday use i think this thing is awesome if you 're going to haul your laptop in it , make sure you have a protective sleeve of some sort as the bag itself does n't have an <unk> system for laptops
i have # sizes of this bag - citizen and the <unk> the citizen is the perfect size for daily use i use it to carry my work laptop and a notebook or # for what ever i 'm working on the main compartment has no dividers which some may not like but i think is great the other pockets are perfect for pens and an ipod or <unk> bar or something it seems like it will last for a long time i have n't had a chance to take it for a ride as it is winter but it seems comfortable enough to live with for a while in the saddle overall a great bag , much better than the timbuk # ones i have -lrb- still love them but for comfort and daily use chrome has them beat -rrb-
did not include the red keyboard color and sent the wrong size i used it on another macbook and fit was horrible the weight causes the hinge to fall
not what i expected at all ! it was way too big and the material was not as described tried to return but would be too expensive and did not get refund
i got this case for my new macbook to keep it safe from scratches when i got the produce i was disappointed to find that there were only # rubber feet to keep it from sliding which did not work well as for the legs supposed t support it , they looked extremely flimsy and i would n't trust them to last or not fall off also the edges of the case are sharp and cut with low quality as i tried to type the scratched and cut my arms will definitely return
the only thing with this case is that it covers the speaker area in case you want to speak on skype you can hear the person but they ca n't hear you
i was a little hesitant when i opened the package it seemed <unk> it felt too plasticy what in the world had i ordered but i was so wrong this product seems to blend in with the aluminum unibody of the mac , and it literally makes the laptop look like it was intended to be the color of the cover as far as it being plasticy it 's just lightweight , and when snapped to the mac , it fits like a glove i know that my computer is protected get this product
however , my laptop got unusually hot when i used this cover and even though i know they sell them in the apple store for twice the price , i am no longer using it
received the exact product i wanted and am happy with the color -lrb- red -rrb- selected do not use the cover for keyboard because it keeps fingers from sliding over keyboard would definitely order again
if you do n't want to spend too much money for a case , and just want something simple to protect your macbook pro ; this is the one to get it fits my macbook pro # `` -lrb- # model -rrb- pretty well along all edges , but not completely flush with the top the plastic is not perfectly flat , so it leaves a gap right above the apple logo area -lrb- not very noticeable -rrb- i just need something to prevent scratches for daily use , also got a neoprene sleeve for when i travel and need more protection this is light weight and easy to install
i had a speck cover for my # & # # ; before and i loved it i don ; t love this one as much but for the price it is a much better value and does the same thing
i love this case this is my second one i bought my first a year ago and one leg broke off ; i am going to repair it in the meantime my new one will continue to protect my mac , look gorgeous and make me feel smart for saving so much money buying this one compared to the others i saw
overall fairly great macbook pro cover it does what its expected of it to protect your macbook with its ' life , and makes you look fresh and fly all at the same time i would buy it again and again and alternate in colors if i had the
i really love my red mcover it has protected the hefty investment i made in my macbook pro i had n't had my macbook very long before i started worrying about scratches , etc . i found this cover online , kicked it up with red and am so glad i did the product came when it was supposed to , was in perfect condition when it arrived and still looks great it was easy to put on and did n't scratch the laptop in the process it has kept my laptop looking fine i discovered after i got it that it has feet on the bottom so that you can tilt the laptop at an angle which makes for more comfortable typing and screen viewing
this cover overall is great there is only one problem and its that my macbook pro seems to be getting unusually hot and pretty fast but other than that its a great case and so far has n't scratched my laptop the shipping was fast and the case is great overall
saw similar cases in the apple store for $ # this was a bargain and gets the job done my only complaint so far is that the cover for the lid could stay in place a little more securely , but otherwise it does what it 's supposed to do
i was not expecting the color that arrived it appears to be an <unk> red instead of a dark true red like i ordered the fitment is great and the quality is good even with the color being a little off it still is a great
i purchased the mcover hard case for my # `` macbook pro because it looked like high quality protection at an affordable price it turned out to be just that the package did n't contain detailed instructions so i put the top piece on wrong the first time but <unk> it was simple enough i feel very confident that this cover will keep my macbook pro looking like new and the extend able props puts the keyboard at just the right angle for comfortable typing my only concern is with the fit of the monitor piece it seems a little loose and i feel like i am going to pop the cover off every time i open the clamshell overall , i am very happy with my purchase
its worth getting a case for your mac book , especially if its for a child its a snug fit so it stays on however , the hard plastic is somewhat easy to crack and even though my child was very careful with it , one of the tabs on the bottom broke , but it was after using it for about one year i love that they offer wide selection of colors mine did not come with a free keyboard cover i bought this a few years ago
i 've had no issues it fits securely and has n't slipped off or loosened thankfully , i have n't dropped my mac so i do n't know how it stands up to a fall i have put it my bag where it was jostled around without a scratch on it also , it 's see through so i can still my vinyl stickers
i put it on easily and gently and the color is very bright and i get compliments on it i like the feet cause i do n't have to take my stand which is extra bulk in case it matches my decor so i can leave on coffee table and in just goes
great color , perfect fit , seems durable it is very snug so it will not fall off exactly as described i 'd buy this again for myself or anyone as a gift
i ordered this case after seeing a case that my friend had on a # `` macbook pro i am often taking my macbook around the house to different areas and noticed that i tend to be a little clumsy with the price of a macbook it only made sense to spend a little money to keep myself from giving it too many dings and dents this case has done exactly what i need it to it slips on great and has been quite sturdy since i bought it ~ # weeks ago the only downside is that the screen ca n't quite open as far is it did before because the case gets in the way this has n't been a problem though as it still opens to an angle as wide i will ever use -lrb- ~ # <unk> -rrb- a great product to help protect the investment of a macbook
this macbook cover more than met expectations it is well made and easy to put on the feet also are a great feature it protects my macbook pro -lrb- late # <unk> # version -rrb- stylishly and perfectly the low price was an added bonus to a great product
it 's in my favorite color and fits my mac perfectly there was one time when i spilled water ; because of the case , my mac was fully protected definitely a good investment
this shell is a great deal at around $ # similar products from speck and incase that look just as good and provide the same amount of protection for your laptop go to $ # or even $ # this product fit perfectly on my macbook pro ; the color is a beautiful , vivid red ; and the hard plastic makes me feel more secure about my laptop 's safety as i lug it around everywhere i 'm very happy that i purchased this
i love this hard shell case it fits my # -inch macbook pro perfectly and has kept me from getting any scratches or anything on it plus it made my macbook look pretty : -rrb- it was easy to install and i have n't had any problems with it coming off or anything i suggest that all macbook pro users get a case like this for their notebook
it was easy to snap this case on to my laptop and it has n't budged since it seems solid and i feel like my computer is protected i recommend this case to anyone who has a mac
so i 've had this case for # months now and i love it it 's saved me from a number of nasty spills and knocks plus i get compliments on it all the time since it looks like a special build comp case fits uniformly and snugly highly suggest it
i like this hard case very much it is valuable for that price and is really charming color too also it fits my mac pro perfectly , i would really strong recommend get this instead you pay double of this amount to get it from the apple store which the quality got ta be the same
got this case about a month ago to obviously protect it does its job the only complaint i have is that when the case is on , the laptop gets a tad warmer than usual but that is to be expected with any hard shell case for a laptop otherwise great case and cheap
i love this hard cover shell it fit my macbook like a glove it was easy to install , very inexpensive , and ship time was cut in half by seller thanks again for such a reasonably priced cover
this bag is horribly designed and unbalanced with a laptop inside of it it will not stand up and is just too & # # ; sloppy & # # ; for my taste it did n't help that the inside sleeve was stained , and i had to return it , but that did not lower the rating - the overall design did
this is the second bag i receive now which has about a quarter inch of yellow glue on the lip of both the main bag as well as the smaller & # # ; sleeve & # # ; bag i will be returning this one as well , and hopefully the third time around will be a charm ? ! nice bag though ! well built and over sized , just like i need
this bag is somewhat ok but it still is disappointing in many regards i got it at a bargain so i 'll keep it rather than hassle with returning it it is floppy and does not secure my laptop that well it does not hold the accessories -lrb- cables , mouse , etc -rrb- in any logical place well and i just do n't like it much so i rate it <unk>
it 's a very nice and cute case i loved the design when i first saw it however , due to the color it does tend to get dirty easily and does not have the sort of protection i was looking for i am currently still using it as a `` starter `` case for my ipad # , but am actively looking for a case that is harder and has more protection
this sleeve does fit the acer one mini , as promised if you 're looking for something to keep scratches off your laptop , while it 's in another bag , then this would be a fine choice the material is n't as nice in person as it looks in the picture , though there 's not a lot of padding , so it definitely wo n't do much more than keep your laptop from being scratched
overall i have been very happy with this case i used for an asus eeepc it has held up great , except for the corners we turned the case inside out and sewed a small piece of denim into the bottom two corners to patch some small holes and to add reinforcement -lrb- maybe they should have made it that way -rrb-
i got this little netbook sleeve for my wife 's asus eee pc netbook and she loves it a competitive price point , durable material , and a pattern that 's nice and girly for her i highly recommend this case if you 're looking to get a gift for any female someone who has a netbook
i bought this for my laptop , but i did n't notice the size well , it would n't fit my laptop , so instead of sending it back i just purchased a tablet it will fit up to # & # # ; device and is thoroughly padded for protection
i bought this case at the same time i purchased an asus # . # -inch netbook pc as a gift for my wife the case is a perfect match for it the netbook slides in with ease and is perfectly protected we took the netbook on a trip to florida and the case prevented any damage , not to mention it received favorable comments about how attractive it was the case is padded without being bulky the zipper seems to be strong and it slides well what more can one say it is good value for the cost
i purchased this sleeve because there was a <unk> on the front my friends call me <unk> it 's cute but loose and i wanted a closer fit for a sleeve it 's keeps the computer safe so i guess it 's ok
i bought this product for my dell inspiron # z ultrabook , and the sleeve was , unfortunately , a bit too small because of the stretchy fabric of the sleeve , however , the laptop is able to squeeze into the sleeve , but it is definitely not a comfortable fit however , the sleeve itself is very nice so i would recommend this item , but would like to advise that you measure your laptop and compare it to the exact sleeve size before purchasing
# words to perfectly describe this case : cute , durable my # inch dell inspiron fit nicely into the laptop case i love the seafoam green and <unk> yellow colors ; i also love <unk> . :
i purchased this sleeve for my macbook pro # `` it fit like a glove it 's a well made item , the quality is pretty decent however , i ca n't get over how ugly the design is it looked so cool in the pictures i actually thought it was a raised abstract design or an <unk> pattern on top of the black background in reality , it looks so cheap and ugly ... like bad <unk> <unk> <unk> ! ! ! i am sure you can get another high quality sleeve with a much cooler design super tacky ... seriously
it fits my lenovo x # loosely the quality is decent , thin but not too thin , just enough to protect from scratches the design is <unk> but the color can be a bit brighter and more defined , it looks kind of blurry up close the plastic smell was pretty bad , i aired it out in the sun for an afternoon , inside out , and almost got rid of the smell , it probably needs another day in the sun
this is a great case , but it is a tight fit if you already have a hard case on your macbook . it still fits , just a little harder to fit
an attractive and protective cover no room for accessories , but that 's not the point of a cover works best stuffed in a backpack or briefcase , otherwise , one would want a more <unk> with strap , pockets , etc .
i love my laptop sleeve bag carrying case the design is great and it has great quality the only thing that could have made it perfect , is if it had a handle
the heading says it all it never looks dirty like my pretty pink one for a bigger laptop keeps it free from dust , etc . when computer is not in use i just wish that i could find this kind of cover with a small handle for easier transport
it is as pretty or even more prettier than the picture it nice and soft , so it does n't scratch -lrb- i have a # inch macbook pro -rrb- covers my laptop perfectly
looks great and seems to be good quality it comes with a foam insert , which i recommend keeping if you have a thinner laptop with the foam it fits both my macbook air and ipad for a normal thickness laptop it should be perfect
this is a nice case , but it is way too big for a # . # computer it is better for a # `` computer i decided to keep it just because i did n't want to pay for the return shipping
i brought this for my nice because it looks really nice but i recieved instead a # inch laptop case its a nice case but its too big and it took so long to get here i didnt want to bother the seller on the plus side it arrived on christmas eve : -rrb- its a really nice pinky purple color
i ordered this product to keep any dust of my laptop it makes it very easy to access your laptop without having to rummage through your bag it is also waterproof so i feel safe leaving on the <unk> room table the quality is good
the cover was bought for a sony vaio <unk> series # . # inch laptop it 's too big thought it is one of the recommended products when i put in the laptop info searching for a cover it may fit the # inch version but it 's too big for # . # inch laptop the color is very vibrant but think i 'm going to return it and order something else since it barely fits into my laptop bag which was designed for # inch laptop -lrb- hard zipper makes it stiff -rrb- does not fit like a glove
i love the color however it 's not as tight as i 'd like it to be i see how it fits my sony vaio , however there 's actually room for a bigger laptop i needed something a little tighter since i have to fit it inside my camera backback
i bought this for my girlfriend for the sony vaio that i bought her for christmas she loved the case but i did n't it is probably the <unk> laptop sleeve that i have ever felt and offers almost no protection if you were to drop it all this sleeve does is protect the laptop from scratches it is also a little big for the laptop and the zipper is n't very high quality and has no flaps on it to offer protection over the zipper area if you are going to keep your laptop inside something else such as a backpack than this sleeve is fine but i would n't rely on it to protect it from a fall
i have had this thing for a few years now and put it through all sorts of abuse - which it has taken <unk> still looks more or less new after <unk> , has protected my laptop well , <unk> off <unk> <unk> and a crazy toddler very happy with this case
as others have said , they sent a # `` model ... with that said , the one that was sent was a great product as far as quality goes this is the only reason i gave it more than # star
while the product arrived faster than the estimated shipping time , the product is much bigger than my # . # `` acer <unk> i assumed it would be snug on my laptop but there is a lot of space around it it is good quality though , just too big
i purchased this case for my toshiba # . # `` laptop it barely fits in there the sleeve clearly was n't made for # . # `` laptops because it is stretched to the max when the computer is in there the lip of the sleeve does n't lay flat because the laptop does n't fit properly i would not recommend this sleeve to anyone with a # . # `` laptop , as it does technically fit , but not very well
this is just what i was looking for i just have a small complain about its size it does not fit properly for my toshiba satellite it arrived today i hope that by time it will expand a bit now its a bit smaller for my notebook this is the only reason i do n't give # stars to it the rest seem to be ok
i ordered one of these and a larger size was shipped to me my order was wrong but as soon as i told amazon , they were more than willing to send me the right size , no charge , i got my right size and i absolutely love it !
of course we bought for style , but this definitely is not the best for a <unk> high schooler after a few months of heavy use , the more delicate fabric began to tear from the stress of overstuffing and abuse but was very enjoyable while it was still in one piece
