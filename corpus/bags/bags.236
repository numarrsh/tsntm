i purchased this sleeve for a # `` macbook pro to get some extra padding for the messenger bag that i purchased the sleeve is a little large for the # `` mbp -lrb- a good inch or so -rrb- but as this was only secondary , works great
i bought this case to carry my laptop in around college my laptop is a # . # `` acer aspire # z this case has adequate soft padding to protect your laptop from minor scratches and bumps in the daily college life but i would n't feel too safe dropping this with a laptop in it this sleeve fits very nicely inside my backpack and looks like it would protect from minor spills and bumps the sleeve on the front is perfect for carrying a small mouse and a flash drive however i ca n't say it would be good for carrying the power cord in , as it would be a tight fit also this case only zips open on the front and one side , instead of on both however , i still find it good enough to slip the laptop in perfectly this case is worth the money if you 're looking to carry a laptop around the day to day life at college
i got a dell xps # for work and bought this case for it it fits , but very snuggly it 's actually kind of difficult to get in all of the way , but then once it 's in i can zip it up fine the extra pocket is nice , too i have one of these -lrb- a different size -rrb- for my personal # inch laptop and it fits fine the extra pocket even holds the power adapter and a flash drive when i am on the go a nice case for laptops without too much bulk
this case fit perfectly and the pocket stretched to hold both the power cord and my trackball mouse it was easy to get the computer out for the airline , and it fit into my carry-on tote i would recommend this
this is a great item to have if you need to travel much with your mac book - i like the extra protection the newer mac books do n't have built-in dvd , so i purchased an external drive the pocket on the front is perfect fit for the external dvd drive
excellent case for # . # netbooks if you are going to tote the computer around in another bag i do n't really care for most computer bags , and instead carry my netbook around in a <unk> <unk> small messenger bag i want to protect my netbook at the same time this case logic sleeve is perfect it is soft the inside material is <unk> and will not scratch my asus # . # in netbook fits snugly the sleeve with netbook fit perfectly in my small messenger bag it 's like a <unk>
i have n't had a chance to use it as of yet , but it fits my laptop just like a sleeve , its made well and when i travel it will protect my
this sleeve is exactly what is described it fits my dell inspiron # & # # ; perfectly i do n't think it would be much protection if you dropped it but as far as keeping it clean it does the job
i bought this case for my dell xps m # which i typically use with the extended battery and it fits very nicely even with the larger battery which gives the laptop a height of # in at the back i can even fit in the travel power cord and transformer in the extra pocket at the front while using the extended battery sometimes i use the pocket for <unk> instead you can directly feel the padding that the laptop is wrapped in the inside is covered by a protective cloth and the zipper is covered by rubber which makes it easy to catch and zip it 's a great case with an excellent fit to this laptop this is a high quality case - well worth the cost
this case is very nice it keeps my computer well protected and keeps it from getting scratched in my backpack it is just a tad bit big for my hp envy however it gets the job done with ease it protects the laptop great product and case the zipper is sturdy and case itself seems as it will last me a long time i have only had it for one week you may think one week is short , but i have been using it for one week the way i will be using it for months on end we will see in the long run
it fits my asus # . # inch laptop well , my laptop feels secured there 's the extra front pocket where you can put little things which i like the charger fits in the front pocket too but it becomes a big blotch
i bought this for my samsung nc # , and it fits perfectly i can slip it in and out without having to apply any force or pressure , and very little space is left around the sides i love the usb stick holder and the front pocket is great for a mouse or charger
this sleeve fits myasus eee pc # <unk> # <unk> # . # -inch black netbook - # . # hour battery <unk> a glove it fits perfectly , does n't wiggle around but fits nicely there is adequate padding , and the inside of the sleeve is <unk> there is a pocket for a flash drive and power adapter i do n't use the dedicated flash drive slot because i keep my flash drive on my keys , but i might use it if i travel and do n't take my keys but take my flash drive the pocket fits the small power adapter for my eee pc the pocket bulges out with the power adapter inside , but it does zip shut i would recommend this to anyone buying a netbook who needs something to put their computer in to protect it inside of a backpack -lrb- which is what i use it for -rrb- make sure you check the size of your laptop and compare it with the maximum size of the sleeve -lrb- they are listed in the specifications on the item page -rrb- overall it gets # stars from me because it is perfect for what i want it to do
i do like this sleeve especially for tablets i am using it for my asus transformer prime with keyboard with keyboard it makes a nice tight fit with good protection i do like the zippered section outside to store memory cards and power cords yes , it does increase the bulk but you are only transporting it that way you still keep your thin tablet profile while using the tablet overall good quality construction from case logic and smart design
i <unk> bought this for my dell laptop that has a # . # inch screen i was very glad when it fit inside the sleeve perfectly it is made of high quality materials and the inside of the sleeve is covered in a very soft plush material that should be very gentle on the surface finish of any laptop
i bought this sleeve for my new lenovo ideapad y # laptop and it fits great of course i have to put the laptop with the battery at the zipper instead of putting it in battery end first but , that 's because the battery is a tad bit big for a # ' laptop it still fits perfectly though all in all , this sleeve is extremely well made i would recommend this sleeve after proper measurement of your laptop and such great storage zipper in the front for a thin spiral notebook , notes , pen -lrb- s -rrb- , and a usb slot pretty cool for the awesome price i got it for
i bought this to protect my laptop when i have to stuff it into a carry-on bag or suitcase it is thin and light weight and protects the laptop from scratching and damage but it 's not a stand-alone case
i like this bag a lot i got it for my # `` macbook pro and it fits perfectly it is more cushiony than other sleeves i looked at and the pocket is a great addition it stretches to hold funky shaped things like the charger , extension cord for the charger , flash drives , cds , and more one review i read said that the inside is a furry material ... it is more of a foam material that is very soft it wo n't scratch at all this sleeve is a great buy
fits my lenovo t # snugly and perfectly great for taking it back and forth to work without having the take my whole briefcase provides great scuff and bump protection pocket holds my mouse and the little thumb drive pocket is cool easy to recommend , would buy again
fits my asus t # tablet perfectly ! -lrb- a little tight , but it works -rrb- the side pocket is a little tight for more than just the charger and a set of headphones
i have a toshiba satellite model t # and this sleeve fits perfectly i use it to keep my laptop safe inside my tote - no need to worry about scratches , and if i drop the tote for some reason , i feel this helps to protect it the extra pocket is amazing i did n't think i 'd really use it ... but it fits my wireless mouse and my mobile <unk> usb adapter wonderfully i highly recommend this sleeve
just the right size good foam-like interior insulation -- providing nice protection to my laptop durable but yet comfortable material but the winner for me is the exterior pocket that nicely holds my power cord and room for other small items -- zip drives , earbuds , etc . a good buy
just bought this for my dell inspirion # and it fits very well i was concerned b/c most reviews i read people did not understand the dimensions for most cases i took a gamble on <unk> review and it was right on the money fits snug with about an inch and a half of space at the top the zipper side pocket is excellent as well . fit and finish is nice too
i bought this because of the great reviews sure enough , i am very satisfied with my purchase it holds my # in acer laptop and the charger it definitely keeps my laptop from getting minor damages
like all case logic gear , this does not <unk> it protects my laptop during transport not only from things banging around in my backpack , but from liquids i sometimes keep in there , too
so i purchased the # inch sleeve for my asus transformer prime w / keyboard dock and it fits perfectly the side pocket is large enough for the charging cable and any microsd or sd card cases you may want to carry
i am very happy with this laptop sleeve it fits my dell vostro # perfectly and provides a decent level of <unk> for it while in transit the small pocket holds a number of small accessories this is exactly what i was looking for
great case to carry around a # & # # ; laptop not bulky at all and offers good protection for the normal everyday use includes a small pocket on the outside to store cables , thumb drives , etc etc .
it 's very good quality - caselogic overall i 've bought # cases before this and have had no issues the inside is extra cushiony and has about # inch leftover for a macbook pro there 's an outside pocket that fits usbs , cables , charger , all at once if you do n't mind the <unk> would buy it again
i really love this laptop case it fits well with my macbook pro , and i really like the convenience of having the pocket for the charger , and a small pocket inside that for the usb key -lrb- which i constantly lose -rrb-
i bought this for my white # . # `` macbook and i could not be anymore happier it 's a snug fit and i trust this case to protect my macbook it 's also pretty light
this fits my toshiba # . # `` notebook perfectly i had not been able to find one for that size that was n't big and bulky this is a perfect fit it is padded and i like the zip pocket on the front
my father has one of the older versions of the mba and he 's had a speck case on it the entire time and now the screen does n't hold itself up because the case is too heavy for it he has to prop the screen up with some thing for it not to fall all the way back like a pancake -lrb- that 's a slight exaggeration -rrb- he 's had the computer for a while so please do n't ruin you mba by buying this case because your screen will buckle under the weight eventually
could not use this item because it is not compatible with the latest macbook air - and it does not say this on the ad had to be returned for a refund
okay amazon as alway did a great job on delivery i was not happy from the manufacturer i got this hard case from i got the case all scratched up , not cool at all i was very disappointed ;
product is plastic and i thought it would be of great protection and use but it broke after a month and i was just opening the lid of the computer
the case does n't match the body of the latest macbook air i got this on # / # , installed it , and found that the usb , headphone , and all other jacks are blocked by the case now i have to try and mod the case with a hot needle to <unk> through the plastic the product description needs more detail as to which version of the macbook air this case is for returning products online is just too much hassle , this really sucks
i have several speck shells , but this model is just too heavy for the delicate macbook air screen the weight of it makes the screen <unk> down and i 'm worried it will loosen the hinge
i really like it because it does protect my computer but it makes the top fall alot because of how heavy it is i like how it looks and that it gets scratched and not my actual computer i would recommend it
just make sure you have the first gen macbook air i saw a lot of people on here complaining about how it did n't fit , when it clearly explains that what gen it is for no complaints , love it
i love the layout and design of this ; it 's perfect for a lightweight laptop and a few books i 've had it since mid september , so it has had one semester of use it has a gaping hole at the top seam , just above the zipper i 'm going to have to replace it very soon this is very disappointing i used the same backpack through my <unk> years and two <unk> degrees -lrb- <unk> # years -rrb- now i 'm a <unk> student , and i wanted something fit for a laptop , as my previous <unk> brand backpack does n't have any extra protection for a laptop i wo n't be purchasing this brand again . $ # for one semester 's use is ridiculous what a waste , as everything else about this is fine ; it 's just low quality as to how it 's made
i got this for my daughter as she carries lots of books she has a <unk> to a private high school the top handle ripped off contacted seller he said since # days went by and a few months in the top hand ripped off the was told i had to go through the <unk> we all know what that means a whole lot of nothing so we went and bought one in the store instead just remember it is not lifetime <unk> like it says
i started using this bag at the beginning of the school year it is november and the bag is ripping in multiple places not a good bag for school it is small , and not durable i am not pleased
i used it everyday as a college backpack and i loved the back padding the only thing that went wrong was the side pockets ripped and and the zipper pulls came off other wise it was
i got this backpack for my wife when she started nursing school she really loved it but said it could have been a little larger inside it holds her hp # `` laptop , # textbooks and # `` binders in the main compartment hope this helps .
i like it very much it is very comfortable and you can tell that the quality is really good i did n't like that it can be a little bit heavy but it 's definitely a good purchase
almost every part of this backpack is great the straps are <unk> and there is nice padding on the back the pockets can hold so much stuff that i have extra room the area the holds the laptop is plenty big enough for my # `` laptop and could easily accommodate a bigger one the only minor issue i have with it is the opening to the major pocket is smaller than i thought it would be other than that though , this backpack is totally worth the money
i purchased this bag expecting to fit my # laptop the thing is that it fits but very tight the bag is beautiful very well made highly recommended , the only problem is the size
i travel almost weekly and needed a good backpack laptop bag the all black ones seemed too masculine so i chose this one as at least it is colorful the only downside is it looks like something a teenage girl would carry not a grown adult it is very functional however - great pockets for extra chargers , mifi etc . i just wish there was one in a print that was not too masculine but not too young my shoulder greatly appreciates the backpack over a sholder laptop bag
bought it for the granddaughter she <unk> a local college # days a week and uses it to carry her laptop and ipad along <unk> books says she likes it and has been asked where she got it has n't complained so far about having any problems
i bought a couple , to be used at school by my two girls # and # , <unk> i know it is built to carry a laptop i am very pleased with my purchase , design is very nice and quality is excellent
thats so cute and lovely . it looks so good and is good for carrying a laptop too . i gifted this to my sister along with a laptop for her birthday and she loved it too
this backpack is great very heavy duty and awesome quality i have had it for about a year and a half now and it is still in perfect shape no rips or tears zippers work perfect
i got this to manage easy traveling between college n work and it 's amazing not only is it comfortable on my back but there is plenty of storage space after my laptop is put in for a book or two and a binder there is storage space inside and out it is also a bonus for it to be so stylish would highly recommend this backpack it is good quality i love it and it was worth every penny
great backpack , have bought several of these for college grad presents , and even one for myself really nice when you get it in person have received many `` thank you ! `` for them
i love this backpack i really have fallen in love with this backpack i bing my laptop to work and the compartments within this backpack are excellent lots of space , lots of options , and still comfy when it is loaded up
i bought this backpack because i started riding the bus and my typical over the shoulder computer bag was n't going to work i also wanted a backpack that was stylish it fits well and my back does n't hurt when i carry it i highly recommend i carry my lunch and shoes in it also - lots of room
i loved this bag it fits my laptop perfect i go to art college and this back is perfect it has lots of pockets to fit pencils , <unk> , and all kinds of stuff it even has a pocket to hold your water bottle its awesome and my favorite part is that its <unk> cute its sooo hard to find a laptop back that is cute and functional and this has both i love it
i purchased this backpack as a christmas present for my first year college student she is very petite -lrb- # ' -rrb- and has to lug her computer along with books for # classes around campus she loves it ! ! she says it is comfortable , keeps her organized , protects her computer , and reflects her style i also thought the price was very good for the quality of this bag when i received the backpack , i thought it might be too small for everything she needs to put in it , but that was not the case if you are looking for a stylish backpack that is designed for a woman to carry , this is the bag for you
i 've had my bag for about a year now and it has held up great i carry it to work everyday with laptop and papers , folders , etc . inside i have highly recommended it to friends who compliment it
this maker really does know how to give a well made product at a very affordable price the stylish pink backpack is perfect for the ladies but they do make other colors for the men it is a bit wider than other backpacks and not as deep but it was designed for <unk> the storage space fits my # . # laptop with ease , even with the soft case i have put on it the straps are very comfortable this is the second mobile edge product i have purchased thru amazon and i would buy from them again should the need
i bought this as a gift for my wife who needed a replacement laptop bag this bag fit the bill very well and has held up well over time i would recommend this product readily
this backpack is great the pink color is a little brighter than it looks on the screen but i love it soooo many pockets on the inside , cell phone & beverage bottle holder pockets on the outside the laptop is held securely and it does n't move around when on your back looks like its quality made and that it should hold up for years light-weight and ergonomically correct i 'm only # ' tall so carrying a shoulder bag caused to much pain and the rolling bags are sooo heavy even with nothing in them so this bag was perfect i love amazon
i got this bag because my husband has one he got a few years ago i was pleasantly surprised that when i <unk> the bag i was able to find this one in a `` women 's `` color love all th pockets and how well it fits on my back just used it on my most recent trip in addition to a carry on bag it fit nicely under my feet on the plane i took it to disney to carry our towel ; water bottle ; snacks and misc <unk> worked well did n't fell heavy at all my husband has used his in the past to take our laptop it has a divider that you put the laptop behind then close with velcro
i love this bag i have had other laptop bags that have been large and bulky making them awkward to carry and most of them are hideous this one is cute and feminine , which is hard to find sometimes the many different pockets make it a very versatile for day-to-day use i use it for school , which is great because it can carry my laptop and my school books and supplies , but i imagine it would be great as a carry-on bag for travel as well i highly recommend this item
this bag provided great protection when on the go and has a build in rain cover which comes out from the bottom i 've bought two of these so far -lrb- one from amazon -rrb- and they are fantastic they 're small enough to be portable for travel , yet big enough to store quite a bit in here i have a canon # d mark ii and it sits inside with a # mm f # . # l lens comfortable you can also fit another lens in the main compartment like a # mm or your charger it surprisingly holds quite a bit i also fit a # ex ii flash in the front zipper compartment in addition to my camera overall , this is great if you want something durable , spacious , and light for travel
this is a fantastic bag it survived an absolute beating think # + <unk> winds , rock scrambling , and hiking in <unk> del <unk> and <unk> del <unk> during a blizzard not to mention : this bag was banged against rocks on more than one occasion , and the cushioning protected my camera this thing kept my camera and my lenses dry , did not rip , and stayed comfortable the entire time the waterproof cover was a nice touch , but i found i did not need it even with the rain and snow excellent bag that exceeded all expectations i used it to hold a nikon d # , nikkor # f # . # , and sigma # along with several filters , lens <unk> , lens caps , etc . the perfect size for hiking i did n't even use my camera strap with this bag because the bag provided such easy access
i bought this for travel light with a major requirement , the bag have to be able to hold the sony <unk> # n with sel # attached with the hood on in compact bag to my surprise , this bag fit sony <unk> # n + sel # + hood <unk> # + sel # + <unk> <unk> <unk> s # all three fit perfectly in one bag with lots of space for memory cards , batteries , and <unk> flashes this bag is just beautiful and perfect for my need now i ca n't wait to travel all over the world with this bag
i was looking for a bag to hold my d # , nikon # mm dx lens , and nikon # mm # . # lens i gambled on the the <unk> # first but it was not quite tall enough -lrb- it fit , but not well enough to make me happy -rrb- no big deal , i gave that bag to my mother the # is taller than the # and it allows my # mm lens to be mounted on my d # and sit lens down the # mm is snug alongside with a divider between them my battery charger , spare battery , remote , lens cloth , and extra memory all fit as well i needed a & # # ; day bag & # # ; that allowed me to grab my camera quickly and still have a few accessories as well this bag is sturdy , roomy , and a good balance of being big enough , without being too big if you are mounting a long lens this is a good choice
i use this bp everyday in the field doing maintenance on wireless cell sites which includes working on <unk> island the need for a bp that was strong enough to hold all my <unk> of extra pockets for small test <unk> . items , misc . hand <unk> top handle to use for <unk> the bag up <unk> etc . professional looking <unk> far i have had great success with this bp items for concern are too small of an opening for the front pocket needs to have a larger diameter top pouch to be a little deeper side mesh pockets to be taller and more flexible but still have a firm grip on water <unk> , meters etc .
a great traveling bag by brenthaven my only issue is that it does not have the `` core `` hard shell internal system that my other brenthaven business bag does that offers maximum protection and i would have loved it if this were an option for this bag that said , i 've had brenthaven bags for years and can easily say no other bag has <unk> it yet
this backpack is very well made , like all brenthaven products , but is a little big and heavy plenty of storage and pockets it seems really big if you put it under the seat on an airplane
it 's everything the write-up says and more and after spending $ # on my macbook pro , this is a worthwhile investment to protect such precious cargo did i mention it has more <unk> to store things than any other backpack that i 've ever seen ?
one of the best backpacks i have used the quality is superb and speaks for itself i have seen northface backpacks which are pricier than this i can say that the quality of this bag is definitely up there , and may be even better
take all your stuff anywhere safely ... this backpack is made very well with your laptop and all its accessories in mind it has a few bells and whistles that ice the cake , but it is just a quality piece that is planned out well and fun to own and use
this backpack is perfect for anyone who is especially concerned with the safety of their laptop i especially recommend it for students or anyone who also needs to carry around books , electronics , and whatever you like to have with you at all times this is my second brenthaven and i cant stress enough how confident i feel in the quality of these backpacks
i have been using this bag for almost # weeks now at school it seems to be very durable , and i feel safe putting my laptop inside of it and not worrying about it getting damaged the bag itself is light by itself , unlike other backpacks that can be very heavy before you even put something into them i like that you can have an extra pocket by unzipping the expandable part it seems to be good at keeping water our , since it has rained many times , and none of my things inside have gotten wet
prior to ordering this backpack i was using a brenthaven messenger bag for my # inch macbook pro the back was and still is a well made and very sturdy protector for my laptop nonetheless i still had to carry a separate bag for my lunch and workout gear the <unk> trek eliminated the need for carrying a second bag while still providing great protection for my laptop along with ac adaptor and external hard drive i would highly recommend this product to anyone that needs the ultimate in protection for their laptop along with the capability to carry additional items be they computer peripherals , books or simply a change of clothes
ordered this a couple of years ago for a family member ; he liked it so well , i gave a # nd to another family member three years on the # st and no trouble with quality , zippers , etc . and i have seen it seriously stuffed and quite heavy no problems with the outside seller ; packing was adequate , shipped quickly , billed correctly would recommend this seller and buy from again
this is my third brenthaven product , and my second one of these backpacks not because the first one broke , i gave that away to a family member and replaced it with another brenthaven case i <unk> for the space the backpack had and <unk> this one the seller did a great job and sent the item fairly quickly
this is the second brenthaven trek backpack i purchased the first was for my personal mac book when it came time to purchase one for my work laptop it just seemed logical it has storage galore plenty of little pockets for storing flash drives , mice , accessories and power supplies in fact , when going on vacation i pack both my work and personal computer in one bag there is plenty of room for both plus everything else and it fits nicely on the plane under the seat
i was looking for a backpack suitable for my new # . # macbook pro after reading online reviews , i finally decided to buy this brenthaven backpack it turned to be a good choice i made i have been using for two month now and i really like it it has very good protection of my mbp . it also offers a lot of room for my books and other stuffs
brenthaven makes very nice quality and usable products this bag is very versatile , offers great protection , and is back by a lifetime guarantee brenthaven 's customer service is very easy and able to resolve any bag issues you may have i highly recommend this product
i use this for work -lrb- my & # # ; murse & # # ; ... -rrb- and tend to keep a lot of stuff with me this backpack has held up well -lrb- my previous brenthaven backpack lasted me for five years -rrb-
i have always loved brenthaven backpacks they are rugged and classy all bundled into one the only reason i had to replace my previous brenthaven bag was because macbook pros keep getting thinner and thinner , and the pouch was too big for my computer this bag fits the newest retina macbook pro snugly the expandable trek -lrb- newest generation -rrb- is lightweight and i am sure it will perform just as well as my previous bags if i were to take them camping or biking etc . well worth the $ $
this is a really , really good laptop backpack most backpacks out there are way too big -lrb- booq , etc . -rrb- or way too small this one is just the right size . . and when you need to carry more stuff the expansion chamber has you covered i use it with a # `` unibody macbook pro and it 's perfect the pack also distribute the load very nicely i was shocked at how lite everything was when i switched from my timbuktu laptop messenger bag the only draw back is there are n't any pockets to hold a # oz
the brenthaven expandable trek for notebook computers was a perfect selection on my part to use when i went on vacation its extremely sturdy and durable and very expandable to hold all my accesories and cables that i need to have with me i highly reccomend it to all
i purchased this sleeve for my macbook pro # `` but it does n't fit as well as i would like i was hoping for the fit to be snug but instead there 's about an inch and a half of space all around i do like the pocket and that i can carry my flash drive and power cord with me as well
the sleeve was too good it fits my hp dv # t -lrb- # -inch -rrb- perfect the sleeve has some extra padding at the bottom which makes it robust n i hope it will last long also , it has a additional pouch in the front to hold some paper plus a usb drive but not good to hold ur battery over all , the product is good and i would recommend to anyone who is looking for a laptop sleeve for # -inch notebooks
i needed a large laptop carry on bag or sleeve for my dell # `` laptop i was looking at a number of them until i found caselogic it fits with room to spare . and the small <unk> area on the side is good for the all the items i need to carry with me
overall , love the case stretches enough to accommodate extra parts -lrb- cords , mouse , etc . -rrb- light yet durable will cushion the lap top from everything but a direct drop onto concrete do wish it had some type of handle ... # `` lap tops are heavy and this can be quite bulky to deal with , especially in the airport security setting wish it came in different colors too would buy again
i have an hp pavilion dv # , which has a # `` monitor this case is just the right size for this laptop there is enough room in the secondary pocket for power cords , antenna , and memory stick the build quality is good i would recommend this case to anyone who has a similar size laptop
i have an hp pavillion dv # , and this case is perfect for my laptop the width is almost exact which gives it a <unk> fit which i like the inner material is soft and the front half pocket fits my huge adapter , as well as my wireless mouse perfectly
this case certainly lives up to everything that was written about it regarding strength and it 's weight it is strong for sure , however i had some other problems with it most importantly , the inside sleeve is only # & # # ; wide , there is a little give for thinner laptops but a thicker one such as alienware # will not fit i had written to pelican before i purchased to check the sleeve size but after two weeks never received an answer the inside sleeve also is only # & # # ; high so it is way too big for a # & # # ; laptop and too small for some # & # # ; laptops , the thinner laptops might have too much room to bounce around there is a cushioning bag to secure the sleeve and to hold the charger and other accessories , i was able to fit the charger only after some difficulty the other problem i had was the deluxe part of this case , the organizer looks cheap and is simply glued onto the inside of the case , the material edges were uneven and frayed the last issue was that when i went to return it i could not get a refund they only offered a replacement , a quick call to amazon and i received a full refund
this is a rock solid case i use to carry aboard boats the downside is its weight it 's about # pounds which is a lot heavier than the computer itself
great product over all kind of heavy as it is but sturdy as hell , the four latches on the case are some time a pain in the butt but for safety wise is incredibly good great protection , great product for heavy duty use
bought this for my dad he loves it , he says it was just right for his needs and he now feels a lot safer taking his laptop out to the field and construction sites
this case delivers on everything it promises it will keep your laptop and a few other items safe from anything you can throw at it it held my laptop , kindle , psp , game boy , and all associated peripherals with ease the only potential downside to this case is the weight this thing is heavy the weight is a necessary trade-off for the awesome protection for everything inside i ca n't speak to the civilian applications of this case , but for keeping your electronics safe during a military deployment , this case is the best
the # pelican case fulfilled my needs perfectly it was more than i expected i had been looking for the better part of the past year for a suitable case for my laptop and i found it thanks do much
this case has saved my laptop on many occasions from rain , falls ... etc as far as product wise this product was in very good shape and delivered in a reasonable time i will be buying more pelican cases in the future for delicate items
