the sleeve is ok for the price you got what you paid for it turned out too bulky for my # inch ultrabook i would 've returned it , but the return shipping is almost as much as the product itself
my daughter has a similar case manufactured by built ny that has much better padding but it cost more too this case is adequate to prevent dust and scratches but i would n't count on it to cushion my laptop against even the most gentle fall
there are carrying handles which tuck inside which have snaps - these can scrape against the finish of your macbook if not careful otherwise case is useful and well made
i have a # `` macbook air and got a sleeve from the apple store that fit my computer perfectly and had a ribbed inside that gave the computer some protection during travel unfortunately it was stolen so i decided to try this one because it was less than a third of the price i paid my macbook air feels kind of loose in there and the material is thin it gets the job done to carry your computer and accessories and protect them from scuffs and scratches but will not protect in a drop
after reading mixed reviews , we 've been pleased with the sleeve for the price no , its not going to protect your computer from much but it does what a sleeve should the material is n't super thick but it does n't feel cheap either its nice and slim for the macbook air and the external pocket is convenient we did buy a nicer bag for when we need to transport the computer
this does the job as a sleeve and fits well into a larger bag however , the one thing that would make this a # star product would be for it to have handles - something <unk> that you can use to carry it around when you do n't have a larger case
would have like to have a bag to put the power cables but if <unk> are carrying just the laptop of up to # . # inc screen and thin , the case is
does what its supposed to do what more can you ask for something this cheap however within a month , the zipper snapped in half but ipearl was kind enough to send me a replacement via first class would recommend this product , even with broken zipper you 'll get the most bang for your buck on this one
bought this for my macbook air and it has been holding up well for months now well put together and a good price this item does not look like a cheap case and it has been protecting my mac air since i bought it
i just needed an inexpensive case of good quality to carry my macbook pro this case is n't as thick as others might be , but it 's much less expensive and still cushioned since i already have a hard case on my laptop , i did n't need too much protection nice features : side pocket with zip -lrb- convenient for a charger -rrb- , lime green interior -lrb- a little <unk> at first , but i like it -rrb- , fits my macbook pro with a hard case on all in all , inexpensive , good quality , and worth it
the pocket zipper is a bit wavy and not the best finish but the sleeve gets the job done zippers work well though and the pocket has come in handy :
i wanted a case for my macbook pro -lrb- # `` w / retina display -rrb- and chose this model based on the the low price and generally favorable reviews the case itself was fine , the quality was n't bad for the price and the outer pocket was a nice feature in fact , it seems almost as good as my old incase sleeve that cost almost # x the price the issue for me was the fit there was about an inch of extra space at the top of the case so the computer just flops around inside it does not feel secure and makes it hard to carry securely i understand a lot of these cases are universal but for the # `` macbook pro w / retina display the fit is poor i ended up getting the snugg leather sleeve case which should be a more tailored fit it helps to read through the reviews and see what kinds of laptops reviewers are using and it the case works with that model
you get what you pay for this is n't a stylish case , but it 's functional i use it to line my bag when i carry my # & # # ; ultrabook around and it does the job
does what it was suppose to do , but it had that strange smell to it , i washed it many times , but the smell did n't go until a couple of
this case is lightweight , sturdy , and not too large it protects the laptop and gives it a carrying handle - very handy also has a shallow side pocket for papers , etc .
definitely an adequate case that i use to transport my computer from place to place , but it is also very thin and does n't offer enough cushion for me to feel comfortable sometimes
overall it 's <unk> than i expected and would have liked , but it serves its purpose it 's <unk> makes the zippers a little tricky to work smoothly the zippered pocked is the right size to hold needed accessories , like the charger , a compact mouse and a <unk> keypad
not a bad case i just wanted something small to protect my laptop , but one that had a pouch to hold the charger and maybe a mouse it does both pretty well not too bulky with the charger in the pocket either my one complaint and reason for four out of five stars , are the handles on the inside i do n't plan to use them , and when left inside , the metal snaps seem like they can scratch or damage the computer i cut the straps out and now i do n't have to worry , but seems like a silly design flaw either way i am happy with it , and you ca n't beat the price
i just received this a few hours ago it fits my macbook pro # inch very well i do recommend keeping the styrofoam inside it the sleeve is not really thick but not to thin either will keep it from getting scratched up without the styrofoam inside , you could easily have a hard case on it and it will fit nice and snug inside the sleeve i would recommend this to anyone looking to protect there book from getting scratched up in a bag while traveling
i was looking for an affordable sleeve for a # & # # ; lenovo yoga most sleeves that fit the macbook also seem to fit a # & # # ; yoga but i did n't want it to be too expensive so that if it did n't fit , i would n't have to hassle with the whole return process well this fit perfect and the charger fits perfect in the external zippered pouch i was looking at a similar sleeve from a different brand but it had a smaller zippered pouch and i was concerned that the sleeve would n't hold the charger and cord i am glad i got this one everything fits perfect the sleeve is a little thinner than one that i had from tucano for my # & # # ; , but it is still acceptable the only thing i do n't like about it is the bright green interior but nobody sees that
great product for my acer # inch ultrabook it 's big enough that i can put papers in there , but small to still look slim the only downside is that the inside is a neon green , but that 's about it
lightweight and practical the pocket in the front is perfect for carrying my external hdd and power cord i feel much better having my mac in a sleeve , especially when i
i 've had this case for about a month , and it is the perfect simple and inexpensive case for my # inch macbook air - i even take it as my only luggage on day plane trips the outer zipper pocket can hold the charger and vga connector , and it is sturdy enough to provide some basic protection for the laptop the inside is lime green , which is slightly funny looking , but not very visible
i bought a new hp folio # and was looking for a light weight case to protect it when i 'm out and about the case fit and appears well constructed the outer pouch is roomy enough for the power cord or other accessories
laptop gets hot unless i shut it down all the way or leave it unzipped fun green inside looks sharp and fits my ideapad yoga # perfectly
my son is a <unk> in high school and is carrying a macbook in his backpack everyday the sleeve is the perfect safe companion to accompany the hard cover shell that we also purchased on amazon i really like the zipper pocket on the outside of the sleeve - it works nicely for storing earbuds the construction of the main zipper is sturdy and looks like it will hold up well for quite some time for a # -year old boy , products must be sturdy he has been using the sleeve for about # weeks and it still looks brand new
great quality sleeve seems sturdy and well made the material does not seem thin as some reviews mention it 's the perfect size for my # & # # ; macbook pro -lrb- late # model -rrb- with around # - # inch to spare on the sizes so you do n't have to <unk> it in the carrying pocket is large enough for your power supply and other small accessories my only gripe is there are carrying handles that flip out from the top so you can carry it like a bag the handles would be great if they did n't have metal <unk> that could potentially scratch your laptop it 's simple enough to just cut off the handles with scissors the carrying handles are not mentioned in the product description or shown in any of the pictures
great case for a great price that protects your mac book pro like the zip pocket in the front to store the mac book 's power cables the case comfortably fits the macbook pro with the ipearl mcover hard shell case
i really like this case for my # . # inch ultrabook the neoprene protects it and the outside zipper pocket is nice to put small accessories in it like the mouse the ac adapter will fit in there but makes it a little bulky seems to be well made and i recommend it over the little case that is shipped with the aspire s #
thanks for a good business and for fast shipping the product arrived as expected and looks even better then described i like a lot the handles hidden inside - so you can use them or not the side pocket is one of the best things as well - everybody has a cable or two or a charger or whatever will come back again for sure thanks ! !
very good quality . nicely stitched . it also has handles inside that comes out perfect bag . looks like im <unk> notes and not a ultra book which is perfect for <unk> eyes
i bought this on # day prime as there was a last minute need to take my macbook pro on a trip by plane my macbook pro with the protective cover fit in this case , but it was a tight fit this case offered enough protection on the plane and while i was carrying it around i love the bright green interior lining the zipper pocket on the outside was good to hold my pens , phone , etc . i would buy this again and will be using this on trips in the future it also went right through security in this case and i did n't have to remove it , which was nice
i like this sleeve case it fits my macbook pro # & # # ; perfectly also , the extra pocket is great i store small items in there , e.g . my earphones , remote control , and cleaning cloth for my screen feels very good i would definitely recommend this back
honestly , i 'm surprised there 's not more reviews on this it fits my new # `` mba -lrb- mid # -rrb- perfectly even fits with the ipearl clear mba hardcover case the outside zipper pocket is great would definitely recommend this
the same one we purchased # years ago is still great , so we got another one for a new laptop what we really like is the outside pocket which holds the necessities
i purchased this case for my samsung # . # & # # ; ultrabook -lrb- ativ # -rrb- and it fits perfectly i think i paid less than $ # for it but the price in store for other cases were at least $ # it was well worth it
i was unsure about my decision to buy this case but took a chance after reading the positive reviews add me to the list , i love what i got for the money would recommend this any day
i typically carry my laptop in a backpack , or in the outer pocket of a carry-on bag i like to protect my investment with a little padding this is case meets this requirement very well it is well made , offers the protection i want it has a full length , half high zippered pocket on the side to papers , a cd or even the power supply i plan on not using it as then i can put the laptop in the sleeve on the belt for tsa inspections
i love my sleeve : just perfect to carry my mac pro in it fits well and also the extra pocket is big enough to carry the charger and the extension cord protects it well , and fits well in my bag to carry it back and forth to my apple <unk>
i wanted a sleeve that had a little extra room in case i wanted to put extra things in there this allows exactly that , along with the extra pocket most of the times i leave the foam in it to give extra protection and fill in the extra space but when needed i can remove the foam and add a note pad or papers i love it ! !
its a good case and fits pretty much perfectly on my ultrabook i bought this for by hp folio and so far i have used it everyday to take my laptop to class no scratches on my laptop so its doing the job well
i bought this for added travel protection for my sony vaio and it certainly does the job the neoprene case is thick enough to add another layer of safety without compromising the space of where you carry it there is a pocket on the side designed to keep peripherals close by , but not big enough to enclose them completely if you are in need for padded transport of your # & # # ; laptop and your bag does n't already come with it , then i 'd recommend this for you
cheapest option for a # `` ultrabook fits my toshiba z # like a glove a little unsure about how well it can protect it but at least for scratches and the like , i 'm happy ultrabooks in general are so thin that it 's hard to not worry a little bit with a soft case , but for a soft case , this ipearl one is great
i do n't know what people expect for this cheap of a price but i love this bag yeah it is a little thin but i feel like its exactly the same thickness as any other case of this style the zippers are n't messed up like that other person commented and i love the front pouch i was surprised to see the black was bright green on the inside but you never see it anyway my # inch macbook pro fits perfectly so i do n't know what crazy size laptops these other people are trying to shove in this case but if this is the computer you have , buy it
very easy to use and with its side zipper im able to carry my charger and my mac in the same case and not have to get a huge laptop
i bought this after my expensive case broke i do n't understand why people are paying so much for cases when this cheap one does the trick and looks great as well
it fits my mac perfectly and it is soft inside so my mac stays cushioned on my long trips and just everyday the pocket is handy for iphone chargers and even the laptop chargers
does exactly what it 's supposed to do for a very low price no issues at all glad i bought this instead of one of the higher priced items
the product had great packaging and was in perfect condition it fit my macbook # in perfect even with the case on and the pocket was perfect for holding my charger . love it
this case fits my # . # inch laptop perfectly with just enough room to spare , providing the perfect cushion when i take it anywhere , as i often do i take good care of my electronics , but this case gives me that extra peace of mind knowing my laptop will be safe i even like the neon green lining although i did notice a slight chemical smell coming from it at first , as others have , it was negligible and went away after a while
i do n't know for the other laptops but for the mac air # inch is horrible one simple problem it does n't fit in the mac air # , i have to force to put it in it is not built for this product
received this as a gift and after two months of use i am sad to report that it is coming apart at the seams now being held together with red duct tape and that is really disappointing because i really love this case otherwise
i have had this since feb and i have not been impressed with the build of this sleeve the first thing that happened was the magnets in the flap started to come loose and move around in the flap it got annoying to move the magnets back into place ! then the adhesive that they used to <unk> the whole case together started to crack after not much longer it began to peel i have not abused this case it seems with the wear that i really put this through a lot my macbook was placed in it then i put it in the carrying sleeve in my backpack not impressed with it it also does not offer much for and accidental drop protection
the case does everything as described i have a samsung series # and it fits nicely however , it came with a very poor finish . stitching on the leather , around the magnet was very poor stitches on several places were either lose or they were just hanging out of place
it would be fine if it was # inch wider it is <unk> to get my macbook air in the case if you try with the usb connector for the <unk> becomes impossible makes a nice pad
this was a great sleeve slim & good looking it * was * great ... until it fell apart on me i should of <unk> the warning photos that another user submitted , showing a sleeve that was peeling apart at the seams `` that wo n't be me , `` i thought , `` i take care of my stuff . `` but after about a month of daily use , sliding it into my messenger bag , the corners started peeling i bought it # weeks ago and the return window closed # weeks ago edit : easyacc responded promptly to this review and <unk> offered a replacement which i declined in favor of a refund my rating reflects the product itself , though easyacc should be <unk> for their exceptional customer service
i bought this for my lenovo u # laptop because it claimed to be able to fit it it does fit , but it about rips the case when i try to put my laptop inside i would only recommend for tiny mac book airs i do like the case , but i was disappointed when my laptop did n't fit it is very thin , and not durable i would not recommend this case if you are looking for protection for your laptop if you just want something cute to keep the scratches off , this product would be great for your macbook
this case began coming apart after # year it was nice at first , but once the inner and outer leather begin to separate at the seams , it 's no longer usable
this product is well made , however , the color depicted here is not what it actually looks like the sleeve is actually dark <unk> black there is also a logo in the bottom corner which is not in the image
after reading the reviews about the magnets messing up the screen / putting their macbook air to sleep , i decided to cut out the magnets with a razor blade the cuts came out clean and i do n't have to worry about any of that anymore the sleeve still closes with no problem aside from the magnet problem the sleeve is awesome looks like real leather until you 're up close to it definitely a nice sleeve for # bucks
i bought this for my dell xps # ultrabook i looked at others but i wanted something that was thin to protect my ultrabook from scratches and would easily fit inside my backpack i 've had it for over a month and i am happy with it it fits snug and it does the job
i bought this to protect my macbook air while it 's in my gym bag no edges of the laptop are exposed while in this case it does exactly what i wanted it to , basic protection for a low price
i just wanted a nice looking sleeve for my # . # & # # ; mba it fits nice and snug , it 's pretty inexpensive and it 'll keep the product protected i 'll say it had an interesting smell at first but that only lasted for a week or so pretty sleek looking protective cover that will fool the <unk> eye into thinking its leather is n't that what you were looking for
bought this sleeve for my # `` mba , and i 've been very happy with it over the week or so that i 've been using it the laptop fits nice and snug , and the magnetic closing lid is a very nice feature the interior of the sleeve is made of a very soft , supple material , so i would never worry about scratches or anything like that while inserting the notebook into the sleeve the only gripe i have with this -lrb- and its a purely cosmetic , minor issue -rrb- is that the exterior material has a ` faux ' leather look to it not a big deal , but it just does n't look like quality material in the <unk> other than that , it 's a great product
so this fits the macbook air perfectly , but the magnetic closure does n't feel very robust when you put your laptop in and you try to close it but it 's a small issue and it looks good and gets the job done
this is a beautiful faux leather case it will make your laptop look stylish , and protect it from dirt and scratches , but wo n't offer much in the way of impact protection it is a really tight fit , too the first case i ordered the magnet did n't close because the fit was so tight easyacc sent me a replacement though , and the magnet closes on this one just make sure you slide your macbook in <unk>
for the price you pay , it is a great product it is light and soft inside so it wo n't scratch your air however , after heavy use the sides become undone and it begins to fall apart
bought this for my hp spectre # t- # i like the way the case looks and feels its very thin and sleek , but its way too tight i 'm hoping it breaks in over time , but right now its a pain to get my laptop in and out updated my review to a # star rating case has loosened up <unk> it is now a comfortable fit for my laptop also , i would like to <unk> easyacc for their customer service upon seeing my initial # star review , they immediately contacted me to see if they could help in anyways its rare to see that , so kudos to them
this is a very nice elegant looking sleeve the material and the quality is really great for the price however , it was n't designed for macbook air with a case on i have moshi case and it is pretty thin -lrb- probably the thinnest in the market -rrb- and i struggle every time to slide it in and out of the sleeve i do not think any other macbook air with a case would slide into this sleeve so basically , if you have a case on your macbook air , then this is not for you i gave it # stars , because i want to keep my macbook air case on
it fits perfect just realize that if you have any kind of hard shell snap on type case , your mac wo n't fit in here it also seems like some people are upset that their & # # ; mac pro & # # ; does n't fit ... no <unk>
the # . # inch sleeve carry case is made of quality leather which i did not expected at such a cheap rate i really like its look and feel and it fits perfectly to my sony vaio # . # `` t series ultrabook
material is really good , the leather is soft on the inside and outside has a magnet that prevent the case from open no matter what nice product , protects the laptop -lrb- i have a mac air # & # # ; that fits perfectly -rrb- <unk> , if you have a hard case -lrb- like me -rrb- , sorry but it wo n't fit you 'll have to remove it to use the leather sleeve
my old mac book air # . # `` sleeve got all dirty and weird looking , needed a new one got this one and i have to say i am impressed by the design as well as the material it looks professional and sophisticated , i like it ... have only have it for a week ... will
beautiful , everybody like it , is nice , really good looking and works perfect , was tailor made for the macbook air # , fits like a glove and when you go to a meeting looks great
it 's a thin , lightweight , not bad looking leather sleeve that fits my # macbook air and protects it well there are no pockets for the power cord , flash drives , or anything else you might want to bring along
i love it and so does my boyfriend we use it for his # & # # ; mac air : -rrb- it 's nice and slim and does n't look like it 's bought from <unk> after almost a year , condition of the material has n't seemed to change , either
the <unk> leather is <unk> , supple and <unk> . magnetic clasps are strong and hold the flap closed firmly used with a macbook air # . # `` the fit is tailored perfectly i 'm very pleased
i was looking for a simple leather case -lrb- although not real leather -rrb- that was slim and classy looking its really great you can carry it anywhere and look professional and it fits great in a bag inside is a soft cloth material that kind of cleans your air too has a magnetic lock that closes it very tight and simple although you have to slide the thicker end of the air first or it wont lock other than that in super happy with my purchase
it fits my acer ultrabook perfectly , seems to be as tough as one could expect for a <unk> product , and arrived quickly it does all that it is supposed to do , and is inexpensive there simply is n't anything more to ask of it
i am very happy with this sleek carrying case it fits my mac air like a glove it looks professional and fits inside my tote easily love the easy magnet closure
i love this thin , magnetic closure , sleeve very sleek to go with my macbook air it is durable and fits into my other computer bag very easily i would recommend this product
i really like my laptop sleeve , i was really happy when i got it it is thin and easy to carry around , very simple and looks very professional the material i 'm sure is n't the best material out there , but it does the job if you can take care of your personal things i 'm sure it will
pros first : i liked the size of the bag and the spacious interior cons : the bag really smells i asked for a refund , and it 's not worth it they charge about nine dollars if the bag costs about twenty four dollars , i 'll just forget about it i guess it 's good for a garage sale
the pocket for the laptop is not a separate pocket - it is open at the bottom so if you put your keys or other marginally sharp items in the bag , your laptop can get scratched or damaged the flap at the bottom does n't provide a good seal and does n't go in the same spot repeatedly the style is nice -lrb- strap material feels cheap , though -rrb- but i want something stylish that still at least gives reasonable protection to my laptop when i 'm traveling or heading to a local coffee shop returning this one and looking for something better it 's too bad one has to choose between good quality and style with laptop bags
the bag is lovely and huge , however i wish we would have taken note to the other reviews because this bag stinks i thought after i took it out of the box and the plastic bag it came in and let the bag air out the smell would go away no such luck so i thought febreeze -lrb- the bag is for my mom -rrb- a nice <unk> scent would be lovely , <unk> , no well needless to say the stink from the bag <unk> my house last night so much i got a nasty headache from the chemical smell we ended up putting the bag outside for a few minutes to air out ; and i sprayed the bag with a new scent of febreeze ... we 'll see hopefully my mom wo n't pass out from the smell when she gets the bag
it is exactly the size needed and had all the qualities i was looking for , but had to keep it outside for # weeks because of the odor either the materials or adhesive causes a very strong smell , even after a month there is faint odor , could not have taken it to an enclosed space
i bought this bag for school , but ended up <unk> it after a few uses the bag itself is nice and spacious , but the make feels like it is cheap the straps feel like a cheap plastic and do not relax into an easy or comfortable fit they came sort of <unk> , and the kinks have not worked themselves out , despite heavy contents and an attempt to stretch the straps out i have replaced it with a more legit leather bag that does the trick
i finally settled on this bag after searching for weeks for a bag to fit my dell # & # # ; laptop it is sooooo wide ! ! ! the bag is slender and leaves very little room for extras however , i managed to squeeze my headphones and wireless mouse in it i have to maneuver my laptop into the bag because my wireless mouse usb connector snags it takes more than a few seconds to slip the laptop into the bag this christmas , i just bought a vera bradley tote that fits my laptop and everything in between i am <unk> this lady <unk> pro if the lady <unk> pro had another inch in width , it would be perfect
gets the job done , works well for carrying large laptop and looking professionally the straps are a little thin so do n't overload it or it will dig into your shoulder
really good for a busy business person that carries a lot bigger than what i thought , of course i should read the <unk> before lol other than that no complaint
bought this for my mother she wanted to start taking her computer with her when she travels she has used it for travel in the u.s. as well as internationally and it seems to be hanging in really well it holds her laptop , phone , documents , and whatever else she needed it to carry she has said nothing but good things about it
great size with nice structure and just the right amount of pockets enough so that everything has its place but yet you can still locate it all quickly perfect for an inexpensive laptop bag
this bag very comfortably fits my # . # & # # ; dell laptop there is not much room in the other pocket once my computer is in it -lrb- which is why the # stars -rrb- , but overall , i 'm very happy with the purchase
this was a perfect find for me having a huge laptop made it hard to find a professional looking bag that did n't cost me an arm and a leg and this was perfect
after searching everywhere with no luck for an inexpensive `` girly `` bag for my # `` hp laptop , i consider myself lucky to have found this one the bag looks very pretty it has plenty of storage space to easily carry my laptop and accessories the handles are supposed to be leather but they <unk> like vinyl and feel a bit hard in the shoulder according to the product information it has a padded shoulder strap , it does not the padding inside is decent but i wished it was sturdier saying that , i believe the bag is absolutely worth the price it looks pricier than what i paid and it does the job *** it is now over a year later and i must say the bag is still great no issues , great storage space , still stylish
i got so much out of this bag i needed a decent bag to take to work and take my laptop in it not only fit those qualities , but i liked the fact that it can pass as a fashionable bag without giving away that you could be carrying a laptop it 's a plus that it zips up and has a few compartments to keep the usual <unk> necessities -lrb- phone , <unk> , keys , feminine <unk> , etc etc -rrb- the bottom has a few <unk> for it to stand too i do n't need to worry for a dirty bottom if i have to put it on the floor it was practically a steal ! -lrb- was # . # at the time
i needed a durable computer bag for my # ' macbook pro for everyday use i had <unk> many websites and many bags looking for a good deal on a good bag this bag definitely surpassed all of my expectations it was a great price and i have used this bag everyday for the past # . # years and it is still in very good condition ! there is some wear along the bottom seams , but the interior and everything else is still fully intact it is also very professional looking - would highly recommend this bag ! !
even though this tote is for laptops , it 's great for everything it 's large , stylish and nicely padded it has a center divider , some zipper pockets and places for pens also the straps are adjustable and it has an outer pocket the tone on tone design is stylish and appealing
it looks much better than the normal laptop bags i also like the extra room in it to carry more than the laptop and charger it is very durable
i 've found this bag to be very handy it 's bag that not only fits everything in it , but it also has style to it i find this bag as useful <unk> klein nancy laptop bag it 's fine bag , no matter what you use it for
