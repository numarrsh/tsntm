received item without box and item did not look new there were dirt smudges through out the whole lap desk i had to clean it after purchasing a & # # ; brand new & # # ; item very disappointed and do not want to waste time and money to return it
i was disappointed with this lap desk it was too small for my # `` notebook , and the surface was not made of a <unk> material ... my laptop was sliding around when i tried to use it i ended up returning this for another brand
it was too heavy and my notebook weighed an additional # pounds that was not the main problem my # . # notebook would slide off the holder and become <unk> on my lap , because there was no design device that would keep the notebook in place the grey <unk> covering serves no purpose in keeping the notebook on the holder it could possibly work better for a # inch , but the same shortcomings would be <unk> i would not reccommend this product to anyone i purchased another holder from a local dealer that is <unk> to hold the notebook in place ; better suits my needs ; has space for a wireless mouse ; and meets my comfort level the big plus is that this particular targus lap desk provided is : it let me know what i did n't want
does not fit # & # # ; do not buy if you have a # & # # ; laptop otherwise you 'll be like me <unk> it off on someone else trying to get my money back that way
i wanted to use my purchase which has just arrived i wanted to love it because it seemed useful , sturdy , and practical however , first it would have to fit for my lap top i purchased this item thinking this size would fit my # . # screen ~ could you please be more accurate in the future this purchase is now useless to me
this product came with the left gray latch <unk> to the product so i am now unable to completely close the case also not very durable plastic i will keep and use the product but i 'm not very satisfied with the purchase
my laptop gets quite hot on my lap this solves that problem only complaint is it 's a little bulky and i do n't have need for the internal storage that makes it big
i got what i ordered but when it came in the mail one of the clips to keep it closed was not there it works well , but now it wont stay fully closed and it can not be trusted to hold things inside of it
i would love this if i had room for my mouse the storage is adequate you can fit pens , a remote control , your phone , etc . -lrb- just nothing too big , like a book or thick stack of papers . mine came promptly and nothing was broken , so no qualms there if only the mouse issue were solved as it is , it 's collecting dust
i <unk> i did n't really see the usefullness of the product when it first came i was half expecting something that you put a laptop inside however , it has quickly grown on me as i started using it in the way that the pictures and small <unk> described i did n't realize it , but i do tend to put a laptop on top of another surface -- often an old box or something this product provides a stable surface which allows air to <unk> underneath there is storage inside the unit , sort of like in the large school portfolios the kids lug around these days the underside is a soft surface and the top where you set your laptop is like a hard plastic mesh of some sort i liked it more than i expected
i found that it is more comfortable to use my # & # # ; lap top with this it makes it a lot more comfortable and cooler than just having it on my
this laptop cooler is a passive cooler it does not include a fan that some <unk> do the grate design ensures that your laptop 's own cooling mechanism will not be obscured so it will remain cool it also ensures that the computer <unk> will be <unk> from the very hot surface of the bottom of the laptop this product is very well made , structurally very sound and quite attractive being a passive cooler , it wo n't be as effective as one with a fan users playing games that requires the computer to run at a higher temperature may get more utility from the cooler with a fan otherwise , most users will benefit from this cooler there is a snap to close the top and the sides are closed to papers and supplies put within the cooler will stay in place also , just having hte computer tilted up a bit is a helpful feature
i use my lap top all the time while on the sofa i had been trying to decide what would work best and went with the targus laptop lap desk i t works well and i do not have to balance my laptop anymore . i has storage which i have not used but looks like it will be convenient
i bought this for my wife 's laptop , she really likes it it has inside storage for mouse , pens , etc . if anything ever happens to it , i 'll have to buy her another
i love this accessory for it 's not only ergonomic in its designed it 's also helps prevent the laptop from overheating and has a small compartment for storage of memory cars , cd and stationary
i work from home a lot and when i work i 'm sitting on my couch with my laptop on , well , my lap i had dell and the battery would get really hot in one week i received two deep burns on my leg after i had fallen asleep waiting for a long process to finish i went on amazon and found this simple little lap table and it works like a dream it is sturdy construction , comfortable on my lap and just the right size it opens to a small compartment where you can store , pens , sticky notes and the like the top is a hard mesh that allows air to circulate away and around the base of the laptop both pulling the heat away and protecting my legs from the heat it also doubles as a writing desk for my lap i highly recommend this product for anyone that using their laptop on their lap and for a lap desk for writing
i have a # `` laptop and am typing this review using the new targus lapdesk i use my laptop a lot , and one of the annoying things has been the heat on my legs -lrb- which apparently is a bit dangerous , from info i 've heard -rrb- after a few hours , it becomes highly uncomfortable keeping the laptop directly on my legs , so this is a fantastic accessory for me . which keeps my legs cool , especially in the summer unlike some huge wood lap desks i 've seen , this one is sturdy , lightweight and hence portable i often take the laptop from room to room throughout the week , so the ease of moving the lapdesk is definitely a <unk> feature in addition to being sturdy , it also opens up with # easy latches inside there is a netted compartment for pens , notepads , or other important office accessories -lrb- it also came with some avery <unk> sleeves for important papers , etc -rrb- i absolutely love it
my hubby and girlfriend both love it it keeps his lap cool and has the storage area and angled for better typing ability and more correct <unk> typing he uses it daily and is very happy with the gift as well as my girlfriend ... she is happy with the bday gift i chose
i absolutely love this lap desk it serves it 's purpose , is light , allows the computer to stay cooler and has the added bonus of storage the price is right too !
i use my laptop all the time , and in fact , i often have two laptops open and going at once because of this , i have used several different kinds of lap desks this one is a <unk> nice design , because it 's small enough to tuck into a briefcase with my laptop for use on the road the ventilated surface is nice for passive cooling , and unlike <unk> equipped with fans , it is , of course , <unk> i like having the storage space inside for a couple of pencils and note paper , as well as a compact external hard drive and cords , which conveniently thread right through the sides of the lap desk the bottom has a soft surface for your lap , the handle on top is rubbery to keep the laptop in place , and the latches close it up securely lightweight and comfortable
if you 're like me , your laptop is running its fans all the time when you 're using it , because you 're <unk> it out with things to do this is a nice little <unk> hollow -lrb- with storage , if that 's what you actually need -rrb- lap-top laptop pad that will let you compute on your <unk> without cooking your <unk> and <unk> lightweight with a slightly tacky finish , so your computer does n't slide around while you 're using it in practice , this is almost as good as using a laptop pad that has fans built into it if it 's sitting on a table
product is nice like the product , does what it describes however you may want to shop around , you might find a cheaper price but this is a good <unk> and would recommend
i needed to replace and old laptop desk that broke this is more solid and allows the machine to breathe it keeps the warmth off your legs it can also be opened for storage well made and useful i would definitely recommend
i use it as my remote desk , i store billing and daily home office stuff inside of the pocket , it is very easy access the pocket even when i use my laptop
i opened my sleeve from the package and the zipper was already broken it does not zip and i did not even have a chance to use it very disappointed ! !
i have just received this sleeve yesterday i ordered it to fit my dell tablet it does its job well , the tablet fits it perfectly the zips are fine too the material did not smell as much as other reviewers pointed out what i do not like about it is - too vivid colors making the sleeve looking a bit cheap , they are more vivid that on the photo , - rather slippery material so i am afraid that the sleeve can slip out from my hands but overall if you compare the price and what you get i think it is still worth to buy it
the sleeve arrived much quicker than i expected ... only two days after i ordered the design is even cuter in person however , i think it 's a little too big for my ipad # i think its better suited for netbooks but , i 'm going to keep it because it 'll do the job and the design is one of the cutest i 've seen while searching for an ipad sleeve the handles on the zipper are rubber coated and look pretty durable i think this company should consider making a sleeve that is specifically designed and measured for ipads and tablets
very pretty case , just as shown in the picture however the fabric is very thin ; it will keep my ipad from getting scratched but does not feel very durable or protective
it is a very pretty case but it is not easy to get the ipad in this case you have to stretch the case to get it over the ipad i guess i thought it would be a little bit bigger
to <unk> for a second before i get into the bad stuff , this design is adorable ! and the material is super soft and plushy - i almost want to stuff it like a pillow and sleep on it it is so cute , and well <unk> problem is that its small i had to squeeze my dell mini laptop into it and was alittle scared the zipper might not hold i got it in but it is a serious tight fit i think saying it could take a mini laptop is a <unk> i gave it a # because i am going to use it and its not all that bad i just have to be careful with the zipper hope this helps
ok . the colors are not quite as vivid as the pic shows , but they are still nice the bonus is that it does n't ever seem to look dirty i ahve not washed mine yet i am sure there must be a way too though it was a good value
i use this zip pouch to hold my journal and my kindle and a calendar i wanted something to keep my things together in my day pack and my overnight bag the zipper is very good quality and the pouch is just simply pretty
this case is really nice the fabric is great and the colors are vibrant i use it for my ipad # and it has some space left for the charger if you are looking for a unique funky case , then get this one !
i was looking for an ipad sleeve that would allow me to slip in my ipad # with a tire <unk> cover on it , which is very grippy -lrb- for lack of a better word -rrb- i love the print on this sleeve it is very soft , zipper works smoothly , ipad fits very nicely , just snug enough without it being too much trouble to zip shut great protection for the ipad screen
this is of very good quality colors are bright and materials are protective for ipad fit is very good even with a flap front hard shell case on ipad as
the sleeve provides cushioning for my ipad when i take it with me it fits my ipad -lrb- # st gen -rrb- with a slim case on it just fine & has extra room i also like that there is a wrist strap if needed the colors are muted - but pretty much look like the picture which is what i expected
i bought this bag for my son 's new computer that i got him for christmas he is an adult and has not mistreated the case he started out really liking the bag the only use it gets is going from the living room to his bedroom at night and back again in the morning he has to use a <unk> to get around so he does not even carry it around by the handle but lays it on the seat of the <unk> he picked it up from beside his chair to use the computer and the plastic part of the handle broke in half i was very surprised and so was he it is not like it has been misused at all i do n't even see how it could break , it had to be faulty anyway , after really liking the case with all of its pockets and all , now he is just disappointed in it and i feet badly that a gift i gave to him barely lasted for a month
this case is the perfect size and form factor for both my acer c # and acer c # chromebook there is enough room for the power block , and even a mouse and a few other small items , such as pens , <unk> case , etc . the case is very lightweight i am disappointed , though , because after about six months of use the velcro on the strap that holds the computer in place has become completely ineffective the zipper and padding on the case is fine , but i 'd be a happier customer if that velcro held together better
a little wider than it needs but great padding to keep your little laptop safe optional shoulder strap makes it handy to throw over your shoulder while traveling i have to say , i really love my chromebook what a fantastic screen
i am very pleased with the bag i can put my chromebook along with my kindle fire hd and phone in it comfortably it certainly was worth the money i look forward to traveling with my new bag i would recommend it to my friends
these cases came just as described they are sturdy and have plenty of space for a charger and a mouse ... i even have enough space to place my writing tablet on top of my chromebook the adjustable shoulder strap was an added bonus
i bought this case for my samsung chromebook -lrb- wi-fi , # . # -inch -rrb- the the fit is good and there is enough room for my mouse , the charger and my kindle this case is made with sturdy woven nylon that wo n't snag . there is nothing cheap about this bag it fits my needs quite well , and the price was right
i love this case very well made has a lot of inside pockets for storage the material and handles are very sturdy and will last a long time the front closure is very strong velcro lots of room in the bag for accessories
i love the adjustable shoulder strap , the interior and exterior pockets and the fact i can fit my chromebook and even a <unk> book in the case easy carrying doesnt irritate you when you tote it i use this from home to work and when i use it for traveling easy to use at airport because you can open the case and it wont come out . nice hard case absolutely love it
i am really happy with this purchase we bought this bag for my son to put his new chromebook in he loves it he carries his chromebook and some <unk> too i like that it keeps his computer safe and that he has a safe way to transport it around
this is a bulkier bag which in many ways is great that means it holds a lot and has a space for everything you could need that also means it is not a sleek bag about town what helps this is the overall dimensions because it keeps it small enough not to look like that laptop bag from the # 's that your employer gave you with the laptop the color is a nice red - not too vibrant but rich all of the moving parts continue to work well - no stuck zippers , seams torn , or anything it has held up very well it fits <unk> chromebook -lrb- wi-fi , # . # -inch -rrb- very well with no problem including the charger cord it also fits my kindle fire and notebooks so this is really a nice bag for practical reasons i had actually tried to cancel my order because i thought it would be too bulky but luckily for me i was too late - because when it arrived i fell promptly in love
great product , exactly as described arrived on time and is very useful the outside pouch holds the charger <unk> the actual pc is secure on the inside great amount of room and sections for little extra things
i had read many of the reviews for the roocase netbook carrying bag , and decided to give it a try it 's everything i needed i have a kindle , which i am able to carry in the pocket on the outside , and fastens with velcro nice shoulder strap , and sturdy zippers on the main compartment the inside holds my chromebook , and a couple of notebooks if i need them i am taking online classes at the moment it also has plenty of space , and pockets for my charger to my chromebook , charger for my phone , and kindle , and my ear buds nice and compact to carry around , when i do n't need my book bag in fact , i can put it in my bookbag when i need to , especially when i go to china for vacation later this fall
loved the concept of this bag , all the various pockets and compartments made it perfect to carry for my job unfortunately the trim started tearing loose within a couple of weeks of receiving the bag , as well as the interior lining i began contacting the seller , trade winds corp , # weeks after receiving the bag to resolve the issue after <unk> me along for almost # months , he now states that since it has been over # days he is protected by amazon policy and that `` i have no recourse . he also refused to <unk> the issue through amazon , i can only assume so that there would be no documentation of our conversations if you can find this bag with another seller , it 's worth taking a chance on , but i would avoid this seller like the <unk>
the design was great the concept is good but the workmanship and the material are very very poor quality i 'm already looking to replace it for now it will have to do i know will not last six
provided a good amount of storage , fit my # inch laptop just fine wish the large back pocket expanded a bit more stitching started tearing really bad after # months of regular use will probably look into getting a custom bag made for my needs i have n't found one yet that really fits my needs
i have to agree with the other computer tech completely , this is by far the best <unk> bag i 've ever owned super durable , huge amount of storage , and completely <unk> looking this may be geared more towards the tactical crowd , but if you 're a it person on the go then i highly recommend this case
i 've had many laptop bags , and this one is by far the best it 's solid , light , and well laid out the seller ca n't <unk> tactical , but it 's still a great product it arrived on time , in good condition , and included some extra gifts a tiny american flag -lrb- made in china -rrb- , and a bumper sticker that does n't make any sense to me does anyone know what `` <unk> will be done on earth as it is in florida `` , means ? google did n't know either it also has two special mounting spots for <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> # <unk> you can <unk> your office <unk> in the back of the head to make them take out their ear buds
quality through and through i carry a few <unk> items in this sturdy -lrb- rugged -rrb- bag every stitch is double and bar <unk> the only draw back is the three front bags i replaced them with maxpedition tactical # `` x # `` x # `` blk . bags the bag has <unk> attachment webbing all over the front that made it easy to attach the bags with maxpedition `` <unk> `` straps that finished the bag off ... perfectly
what can i say , it 's perfect for a traveling man such as me it can hold just about anything you need to take with you onboard the plane and is small enough to fit in the overhead much better than those <unk> with roller boards trying to stuff them in the overhead bins
i have had this back for five months and the i had to get the one of the shoulder straps done because the seam was giving away the inside lining giving away and this one can not be sewed back since it would need to re sew all the inside of the backpack i carry a d # , a nikkor # mm , a tamron # mm , a tamron # and a sb # <unk> i thought this bag would be enough for this but it seems that it is n't
it is smaller than i thought it would be i felt it could use a few more compartments for accessories do n't expect to carry much more than camera and laptop gear it is a good bag though i like the side access for the camera and the option from sling to backpack
the backpack holds multiple lens and other accessories when we flew from the <unk> to hawaii it also held the laptop it is easy to slip off one of the backpack straps , sling it across your body and have easy access to lenses while hiking i could not give this product # stars because on a recent hike , in # + temps the backpack caused discoloration to my husband 's t-shirt
it is a perfect bag if you love your dslr nicely padded , multiple compartments , tripod foot rest pocket and easily customizable based on your needs it came with weather coat which was icing on the cake must buy for all dslr holders
i absolutely love it i have only one complaint and so i 'll say that first the tripod holder is flimsy / small , and the buckle that holds it is cheap plastic other than that , it fits my # . # inch laptop easily with about a half inch on both sides it has adjustable compartments which hold my canon dslr camera , and # lens also has multiple other compartments which can fit my laptop charger , mouse , sync cables , sd cards , and more
after looking at many different options , decided to buy <unk> and am really satisfied good size , fits camera with mounted zoom lenses accessible through quick side access plus several other items more than enough space other bags fit passports , batteries , cards , etc . ca n't go wrong with this
i own a couple dslrs and recently bought a canon # d which i gripped and a # # . # sigma lens this is one of the most cumbersome <unk> many enthusiast will have it fits perfectly i thought the grip and the telephoto would not fit but they did in the lower compartment , i was able to fit that , a # and a # ex sized flash theres the upper compartment also where another two or three sized lenses may fit finally , it was really comfortable to held a couple hours with a rebel sized dslr , a flash , and my laptop alienware -lrb- # in -rrb- which fits more than easily in the lap top bag
wished camera storage section had more flexibility for me , upper storage would be more practical if it was & # # ; box like & # # ; design , rather than & # # ; full open & # # ; side storage not very accessable and usefull outside access would have been better <unk> , the tripod storage <unk> -lrb- i assume , there was no manual -rrb- , was not practical for a standard tripod - no lower support backpack overall size was ok , and material seemed strong just purchased , so time will tell i guess overall , i should be satisfied for the price i am not a professional photographer -lrb- yet -rrb-
seems relatively well made snug for the laptop compartment , but ample room for camera gear i 'm not sure i 'll be able to use this as my only carry-on , but i am going to try on the downside , how is this a sling it 's almost impossible to carry this bag over one shoulder , and that 's what sling says to me
looking for a backpack to fit my canon # d and # in laptop for the price , it 's great my laptop is not a skinny little macbook and it fits fine i do n't expect this backpacks durability to last forever , but for $ # -lrb- compared to others exactly the same around $ # -rrb- it 'll work for a few years
i can fit everything i need in this bag the shoulder straps are padded well and the compartments work great with all my items it was shipped quickly and was priced well
great function , great price , we are very happy with ours note : try to <unk> your dividers , b/c they will begin to tear if you velcro and <unk> them too much it has many , many features for the price and for me the best are the -lrb- dual -rrb- quick access zippers and the laptop/tablet pocket -lrb- or travel documents -rrb-
this is an awesome camera bag for my needs ! ! i just wish there was more pockets like the one on top where you can put more than just flat stuff like sd cards and cleaning clothes but so far i love it my laptop fits perfectly and i still have space for my charger ! no more hassle at the airport with # different bags
i bought this back pack to hold my laptop and camera gear and was very pleased with the quality overall as several people have noted some of the zippers already have problems -lrb- the one inside the case already unzips itself -rrb- as long as the outside zippers work , i can deal with that bag is larger and heavier than i expected , but so is what i put into it i ended up wishing that the bag was a little larger so i could put more equipment in it the chargers fro everything take up a lot of room so they will have to live in the area i was going to use for something else i underestimated what i was planning on putting in this bag
yes , everything fits and well protected in this bag it is very similar to the tamrac evolution # or # but only # or # of the price <unk> i think the side access is very important ... unless you want to take the backpack off and lie it down on the street for the next <unk> the rain cover also comes handy and important unless you only stay at home ... in that case you do n't need a backpack you can buy the big brand but i am telling you that i made a side by side comparison and there is very little difference ... . the zippers are actually better on this product i am selling my tamrac expedition and staying with this one instead of the tamrac evolution forgot to mention also that the tripod leg pocket at the bottom is also bigger and stronger than the tamrac and you can conceal it in case you do n't carry a tripod the laptop pocket is well padded and big enough for any # inch screen the handle on the top feels stronger than the tamrac evolution imho
i got tired of carrying around my second camera body at events and this bag really helped take away the stress from # shoulder and <unk> me out i can fit # camera body and a few lenses without a problem and also use it to hold my tripod
like any avid photographers i am always looking for the perfect camera bag it does not exist of course because there are too many human to consider : how much weight do you want to carry , how much equipment do you own and so on so i have many camera bags and change them too often but down to <unk> : this bag is excellent value for money , seems quite well made and is light weight enough to make it useful i would like a bit more versatility in the removable partitions but let 's be serious , this is not a $ # . # bag i recommend it
great bag for all of my photo shoot essentials the only issue is that it 's now too heavy to carry on my bag , which is why i ordered a trolley insert putting it on wheels makes it the best bag that i 've had so far you get a lot of bang for your buck it 's very sturdy so it protects your valuable equipment and it did n't cost an arm and a leg
does n't stay on very well , at least the bottom portion kept falling off , so i threw it in the trash and just kept the top portion to protect the face of my lab top at least
this thing is horrible for the macbook air the top half is too heavy for the air and this case is so hard to get off , i accidentally scratched my laptop while trying to remove it kind of defeats the purpose , no ? my fingers hurt soo much from trying to pry this off it took far longer than it should have -lrb- the speck * case does not have these problems and stays on very well -rrb- the only good thing about this case is that the bottom half has openings to allow for ventilation -lrb- the speck * case does not -rrb- even though the macair vents at the rear , near the hinge , this still seems like a good idea however , my recommendation would be to spend the money on a more high-quality case that wo n't be too heavy and will be more easy to remove on a side note , mine also came with a defect that caused the case to curve away from one of the edges of my laptop really not worth the money
it was relatively easy to put on and it works to protect my macbook air the only cons are that it blocks one of my usb ports technically , i should be able to use the port on the left side but in practical use i ca n't plug a flash drive into it the tab used to snap the case in place is tad bit too thick i have tried <unk> the flash drive , which is what i have to do for the right usb port , and it still does n't work but i really only use one port at this time , so i am pleased with the product
how the hell am i supposed to remove the top half from the body it 's literally impossible to remove on the other hand , the bottom half flips off so easily , not to mention that the rubber plastic fall off automatically everytime you place your mba on a desk seriously . . -lrb- i still could n't remove the top
i had bought other <unk> transparent hard case cover , that went out any time i handled the device it mad me to much <unk> khomo it was another song , it works ! ! it fits perfectly over the the macair # `` and never flip out
this case is fantastic it really does fit like a glove it snaps on and stays on previous reviews said that the top does n't stay on , and i had a problem with it initially , but after realizing that it was n't snapped on properly the top part of the case needs to be snapped on from the bottom first and then snapped on the top in order to secure it properly this case was definitely worth buying
not a bad case for the price but it will not protect your computer from much ideal for just putting in a book bag to keep from getting scratched by random items also , the velcro is not adhered well , so it came off within the first week of use if you need a computer bag for just a few occasions , this is n't bad but as far as everyday use , find something else - hope this helps with your purchase decision :
i bought this for my surface pro , and it 's a bit too wide the color is certainly not as bright as pictured however , if you want a cheap sleeve to pad against bumps it 's perfectly acceptable
i think the pictures more than do the cover justice however , for as little as i spent , it will do just fine it is a <unk> sleeve and will keep the unit from getting all scratched up in my bag that is why i purchased it as for protecting it against anything more than that , no way this is not that type of cover nor is it advertised that way i am happy with my purchase
i 've travelled quite literally around the world with my laptop in this thing in the past several months and love it super soft and durable , provides enough cushioning for my laptop without being heavy or bulky , and cheap
this case is exactly what i needed this is not a big bulky case , so i would not use it for carrying the laptop around outside of another bag what this is great for is slipping the tablet in and then slipping the whole thing inside a backpack or bag the case keeps my computer safe inside my book bag and the light padding makes me feel ok about it being jostled around a little during normal use
i bought this for my teenage daughter for christmas to go with her google chromebook and it 's great i holds the chromebook and protects it when not in use seems to be made well , no frayed stitching or anything
the color is bright , the material protective and nice to the touch it does add a bit of bulk to my macbook air , but i do n't go anywhere without it and the price is great
this product is fantastic it is a little roomy but if your like me and also have a hard case with it , it is great it 's very cushioned and protects my mba it 's light and has access for the charger to be left in overall just amazingly
you get what you pay for , i suppose this sleeve is not neoprene at all - it 's an incredibly thin foam rubber that offers little to no protection for your netbook that , and it smells bad on top of it mine is going in the garbage on the brighter side , the zippered plastic baggie that it comes in is actually worth something and may keep my netbook dry once i find a decent neoprene sleeve
i have a macbook air # this sleeve fits so loose that it makes me leary that it will slip out of my hand i ended up ordering another sleeve and tossing this one
this case was definitely not designed for the # . # `` macbook air , as my # . # `` macbook air does not fit snugly inside - even with a hard shell cover case over my laptop another reviewer mentioned the velcro starting to come off , and i 'm worried this may be an issue as my macbook slides around inside and may slide out if i 'm not extra careful the case itself is decent for its price , but the product description is entirely misleading
this was a nice alternative to the more expensive incase neoprene sleeve worked for a couple months before breaking -lrb- velcro <unk> -rrb- i would spend a little more money on the better well known cases like incase and speck their products last longer so it is worth it in the long run
on the upside , this offers a lot of protection as it 's almost like an air sleeve on the down side , that 's not what i was looking for i was looking for some basic <unk> in a sleeve , and this offered a lot more than that so : if you want protection , this is a very affordable way to get more than a sleeve if you want this to easily fit in a backpack and not take up too much space , you might want to examine some other options
i like the sleeve , it 's very soft and protects my laptop from scratches i have a new macbook air # inch and this sleeve is wider than my macbook , but not enough to where it wo n't protect it properly i like the velcro closure too , very quick and easy to open/close it i would recommend this sleeve to everyone
cosmos neoprene laptop sleeve is nice and will protect my laptop , not as thick as my old one but it hard to find one on the <unk> at stores the fit was good and had a little extra room for a larger laptop my # `` fit perfect and this will last a few years
i use this with my macbook air # ' it is priced well and fits perfect the velcro is a little loud when you 're opening it at night if someone is asleep , but it is also strong so it wo n't fall out by mistake
the sleeve is a good fit for my asus vivo laptop # . # & # # ; this is a great sleeve for backpacks because it opens in the top velcro seems secure good product to prevent scratches on your laptop it is not going to be much protection if the computer is dropped good buy for the price similar sleeves at other stores are double the price
actually the reviews were not particularly hot for this item that said however , this laptop <unk> is the best you will get for the price it works great and is made of good material the macbook air # inch fits perfectly inside of it
i was a little apprehensive when this sleeve first arrived the crease where the flap opens was significantly wrinkled and i was afraid it would n't hold up , so i held off on writing a review until i 'd had it for a few weeks this sleeve is all i 've been looking for to protect my samsung # . # chromebook the padding is there but it 's as light as air the velcro loosened up slightly but that 's a good thing , it makes it easier to open i was also thrilled when i found out i could keep my sd card in my chromebook -lrb- it pokes out like a third of an inch -rrb- , no problem great product here for an even greater price the simple look , lightweight & size are perfect for all my needs
this case was more of a dirty <unk> faded green upon arrival it also had large numbers written across it in a lighter stain it looked like it had sat in harsh sun for a couple years i have no idea how they managed to get lighter numbers about the size of the case lengthwise <unk> <unk> into the fabric i would have returned except i got it the night before we left for a trip to go out of the country for a month , and it was the only thing i had to protect my sons laptop otherwise i do not recommend we were really disappointed
i ended up giving it away it just is n't solidly made it does the job , but if you 're looking for something sleek and sophisticated , this is not it the fabric is extra cushy and cheap feeling not a huge fan
