excellent investment for my netbook very well thought out design , and the grid-it is incredibly functional love the carrying handle with optional shoulder strap everyone i 've shown it to wants one of their own
the product does exactly what it claims i am able to hold my tablet , cords , chargers , and other items securely it is great to not have to worry about fishing for cords and <unk> them the grid stores them firmly in place on one side , while keeping the wires away and the tablet padded on the other side
this macbook cover fit perfectly , but left major scratches on the exterior of my macbook it left it almost entirely scratched up whatever material they are using is absolutely terrible quality not a fan
i liked the color and how the bottom piece had slits in it so my computer would not over heat but it did not fit i tried to put it on and it just slips off
i would n't re purchase this it comes off when it 's not supposed to it makes your laptop <unk> and just does n't seem worth the annoyance to have a cute color instead of plain white
i used it for a couple of weeks before deciding that it may be too bulky for my needs but that may just be because i am very mobile with my laptop otherwise it looks very nice
product had arrived in decent condition one of the plastic tabs to help clip onto the computer was <unk> off did not affect over-all quality of product arrived at a reasonable delivery date
this is the perfect cover for my macbook it is so durable and light my laptop is completely protected and it looks beautiful too it fits perfectly seems like it might be a little difficult to take off when i finally do , but i have n't needed to yet so it has n't been a problem i know a lot of people who have this same cover and since it comes in so many colors we all have something different a great way to personalize your computer
the case is great for protection and for adding some color i think originally i ordered a different color than what i got , but luckily i got a color that i also liked i would say that its a little bit overpriced , but still a good buy
i like this cover it is easy to put on and very durable i have two young children and this case has done a great job protecting my laptop the legs on the bottom are pretty cool too i shopped around for a while and this price is the best you will find
this cover came quickly , is really cute , and snapped right on to my macbook i like having the feet on the bottom of the cover so that i can tilt it a little if i 'm working on a desk -- makes me feel like it 's getting better ventilated my only quibble is that the top half of the case does n't fit perfectly onto my computer and so it bubbles out a little bit this is n't really a problem , it 's just a little less pretty than it otherwise would have been
i got the blue mcover for the white unibody macbook # `` the color is vibrant and the price was less expensive than i thought it would be got the product extremely fast

i loved it and everyone else at my school ordered them too the only problem is that you ca n't take it off without breaking it so when dirt gets underneath you either leave it or buy a new case
brought as gift for my brother and it looks great on his white macbook the keyboard skin makes the computer look even better and complete we have no issues with typing on the keyboard skin on it i would recommend buying from this vendor for your computer and we received it within # days from my order date with just standard shipping
i bought a blue mcover for my white unibody macbook if you 're in the market , this is a good choice it fits well and is easy to put on and remove the little tabs grip the top surface of the plastic so damage is unlikely -lrb- similar products put pressure on the corner of the laptop , <unk> into the casing . i did n't care about the flip feet on the bottom of the laptop when i bought it they 've been surprisingly handy in short : added protection , durable plastic , convenience features and an entirely reasonable price when i get my next computer , i 'll want another mcover
having seen other family members scuff up their white macs , i decided to protect the exterior just after purchase i was please at how reasonable and functional the mcover was when i put it to use the hardest part was deciding on just the right color pleased as punch with the cover
i got this mcover in blue for my new macbook i love the plastic folding feet which lets the laptop vent after using it for a while the cover is pretty durable ; it holds up well and protects the exterior well i like that there are many colors to chose from and the free keyboard skin that is offered is amazing with the skin my keys are protected from small dirt particles i am very happy with the purchase and the transaction with the seller was very simple i would recommend this cover to anyone looking for a way to protect their macbook
i was very happy with my purchase of this hard shell cover case and free keyboard skin for my macbook it fits perfectly and i have not had any issues at all with it i really love the clear keyboard cover because it helps keep my keyboard clean and keeps my screen clean too my keys used to leave some kind of residue on my screen when i would have it shut , but using this keyboard cover has eliminated this issue i would highly recommend buying this product rather than the overpriced hard shell cases in apple stores it has ventilation on the bottom to keep my laptop from overheating i would highly recommend this product for everyone who has a # `` white macbook
i bought this case to protect my computer because i have to take it to and from work everyday it was very easy to put on and is very well made i have been using it since september , # and there is hardly any sign of wear on it at all i have gotten tons of compliments on it and always tell people where i got it
where would i be without this cover and keyboard skin ? fast delivery and product was in tact this is a must have for these white macbooks the keyboard stays clean and i just take a wet cloth and wipe it down once in a while cover is great as well do n't really use the legs but glad to know they are there on the rare occasions i flip them up
the handle came of after a few months of use now i have to have it repaired somewhere it 's also a bit bulky that even if you only have a laptop in the laptop sleeve , it seems as if it 's full the metal latch is a bit inconvenient to <unk> the plus side , it does look
i have been using the bag for a few weeks it does hold a fair amount of files , but the places for pens is sparse the only problem i have found are the clasps to close the flap are cumbersome to use one of them consistently hangs up on me while i am trying to close the bag i will be taking a trip shortly and want to see if it is in fact easier to get through security i do like the way the bag slips over the handle of a roller bag from a look standpoint , it is very stylish i have had people ask me where i got the bag the padded strap makes it comfortable to sling over my shoulder the handle seems skimpy but holds well
when putting work papers and chargers for a cell phone and computer i also had a # inch computer in the slot where they recommend it they place it the bag <unk> and i had to replace with another bag from thule the other bag is <unk> near the handle
very nice aesthetically buy my one issue is that it 's too stiff it <unk> soft but its not only the insides are sold i was n't too pleased but it does look
have had this bag for over a year great construction and the al buckles although a bit finicky -lrb- meaning you have to pay attention to slot them , and may take a few attempts -rrb- but they look really cool there are many clever details that you enjoy as you start using the bag my biggest issue has been -lrb- thule designers please take note -rrb- the rather flimsy and poor material choice of the foam or shoulder pad i mean it is painful if you have this bag on for a <unk> or walking through a big airport the foam is really poor quality and has almost no cushion and since the webbing of the strap is nylon , it really gigs into your skin i wish they would update this on their new bags
i bought this for my boyfriend and he loves it it is very durable and has plenty of space inside he is a young professional and this has a <unk> feel to it
easy to carry , durable , works great attaching it to luggage handles in airport wished it was a bit more roomy i used to use a backpack and had to seriously <unk> down what i carry flipping laptop into bin while keeping it in the bag is difficult the bag has to go on the belt while the flap goes into a bin , awkward still easier to take the laptop out
this is a great looking bag and very functional it holds my macbook and my ipad with no problems i have noticed where you need to carry files or paperwork it can become very cumbersome and i 'm not a real big fan of the front buckles but overall i really love this bag great-looking , stylish and it does the
after using this bag for a few weeks , i am impressed by the solid construction , and really like it overall , especially the price the clips do n't really bother me as much as they do other reviewers i only have # <unk> with the bag # -rrb- not enough pockets # -rrb- the cell phone holder does n't hold my nexus # phone when the bumper is on i do n't know if i can really blame thule for this , as google made the phone a little too big in my opinion , but it still would have been nice if it had fit correctly
this bag looks nice and does a great job protecting my macbook air and ipad it also works well at the airport security checkpoint , so you do n't have to take your laptop and tablet out my only complaint is that i wish it had more pockets a zippered pocket on the front flap for small items would have made this awesome
i have been using the bag for over a year 's time and it is the best laptop messenger bag i have used the bag has special compartments for an iphone and ipad the laptop compartment is tsa approved and the laptop does not have to be removed from the bag the main compartment can fit a pair of clothes or other things like sunglasses if you are looking for a laptop messenger bag around the $ # range , look no further if there was one negative , it is the hook system that closes the bag its a little <unk> to use and might take time initially to get it on and off
this is the best messenger bag that i have ever purchased for a laptop the thule bag is absolutely amazing you , reading this review , should buy one if you care about your mac
the perfect laptop bag period i 'd buy six of these if i could <unk> em and if amazon had em in stock <unk> quality compared to anything else on the <unk>
i ordered this bag for my husband as a gift he is very hard to please and i was excited when he asked for it he loves it it 's very sturdy , has very nice compartment areas with additional space for other items in addition to your computer the bag has style and function
i love the bag great product , one minor detail thought ; mine came with the velcro in the secure compartment unsewn so i had to make a minor repair apart from this the bag is very well constructed ; the material feels solid , its really practical and there lots of space to store everything
i 've been using this backpack for a couple of months , and i 'm generally happy with it i travel every week for work and find that this is probably not the ideal bag for travelers - the bag is a bit wide if i put my travel mug in one of the side pockets , the bag wo n't fit under many airline seats - there is no <unk> on the back of the bag so that i could attach it to my roller <unk> - lots of space - very smooth <unk> with the couple of issues noted , i do n't plan on replacing this bag anytime soon
have had this backpack for just over a week i use it for work to carry my laptop and accessories to/from work and meetings , and i could n't be happier with it thus far it has ample storage space throughout its various storage pockets it seems very well made which makes me confident it will last for many years if sufficiently cared for the padded shoulder straps and back make it very comfortable to carry highly recommended for the business user
love this back pack . filled with loads of pockets even when laptop and all accessories are pack in and text books , pens , purse , glasses , kindle and loads more it does not feel heavy on the back the straps are wide and not individually stitched to bag which makes the durability great this was a great find and have been so excited about it
i bought this backpack to replace an old targus that i 've had for # + years the targus bag was great but their newer bags did n't impress me so i looked around and <unk> on this one it was hard to make a decision because there are so many bags available but i 'm impressed with the quantity of pockets and security of the bag i like that it will stand up when you set it on a flat surface it holds everything i need to carry with room to spare
very well make carry my # `` laptop and # lbs of books , still have room for my lunch i had used few other <unk> backpacks before , but none come close to this one
this trolley is just right size for me i travel a lot and most of the times for <unk> nights it holds my tablet , paperwork , and necessities for the trip rolls very well fits even under the seat of the regional jet
the very best product out there i bought one before and have been looking for another one to give my son for his birthday i am thrilled with the price and was very happy with `` computer <unk> `` for the fast delivery highly recommend this company and amazon
i have purchased several bags lately trying to find one big enough and well built to handle all my college textbooks and laptop this one is perfect ! ! the wheels do n't fall of like the others , pulls easily , and i can fit # large <unk> , notebook , and laptop with cords in this ! absolutely the best
it has excelent size , perfect for short travels with <unk> # case , having enough space to store clothes for # days and all your electronic gadgets as well as all of your business
cute design , but unfortunately it fails at its main purpose , to protect your stuff from small bumps and scratches after only one or two times in the sleeve , my new laptop , charger , and mouse all <unk> with permanent scuff marks all over them if you want to easily make all your new stuff look lightly worn , go for it , otherwise find another sleeve
the actual case is fine , neat mod design the color , i can not emphasize enough , is not as shown it is not the orange shown in the pic , but rather its a super bright fluorescent orange i really want to return this , and just might i feel ridiculous carrying this into my office building it is way more <unk> than i expected orange would have been great , fluorescent orange - no , does n't work for me so , again - the orange in the picture is not the orange you 're going to get other than the disappointing lack of color precision in the picture , the actual case construction is decent enough and the price is good
i was impressed at first , despite the obnoxiously bright color soft and comfy , and it seems like it will take care of my laptop since i 'm not too rough with it as it is however ... the inside -lrb- grey -rrb- seam ripped on the first day i used it i would return it if it was worth the hassle , but i guess i 'll just deal with having a <unk> orange laptop pouch with a useless pocket until i get around to buying a better one
the orange is very orange -lrb- think construction <unk> -rrb- , but i like it the only problem is that the material and stitching on the pocket inside the top flap is weak i tried putting my mac adapter in there for a few days -lrb- creating a big lump , which was fine with me -rrb- , but the material pulled away from the zipper so , the pocket is only for flat cords -lrb- like usb , etc -rrb- the design is creative , though , with the elastic going around the back and no zippers , so no danger of scratches
the lacie coat sleeve is a good fit for my # `` macbook pro -lrb- mid # unibody -rrb- it fits fairly snug -lrb- a little wiggle room -rrb- and provides a decent amount of protection it will protect from scratches and some bumps , but i would recommend keeping it inside a backpack or something else it is not meant to protect it from a fall or any type of blunt trauma best part was that it was n't $ # for a simple sleeve oh and it looks cool
my dell duo fits great it 's a bit bulky when i put the cords in the zipper pouch located on the top flap but still doable overall , very happy with this purchase
i received this today and was so disappointed the color was the only thing i liked the case itself was made of cheap plastic there were clips included , but no directions as to how to put it on i 'm pretty <unk> with this stuff , but this was just ridiculous the product description was also inaccurate it does not fit my macbook steer clear of this product low quality & slow shipping not worth my money
broken when i received it and does not even fit my mac book there 's a crack on the sleeve and it 's all scratched up it is supposed to be new
what a <unk> -- buy this case and you 're very likely to scratch your mac i loved the color and feel so much that i tried a second one -- fool me twice shame on me :
i ordered this product for my new mac book pro and it did not fit ! i was disappointed because i had this case on my old one except i purchased it in stores
i brought this case for my old macbook that i got in early # i was upset with this purchase because i wanted it to fit on my macbook but it did n't fit and on the description it did n't specify that it would n't fit other than that it was in somewhat a good condition
i loved the color of the case , but was quite disappointed that it does not fit by macbook -lrb- a white # model -rrb- beware if you have a <unk> macbook , this case will not work
it would have been nice to know that the cover does n't fit previous generation white macbook before receiving it the cover only fits the october # model and newer versions i am extremely bummed out
my macbook is a year older than what was specified i was unaware , but i love the color i wish it was able to fit <unk> it seemed like it would be good protection for my
i ordered this case for my white macbook that i believed was a new model macbook as i bought it after the date that is specified in the product description when it arrived it was too big and the wrong size i must have been sold an older model macbook at the <unk> - not impressed : - i am very disappointed at it is an awesome product love the colour i did n't see the same product for the older model macbook on amazon very disappointed : -
outrageously expensive for what it is , but this is definitely the best hard shell case out there for the newer macbook # `` <unk> the satin soft touch has a nice feel and design that said , for the price this product should at least ship with a keyboard and/or trackpad skin
i bought this product to prevent my computer from getting scratched since i <unk> it so often the color is spectacular and it clicks on and fits like a glove , but as soon as i pulled the case from it 's packaging i got big noticeable fingerprints on it i ca n't imagine that the shiny -lrb- not satin , like this one -rrb- case would be any different ... except the smudges might come off of it more easily anyway , i ca n't be bothered to return it because i feel like i 'd have the same kind of trouble with other shells the satin really holds fingerprints and smudges easily though -lrb- especially if you 've just used lotion ! -rrb- , so if that 's your pet peeve definitely do not buy this product if it is n't ... it 's a decent enough laptop shell
i have a # model of the macbook and it fit perfectly but i was extremely disappointed to see that at the seams the satin was a film put onto plastic of course , a week later , i ended up with a significant piece of that film missing from a single scratch on the case also , fingerprints and well ... anything ... is super visible after no time at all
this is a good case for the white macbook # nd generation i bought it for my girlfriend and she likes it a lot , even though she wants a gel case but that is hard to find so this will suffice until
while it does get some smudges its a really cool purple i also paired it with the purple keyboard cover and it has a look of a custom made laptop now totally worth it and less <unk> than buying from the apple store with the same
i just got this today and the color is beautiful the apple on the front shines through nicely it snaps on easily , but i found the top cover a bit hard to get off you can buy an almost identical case from apple , but their 's has vent holes on the bottom this case has no vent holes on bottom -lrb- or anywhere -rrb- as i said before the case is new to me so i do n't know if this will be a problem it does add a little weight to your computer
the product is awesome , fits perfectly and is serving it 's purpose of being both a protective case for my macbook and being stylish it arrived on time , fits perfectly and without hassel of putting it on only problem was the packaging it came in was a <unk> a total mess it was falling <unk> , dirty , held together with barely there tape i 'm surprised it held together long enough to get to me before messing up the case other than that , everything is great -lrb-
i bought this item for my macbook , it was much easier than i had anticipated to attach to my laptop and is smooth to the touch when the laptop is on , the illuminated apple sign shines through easily to still give the appearance apple intended
the condition was pretty good it was a little dirty but nothing a good cleaning can fix the cover was shipped pretty quickly too the color is beautiful and was exactly what i expected it to be it was a deep purple color
i 've had this on my laptop for almost three years now , and this is mainly due to the fact that i ca n't seem to take the case off that said , it 's not going anywhere that 's what i bought it for the only con about this product is that it makes your macbook noticeably heavier
i think it does the job but there is a issue with fingerprints and collecting dust the product itself seems to do exactly what it is meant for however , i gave it four stars because it does collect a lot of dust and fingerprints and the prices are high for pieces of plastic
i 've had this case for a little over # years now , and it 's been great my only complaint is that around the edges now , it 's starting to peel it still looks good and does it 's job , but the peeling is annoying
i loved it has kept my computer safe for a long time , only thing i did not like about this product was that it got ugly after a while it has scratches and somehow layers seem to peel off
this case is cute and easy to install -lrb- a little hard to take off for cleaning , but i rarely take it off -rrb- . already had it on for # years , and it 's still looking good
i bought this cover for my macbook # `` , unibody it 's for the newest model -lrb- which i purchased in august # , i believe it was released in may # -rrb- i really like this case a lot it snaps on and off very easily i like that it has more of a <unk> look as opposed to the completely clear cases that you see more commonly this is made from good quality material and has a very slight grip to it so it does n't slide around as much as the smooth clear plastic cases do wipes clean easily the color is nice and bright a previous review had mentioned that it attracted lint and pet hair easily because of the more textured surface but i did not notice anything getting stuck to it at all there is nothing i dislike about it and would recommend this case to anyone buy it , it 's awesome
i bought this case to protect my white # `` macbook the case is built specifically for this computer and fits like a glove it snaps on with ease and protects the outside of the computer from being scratched my local apple store did not have a case like this in stock so i went to their website they did carry the case on the website but it was considerably cheaper on amazon i purchased the purple one and it is a beautiful deep eggplant color and the apple logo shines through when the computer is on and lit the case also came with a soft cloth that i use to dust the computer screen which works well without fear of scratching i would definitely buy this item again
now i can fit my laptop lock into the hole so i can travel with my mac the last hard shell case i bought prevented the lock from fitting in the hole this case has open spaces on both sides of the computer so you can fit everything in without <unk> i love it there was only one color choice at the time i ordered it on amazon , purple , which is fine , but it would have been nice to have some color choice but , i am very happy that it fits well so i can travel with it
this is the case you should get for your mac its cool looking , easy to put on your laptop , and protects your laptop the case itself has a nice finish to it , its some sort of soft plastic i really like this case and i recommend buying it or possibly its equal but in a different color
the cover is great and it fits great for my computer i have a macbook , the white one the cover has n't faded at all and it 's still snug , i 've had it for about # months now
this case is just what i was looking for it snaps right on to my macbook and is securely attached i love the purple color it is a deep purple , but you can still see your lit up apple through it it is hard rubber and has a matte finish , not glossy i have a <unk> <unk> -lrb- which means a lot of fur floating around -rrb- and i have not had a big problem with fur sticking to the cover if you just wipe it with the included cloth , everything comes off easily i like the look and design of the cover and i feel it adds a good layer of protection for my macbook
i got this in the mail with a small crack , but i didnt bother to send it in , since it was very small i love the way it fits my computer
the product arrived quickly and was a very nice product my problem was it did not fit the new macbook air # nd generation the seller was very understanding and i was able to return the product for a refund
i bought this in # and still have it on my mac it can withstand harsh treatment my dogs are always jumping up on my laptop and it hardly gets scratched it keeps the mac clean and protects it very pleased with this purchase
this product really secures your laptop and the texture is incredible do not -- i repeat -- do not pay full price for this item if you can help it ! i saved a ton by buying it on amazon , and you should do the same it is easy to `` install `` -lrb- securing it to your laptop -rrb- i have only had it for a few weeks , so i have n't needed to clean it or anything so far sleek , soft , and a great buy for protecting the outer part of your macbook ! !
the soft touch hard shell case fit my macbook white later model unibody perfect it 's a great dual use product as it is attractive and keeps your macbook safe from scratches
i really love this cover that i purchased about a month and a half ago it looks great and it was extremely easy to put on however , taking it off is easy for the bottom part but i found it difficult to take the part that fits the screen off i actually still have n't taken it off -lrb- to clean -rrb- because i 'm scared but besides that , i do recommend the product
so far so good it arrived in perfect condition all i had to do was snap it on the fit was perfect and the color was true to the picture no scratches , so that 's good in my book
recently ordered this for my white unibody macbook so far , it 's a wonderful product it literally took me two seconds to snap it on to my computer it does add a little weight to the computer but it 's worth it to protect the original exterior i 've had my macbook for about a year and as hard as i 've tried to keep it clean and in mint condition , i started noticing small scratches and the bottom looked a little dirty so , i decided to get this speck case after tax and shipping it was a little more than i wanted to spend but well worth the investment what you see online is exactly what you get you will not be disappointed ! :
i love my hardshell case does add a little weight , but i 'm definitely not complaining about it it fits perfectly , the color is great i definitely feel safer carrying my macbook around with this on it oily finger prints tend to show up on the satin finish , but it 's an easy clean
this is my second case , and my first one was junk so coming to this one i was <unk> , but this is absolutly lovely the color is so nice ! and the fit is so easy to get on , unlike other cases its aligned just right with everything and does n't hurt the mac this is such a good quality product for the price i 've actually seen this at the apple store for the price of # . # <unk> worth the buy
originally i gave this product # stars yesterday i took the case off to clean my macbook pro and it has scratched my computer right next to the apple logo it is deep scratches i will not be putting this case back on and i have ordered a different one from speck i do not recommend this to anyone who has spent a lot of money on an apple
on the apple macbook pro recent <unk> , apple changed the shape of the power connector such that it bends towards the back hinge instead of coming straight out like the older models this causes it to interfere with the shell such that you ca n't charge the laptop with the shell on unless you have an old power adapter making this unit unusable and a waste of money
i specifically ordered the case for the new unibody macbook pro i received the case for the `` white unibody macbook pro `` they are not the same and since they have both <unk> i would expect the seller to know this i had to return the item and my computer is still unprotected i probably will not try to re-order even though i think this case is really cool because i need a case quickly and i do n't want to risk getting the wrong item again overall the case looked pretty cool though i ca n't speak for how it would hold up
this item did not fit my daughter 's computer i have contacted the company by phone and could not get through to anyone i also sent an email to see if i can return it or exchange it for one that fits i am waiting for their response it looks like the picture and what we were expecting it just does not fit
i bought this cover because it 's good-looking and more unique than other mac covers it fits the # `` macbook pro perfectly although dirt does accumulate between the case and the cover , you can prevent wear to the surface of your mac by cleaning it out regularly i previously bought the case in pink , but because i did not clean the inside of the cover , it got somewhat grimy however , i like the cover so much that i got another in blue definitely worth it
i have had my bubble case for about a month now , and i could not be more pleased with it it fits my mac perfectly , snapping on <unk> the hot pink is loud and unique , making my computer stand out from every other mac on my college campus the bubbles only add an extra dimension to its aesthetically pleasing design
i love my new case for my macbook pro # inch i feel very confident that my mac is well protected from bumps and scratches the blue bubbles look very unique with the apple glowing through the case i do n't have any issues using my power cord at all i just place it in a different angle when charging overall beautiful case and awesome price i love it
this bag says it is # . # ' wide my laptop is an ultra thin # `` and is # . # `` wide but it takes # people to get the laptop in it is so tight i would skip this if your laptop is anything over # `` wide as it is probably thicker than mine if you ca n't try it out ahead of time be prepared to return it . otherwise it is well made it is just probably not fit your laptop
it 's a nice case to fit my laptop ; however i must say when i got the product , it was not as brightly <unk> as pictured the colours looked a little faded and some kind of overlapped , so they were n't bright and
