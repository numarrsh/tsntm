this is by far the most stylish laptop bag i 've ever owned the design is a perfect fit for my macbook along with having a specific pocket for the ipad as well it 's a great design and very comfortable on my shoulder with a # `` macbook very happy with my purchase
this is the best bag i have my ipad in it , my kindle , all my cords so many pockets and storage areas i will not buy anything else my husband bought one too
i love this roocase i got it for my ipad # , which is in a leather protective roocase it fits in it nicely , along with my kindle , which is also in a leather roocase -lrb- i seem to like their products -rrb- i have room for my cell phone , the cords that go with the ipad and kindle , and my skinny billfold can fit in also i got the red color it looks great , seems to be very well made and is the perfect size love it !
i needed a light weight bag to carry everyday with ipad # , kindle , iphone and act as a purse with credit cards money and misc items , does all of the above and still small and light weight i do n't need a purse now except for evening wish e same style but in leather so it looked more lie a purse instead of utility case but i love it fr everyday ease
i loved this bag i have ordered # , one for a friend now my sister is in the process of ordering one i love it because it holds all the cords , ear phones and anything i need connected to my i-pad and even my phone
i bought one of these for husband for christmas for his kindle tablet i loved it so much that i left the bag i had for my ipad and got one of this style for me too i like very functional items and this one really does give a lot of functionality for all the things you use with a tablet ... cables , cleaning cloth , blue tooth keyboard , etc .
i have a # th gen ipad -lrb- note they are the same size as the # g -rrb- my ipad fits perfect along with my <unk> keyboard in the case and still gives room for a folder or two to go with it love it 's small size and can run between meeting to meeting , have my few little extras with me -lrb- note pad , gum , cable , pen and a folder or two -rrb-
i 've had this bag for a little over one month i love the style of the bag and the way it looks i just noticed yesterday , though , that the main zipper is <unk> from the seam it 's not ripping or tearing , it 's as though the zipper was not completely in the seam area when sewn going to see if i can get it replaced because other than that i love this bag and i 've received many compliments on it
it 's nice looking but not as roomy as i 'd hoped and the seam does pull apart as the other reviews noted it 's good for occasional use but not everyday i use it to travel if when i just take what i need
so this is a nice bag if you 're a minimalist i packed my laptop & a few papers in it and it was full then i stuck a book in it and the zipper tore if you decide on this bag , do n't push the limits of it 's capacity but it does look nice and if was a tiny bit bigger , i 'd love it
i constantly use this tote i do <unk> work and have found this <unk> be just right to carry everything i need to use in my day to day activities
we bought this for my wife 's netbook it fits really snug , but that 's both the good news and the bad news i just ca n't stand to use the `` keyboard `` mouse , and there 's very little room for anything but the netbook eventually bought a small `` briefcase `` style satchel and way happier take up a bit more room but much better in my opinion
i have used this soft case for my netbook and now for my samsung tablet this case has two zippers that allow you to open as much as you want of the top of the case the side pocket expands some and will hold your chargers and a few other items you want to keep with your electronics it is <unk> if it is gets dirty as well i really recommend it i like this case quite a bit
i really like this case it is soft , so it will not protect the netbook if you drop it but it is great if you want to carry the netbook in a purse and not worry about it getting damaged by other items also useful if you want to leave it laying around and not worry about someone scratching it or spilling something on it the power cord also fits in the outside pocket
i 'm a student and i bought this case to protect my toshiba netbook as it goes in my bag with me to school its lined on the inside so it saved my computer the time my water bottle spilled in my bag the case is soft , easy to hold and the computer fits snuggly the cord does fit in the front pocket as advertised but that is a bit more of a stretch still the pockets are really useful i love this case
i bought this case for my toshiba mini laptop it fit it perfectly not only that but is has a pocket to put the charger and mouse -lrb- that i bought separately -rrb- which is something that most mini-laptop cases do n't come with i have had it for a year and a half and i use it every day it 's very durable
intended to use this case cover for my nook color and accessories it is roomy , the outside pocket is perfect size for extras i usually have my digital camera , keys , credit card , paper money in it the case interior is soft and padded for good protection of your device green is my favorite color , so that 's a big plus also <unk> for my portable # `` dvd player and accessories , the discs -lrb- if in a sleeve -rrb- fit nicely in the outer pocket zippers are sturdy and easy to use comes in other sizes and great colors i love roocase
i really like this bag it is durable and i like how it does n't look `` boring `` like typical computer bags the padded compartment fits my laptop well and there is plenty of room for other papers too
i bought this for my # . # & # # ; laptop , so i was a tad concerned about it fitting fit is a bit snug , but it works the fabric is a really pretty <unk> with interesting texture the bag itself is lightweight the photo makes it look a bit stiff , and although there is a padded compartment for the laptop , the rest of the bag is more fluid fits many other items in the side pockets textured strap does not slip from shoulder i bought it for a business trip to <unk> around my laptop , but i now use is as my to & from work bag whether i 'm carrying my laptop or not
perfect for any woman , it is plenty large enough for a laptop i purchased this bag in hopes it could do double duty as a purse and ipad # , but turns out it is too large for that specific use for me wish it had been # inches across instead of # . # , everything else about the bag is perfect it arrived in brand new condition and on time
i have a macbook pro and it fits perfectly i also have enough room for a couple of file folders it has a handy dandy front pocket to store the mouse and a few pens the extra zippered pouch is perfect for the dongles the strap is wide and does n't bite into my shoulder i gave it # stars because i wish it had a back or side pouch to store the plug
this is a good buy sturdy , durable , and plenty of room i like that the outside is textured the inside lining is kinda cheap looking to me , but that 's not a deal breaker overall , good bag
this is a well-built bag and it rides well many convenient pockets with nice lining my dell # & # # ; laptop did not fit in the laptop sleeve but does fit in the main compartment i 'm satisfied with this as it still suits my needs but it would be nice if the laptop sleeve were just a half-inch larger or so
took it on my euro trip and it was great looks good , great quality and very practical not too bulky and has a lot of pockets the only thing is that it could be more water resistant not sure what they claim , but that would have been nice
i do n't normally like to say negative things however , the pack ripped during the first week of school we had the same exact pack for two school years & it stood up so i 'm not sure if it 's a manufacturing issue & possibly the fabric was old & weakened as it is a model which is no longer available & this was the only one i could find anywhere online i do n't blame the vendor but i was very disappointed & a little irritated the ordering & shipping process was timely i would still recommend & perhaps even order again from this vendor
i bought this to replace my # year old 's jansport big student -lrb- which is <unk> good shape -rrb- the reason we picked the <unk> was because of its roominess my son does not like going to his locker in between classes , so he carries everything in his backpack ... which weighs around # lbs the jansport pack is still in good shape after # yrs use , but the zippers are strained and he wanted a little more room when i pulled the ogio bag out , i was dismayed by its thinness the bottom seems to have no reinforcements at all -- in fact , it feels like a wind breaker now , this could be some amazing , <unk> material that will hold up to the abuse of a <unk> , so i guess we will have to wait and see what happens when <unk> <unk> in the fall i will try to post a follow up then
this is a huge bag , almost exactly what i 'm looking for it is n't full of straps and elastic bands that get in the way it is clean on the outside and simple i 'd even be happy if it did n't have the water bottle pocket on the outside the only thing i do n't like about it is how the compartments are sized i wanted the large overall pack , but the big part of the bag has a divider separating the largest part of the bag into two , smaller compartments that do n't really work well for me the front compartment is sized <unk> large too i think it 'd be great if all you wanted to do was put books and a few accessories in it however , i wanted it to carry all my gym clothes and lunch for work while riding my bike scissors will fix this problem though and overall if you are looking for a large , huge backpack this is the biggest i 've come across
this backpack is stylish , lightweight , and holds a lot my son is using it for college and it holds all the books , laptop , calculator , and food he is very pleased with the backpack and would recommend it
purchased this backpack for my son who seems to carry an excessive amount of stuff to and from school each day never purchased anything from this brand previously after a couple months of use , it seems to be durable it 's extremely roomy the compartments are nicely sized we 're really happy with this purchase
i really like this bag ... plenty of pockets and it is large enough to hold everything i need for school and travel it does get pretty heavy when i load it down so the wide cushioning on the straps comes in handy
this is a great backpack it has a ton of room , which is great for me as a college student it is nicely made , cute , and comfortable i like the extra padding on the back and straps i also think the little mini pocket on the top is nice it 's easily accessible and convenient
was looking for a laptop bag that had enough room to fit all the other equipment i needed this thing has space and has definitely held up over time no issues with any zippers , etc . only wish that the straps / back was slightly more padded
this back pack is nice , but i am not impressed the storage capacity is moderate , but the front pockets does not have enough pockets to store pens and other necessities further more , the divisions within the bag take up a lot of space considering the moderate amount of room in the bag on the plus side , the bag is a comfortable fit and well padded however , something that was n't thought about in its design is that the zippers are extra large , resulting in a person wearing the bag `` jingling `` every time they move around this is actually quite annoying find a different bag
the overall look of this pack is good but the interior is somewhat lacking it 's minimalist regarding storage space organization ... not enough little pockets on the inside comfort is actually quite good overall well made and durable but the lack of internal organization is disappointing
but not meant to carry heavy stuff i bought mine not # months ago and it already has a wear at one of the stitches also a strange design at the <unk> very comforting for your lower back
at first , i think my daughter was very happy with this she opted for quality instead of looks but she figured out she did n't get either she 's a freshman in college and thought this backpack would withstand all of her books it ripped right around thanksgiving and dumped her books , pens , and everything else , in the middle of
it is a very spacious and comfy backpack well padded and useful pockets , for the very right purpose i like it and would recommend it as a very good
this is a lightweight , compact and space savvy backpack it feels comfortable on , even carrying a good bit of weight my macbook pro fit safely -lrb- and securely -rrb- in the inner laptop pocket and the many zippered areas made it easy to keep items organized and accessible i felt like my computer was safe -lrb- and undamaged -rrb- when i was <unk> it on and off my shoulder and back and forth to the ground , as you tend to do with backpacks though i ca n't confirm , since it 's brand new , this pack looks <unk> , and seems like it will stand up to wear quite well this will easily hold the books and stuff you need for class , the office or an overnight trip
this backpack is not only rugged enough for regular use , but also looks good to boot in addition , it is comfortable enough for extended carrying the padded straps help in that regard the capacity is more than sufficient for up to # inches , and my # . # `` fits in very snugly some <unk> features include a handy detachable key holder -lrb- in the outermost pocket -rrb- ; a lightly padded media player pouch with earphone pass through ; and a lanyard catch right by the carry handle by <unk> of its location , the notebook compartment is also very well protected indeed what i miss are zippered inner pockets - handy for storing loose items -lrb- like parking meter change -rrb- that tend to slosh about otherwise while a bit more padding in the carry handle would have been appreciated , it really shines when in backpack mode
it is very sturdy , solid build . it fits up to # & # # ; laptops and a lot of paper folders it is great for office materials and equipment not as good for outdoor backpacking since it does not take many bulky items
i only have a # & # # ; laptop and it hardly fit in this bag with my other items i would expect a laptop # inches smaller to fit with loads of space but i just do n't feel as though there is enough breathing room for it
the targus brilliance ii backpack for # `` laptops is a nice product it seems to protect my laptop well and has enough pockets to hold a few ` extras ' , like my mouse and mouse pad i would n't drop this bag from a second story window and expect my laptop to be <unk> , but for basic use , it does its job personally , i would n't use this as a multi-purpose bag for school , b/c adding books to the weight of the laptop would not be great for my back , but as a computer bag alone , it works it has a sleek design and well padded shoulder straps it is moderately sized and holds enough to get through the day if you are looking for a backpack to carry your laptop in from point a to point b and do n't like messenger style bags , this is a nice option
i love this bag it 's very light and pack all the stuff i need for those who are annoyed by the jingling of the zipper tabs , just tuck one in so that only one zipper tab is out this significantly reduces the jingling while you walk i also enjoy walking and this tip pretty much did the trick for me
i purchased this backpack to use as a carry-on for flying this backpack is bigger and stronger than i thought it would be i can fit my laptop and my dslr with one lens and some accessories , plus some books , clothes , and still have room for <unk> stuff the straps are strong and padded and so is the part that touches your back the bottom of the bag is clearly a stronger material than the rest of the bag , that i assume to be more water resistant too it is exactly what i was trying to find there are n't a ton of inside pockets in the larger sections , but the front pocket has organization and there are side pouches with elastic tops as well that would actually be the only improvement : more inside pockets
got this bag on clearance at the radio <unk> i work at and is the best backpack i ever owned it 's durable and comfortable to wear , but i actually use it as a <unk> bag and i must say it serves me well i can fit up to # books and # three ring binder notebooks inside and i usually put my headphones in the middle pouch and pencils/pens in the small so whether you 're looking to carry around a backpack for just a laptop , books , and hiking accessories this bag carries it all targus you 've definitely exceeded your expectations on this bag
this book bag is definitely big enough for carrying all your books and there 's nice padding on the back so you do n't completely kill your back with all the weight it holds laptops very well ; however , there is no separate compartment for laptops so you have to put your books in there with your laptop if this bothers you , then i probably would recommend buying a separate case otherwise , it 's perfect it holds everything you could possibly need and there 's a second pocket for smaller notebooks
i was looking for a bag that i can take with me on trips to carry on the plane with me i had a flimsy laptop case that served its purpose , but always feared it was getting banged up , even while carrying it myself , plus it had no other storage capacity than the laptop itself so when this became available through vine , i immediately grabbed it and found it is exactly what i needed it has plenty of support for the laptop to stay in place and that it feels comfortable while carrying in addition there is room for other goodies to carry on the plane with me like a book or other items that i may need to bring with me the construction and design is straightforward like any backback it does not hold , perhaps , as much as , say , ones people use to go to school and carry a load of textbooks , but there is sufficient room to pack what you need after the laptop this backpack is for # inch monitor size laptops , but also works with # or # inch as well -lrb- i am using a # inch macbook -rrb-
bought this for my husband who works in construction he needed a backpack that would protect his computer while out on job sites the padding is great for protection it also has a lot of room for all the paperwork that he has to do while out on these projects it holds everything that you need while being out of the office i would recommend this for sure
after using it for a couple of days i find the targus brilliance ii laptop backpack very comfortable on my shoulders and back the materials quality is good , the zippers are good quality , and the look is quite elegant the laptop sleeve has a lot of protection front , rear and at the bottom , which is great as a whole the backpack is well designed and with three ample storage areas you can carry whatever you want records , books , and notebooks in one compartment and gym clothes or extra attire for later as for extra pockets you can stuff them with a tablet , mp # player , cel , water bottles -lrb- # -rrb- away from electronics you can fit a device of # . # `` x # . # `` x # . # `` and above all a limited lifetime warranty which is great way of telling that targus is sure of its quality my advice is if you are looking for a good quality fairly priced backpack get this one if you are looking to waste money on a trendy expensive brand go someplace else this is a backpack for people looking for good quality if not excellent at a fair price
this targus backpack is lightweight , yet sturdy my # inch laptop fits in fine and there 's room for gear i like the extra compartments , which are handy for those extra items recently i traveled by plane to another city and i took along my targus , but not my laptop since my trip was only # days , i packed my clothes , toothbrush , etc . in the backpack and did n't bother with a bigger carryon i was so pleased that the backpack fit easily under the seat , because the plane was full and there was n't room in the overhead bins by the time i <unk> after i reached my destination , i had to do a lot of walking the nicely padded straps on the targus backpack were comfortable and it was very easy for me to carry looks , sturdiness , capacity without being oversized -- this backpack is a winner
it was everything that i thought it would be and i love it i would recommend this to anyone who will use it on a daily basis , strong and sturdy and looks nice too
i initially rated this as # stars , <unk> the fifth star until i used it well , one of the zippers broke -lrb- came off the track -rrb- upon first use extremely poor quality for an expensive product from a well known vendor
bought this because of the retractable wheels pro 's : # retractable system works good straps can be hidden which is good as you will not be dragging them on the ground retractable system is heavy when wheels are drawn , the backpack falls forward does not fit in small regional gets , with two laptops -lrb- had no problem with two laptops with tumi the leather handel cracked and happened after the return policy ended would not recommend
very well built but just impractical , the handle storage area and wheel extension is a great idea but leaves almost no room in the bag for storage main zipper angle is awkward i had great intentions with this bag , but the first time i loaded it for travel i knew it was a non starter please consider a redesign
i really want to like this backpack , considering what i paid for it however , despite study construction there are some flaws that make it a <unk> disappointing to use it is unstable - falls over -lrb- forward -rrb- when its full and the handle is extended the pouch in the back -lrb- behind the laptop pouch -rrb- not well designed . the handle telescopes into that space , and create an awkwardly shaped compartment , useless for putting books so , its the laptop in the laptop pouch , and the remaining space is unusable except for soft objects , which can mold into the space i usually use it for a few weeks , get disgusted with it , put it away for a few months , only to try it again , hoping for a better experience then the cycle <unk> if they could solve the tip over and back compartment problems , this would be a # star bag
while i love victorinox for its quality & service , unfortunately this rolling backpack is huge and looks like luggage i was really looking for a rolling laptop backpack i could take to work this would make me look like i 'm moving out sadly , i had to return it
no issues for the product quality a little large for most people but if you carry a lot of things with you , it 's the perfect backpack very expensive for the category but really good built quality and very nice ideas / solutions for a laptop backpack many pockets inside to let your gadgets safety -lrb- external hd , laptop , smartphones , mice , power adapters and cords -rrb-
i was able to fit my # & # # ; macbook pro , and adding a large leather folder -lrb- zipper -rrb- , plus a jacket at the back of the bag , without any problem the backpack is wonderfully designed and if it gets too heavy , then i can simply take out the roller handle
nicely constructed bag , but this is strictly for an ipad only any talk of fitting your # & # # ; macbook pro in it , along with the things you also need such as a charger and a pen , are <unk> exaggerated however , if all you need is your ipad , a couple of sheets of printed paper , and a pen , then this is your bag the padded sections will keep your ipad secure , and the other side offers some storage for your pens and work id fitting much else in is a challenge for me
i have owned other timbuk # bags in the past and i am a big fan of the brand in my experience the quality has been excellent this bag is no exception it is a great size for a laptop and accessories , <unk> being <unk> large unfortunately there is n't much padding for the laptop compartment this was a deal breaker for me
i like it but it 's not worth the price it will work until i can find something better at which point i will hand it down to my # year old son pretty stylish for a laptop bag
i dig the water resistant material , great design and well made i would love if it had some sort of small but expandable pocket that would hold a water bottle i would defiantly buy this bag
fits a # in laptop and ipad i love it ! great bag , but beware it 's a bit tight fit if you have a laptop and ipad plus chargers not much room to spare overall thought , i love this bag it 's not too big and not
this bag is really small i carry an # & # # ; macbook air and a mini ipad they fit nicely but add a notebook or two and its pretty full small size and capacity mean that it is light very nice bag but make sure you are not planning on carrying a lot of stuff
i have been using this bag for a week now and love it very comfortable to wear , stores a good deal of items including the capability to store a full sized laptop , netbook and tablet all at once with plenty of room to spare easy to shift the bag and weight to where it needs to be to make walking easier doubled with a cross strap , this bag will remain secure for more rigorous activity the bag is made from very durable materials , so it will last for a long time it also provides just enough padding in the areas that count then the <unk> amounts of spaces to store things make this bag ideal for anybody carrying electronics around and wants a greatly priced , lightweight , bag solution
i was a little concerned ordering a `` small `` case that i might not fit everything i wanted in it , but with a new macbook air # `` did n't want an over sized case either this fits it with some room to spare , has a separate slot for my ipad , and has a decent sized second pocket to hold chargers and what not plenty of room for the things i need on a day to day basis in a small package i 'm pretty sure it 's bigger on the inside somehow
replaced my timbuk # medium messenger bag with this one for a few reasons first , i carry a smaller laptop now , a hp spectre xt this bag is smaller , but holds my # . # laptop with or without a sleeve i keep the laptop in the sleeve for extra padding , plus i can just take it out in addition , there are seperate compartments for the <unk> and for everything else plus they open with zippers , rather then having to rip open velcro during a lecture i can keep slim chargers in the external pouches , which are under a flap secured with metal clips rather then velcro or plastic clips reliably holds # classes worth of materials . # spiral notebooks , a big textbook , several folders i can carry either my # inch or my # inch tablet in addition to the laptop
we purchased this for our son who is currently serving an <unk> mission in new york city he replaced his backpack with this messenger bag and he says he loves it
i have a # . # & # # ; laptop , and it fits wonderfully in this bag there 's also plenty of room for my kindle , power cords , and any accessories within the laptop pocket with a laptop , it is a little snug to fit much else , and as other reviewers have said , there is n't much expansion room in this bag the ability to unzip it and lay it flat is really nice for travel , although you do have to be careful of what you put in the outside pocket when you do that i use it daily for work , without my laptop , and i use the laptop pocket for documents and folders , which works out really well i have a small umbrella , power cords , brush , and some personal items in the front pocket and it 's not tight at all overall , i 'm really happy with this bag , it 's a really nice size if you do n't want to carry the <unk> with you , and the shoulder pad on the strap is very nice
i purchased this bag a couple of days ago and wow the quality is off the charts , the storage is great , and its a stylish bag it 's not your run of the mill , plain black laptop case it fits my # . # `` widescreen laptop like a glove it has separate storage for my tablet and power cords the only downside to this bag is the straps that connect to flap to the two side pouches they come loose very easily and no matter how much you tighten them down , they still come loose not really a big deal as the velcro keeps the flap closed well also , the padding is not really much for the laptop/tablet pouch , again , no big deal unless you plan to throw the bag all over the place this is a great , high quality bag and worth every penny
overall , i 'm satisfied with this i take in on # mile bike rides each way to work -lrb- ~ # mile round trip -rrb- still get back sweat but not as bad as my old backpack , but aside from getting away from using a bag , i realize that will still be an issue the bag is a little long , though i 'm only # ' # . i like it - have n't tested it in the rain yet , but hopefully it keeps my stuff dry
this is my first timbuk # purchase and i like it the bag is well made , feels sturdy i wanted a simple , usable bag and this is exactly that does n't have too many compartments that i would never end up using anyway the laptop compartment is not padded on the inside , but it is slightly raised from the bottom so there is no risk of hitting it if dropping the bag on a hard surface i use it for a # & # # ; laptop with no sleeve the only thing i 'd change is add an extra bottle sleeve on the side the bag only has one , not enough for a coffee <unk> and water bottle
based on the size of this thing it is not made for # . # inch laptop fit my wifes # inch mac book pro in this thing -lrb- with some extra force ... do n't by it for a # inch either -rrb- affordable and does the job
i bought this despite the reviews i read this is so thin its not even funny it is like a joke that this will protect my macbook pro the memory foam sinks in and is super thin this is no <unk> <unk> bed do not buy this product pay $ # more for a better one this really is a joke of a sleeve
when i got this case for my # inch macbook pro , i adored it it fit comfortably into my backpack , and did n't scratch the edges of my laptop now <unk> into the second month of having it , it 's the thinnest thing i have ever seen for a laptop case my laptop has yet to overheat , or get truly hot - but the foam in the case seems to be disintegrating - especially around the edges , where i feel i need the protection most though i loved it at first , i will not be buying this item again - and wo n't recommend it to those i know
great case initially with good memory foam to protect the laptop but i 've had it for just over # years now and suddenly there are big spots on each end on all four sides where the memory foam is just gone ... like it <unk> or something the spots started a little while ago and were small but they are definitely growing and i 'm worried the case wont provide enough protection eventually in looking for another case , though , i ca n't find one that beats this price so i may just get another one ... but with the knowledge that they are only good for # years
ships really fast which is good and it 's nice and soft with cushioning so it 'll protect your laptop but it does n't fit my laptop at all there 's an inch of space all around and my laptop slides back and forth between the sleeve i have a macbook pro # inch so i do n't understand why it does n't fit . = / this product could have gotten a full five stars but i 'm disappointed about the extra space
i guess it did its job for a $ # sleeve ; it is basically a black cloth covering what appears to be a little bit of foam the case wore out after just a couple months and so the quality is n't the greatest i would definitely go with the case logic brand sleeve over this
whenever i put my macbook pro in this sleeve , it seemed like it always came out with tiny scratches plus , the material is not actually very <unk> ... if i pretend to drop this sleeve with my laptop inside at any height , i just do n't feel comfortable it just seems like a <unk> sleeve , which is totally inappropriate for something as valuable as a macbook i got a case logic instead and i 'm much happier with it
this is the second case like this i have bought , the memory foam is thin , but strong . i always add padding on the inside of these though just in case
great case for the ipad i like it because it shuts off the ipad when you close . it is very sturdy . only problem was figuring out how to get cover to stand by itself
it is too tight to fit my # macbook air # as a result , i can not even pull out my laptop when i push it into this sleeve i 'm returning it to amazon and asking for a refund
one corner seems misshapen and curved up to a point instead of <unk> out like the other i was n't a fan of the material and the tab that you pull to remove the laptop , while clever , seemed to get in the way of snapping the clasp on the open end of the sleeve the corner would n't have been that bad if it was straight but it really put me off for some reason which is why i returned it
overall it is a nice sleeve case but it is little small for macbook air # `` and requires you to push it hard if you want to close the top
from reading the reviews , you 'd think this is the thinnest , easiest , lightest case to be had for the macbook air well , it 's thin , but not super thin it 's small , but not super small , and it 's light , but not super light but , and this is a big but ... it does not fit the latest mba # `` from mid # ... it sticks out on the top by about # inch , and the tab does not shut this is great if you have an older mba -- but the newest one does not fit
i 've used it a few time and so far do n't see any scratches on my laptop the best part of this sleeve is the <unk> tab that gives you easy access to your laptop when you need to take it out , which by the way , is a creative idea i have n't seen lately as for the actual fit , it fits just right ... not too tight no too loose i have n't taken it out of the country or <unk> yet to see it durability , but we 'll see item is made in china , but quality is decent leather is smooth and does n't seem to scratch easy
i got this case for my # `` # macbook air and it fits perfectly and protects the computer when i 'm on the road the case almost never needs to come out of my backpack 's laptop section i just pull on the tab to pull the mba out and it 's done then i just push the mba firmly back into the case and close the cover the case provides good additional surface protection for the mba and is also a stylish case to tote around if you 're only going to be moving around with the computer the fit was initially a little tight but the case seems to have expanded a bit after having been on the road for a while , so the mba now fits the case perfectly i 'm happy with it
wish they allowed the leather to come out more and cover the entire macbook air . right now about # in is exposed , and thats how my macbook was damaged . otherwise , really good
`` i just buy mba # `` in # and i was looking for sleeve for this product this is absolutely what i was looking for it is gorgeous do n't spend your money on stupid things this is perfect ! thank you so much for this product i really guaranty that you will like it there is a <unk> bag which is so small do n't for get to take it out
i like this sleeve it protects my macbook air so i can carry it with another laptop in a standard laptop bag or just carry it alone when i first got the sleeve , it seemed as though the macbook air did not insert far enough into the case for the tab to easily snap shut after about a month i realized that this was because there was a pouch of <unk> jammed into the bottom of the sleeve after removing that , i found the sleeve is a perfect fit the sleeve is not made of leather but it is stiff and protects the macbook air from scratches and bumps well the eject tab works well you can charge the computer while it is in the sleeve because one side is exposed i have n't found anything else as easy-to-use and functional to protect the macbook air as this sleeve
wanted something sleek and sexy for my macbook air , definitely made the right choice i have a # `` # model , this thing fits it like a glove looks amazing , could not be happier classy , sexy , simple , and functional if you 're <unk> at all , do n't , just buy it well worth it
one of the reasons i own a macbook air is due to it 's <unk> this makes it perfect for travel , which i do a lot of this case keeps that slender profile perfectly it is a tight fit , but the pull tab makes <unk> the laptop a breeze it seems very well crafted and is exceptionally stylish i 've only owned the case for a few hours and am impressed
if you think this is gon na look like a b & w newspaper with some color images , you 're wrong ! ! i got it and it looks all <unk> , i really did n't like it they should put a real picture of it . =
i did n't get why all laptop pouches should be $ # i always trust reviews at amazon , so i purchased this it looked fine on my monitor and all the reviews were great but i just got this , and it looks really cheap and the padding is quite thin and the part along the edges are very sparse i do n't really feel that my laptop would be safe in this pouch , then a backpack , just put it hard on the floor i think i should return it
i like the newspaper pattern of this sleeve bag , but the material is low quality it 's a little bit bigger for mac , so if you have a macbook pro , look for another case once again , the pattern is great , but
i know you get what you pay for ... but the printing on this thing was very blurry for something that 's supposed to look like newspaper , a sharp print is kind of important , i think i had to send it back because of the size -lrb- oops -rrb- , but if i had n't gotten the wrong size , i would probably have returned it for the design
i initially bought this for my # ' macbook pro but like other reviews have mentioned , it is too loose to fit the design is cute but it 's poorly made it 's a fair value at $ # . # though i decided to keep it because it fits my mom # ' lenovo touchscreen ideapad laptop like a glove
i was excited to receive my laptop case that looks like a newspaper but not excited to find out that it is not the same as the on in the picture mine has weird abstract pictures and <unk> mixed <unk> on it but over all its a okay product as long as it protects my laptop
i ordered this sleeve for my macbook air and although there were mixed reviews decided to go for it of course i received a sleeve that did not look like the one from the picture but i knew that was most likely going to happen its alright and it is still a unique sleeve so refer to the pictures i will post if you want to see what the sleeve looks like
i saw this case and really liked it and although it had mixed reviews i decided to see for myself so i ordered it and was so sorry i did it did n't arrive on time , a day late , but that is n't even what upset me the laptop case advertised was not the same as the one i received the newsprint on the case was n't in english , but in italian and the cover did n't look at all like what the seller was advertising
