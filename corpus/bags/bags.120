i would expected better from samsonite i have had this model for only five months and the wheels are almost <unk> and on top of that they make a terrible noise it sounds as if i put a piece of plastic in a bicycle tire 's <unk> while its spinning i would suggest you get a bag with real inline <unk> wheels and trash the soft wheel bags
this was my # th samsonite business one mobile office , having worn out the last # over the years due to world travel i expected the same quality on this one as well but was quickly disappointed the plastic zippers started to fail almost immediately as did some of the stitching it 's as though their manufacturer finally figured out just how cheap they can make them would have returned it but i had to hit the road as soon as it arrived now after a few months i 'm looking at replacing it with another brand i really hate to write a bad review of this bag as i always loved it , but it appears that samsonite 's qc has taken a turn for the worse on this product very sad that i can no longer recommend this bag to anyone
i strongly agree with <unk> b on the wheels the bag itself is <unk> but the wheels are pathetic they seem to last about # months for me i have had the wheels replaced by a samsonite repair center three times at my expense - the last time i asked them to use harder <unk> wheels i 'm not sure what they used but they did n't last any longer that repair center is no longer available and not the closest one is over # miles away the wheels on my garment bag are wearing like iron so i just do n't get it do not buy this bag if you plan to roll it much
first , the space <unk> for the personal travel items is very small and not <unk> there are no zippered pouches to hold toiletries or small items second , the quality and the workmanship is pretty bad inside the bag this buyer is dissapointed
very nice bag , holds a lot of items other than the lap top it truly is a mobile office but , the darn portable bag inside of the mobile office is way too small , its useless i called <unk> # x and each time was told to call another number i got tired of the run around i do n't know what it is supposed to fit , but it does not fit a hp # . # `` laptop i do n't think it will fit a # `` laptop either oh well , so much for samsonite i still have the mobile office and the portable bag that is way too small
i 'm torn ; i love this bag -lrb- already had one -rrb- , but am starting to have issues with one of the zippers sticking in a few spots it is still a great bag for travel and fits nicely under the seat in most airplanes rolls well and fits a lot of stuff
i ordered this as a replacement for my existing contour pro # the picture looks right , but the product shipped is far , far inferior and is missing a whole compartment there used to be a separate top loading compartment for the laptop and included an additional sleeve this one <unk> both compartments into one and <unk> the sleeve i was very disappointed if kensington is going to create a different bag , then give it a different product number and a different name - like contour # amateur
this is the same product i ordered three years ago , but the quality is terrible , a cheap knock-off of the original this new version is a real <unk> the original version of this product was excellent reinforced stitching , industrial strength zippers , quality fabric , etc . this current version wo n't last more than a few weeks of hard travel someone at kensington has sold out the brand for a quick buck i 'll be shopping for another brand
i had an old computer case that came with my gateway notebook loved it , but the straps broke . the new <unk> case seems sturdy enough , but definitely does n't have the number of pockets and great layout my old case had for the money , i 'm content with it
well designed bag with lots of room for extra stuff tough and rugged with high quality materials throughout great bag if your are taking your computer on the <unk> trail sled dog <unk> however , if you do n't have a sled you are in real trouble the bag weighs more than my # `` laptop if i add any paperwork i feel like i 'm lugging around my office desk with <unk> the good thing is that the big heavy bag comes with a seperate lighter bag for the computer on local trips i throw my computer in that and carry a seperate notebook
i 've been using the my contour pro since mid june of # i 've mainly used it on my college campus , and i must say it 's been great i can easily fit my laptop , and books in fact the pocket at the end of the bag -lrb- which is curved -rrb- is perfect for books my only complaint would be for a longer strap so you could <unk> the bag across your chest -lrb- for # ' guys it feels awkward -rrb- great deal at ~ # usd
i bought a toshiba p # -s # which has a # `` widescreen display this case lists being capable of holding a # `` lcd , but not mine it fits ... but just barely after having a laptop previously , i keep a cloth cover over the lcd lid to protect the top of the case from surface scratches when i slide it in the case , it just barely <unk> the internal `` carry case `` i can feel the stress to the zipper if i close the internal portable case i can close the external zipper fairly easily , but frustrating if it does n't close easy other than that , i really like this case and will keep it it is very durable , comfortable , nice looking , and has plenty of storage space overall , this is a good buy
amazon says it holds # . # `` reviews on other sites -lrb- for less money , but i trust amazon -rrb- says it 'll hold a # . # `` nope , not even close my other ibook # . # `` barely makes the cut too bad ` cuz it seems like exactly the material i want -lrb- tougher than neoprene -rrb- description should be more <unk> as it was recommended by amazon for the $ # . # `` macbook pro i bought from them , too
it does the job but is n't anything super i would prefer neoprene in the end i purchased a manhattan <unk> bag that has a neoprene sleeve built in this case works for me when i put it in any other luggage
before i purchased the shuttle i was unaware of the size of the product my laptop computer is a bit small for the shuttle as the product is large enough to carry a slightly bigger laptop i like the <unk> like straps on the inside and the ability to stash papers in the folder within finding the perfect fit for a <unk> laptop will be difficult the shuttle is sturdy and i like the durable <unk> / whatever that the product is designed with the zipper is easy to move and the color is black in and out a small <unk> <unk> in the upper area serves as a place to hold the product when it is carrying your computer i am satisfied with the product it is the closest thing to my imagined <unk>
i bought this product a week ago it 's a good product but the seller should put the important information that is `` computer compartment dimensions `` for this product , it is # . # x # . # x # . # in unfortunately , it did n't fit for my # . # in . wide screen , it 's hurt i will not buy this product if i knew a `` computer compartment dimensions `` before
the accommodating dimensions of this unit are wrong . laying a ruler flat in the bottom of this case measures barely over # inches not close to the # . # advertised so this will not work for what i need
this is a nice sturdy case for the larger screen laptops -lrb- # `` -rrb- i previously purchased one for myself , and then bought another when i purchased another laptop for my sister it has many compartments for pens , papers , etc . , and a velcro strap that holds your laptop secure the only negative feedback i can give is the material it is made of likes to collect lint but that is easily removed by a lint brush
just like the title states inspiron # fits like a glove , and it 's the one piece of travel gear that has really lasted i travel all over the country , and this bag has taken all sorts of abuse i have n't had a single issue with the craftsmanship my one issue is the velcro on the front flap if you put anything of decent size in the front , forget about that thing staying closed if not for that little <unk> , this thing would be perfect
i purchased a # `` screen notebook as a present to myself i then went on a hunt for the perfect case i was surprised to find how many cases are available i was n't satisfied with any of the cases i saw until i saw the samsonite xl notebook case it is just perfect i love the way it is made it is very stylish everything i need to carry with me fits ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! it has alot of cushioning which is important it is well made and not as bulky as some notebook cases are
it 's just what i was looking for it 's made of a sturdy material and holds extra -lrb- enought room for all the cords and mouse -rrb- it stores extra materials also i am very please with my
i was very excited to get this bag since i travel frequently about the fifth time i used it , the shoulder strap completely ripped apart i only had my laptop and a few miscellaneous objects such as pens and a notepad in the case i am very disappointed in the quality i will be contacting the manufacturer in hopes of exchanging the case
after # weeks of use the shoulder strap tore right off from the bag i had to super glue it back on and it looks awful the zippers are also not good quality if they are completely unzipped , the will sometimes not zip back up properly and leave a big hole exposing the contents if what is in my bag would not recommend purchasing this
excellent bag for a quick trip through airport security as you do n't have to remove your computer ... the one drawback is that it stands too tall to fit under the seat in front of you
this bag is okay if the lap top would just fit but it is too hard to close the zipper i have an asus # . # `` and it is very thin this bag was just too tight for the laptop now i have to return it and wait look for something larger i like the leather handles and the multiple storage compartments but i 'm sure targus has something better
the price is right i like all the various pockets . it is lighter than expected , and the shoulder strap is comfortable the best part is the butterfly opening for air travel you do n't have to take your laptop out just simply zip the laptop compartment open and slide thru the security belt then zip up again and your done the tsa likes this bag as well i highly recommend this bag if you travel alot
this is a good bag for a smaller computer , it is at a good price and has a good number of pockets travel friendly , # large sections . # smaller pockets can be attached to other luggage handle via straps
there 's not a lot of bells and whistles with this bag , it is n't super stylish but it is n't too heavy , it seems pretty durable and it is great for airline travel i would recommend it for frequent <unk> who do n't have to carry too many paper files along with them
bought this bag to fit my asus g # <unk> # . # -inch laptop in my opinion , targus has always made the best computer bags , and this one is no exception it 's built well and has lots of space for both your widescreen laptop and plenty of other <unk> , including my own laptop 's giant power brick and good news for those of you skeptical about whether this thing works as advertised through airport security checkpoints it does work you do not have to take your computer out of the case , but rather simply unzip the & # # ; clamshell & # # ; center and lay it vertical on the <unk> belt i did this with no questions asked through both lax and the <unk> <unk> airport in <unk> -lrb- one giant airport and one <unk> airport -rrb- perfect for frequent flyers
we had just seen one of these <unk> briefcases in a high-end luggage shop for about # times the cost this one serves the purpose beautifully it 's slim , lightweight , yet holds everything needed for regular business travel
this targus checkpoint-friendly # . # `` air traveler laptop case - black <unk> # us is by far the best laptop case i 've ever bought it has so many pockets for all your odds and ends and plenty of space for magazines , folders and papers it looks and feels very durable and will last for years i like the way it opens up for check points would by again if needed and would surely recommend all that need a great case
had it for a few months now and love it . carry a few books and a laptop everyday and have n't seen any wear on it yet tsa does n't <unk> when taking it through security . comfortable shoulder straps . good amount of space inside . great value
it was too small for my # . # & # # ; laptop , otherwise it met my high expectations i had another similar targus case supplied by a former employer , and i was very pleased with that one
if you are looking for a very simple laptop bag then you may want to consider a different bag i needed a laptop bag that allowed me to carry multiple items including an additional ipad this is the first case i have purchased that has enough room and pockets to hold everything i need to carry it holds everything securely , is well made , and looks great
nice package and works great at airport security the bag is quite expandable , so with only a few items , it remains compact , however when a lot of added material is needed , it expands to accommodate been using it for # months on a daily basis and no issues with the durability so far easy to fit under the seat when overhead compartments are filled
i needed a new bag for a new job , and i have had good targus products in the past i searched through all the offerings , and for a # & # # ; laptop case , this was the best of all those available i love the variety of pockets , and it contains every portable electronic device i need it to hold i especially love the tsa-friendly laptop space for the price , this is a great choice
i like this bag it 's not too bulky and big like all the other laptop bags , but it is still big enough to give you enough room to carry a couple of books along it 's light and easy to carry around
kensington obviously took a bad lesson from the american <unk> industry this rolling bag was perfect now the quality is garbage and the materials used <unk> the mind i have owned three of these and had to return this recent purchase as the product is no longer usable now i am stuck trying to find a decent rolling bag
got this bag and loved it could not <unk> what all the & # # ; # star & # # ; rated reviews were about i did notice the plastic handle was a little wobbly however , for almost # months the bag was wonderful yesterday , while navigating a small <unk> , the plastic handle simply broke apart no amount of fiddling will fix it it is now worthless the # star reviews are correct , piece of garbage
i have used this case for # days and the wheels are already wearing out the telescoping arm is a joke it does not stay up when you want it to and it will not <unk> when trying to lower the handle very poor quality
this was such a great bag ! ! ! ! i had my bag for about six years until i broke the zippers off -lrb- very heavy use kensington switched vendors and this is not the bag you see in the pictures it does not have the nice hard plastic on the zippers - it 's just the metal now also , less zippered pockets in the bag do n't get me wrong , for people who never had the old bag it 's not a huge loss it 's still a nice bag , but just much cheaper kensington really needs to update their picture because it 's not the same bag hey kensington ! ! ! it 's bait and switch you <unk> ! ! !
i love the design of this bag , for my purposes it is just about perfect however the materials used in it 's construction have to be the cheapest on the planet the telescopic arm wobbles , and feels like will break any second not only is the fabric cheap , thin and crinkly , it smells like horrible chemicals the smell took about # minutes to <unk> my entire office i know someone who had the previous version , which has an almost identical design and they warned me that the new ones just did not hold a <unk> to the older ones it seems that kensington decided to <unk> the bag with cheaper materials and <unk> to make more money and in the process they ruined what by all accounts was a awesome laptop roller until kensington returns to the old materials , construction and design , i would stay away from this bag
i should have listened to other reviewers a friend has this <unk> bag , but bought it years ago there is definitely a difference between his and mine his has held up very well , it 's sturdy , the arm does n't wiggle and it 's clearly taken abuse and is still in great shape mine looks good , has a good amount of room for all the files and two computers i travel with , but after only a few weeks i 'm worried the arm is going to break off i 'll continue to use it for the time it holds up , but am saving up for a much better bag
this bag is a royal pain nine out of # times the telescoping handle would not extend to its full range causing much frustration on my part i expected it to be a much smaller bag , but it was the same size as all of my other computer bags the wheels also caused some problems but were not near as frustrating as the handle was i would not recommend this bag to anyone
had this bag # months with daily usage . . the button on top of the handle does n't always push the rubber stoppers in , if forced eventually the rubber disappears and the handle does n't stay open plus the handle wobbles to the right and left the wheels are nice , but the bag is a little large to go under any airline seats easily i did get it in the overhead bins nicely even on the embraer aircraft -lrb- commuter jet -- not sure if these folks will replace the bag
the bag is a great size and the wheels work great , but the telescoping arm is a b * <unk> to retract you really have to ram it down <unk> , and <unk> i ca n't get the bottom one to go down at all
i purchased this due to a back injury and the need to transport teaching materials i walk # blocks to the bus each day the functionality of the case is great and the narrow wheels may work fine in airports , but they wear very quickly on concrete sidewalks the narrow profile <unk> the weight onto a small contact area my bag experienced serious wheel wear in only two weeks of use still , i liked the case and contacted kensington about replacement wheels they do not sell replacement parts , and the wheels are <unk> not wanting to have to replace the case every # weeks , i returned it and purchased a case that was not as functional , but that had standard <unk> size wheels if you are limited to using this case on smooth flooring or occasional sidewalk use , it is fine
i liked this product enough to buy a second one after the handle of my first one broke but , when my second one had the same problem with the telescoping handle from day # , then i just sent the second one back
that kensington roller carrying case was my mistake i wanted a rolling brief case for office and class use this is a monster case more suitable as luggage for a plane trip too many pockets , too much padding , maybe needed for trips but not for light duty going to class holding folders and a few books it is well designed and well built but not for my needs it has been retired awaiting a long plane trip while i still carry my stuff in a brief case i am still looking for a bare bones rolling case with maybe two compartments and no padding or multiple small pockets
i bought this without seeing one the reviews were mixed , so i thought it would be ok to buy plus , the kensington name i recognize from other computer parts i have purchased well , the bag is nicely designed , but the quality is terrible from the zippers to the <unk> handle it 's made cheaply plus , the narrow plastic wheels are super noisy on cement you 'll sound like you are riding a cheap <unk> into the building i would have paid more and bought a different one had i known all this in advance
i recently went back to school and i needed a <unk> for my laptop because i got tired of the back pain caused by my other bag this one has worked out quite well i love bags with compartments and this one has quite a few i was able to find a spot for all my miscellaneous items i wish it could hold a few school books in addition to the laptop the handle sometimes feels a bit flimsy , but i 'm tough on equipment and bags and it 's holding out so far to my rough handling i do n't regret my purchase
make sure you board first if you own this bag it 's a good bag but if you travel on small regional jets it barely fits in the overhead and will absolutely not fit under some of the seats check into the kensington # it is smaller
i like almost everything about this back accept that the wheels have already started to fall apart and i 've only had it a month i walk about # blocks to work on normal sidewalks and one of the wheels has already started to fall apart it does look like i can replace them but i expected them to last longer
looks roomy and has ample space , but structure is flimsy the telescoping handle wobbles and does n't look like it will take a lot of wear i still have the previous model i bought in # , which has seen a lot of use i had to replace it as the nylon exterior is shredding and looks bad even after all those years of use , its structure is still in tact and stronger than the new version also , the wheels on the this new model are skimpy in comparison to the robust , thick wheels that still work great on older model a note to kensington : do n't change a good thing for change sake change for the better , not for some cheaper model or imitation of the original bring back the original and you 'll have at least this one happy customer
i love the case it works better than i hoped but they forgot to send the strap i reported the problem to <unk> and they said they would ship it to me i am still <unk> waiting i am sure it will come some day the bad news is that the support is in india and it 's just so hard to effectively communicate with their <unk> i would pay extra for american support that would be a real cool feature
we bought this bag so i could continue to bring my laptop and work files home and on the go during the last months of my <unk> we love this bag it 's sturdy , keeps my files , accessories and essentials organized and neat we 've rolled this bag through snow , ice , pavement , rough terrain it looks brand new the adjustable handle really makes this a bag for all this bag is deceptive , it looks compact , but holds it all we 're very happy
i greatly enjoy this notebook case it 's hard to find one that fits a # `` notebook computer these days lots of space , and its well organized telescoping handle , <unk> well through airports easy on hand grip , <unk> weight well and is <unk> strap does n't support weight well , <unk> to tear after one week of use all in all this is the best traveling case i 've had
this is my second kensington roller it is a great durable bag in the past . seems like the construction is similar , but time will tell if the zippers will hold up . looks and feels cheaper . will have to wait and see not sure why the change hopefully the reasoning was not purely cost
this has been a great case for travel - it has lots of space to stash things you need for a trip it can be heavy to carry , though , even with minimal -lrb- ie , computer only -rrb- cargo but it handles beautifully on the go and the handle tucks away when you do n't need it i 'd buy it again
i purchased this case after i was injured in a car accident it is hard for me to carry a heavy bag full of files , # inch laptop , and books now because of the stress on my neck and shoulders in fact , i tried to be fashionable at conference last month and used my dell bookbag instead boy was i sorry this bag more than delivers all it promises and that others have written about however , it gets # stars instead of # because the mesh used for the pockets -lrb- mouse , power cable , water bottle etc -rrb- is so easily ripped i try not to put anything in these holders if i can help it otherwise , the remaining <unk> of the case are pretty durable
i 'm generally happy with the bag it holds a lot of stuff , and there are plenty of pockets , `` cargo nets , `` and zippers for stashing the variety of things i need when i travel the biggest problem i 've had is that the retractable handle sometimes does n't extend all the way when it doens n't , i have to push it all the way down again in order to get it to extend it 's a pain , but not horrible the curved foam strip on the back between the wheels is also coming off , and needs to be glued back on this should n't happen in a bag i 've only had for # months
this is a great computer travel bag the handle is tall -lrb- great for me as a tall person -rrb- and there is a little thing in the back that allows you to slip the bag over larger suitcase handles , or <unk> luggage racks the cushion really protects your computer and there are so many pockets , there is room for any documents you may be carrying my only complaint : i was able to stuff this thing so full that it would not fit into the overhead bins the case can get quite `` fat , `` which makes it almost impossible to carry the wheels are quite sturdy , but if you decide to wear this bag over your shoulder , they rub against your body , uncomfortably so , i would say this is a great travel bag , but not a great `` everyday `` computer bag -- it 's just too bulky and heavy to carry around for normal use
this thing is really handy the storage spaces are all very usable for what they were designed for it rolls easily and the handle opens and closes well my # `` hp -lrb- widescreen -rrb- just barely fits the insert however and i 'd call it # stars if it were just a little larger
this was not a bad item for the price and what i 'm using it for there could be a little more room in each of the compartments but i 've managed to get all i need for work to fit in this one bag i love the handle and the <unk> of the wheels ... however it is a <unk> trying to get the case down <unk> it takes some working but i manage overall i like the product and am glad i bought it
i have had several other rolling laptop bags and so far this is my favorite one this bag has a zippered compartment that goes around the vertical pullout handle that compartment allows you to store extra cords , snacks , office supplies , whatever in most bags there is no compartment around the vertical handle and it is just wasted space i carry # laptops , # mice , and two power cords , plus a notebook , a calendar , plus some basic office supplies in this bag every week there is even room for a lightweight jacket or sweater the two carry handles on the back <unk> with each other very well , making it feel as though there is only one handle to carry when you ca n't use the wheels the only drawback is the materials - a piece of foam trim has already fallen off of the back after only # months of use the wheels are looking a bit worn after # months of use
i like the kensington roller bag i purchased recently it has become a very reliable `` tool `` for my school i bring lots of books everyday to school and so far , this kensington roller bag has done its job
i have had this bag for almost # years of teaching and it has held up very well i read the reviews about the wheels and i agree that they look very flimsy however , i have been careful with not banging those wheels and they are still working well the telescoping arm is beginning to show signs of wear , so i may have to look for a replacement for me , that has been the weakness of this bag the handle works fine , but it feels weak all in all , if you take care of this bag , it will give you years of good service just take extra care with the wheels and the telescoping arm
this case is really nice however , i thought i was buying a black case and it came in as a dark green in all the pictures it looked black and i did n't even think to check the color of it oh well , all else is good with the carrying case i serves the purpose
this bag is well made , well positioned the various pockets gives plenty of storage -lrb- laptop , two spiral notebooks , bible , notebook can all be stored at the same time without the bag being bulky the bag is heavy and not very comfortable carrying over the shoulder , although it has a shoulder strap stores easily on plane in overhead bin mobility is very good
i wanted a bag that would work as both an over the shoulder and a roller , and that was more like a <unk> case than an over night bag this meets all those concerns in the reviews i saw a number of comments that the quality was n't as good as the original , having not had the original , all i can say is that the quality met my expectations if i were to change anything , i 'd love the retractable handle to be a little more sturdy , it has a bit of twist to it being a single pole but that is by no means a deal breaker in my opinion it did fit under the seat in the plane as long as i turned it the long way
i find this an excellent bag all of my laptops -lrb- # inch -rrb- fit in the foam lined storage , and there is sufficient space for files and papers , wireless mouse , extra battery , ... a lot of stuff the roller works beautifully ... almost no effort to roll the bag fully stuffed around however , as another reviewer noted , the telescoping handle should be another length or even two long i am over # ' and it is almost impossible to drag the bag behind you without your shoe kicking the bag ... you really have to drag it on the right side to avoid kicking it
i used this case for several years and it held up very well still have it , but but do not travel as much the extending arm is a bit wobbly , but it never broke and i have been very rough on it would stuff the case so full of papers , files , laptop and so forth that i could not zip all the way the zippers , handles , nor strap never broke the wheels are not <unk> , so i sometimes had <unk> if i took a corner too fast , or similar , but not too bad if i begin to travel again , i will definitely use this case as it is dependable
this bag is a very nice one i use it with a # `` laptop , and it fits very nicely in the laptop compartment there are enough pockets to put a lot of accessories the only drawback i have seen until now is how the weight gets distributed in the bag i had put it around the handle of a carry-on luggage using the provided support on the back however the weight of the laptop case pulled the bag to topple over on the other side i dont know if its bad weight balance on the laptop case or the carry-on nothing happened to my laptop though overall a very good product
the kensington case fills the need it was purchased for it is easy to put items into and get items out of it also is very steady and rolls easily i recomend this case to any one who needs this type of case
lots of storage space and works pretty good for airline travel my only suggestion would be to reduce the size of the wheels or move them <unk> to ease getting the bag under the airline seat
this bag is even better than the earlier <unk> i travel a great deal ; this bag is up to the challenge i had an earlier version and the caddy stripe ripped of the back it seemed like an inconsequential thing , but i really use that strap a great deal so i bought a new bag much to my surprise , the new model has rivets securing the caddy strap instead of mere stitches the bag is room , the compartmentalization is practical , and it fit in the overhead bins of even regional jets i love it and freely recommend it
i have not had any problems i know several others who also have this same bag -lrb- some for significantly longer than me -rrb- and they have n't had any problems either it has a lot of space for it 's size and is easy to use i have pretty bad back problems which made me get this bag and i 'm grateful that i did i 'd recommend it to everyone looking for a <unk> but good quality bag
this is a great alternative to damaging your back by carrying your laptop over your shoulder the kensington roller is awsome you can fit two machines in there and it has a pocket for anything you can think of ... it has a place to put the shoulder strap too what i like best is how effortlessly it handles stairs and curbs as well as its turning <unk> unlike most wheels these move side to side relatively easily the handle is also great you feel the control . # stars
i bought this bag after much research on amazon i compared it with # other bags that amazon had and this one had the most positive reviews i can honestly say now , that those people were right i love this bag because of its ease of use , multiple storage compartments , and <unk> features my old bag killed my back and i usually had sore shoulders after traveling for work because of the weight and pressure of the bag not with this bag . . that is a thing of the past plus , this bag is compact enough to fit in any small compartment on a plane i am under # ' # and i recommend this bag to anyone who travels a lot and needs something that will not hurt their small frame
i have a very large and heavy # inch laptop this case is great on wheels and great hanging on the sholder strap it also has a great plastic handle that is comfortable carying a very heavy case i am very happy with this case
the kensington # contour roller carrying case is exactly what i was looking for to carry my # `` mac laptop i have <unk> stores of <unk> , photography companies and was delighted to find this case it is perfect
this is the first bag i found that would accomidate my new dell laptop does n't hold much else so not an overnighter i have got a pair of shoes and a light jacket in it very well made
i went through at least three bags before i found this one i carry a very large gaming laptop for work i do this because of the larger screen and the ability to upgrade it myself i need to have multiple hard drives for work since i do a lot of work with os <unk> this bag ended up being a perfect fit for my behemoth of a laptop it also was n't overly large like the last one i had prior there is plenty of room for the brick of an ac adapter i have in the back zipper compartment that houses the telescoping handle they really did not waste any space on this bag
what a fantastic product , this is one of the best purchases i have made most of these suitcases are very expensive and the reviews not so great this suitcase was a fantastic deal and the quality is great this was purchased for traveling with the laptop computer and other office information it is well made the handle is fine and it rolls nicely does not look cheap at all
i contacted kensington three days ago to find out where i could buy replacement wheels i 've used my bag so much over the past year one of the wheels has started to come apart the bad news : you ca n't get replacement wheels the good news : they offered to send me a whole new bag three days later fedex ground drives up with my new bag talk about service i was amazed this is not only a great product but a company who <unk> in pleasing their customers when they say `` limited lifetime warranty `` they are n't just talking about if your bag gets hit by lightning or run over by a train
this bag moves effortlessly around corners , up curbs , and through nyc streets very well i hope it lasts with the abuse nyc can give to it but so far so good it is a bit large overall and i 'm often asked if i 'm going away , meanwhile it is just my school bag , but overall it is very functional , spacious , and sturdy and the look of it is very nice the <unk> handles are great for picking up and carrying by hand as well nice bag overall
bought this laptop case for my husband and i and then bought another for my parents is balanced well has lots of room
this was one of the few carrying cases that provides three ways to carry a lot of stuff : handle , shoulder strap , and rollers i chose this due to its phenomenal price point , and because it is small enough to fit under most airline seats i 've used it for a couple months now , with a laptop and its accessories , a lot of other computer and networking equipment fairly well filling it up it is holding up nicely so far , including the zippers i highly recommend it the blue wheels are a bit odd looking imho , but i 'm over it
this bag is fantastic it has plenty of room for a laptop , and all the accessories i also use the back area -lrb- where the mesh pockets are for cables -rrb- to store my <unk> there is plenty of room for files as well the bag is a little bigger than i imagined - although i did measure it against my <unk> `` <unk> `` bag however , the main plus for this kensington bag is the design - the long handle , the short handles and the shoulder strap is just so comfortable its like having a # -in- # ! ! i am so pleased with the kensington contour roller range , that i have also purchased the kensington # contour balance notebook computer roller bag - -lsb- ...
the case is lightweight and holds more than any i 've had before its design makes very efficient use of space i 've not had a problem on a plane yet i can fit both my work and personal laptops in it , along with accessories i have been very pleased with this purchase -- great value
i 've had one of these for a couple years now and it 's held up beautifully i beat the crap out of it and it might not be quite as <unk> as it was the day that it arrived upon my doorstep , but it still cradles my precious just right
this sleeve offers acceptable protection , an <unk> <unk> , and a clear window to remind you what computer you put in it i do find it heavier , bulkier , and stiffer than other <unk> i have experienced
i do n't even have a mack , i got it for my dell inspiron # it beautifully fits , and had saved may baby several times the reason why i bought it is the price -lrb- around $ # -rrb- , but i do n't regret for a minute
i love how snugly my laptop fits in here , which makes me realize that it 's truly protected the color is great - matches perfectly with my laptop the design is wonderful , i love that i do n't have to deal with any zippers i could n't be happier
nice case however , very very small sent it back because it was not big enough contacted the seller twice about a return receipt and never received one sent case back about two weeks ago and paid postage myself and still no refund or communication from the seller do n't order this if there is any chance you may want to send it back ! !
i was extremely <unk> when my package came containing this product while the size specifications of the case were accurate , everything else about the case was simply <unk> first of all the construction is poor , the hinges do n't align properly and the case wo n't close unless you perfectly line up the top and bottom pieces the lock is <unk> pathetic , with a cheap key that will break with any amount of pressure other than a & # # ; <unk> & # # ; touch this does n't really matter since you can easily pick this lock with a flat head screwdriver , or just about any other <unk> material the frame , cover and foam inserts are all decent , however with such poor locking and closing mechanisms , this product is as useful as a lunchbox with foam padding would not recommend this to anyone who is looking for a secure <unk> , however it could be useful as a storage case for <unk> items when thick padding is essential it could also be used as a thin lunchbox
i purchased this carrying case to use as a ring carrier for my wedding it is perfect it is small it can hold a paperback book the whole case is as big as a black and white notebook the key is easy to break but for the price it feels pretty sturdy i love the egg carton on the inside of the box if you removed the carton it could probably hold # paperback books only purchase this if you have small items to carry
i purchased the aluminum case to use for holding <unk> items for my daughters christmas present it is a great size , and with the keys makes it just perfect for holding all the things necessary to provide the look for the perfect <unk>
i needed a small locking case after shopping around i decided on this one mostly because of the size being appropriate for my needs it works fine for my intended purpose but it is not aluminum it has <unk> plastic sides with aluminum frame rails and metal corners the latch and lock are very simple as one would expect lock security is very minimal enough to keep out prying eyes but not a determined person with even the most basic tools inside there is one thick layer of protective foam and this is on the lid the other side is lined but has no thick foam i 'm happy at the price and got what i needed ... and pretty much what i wanted , but be aware this case is not aluminum
we wanted a storage box for a mini video camera and its associated bits as the camera was a compact we did n't want anything too big i thought you could get these anywhere but i was wrong i 'm very pleased we found this on amazon
