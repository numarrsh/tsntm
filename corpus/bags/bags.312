i purchased this sleeve for my # & # # ; macbook air the colors are great and it 's nicely lined with a soft padding the size of the sleeve is a couple inches larger than my computer so it can slip around but it also makes it easier to get on and off
i purchased this case for my # -inch macbook air i specifically wanted something that i could place my laptop in to provide extra protection when traveling i popped my laptop in the case which i then carried in my back-pack or purse it provided extra padding , kept it from being damaged from any stray pens or other items and was stylish not water proof or anything , but the fabric is think enough to provide adequate protection from most things
my laptop , which is a macbook air fits very snugly in this case design is super cute and as shown material feels really durable , a bit rough like a <unk> sack but in a high class way inside is a funky brown suede and has a bit of padding it 's a great sleeve but would have gotten a # if it had a pocket for the cord great value for the price love the retro design
i ordered the # & # # ; in version for my dell # & # # ; inspirion # , going by dimensions it should have fit i can shove it in there , but can not get the zippers around the corners thankfully i will have time to order another one up a size , but that is a pain too also , the fabric pattern is random apparently - i like what is in the picture , but mine has the blue in the middle , and the bottom print up on the top and the stripes on the bottom it is also not as bright as the picture i do still like it , it is nice and i will get another of the same kind , but i do like the pattern on the picture better
i bought this for my # & # # ; macbook pro and i really do love the case it 's really pretty and padded the only thing i do n't like is there 's not enough room to store my charger without making it somewhat bulky i would like to have that added -lrb- maybe a front pocket ? -rrb- but it 's really pretty and it serves its purpose well
i am very happy with this sleeve the design is as shown , perhaps the colors are a tad more muted than pictured but still very very pretty the inside lining is soft and it 's a perfectly snug fit for an # ' mac book air appears very well made
i wanted something a little different for my new mac book so decided on this case the material is sturdy - canvas like , and keeps a nice shape happy with my purchase - thanks
this case is awesome it took me a while to actually find this case on amazon , but its worth it it small , tight fitted , has cushion on the inside for protection , and seems durable the only down side is that there is n't space for my laptop charger
the colors are a lot more vibrant than in the picture , but it is not off-putting and still very pretty i ordered the # & # # ; for my # & # # ; macbook air that has a hard case on it and was worried that it would be too small , but it fit perfectly not too tight at all
seems like a durable case one minor complaint - the case is identical on both sides , so you ca n't tell which side is up or down i do n't like to put my laptop <unk> down , so i have to unzip the case to check
i love this case soo much im so glad i found it on here because the cases in the stores suck ! it is exactly how the picture describes it the case fits my asus # `` laptop perfectly and i can even fit a folder , my charger and headphones in there its very colorful and the inside of the case is very soft it was worth all my money ! !
fits my mac book air perfectly , soft inner lining , and a little extra room to fit in paperwork the only improvement would be to have a strap of handle for carrying
thick zipper and fabric my mac bk pro isnt squished inside so its easy to slide in n out , even with my external drive and long cord inside fabric is not slippery so the grip is great , plus is well padded there 's no handle but i prefer placing it within another container with a handle so its all the more secure
this is a great cover the design is <unk> with lots of colors but not too overbearing i received a compliment on it the first time i brought it to church to use with the kids , where i <unk>
the colors are much darker and richer than in the picture , which it good it 's even cuter in person it also fits my elitebook # p perfectly , so you can use it even it it 's not mac
a sleeve that is exactly what i was looking for i needed something to protect my # & # # ; macbook air when carrying it around occasionally did n't need anything heavy duty as the most traveling it does is from home to the coffee shop this case was just right super snug , soft on the inside , and a stiff outer fabric that feels pretty protective i let it air out for a couple hours after opening it and then had absolutely no issues with any chemical smells that other reviewers had mentioned i love it
i purchased this product because i liked the <unk> style of the canvas fabric when i searched online for a cover for my new laptop when i received it in the mail , it was everything i expected it to be it slides right into my <unk> easily to take to work , school and back home i love it and its unique style ! : -rrb- thanks <unk>
i came really quick , it looks exactly like the picture , and it fits my macbook pro # inch -lrb- # version i think -rrb- very well it has some extra room , maybe a centimeter or two , but it does n't pose a problem and it 's be great for if you have a case
i love it so much and i 've gotten so many compliments had it for almost five months and no signs of wear and tear so sturdy and strong fabric
i love this adorable lap top case the fabric is a bit brighter than the picture and has a really fun boho <unk> love the soft interior lining i 'm super happy with this product
like some of the other reviews said , this case is a lot more vibrant than the product images show i also have the <unk> plastic hard case -lrb- b # gb # <unk> macbook and it still fits perfectly in this case couldnt be happier with this purchase
i was n't sure how i would like the design in person and i love it it has a stripped design instead of the blue pattern on the other side which i think looks perfect the only thing i do n't like is sometimes when i pull the zipper fast it will get stuck on the inside fabric , besides that it is well worth your money great buy for the price !
love it so far zipper and materials inside and out are great quality and the colors were exactly as shown in fact , i think it 's even prettier in person it fits my # & # # ; laptop perfectly i wish i had ordered this sooner
i use this to carry my air in my backpack , it has worked well for me it is easy to get my air in and out and doesnt make it feel <unk> like other cases have i would not use it if you are doing more than just daily
fits my macbook perfectly protects it from the cold when in my bag i travel with my computer to and from work every day , so now it has a secure case that is fashionable to my style
the slip cover is very nice for the price i paid it fits my laptop perfectly and looks awesome i would recommend it to anyone looking for a little bit of protection and style
very cute and good protection for mac book pro it does add an inch or two of width thus making computer too big for my bag but very cute case colors are vibrant
this sleeve is just padded enough to put in a backpack or purse without damaging the laptop , but adds very little bulk to the laptop very soft <unk> material inside and nice design on the outside , exactly as pictured fits my macbook air # & # # ; perfectly
the color is much brighter in the photo than in real life it still looks great and is much better looking than the normal plain case it is wide enough to fit my mac book air with a hard case on the inside is fuzzy and orange while the outside is a lovely colorful pattern
i got this sleeve for my # . # & # # ; netbook and it was a great fit the pattern distribution is not exactly as shown in the picture , but it is the same fabric the inside is lined with a really soft synthetic material
i absolutely love this case i have enough room to put my mac plus a notebook it 's great for when i have just one or two classes during the day because i just grab that instead of carrying my backpack definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a case
love this bag , the colors are absolutely beautiful it is everything i expected the outside is made of durable canvas fabric and the inside is made of super soft <unk> my # inch mac pro with retina screen fit nicely , with a little room to spare , could n't ask for a better match am very happy with this purchase is well worth the price
this case fits my macbook pro # ' perfectly and it is so cute ! the colors are a little more vibrant than the pictures but i really love it i would recommend this to anyone
love the case , have gotten many compliments from random people it came in only a few days the colors are a little less vibrant in person than in the picture which actually i liked better
this laptop sleeve is durable and the fabric is a thicker canvas the inside has a soft , orange lining and the zippers are easy to move it is also very stylish , of course i give this laptop sleeve # stars
inside is very soft and fuzzy i could <unk> it all day . <unk> that 's weird but yeah it 's really really soft the case itself is very thick -- so it gives me a feeling that it 's actually cushioned and protected colors are bright and lovely zipper is very strong and smooth
i was so excited to receive my case , and it is exactly as expected soft interior , fits the computer even with a hard shell case , and the pattern is so cute
this is a really cute and durable laptop cover i have a gateway # . # & # # ; and it fits snuggly but can still zip it closed nicely i can see this lasting a long time ca n't wait to start taking it to school this fall
very pretty pattern and sturdy zipper fits my # & # # ; macbookpro perfectly , with a little extra room -lrb- if i ever put a hardcase on it , i think it would still fit -rrb-
this is exactly what i was looking for i use it while traveling print on cover makes this easy to locate in <unk> on bag recommend this highly to anyone looking for a lightweight protective case
fits the laptop i bought it for without being too snug i had noticed the width measurements of some sleeves was very narrow so i was concerned that if they were n't expandable or elastic the laptop would n't slide in easily and if the laptop did n't slide in easily , my daughter wo n't wrestle with it -lrb- wo n't use it ! -rrb- , defeating the purpose the laptop i bought it for is just over # inch in thickness
i typed my model in the search , and this came up , but it does not fit a little to small and not the same shape -lrb- more square than rounded -rrb- that said : the color was just as vibrant as i thought it would be the build looked decent
i searched for a week to find exactly the right cover for my hp i asked questions , read reviews & still got the wrong thing there 's no way this cover would ever fit my laptop so i sent it back with no problems no questions this time i sent an email directly to the company requesting info & they were awesome i am already in the process of ordering the exact one i need will update when it arrives
this fits my envy m # perfectly , i was surprised by the color because it 's an amazingly gorgeous purple even though in the picture here looks more pink on the downside sometimes it feels kind of floppy when i lift the computer but it 's a good protection from
style ish and works i would re <unk> this to any one who wants a unique laptop or would like to ad stickers with out having to remove them from the actual laptop latter
i measured my laptop twice to make sure it would fit and it did n't - so bummed - loved the case , but it sticks out the top so i ca n't use it
the actual size of this case is # . # & # # ; , not # & # # ; i do n't know why it is so hard to put the correct measurements in the description i had to return this case because it was too big for my laptop
i bought this to protect my new laptop , and i absolutely loved it , until both of zippers broke despite this , i do not blame the product quality this product was a good quality product i blame the corners on my laptop for the unfortunate end of this laptop sleeve had i bought this for my old laptop , this issue would not have <unk> -lrb- i put my old laptop in it before it broke and it fit perfectly and both of my laptops have the same screen size .
i originally thought i was looking for neoprene cases and this one came up i like the fabric but wish it had been neoprene for that extra protection from spills
i bought this to protect my laptop while at school it has a nice soft inside but i do n't think it has enough padding to protect my laptop properly it 's cute and nice if you want a cover but will be carrying your laptop in your hands i would n't trust it if i put my laptop in my bag though it might get damaged
i could get my laptop into the case but it was difficult to get out because of the square corners on the computer i returned it and got the next larger size the padding is certainly adequate and the print was terrific
imo this should not be advertised as an # . # case it is such a tight fit it takes both hands with force getting in to the case , same goes for the removal i rarely put it in the case as is intended i turn it sideways and lean it up against the back of a chair i 'm rather disappointed
not as pretty as i thought it would be but has a sturdy zipper so looks durable so look like a good protector just not as stylish as i would 've liked but the inside is fuzzy and that 's
the cover is of great quality i like the vibrant colors , the soft interior , and the quality zipper i think that it could fit my macbook pro # & # # ; a little bit more snugly , but i assume it 's made to accomodate other laptops that may be a little bit bigger than mine
i am very happy with this purchase it looks just like the picture and my laptop fits perfectly in there not too tight and not too loose i wish it had just another layer of protection , but if you do n't plan on dropping it then this is a great and stylish item
the company that i ordered this case from , contacted me via email , <unk> me that the correct size is being sent to me i received it quickly they were very accommodating , and now i have the leopard laptop case in the size needed . : -rrb- it 's a snug fit so anything over # inches will not work # inch or less will be just fine if its smaller , you can put your charger in the case too
this is a great product for anyone looking for a stylish way to protect their computer the pink is very pretty and girly the inside fur is great for preventing scratches on your computer the product itself is great but came in dirty im not returning it because i already returned a different case , but otherwise i would ask for a replacement
this is a wonderful looking case but for my & # # ; # in . macbook pro its not as <unk> as i was hoping it would be around my laptop it also has a strong plastic smell to it after a while it does go away but it is unpleasant at first other than that , it looks great and still does its job in protecting my laptop
this is more my fault then the manufacturers but i have a # inch laptop and thought this would work perfect but it 's a bit too tight other than that , it looks exactly like you see it , super <unk> and super cute
i 've had this for well over a month , no tears , no thread hanging , no snags with the zip i still have room to fit my charger or my ipad mini with the case and cover , or a couple notebooks
i personally think that this laptop case is a little pricey but it works great and looks exactly like the picture on the inside it has some kind of soft furry material which i really like
the leopard is n't near as bright as is in the picture also the texture is a little different it has fuzz on the inside to keep your computer from scratching i really enjoy this case i can fit my computer and my wireless mouse
i got this for my # . # in laptop it does fit snug but that will help it from sliding around and keep it safe it does come with quite a smell but you just have to let it air out for a few days or spray with febreeze over all it 's a super cute and good quality bag
if you are in to leopard print , and want to protect your laptop then here is what u need i really like this case i know my laptop is protected and wont need to worry for it to get scratched up ! !
i bought this for my daughter 's new lenovo # . # inch laptop the case is just a tiny bit too small and it 's a struggle to get the laptop into it , and forget about zipping the zipper other than that , it is a very nice looking case , and i will be ordering the next size up
i 'm obsessed with leopard print and this case is absolutely perfect , i get tons of compliments on it when i 'm on campus it fits my <unk> pro # ' along with it 's rubber case perfectly it was shipped super fast , and had no sign of the & # # ; fishy oder & # # ; other people mentioned in their review
i love this case it is way cuter than you can even tell from the picture and it 's good quality i now feel like my laptop is both safe and stylish
i 've had this case for about # months now and its still holding up i carry it to class in my book bag , so its very small and compact i have a hp split and it fits perfectly the only thing that does n't fit is the charging cord but the split has # hours of battery , so i do n't need the cord i read some reviews that it kind of smelled but i did not get any funky smells from it thank god ! ha i would highly recommend this i love mine
i absolutely love this laptop cover it is a perfect fit for my # inch dell laptop the soft inside and durable canvas outer fabric are also great features this product is totally worth the money
very stylish , soft inside , offers the perfect amount of protection without being too bulky goes with anything i have had it since around the end of september , it is now the end of march and not a complaint here
the sleeve fit my asus vivobook perfectly the design is great both inside and out if you have a # & # # ; screen and need a fabulous cover , this is for you
i like this bag a lot it is just the right size and keeps the dust off my macbook air it has a strong <unk> smell which is rather unpleasant , but it does n't affect how the product works and my laptop does n't seem to pick up the smell so do n't stick your head in the bag
i get complimented everywhere with this i love it ! and it has extra room so i pit my headphones in there and my charger overall i ca n't complain about it .
this bag is so pretty and its super soft inside perfect for my # inch mac a lot of people here were complaining about the smell , but honestly that smell eventually goes away once you start using it it would have been better if this case came with a handle to carry it easily but oh well this bag is still gorgeous i just love it
this fit my # in macbook air perfectly , its light weight and just what i needed i am able to fit this case and my laptop in my school bag just fine
i like this laptop sleeve the pattern is nice and the inside has nice soft fur i like that it has two zippers on the side as well nothing to complain about
very nice case i thought it might be flimsy or cheap-looking in person , but it 's good quality it 's made out of a sturdy canvas material , the seams are sewn well , and it has a soft cushy protective interior i 've been through a few laptop cases on amazon , but this one seems designed to last
i love this item the measures was exactly as described , so my # inch laptop suited perfect the qualities of the materials are very good , and the zipper seems to be very resistant i strongly recommend this product , and so the seller , as it was delivered by the time expected and with no <unk>
this case is exactly what i was looking for it is the perfect size for my computer and i use it all the time i feel like my mac is protected from scratches and spills yet it still is so slim and cute the price for this case is so great too i definitely would recommend it to anyone that needs one
i loved this case for my # inch macbook pro it fit like a glove , even with a case that i have on it for extra protection i absolutely love the leopard print
my daughter bought this laptop case to carry her computer to class she is a freshman in college and loves is she takes it everywhere with her to protect her computer
it 's pretty and i get compliments everytime i use it i recommend getting an inch larger than your actual laptop my laptops # & # # ; but i got the # & # # ; and its just perfect !
excellent quality and eye catching as well . i love the print and the fabric quality is great as is the zipper i wish there was a matching mouse pad ... that would complete my set
it was everything that the seller described it to be love it fashionable and the soft inside no complaints although one of the little pieces along the zipper did fall out
i am very happy with my purchase of this laptop sleeve it fits my laptop perfectly -lrb- nice and snug -rrb- but i am able to slide a slim book inside as well , which makes it even better
this macbook air case is just what i was looking for the macbook air fits perfectly , and the case itself is actually pretty good regarding protection i expected it to be thinner but the cushion is pretty good definitely worth it for the price
i received this item as indicated the item is pleasing to the <unk> and very durable able to accommodate my laptop , mouse and mouse pad i would highly recommend this product
this & # # ; case & # # ; did n't fit my # . # inch laptop it blocked several inputs as well as the optical drive it 's very flimsy silicone the description said that it would fit any # . # inch unit i hoped it would help me keep my laptop safer i was looking for something similar like the apple case this is not it
this product is nothing like what it 's shown in the picture when i received it i was happy but when i covered my laptop , it had this click noise every time i would close my laptop so it was tight and putting pressure on the screen
it did n't fit & i still do n't have a protected cover for my laptop & that makes me sad i ca n't seem to find one i like as much as
i tried this shock protector on # separate laptops : an older dell inspiron , on a lenovo g # , and a toshiba satellite it fits the easiest on the dell , but was afraid to force the toshiba down without damaging it now here is the thing that bothered me most : all # dvd drives are partially covered on the toshiba , the sd card reader and at least one of the usb connectors are covered - and this after one cuts the & # # ; assigned & # # ; areas to expose additional openings same for the lenovo plus , on the bottom of the laptops , the holes for some of the vents are reduced , making it easier for your laptop to overheat compromise solution for shock protection besides a good laptop backpack from case logic , i prefer a laptop sleeve i like the case logic and the amazon cases for the # . # inch laptops
i ordered this product for my dell inspiron # . # when i opened the package i was quite excited to put it to use the product was simple enough to put on my laptop , however , it covered a lot of the usb ports while it does have cutouts to accommodate various models , none of these matched my dell the second downfall was the fact it covered the upper corners of the screen after looking at the product for a couple of minutes i took it off , put it back in the box and returned it i think it is a useful product , but i had no intention of <unk> it up to fit my laptop i also tried it on my toshiba satellite and it does n't come close on that model universal ... . highly misleading
the photo is misleading to start with the photo actually shows this product on a white laptop i looked at this products photo several times and <unk> it i was under the impression that the white areas was part of the case and would serve as shock resistant bumpers what you actually get looks like a one piece thin rubber bath mat . for $ # . # i am not impressed if you have pets ... it attracts animal hair which is hard to remove it is better than nothing ... i do n't believe this will protect my laptop from any kind of drops or impact ... and i think the statement & # # ; protects hard drive & # # ; is misleading as the photograph hp <unk> # it covers the cd/dvd drive but not really an issue because the corner will pop off easy
the cover is not compatible with all laptops and could n't fit my lenovo y # p also be careful while removing the cutouts as i accidently ripped the case while trying to remove them
my intended use of this is to keep the notebook from undo handling by others but now that i am more careful about where to leave my notebook it seemed not that necessary to have this cover on
my computer guy told me about this item it does protect your computer from getting scratched up plus if your laptop is on your lap it is protecting you legs from <unk> from the
i have a # . # inch laptop i found it very difficult covering my laptop with the <unk> i bought the black <unk> which left my hands with black residue , however i goes away do n't know how or why even so if you want a simple cover i would recommend this
the cover is nice but it is very hard to get it on even after you finally managed to put it on i could not managed to match the holes to fit usb ports on my computer
i got the black sleeve it was a little tough stretching this on to my dell inspiron # series laptop , but it works it does n't close all the way now -- it leaves a small gap -- but that is to be expected it does cover the speakers most of the way , but i use a <unk> tooth ones anyway over all i really like this sleeve it looks durable and will certainly make a great shock protector i also like it because it keeps it safe in the laptop sleeve of my bag : http / / <unk> # <unk> # <unk> # <unk> # ? ie = utf # & qid = # & sr = # & <unk> = dakine + messenger + bag i would definitely recommend this
i saw pictures and expected to be disappointed it is a rubber material and it does stretch and gets tight on the laptop i have no issues with closing it or having it open no vent issues at this moment , i am happy that i got this
