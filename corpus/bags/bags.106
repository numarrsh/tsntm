i found the bag to be uncomfortable also , this bag really is for apple products ; my dell latitude # would not fit in the tablet partition lastly , this bag truly is just for a slim computer and maybe a notebook at most you wo n't be fitting any textbooks into this thing
this is a good bookbag , though the hidden bottle holder is quite annoying because it is only attached at one seam , it flops around and <unk> the back of your arm while walking if your container is heavy enough despite this , it is waterproof , fits my ultrabook like a glove , and even has a handy secret compartment , so i would recommend it if you do n't need the bottle holder functionality
the backpack was excellent for travelling it was smaller than i expected but that was not a hindrance i usually travel with many files and documents onto the plane but with more careful <unk> , the smaller size was not a problem it turned out to be a blessing for fitting under the seat in front and for carrying around the interior padding and multiple pockets made this backpack very versatile it offered excellent protection for the myriad of electronics i seem to & # # ; need & # # ; on a trip with enough room for the <unk> as well
just the right size for my # & # # ; macbook and it has a padded pocket for both laptops d ipad love the zip out water bottle holder -- the only compact one i saw in my <unk> nice padding for your back and sturdy straps all the others i looked at were <unk> and the nice bags were all too bid love this bag
best slim backpack , the only caveat - i would prefer more small zipped pockets inside main zipped sections for small things actually there are no <unk> pockets inside at all currently i need to use additional small bags inside to <unk> this
i 've been on the lookout for something small that could fit a weekend 's worth of clothing , a small notebook , book , and my macbook air # inch the backpack has been amazing given the price , i was worried that the triple trek would be too small , but there 's even a little bit of buffer room left after all that it came much quicker than the # to # month shipping posted on the page -lrb- it shipped in about a week to amazon -rrb- it 's light and very durable
great backpack that is compact and versatile this back pack allow me to carry my ultrabook and other items that i need for work not too big to allow carry of other items that are need , but fit everything that i need for work
this backpack is high quality and stylish it has two padded pockets in the main compartment , big enough for a small laptop -lrb- mine is # & # # ; -rrb- and a tablet it took me a while to find something this small , since most laptop backpacks accommodate larger sizes , which makes them too big for my everyday use
i love the size of it most of all , it is perfect for my work and i am able to put what i need in to it also great for traveling on plane for carry on
perfect for urban traveller - all the required things have their compartments , sleek minimalistic design allows the backpack to be worn with a business suit while keeping your hands free great manufacturing quality and materials used
... or any ultrabook up to # & # # ; - # & # # ; exactly what i wanted after looking at a number of different laptop bags - most of which are designed for much larger laptops with attendant weight and bulk plenty of room for a macbook air , an ipad , a notebook or two and a modest set of accessories like chargers and cables outer top pocket can accommodate an external superdrive with some room to spare materials and build quality are very good water bottle sleeve is a nice hideaway feature enough padding to provide protection yet slim and trim with just the right capacity
i this backpack for my # year old son for christmas , and it solidly made protects my computer , and looks really stylish he absolutely loves it people ask him who its made by all the time
first , i have so many of those backpacks they are usually too thick the goal has been to have a discreet , thin , and light one in order to bring it to <unk> & eacute ; s and work on my upcoming novel without looking like a tourist bingo , i found the best version i was looking for ; it is perfect it is light , very thin with several convenient pockets , and looks quite classy thank you kensington for designing an almost custom size backpack for me ! ! !
great ultrabook backpack first perfectly for my yoga # pro and it first wonderfully with space for the chargers and love the side pocket it 's very compact so some people may not like it aesthetically but i think it 's fine not a backpack if you are carrying a lot more than a laptop/tablet cables and other small items that can fit in the middle and front compartment
many compartments to keep my stuff organized medium is quite large so pay attention to the measurement specs no regrets n use this every work day my # rd bag from stm -lrb- <unk> models -rrb- ; great company
bought a small and was able to put my mac pro and everything i carry in one neat <unk> fly a lot and its perfect for tsa screening will buy
so far i 'm really liking this bag for my surface pro i travel on a regular basis and this bag i 've found for a surface there is even an additional pocket for a smaller tablet like a kindle or ipad my full review with pictures on my <unk> - -lsb- ...
i love stm products they are the perfect gift for the geeky mac lover as most mac lovers , i am over protective with my laptop , tablet , and phone the stm bag allows me to secure my macbook air , and i know it will never get scratched or broken there are ample pockets for headphones , keys , notebooks , pens , chargers , tablets , plus laptops the laptop is secured in a back pocket for easy removal some say this bag is bulky , but it is just as bulky as any backpack it is my favorite messenger bag to date i have a lot of stm products , so far this one is the most convenient one for traveling and going to coffee shops
this product is exactly what i was looking for and fit the description best part is all the segmented pockets in the month of use i have felt more organized and always had a place for anything i needed to carry with me love the strap cushion really quality materials used worth the money
the bag has all the little and large compartments to store everything you need to travel with day in , day out : cables , mouse , ipad , passport , pen , books everything fits in nicely and is both protected and quickly accessible i ordered the medium one thinking more space is better , but i think the small one could have been sufficient
this bag has all the features i could ever want the separate laptop compartment is adequately padded and suited for my precious macbook pro living in new york , i 'm always wary of pickpockets , so the additional zipper closure underneath the flap gives me a sense of security i 'm also not worried of things falling out i can not wait to use it for business travel
everything i expected , very comfortable bag . good compartments , the materials and work -lrb- stitches -rrb- looks fine . it is a bit big if you can manage with the smaller size i would recommend to use it
the bag is nice and good space for what i wanted and the price , but it stinks , have this weird smell like rubber it 's really <unk> i was going to return but does n't worth it because i would have to pay almost half of the bag worth on back fees for shipping i will keep it hoping the smell will go away or i will get used to it :
it is a nice backpack , not overpriced , but the synthetic fabric it is made of in both body and handles feels like sandpaper not recommended for use when wearing bare shoulder clothing i expected a nicer material
the backpack took a little to ship but it 's totally worth the money my laptop fits perfectly and it 's pretty spacious i love the look and it 's not that big for me , i only carry my laptop , external hdd and cd reader , a book and a small notebook and they all fit perfectly ! # stars all around
i would definitely recommend this product it is good quality and it fits my mackbook air perfectly im going to college this year and it has space for my mac , and my binder there is no reason to spend more than $ # on a good quality backpack when you can just buy one for $ #
this backpack is a really great buy this backpack holds my mac and my ipad the only thing i would change is put a better way to lock your ipad without unzipping the containing it does n't fit many college book but one big <unk> book and like # notebook is great looks nice and for the price , everybody compliments it
this sleeve case is way too big for my # inch macbook pro late # with retina display although it should fit according to the description on amazon the sleeve case is about # inch too long and about # . # inches too wide
bought this for a # in ultrabook and it was much to large i have a # . # in laptop too and that fit in this case much more snug than the #
got a dell latitude e # ultrabook , it 's not the thinnest ultrabook yet it is still big for it . i think it fits the # . # `` laptops better , gon na get another one for my laptop . should it fit your laptop it would be excellent
i like the bag enough just wish it had a handle , but it did not claim to have one it carries my # & # # ; , external dvd burner , <unk> card reader and power cord without too much bulk
i received the product in just # days and in good conditions but , take note : the sleeve case is bigger for a # inch ultrabook -lrb- i have an asus vivobook s # ca -rrb- , is more for a # inch ultrabook i probably should bought a # inch sleeve case
this case was too big for my asus vivobook s # ca-dh # t # -inch touch ultrabook , had to return it otherwise i would have kept it well built and i liked the front pocket too
zipper started snagging after one week of use it is pretty big , but the pocket is very convenient the only issue i had with it was that the zipper started snagging after a week of use given the price , it could be expected , but i imagine that you could spend $ # and get one that did n't fall apart ultimately , i ended up with an stm small bag for triple the price , and i am very happy
it 's slightly bigger than my # inch laptop i believe that is because i got a ultrabook which is thinner than a usual laptop however , the product is solid , i like the
it is a cute laptop case and very soft that can be folded as you want but it is a little bit larger than my # -inch asus touchscreen ultrabook , my laptop will move inside the case instead of staying stable except this everything is good
is what it is ! cheap yet seemingly durable and no different from the more expensive options unless having the brand name on the case is the most important feature for you , this would be the obvious choice
i bought this for my lenovo ideapad # inch it is bigger than # inch i can fit my folders and notebooks in it too side pocket is useful too i was expecting tight case , but its ok
great company to work with and product was as described i would recommend this product and company to others it does not fit the computer perfectly but still a really great fit and the front pocket for the charger is a nice bonus
i wanted a sleeve with a pocket so that i could carry my laptop and power adapter at the same time this seemed to be one of the only ones on the market pocket fits my adapter perfectly and has a nice zipper for security the sleeve is a little big for my asus vivobook s # ca-dh # t but not bad
bought this bag cause it said it was made for the macbook pro ... and it is fits perfect , and was able to put the plug in it too great bag . . great price
this soft case seems to be good quality for the money , though it was a bit large for my # . # inch hp ultrabook but i ca n't complain though since it clearly says it is for a # inch laptop
i got a samsung ultrabook and i just wanted a case so it does n't get dusty or scratched i read a review of someone who dropped their laptop and it chipped in this case this is not the case you want if you are dropping your laptop this goes in my oversized teacher bag and has a great front pocket that holds the cord it allows me to have some place to keep the computer safe it does the trick the inside is a bright green you only see it when it is open and i think it is wonderful
i use this case for travel with my laptop - however , due to its protective neoprene use it everyday it 's extra pocket offers room for accessories which is really handy
this is a great case it 's not as slim as the computer itself -lrb- obviously -rrb- , but that was the only surprise i love it , people see it and are impressed that it 's white and still clean great plush feel in the inside
love the look and the extra open zipper spots for charging and plugging in headphones i 've only had it for # months , though , and it seems like some of the stitching is coming apart near the zipper other than that , awesome case
this came in just like how it was advertised at first i was skeptical -lrb- since it was offered in white , and white dirties easily -rrb- but the material it 's made out of seems like it 's durable and will stay pretty clean the corner zipper to charge your laptop without taking it out is a really cool plus it fits the new # ' macbook pro with the retina display perfectly and snug and actually , i can fit my superdrive -lrb- the cd/dvd thumb drive -rrb- and my charger easily definitely a buy you wo n't regret
i have a new macbook pro retina # & # # ; and this is a perfect sleeve it has plenty of cushion i would put this in a larger notebook case if i was doing any major traveling , but its a fine sleeve on it 's on for short trips and storage
i recently purchased this case for my # -inch macbook pro with retina display it looks very modern and sleek the fit is snug , and the interior is super plush to protect your laptop from scratches the outside pocket is n't huge , but it will hold tons of smaller accessories the corner zipper for charging is extremely convenient i would definitely recommend this product to others
i almost purchased this item straight from the incase website for $ # , but luckily i checked amazon before i <unk> my purchase i like how all the peripherals for my mbp fit in the sleeve if i needed them to it 's also pretty nice to be able to charge the laptop while it 's still in the sleeve this case offers great protection from scratches and a nice functional design . . exactly what you 'd expect from incase
the bag came on time and is as described , there are no extra compartments in this bag just one slot for the laptop it will get annoying having only room for your laptop
i like this bag i wanted a simple , no frills , light bag to carry my laptop in , and this bag is exactly that however , if you are looking for a bag that is well padded and provides protection to your laptop , this is not the bag for you you should know that when you are making your purchase if i had been looking for somethign more substantial , i would have been disappointed
this is such a neat design with the <unk> box and i am happy to know that my laptop is protected if i find myself suddenly in a bit of rain
this product was exactly what i expected its a slim carrying case that can fit a laptop and a few folders it 's great for what it is intended to be , and that is a compact , hands-free way to carry and protect your laptop and the design is awesome people constantly tell me how cool it is
so you have to carry a laptop around for work , and you are n't a leather case kinda person enter in the stereo laptop bag this bag is awesome i get lots of compliments its small and easy to transport , but the cushioning is n't that great i mean i could n't thrown the bag down for fear of breaking my computer , but should you be throwing your laptop down anyway i doubt it its just a funky case that stands out and has room for papers and cords
i 'm always complemented on it it is also very durable and is able to fit not only my laptop with a hard shell case on it but also my charger and a notebook i highly recommend this to any on the go college student
this product is extremely well-designed and well-built the padding is exactly what i want to make my ipad mini feel secure i had purchased this to potentially use as a stand-alone bag , but i find that the exterior pockets do n't offer enough give to hold more than just the thinnest accessories the strap is my other minor annoyance as another reviewer mention , this is just the regular ipad jacket with smaller dimensions this means that the handle is too small to comfortably grip , and the strap is too small to wear cross-body style i generally find myself sliding this bag into another bag , which has worked very well for me and allows me to change bags
our <unk> in the field use these and they work great they actually <unk> the shoulder strap and wear around their <unk> the pouch is just the right size for the ipad ; just do n't plan to carry much else
great seller - fast shipping this sleeve is perfect for my ipad mini , even with the leather case i 've put on it plenty of room inside the zipper pocket on the outside fits my iphone , cable and earbuds perfectly love it , highly recommended for the price , you ca n't beat it
i bought this as a gift for my mom 's ipad mini i have one for my ipad and love it it fits perfectly inside with cover on the ipad it has plenty of pockets to hold everything i need including the charger i know she will like it as much as i do
highly recommend this bag i purchased a sony vaio ii computer which fold into a tablet i needed a small case to keep this tablet and screen from nicks and scratches besides making it easily portable it is well made
the great thing about this sleeve is the handle i do n't really use the shoulder strap the handle is just perfect build quality is second to none the only con would be the zip pocket in front ... its a little bit tight with the charger on it other than that ... its just a great buy
i own a dell xps # and i wanted a sleeve with a strap and this is it it is well cushioned to protect your laptop and it has extra pockets for tablets , chargers , and even smartphones this is pretty much a sleeve with extra pockets and shoulder straps but it is not bulky it is very slim and offers lots of protection if you rather prefer a sleeve the shoulder strap can easily be removed i highly recommend this sleeve to all
it 's only bag that fits # ' # mbair i went through many bags before i came upon <unk> sleeve i like the padding on the bag lots of zippers it fits the charger and it got zippers to zip the pocket where the charger is i bought the blue one , it is darker then it shown online i wish they would offer more colors , more bright colors , for example , orange , yellow , green and so on
i have a macbook pro # & # # ; and my husband has a sony vaio # & # # ; we both love this carrying case we only wish it had padding inside i have n't yet dropped the computer , but i think if i do , it 's not going to be protected as if it were padded from the inside but it looks sharp and it 's well made
i purchased this bag to use with my surface pro when travelling i really like the style , a mix of a thule and alienware style my only gripe is that it only has # netted pockets , and a divider between the tablet/laptop where you can put the charger , perhaps a keyboard and a magazine so space is limited however , in my case , this is good as it forces me to pack light there is one diy i want to do though , and that 's to stick in some pick n pluck foam to hold the tablet in securely overall , very happy and highly recommended very very good quality , looks much more expensive than what it is sold
this fits either my # & # # ; or # & # # ; retina macbook pro the fit and construction are first rate the zippers are not as difficult to use as those found on the thule gauntlet ... and the price is a lot more reasonable i am not sure how much protection this will give , since there is n't much padding , but it appears to be water resistant i was using a targus atlanta case for my # & # # ; , but i did n't like that i could n't remove the strap this one comes with a strap that is removable , as well as built-in nylon loop handles
this computer case is very practical and functional i had the thule equivalent for three years and this case is just as nice for less than half the price i found that the zipper on this case is much smoother than the thule the only feature this bag is lacking is a place for documents however , i can get over that , as i have no documents to keep
use it for a lenovo yoga # pro # inch it 's a bit bigger than i need , but , there is good protection and i can carry a patch cable , power cord , screw driver , etc . as well
i did n't like the quality of the sleeve it felt like it is made from cheap material , i gave it away as xmas gift i would not trust this sleeve with my lap top
silk and good appearance it does the purpose i wanted and looks very nice as well i recommend the above for people having mac air # and to protect their
i was a bit skeptical buying a case online for my laptop however , this case fit my new asus # . # inch laptop perfectly it 's sleek and very slim ; easily fits into my bag without taking up too much space i love the style and the color is perfect it does n't feel the least bit cheap , which i had concerns about due to its sleeve design i 'm very happy with my purchase and would absolutely recommend this product
i purchased this to carry my lenovo helix in my `` briefcase `` each day i love the style , the fabric -lrb- waterproof -rrb- , and the look feels more like a folio than a laptop sleeve highly recommend if you are looking for something a little `` different `` from the standard sleeve
this product arrived in good condition and on time holds my # inch laptop with a little room to spare this case is padded , but is not incredibly thick i like the zippered pockets on the front but wish that the rear slip pocket and the inner pocket had snap or velcro closures - something to keep the smaller items from falling out inner pocket is made out of the same material as the liner which makes it not very sturdy would have liked to have seen some pen pockets as well that said , this case is more suited as an on-the-go type bag , for bringing your laptop to and from places such as the coffee shop , library , or classes rather than a business or <unk> setting would recommend this product to those seeking a light duty type bag
bought this for my husband and he loves it - the way it looks and feels only reason i personally did n't like it is because it might be a little too sleek for someone that takes lunch to work only thing you can pack in there along with your laptop is a sandwich bag or any box that 's less than # . # inches in thickness so if you tend to take a bigger box for lunch and prefer everything in one bag , then this bag is n't for you
i received this bag the beginning of august the styling was quite <unk> liked the look of the leather and canvas although was a little uncertain about the quality of the clasps -lrb- they look a little flimsy -rrb- i 've only used it # times , and never with anything particularly heavy in it -lrb- i wear a backback on those days to save my back ! -rrb- however , the stitching on one side has begun to unravel at the place where the strap clasps to the bag after # light uses , the bag is unusable unless i have it taken somewhere to have the strap sewn back on i liked the look of the bag but i 'm giving it # star because of the very poor quality
i was very excited to purchase this item as i had purchased one as a gift and the <unk> really likes it i was sent a damaged item that already been returned by someone else how did i know this the rma ticket from the first purchaser was still in the bag i was easily able to return the item for a refund , but somebody <unk> big time
the clasp on the shoulder strap broke the first day my son used it to much hassle to return it , so my husband used <unk> tape to hold it together
the look of the bag is great with nice leather having said that , on the third day of using the bag , and with a only a few papers and an umbrella in it the buckle completely snapped making the handle useless the bag literally fell to the ground while i was walking with pieces of metal buckle all over very poorly made returned and will not be <unk> this bag
not the best bag honestly , the canvas strap broke on me in only # days , showing that it was not very durable at all secondly , i felt when i put a book and my laptop in it , the shape of the bag looked unattractive i feel it did not fit my lap even alone well overall i was unhappy with this bag
i ordered this bag to replace another bag from another brand that i had hoping that it will last longer than the other bag that i had the design of the bag drew me to purchase it but after a a few months one of the buckles that hold the bag close decided to get loose and now it 's impossible to close if only it happened during the return policy i would 've returned it , but since it 's long pass due i can not return the item and now i am stuck with a useless bag good thing i still like the bag if only the buckles would last longer than a few months and now i have to purchase another bag to replace this
the top handle is made out of a really thin piece of leather i bought it to use as a laptop bag , i would n't ever hold the bag from that handle because it 's so weak and i 'm scared it 's going to break
i get compliments on this bag all the time , i use it every day to carry my laptop to work . the materials are nice , the leather flap is genuine and heavy duty the strap is nice , and adjustable . good pockets on the inside my two qualms are this , the top zipper doesnt work very well , and always requires two hands and the bottom portion of the bag is very flimsy , meaning it falls in on itself all the time , could use a little <unk>
the bag is nice , i admit that it 's a bit small for a # inch macbook , but fits it very snugly very good for the price , but within two days of using it , the metal clip that connects the shoulder strap to the bag broke such that it 's very loose and opens up by itself this would n't be that annoying if i had n't just traveled abroad for # months and need to use it all the time all in all , like the bag , maybe i just got a defective one
the bag is a bit too flimsy for my preference and the leather looks very scratched in person the hand strap and shoulder strap are very thin and uncomfortable to grasp the bag <unk> weirdly when you put any heavy textbooks inside
good looking and quality bag it can not hold a standard # inch laptop i would advise not getting this bag for anything larger then a # inch laptop or tablet
good bag , but the buckle on the handle broke a week after i got it i had it replaced at a local shoe repair shop other than the cheap hardware , the quality was good
it 's a beautiful looking bag i get compliments on it all the time however , the straps are uncomfortable and way to thin for my liking the buckles are weak and are hard to clip in , and the leather is scratchy however , there is suprisingly a large <unk> of space in this bag and lots of pockets with zippers overall : # <unk> : # <unk> : #
this bag is stylish and i get a lot of compliments on it the downside of the bag is the big metal zipper i have to be so careful sliding my laptop in the bag because the opening is so tight that the metal zipper will scratch the face of the laptop i have actually taken an <unk> from my other laptop bag and started <unk> my laptop in this before sliding it past the zipper
excellent quality bag bought for husband 's birthday gift and am very pleased with purchase fits laptop nicely a couple additional pockets would be nice but overall am happy with purchase
the bag is very good looking and fits a laptop reasonably well just note it is not very wide , a few files and a laptop would fit , but not much more do n't expect a lot of room for many cords , cables , etc .
great-looking bag , nice material if it holds up over time , i 'll be a big fan it feels a little flimsy , but that does keep the weight down i 'll revise my review in # months once i know about how well it lasts
delays in the receipt of goods , a good package , i thought the whole leather fortunately , looks good , the capacity is large enough , can put on a lot of things out but prices generally
i really like this bag i only had two issues was not large enough for my laptop , and the handle detached after a week of use the bag is really durable , so maybe i just received a defective one other than that i really like this bag
the bag looks good , and fits a legal pad , ipad , and a couple of books without a great deal of bulging i did notice some minor workmanship issues with the leather
this is the best laptop travel bag i 've ever had quality and build are excellent and flawless i am a warrior traveler -lrb- i got more miles in me that red cells ! -rrb- and i can tell you this bag is all you 'll ever need got it a couple months ago and it has already been in england , ireland , colorado , and florida many more miles to come for this bag for sure stylish and vintage looking bag , but still will look elegant with anything you wear very comfortable to carry , especially when you use it cross style will give it # starts if i could
the bag looks great , just like the picture i hope my # year old son loves it i wanted an all leather but the cost of this one was so much better
very good quality and looks great it relies on a zipper to keep closed , the good thing is that the zipper is again , good quality and heavy duty this bag just fits my # & # # ; macbook pro -lrb- ddr # -rrb- so the newer solid states should fit nicely this bag also has many nice storage compartments which i did n't even realize when i bought it all and all a great satchel that looks great , works well and should last a long time
i read reviews saying that this bag was smaller than it looks , so i bought it to use as my <unk> bag i love it the leather flap is wearing nicely and looks great i 've been carrying it for a couple of weeks and all handles and clasps feel
good quality and durable , i 've got a lot of compliments on it , on the subway and at school my only issue is it 's rather slim , it can only hold my laptop and maybe one book but i can live with that
