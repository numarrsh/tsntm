i searched for a good laptop backpack for my # inch hp laptop and found this bag in amazon it is good for $ # when compared to other brands like targus , swiss gear which costs more than $ # however my # inch laptop does not fit completely into this bag i had to struggle every time to close the zip as the laptop protrudes out a bit also i found the same laptop bag in another shop for $ # i feel the price is little high in amazon
overall , it is a nice bag for the price however , it barely fits a # inch laptop as advertised we really had to squeeze the laptop in , and the zipper was stressed i hope the zipper holds up under the pressure
i bought a hp # inch laptop and was hoping that this backpack would work , but it is just a little too small i really like it and if i had a smaller laptop it would be perfect , but i am going to have to return it i think it is funny though that a # inch hp laptop does not fit in a # inch hp made backpack i gave it # stars since it is a nicely made backpack with plenty of space and compartments for books and such , but i am sad it doesnt fit the one item i bought if specifically for
this is a very beautiful bag with plenty of storage space apart from a # `` laptop however i found its strength to <unk> average it stands nowhere infront of swissgear 's <unk>
received on second day after the order was placed -lrb- as promised -rrb- was up to the expectations spacious enough to accommodate my <unk> other stuff that i would prefer to have in back pack
ordered this backpack for my daughter 's high school graduation and filled it with lots of supplies needed for college the backpack is loaded with lots of room and seems to be a well designed and sturdy backpack for its money the picture here looks like a purplish color but it is not -- definitely grey the color was a little disappointing but kept the backpack because it seems to a great backpack for the $ $ $ many laptop backpacks were over $ # . # hope it holds up while she is in college she used a backpack that i bought very cheap at walmart during her high school years and it lasted over # years the zipper just broke this year so she did get lots of use of it and hope this backpack will do the same seems to be a good backpack for the price i will write back after it is used for awhile
i had this for about # years it worked well for my # `` hp inspiron laptop i especially liked all the different pockets , side pockets , etc . it was very easy to use for travel -lrb- i was traveling by plan every week for work -rrb- and i could easily access all the spaces as needed -lrb- during security at airport for example -rrb- i finally got rid of it when i got rid of the laptop additionally , the right strap padding was getting shredded , though this was the only breakdown of the bag that i had in that three years it would have have gotten a # star rating if not for the shred i will note that for a couple of years , i was lugging # laptops at the same time in this bag -lrb- # and # ``
the backpack overall is great , but is a very tight fit for my sony vaio ar # e # `` to zip it up i have to force the material over the laptop corners with no room for cushioning from the top the key factor is the amount of trim around the screen if there is wide trim , it will be a very tight fit if your laptop has a thin trim around the screen and/or the screen is a little less than a true # `` , it might not be so bad as a side note , it works great for transporting smaller laptops as well as game system with a few games -lrb- ps # for example -rrb- nonetheless , if you 're careful with it and do n't allow the top to suffer impact , it works fine i have had it over a year and no material defects yet
i bought # of these one for myself and one for my husband our laptops are actually # . # inches so the laptops just fit so if you have a # . # inch laptop - you might want to get a different backpack but since we do n't do a lot of traveling with our laptops this works just fine for us you can fit all of your accessories in there -lrb- charger , power cord , mouse , etc . . it seems to be sturdy enough and we are enjoying the ability to travel with our laptops as needed
it 's a great bag , very convenient , tons of pockets -lrb- which i love -rrb- but i have had a pretty difficult time finding a really durable book bag for my books , etc . since high school they all rip apart , this one included however , at least this one lasted about a year before the shoulder strap first started coming apart now , it 's separating in places that does n't get a lot of wear and tear luckily , i only really need this bag for another # weeks since i will be graduating , however , it would be really nice to have a nice bag to carry my laptop and other paperwork in after graduation
good quality backpack but a bit tight for use with a # inch notebook ... at least my hp # `` notebook but with a bit of pushing and shoving , it does fit
i have a # `` hp laptop and the pack hold it , accessories , and any other items very well they only reason i did n't give it # stars is because when the pack is fully loaded , its not the most comfortable -lrb- not bad , but still not the best -rrb- i do however carry around a bit while i 'm traveling , so for everyday use this pack is perfect when it just has the laptop and small items its very comfortable overall a great pack ! ... especially if you have a larger laptop
very good <unk> bag took to <unk> with me and it did great i would recomend this bag to anybody looking the only thing it does not have is a water bottle
good back , provides good protection for laptop the side straps help keep it compact i do wish that it had a compartment for a water bottle this backpack lasted me about # months before the inside started to slightly rip because i tried to fit so many books inside it for such a long time
purchased this bag so i could use it to carry my # `` dell lap top to class its a snug fit for now it may stretch a little bit -lrb- i hope -rrb- but the strap on the inside to secure the lap top will not fit around my # `` lap top however , it will hold it securely inside the back pack
it 's a good backpack i bought it to lug my old hp laptop around and it works well as just a regular backpack too i actually do n't need to carry around my laptop with it but it does a great job with the laptop when i need to bring it around with me all in all , it 's a good buy
i got this for my husband who needs a good durable backpack that can be rough handled and so far it is doing the job this backpack has to be able to hold a laptop and commute on nyc subway , get stuck between subway doors and still survive and have plenty of compartments plus for hidden side bottle holder
this product was as described and got here on time the only feedback i want to <unk> is that it was packed in a huge box and i had to pay more than what it was necessary for the freight
for the price , the backpack is perfect i bought it for my boyfriend and he has been using it ever since it fits his # `` hp laptop and still has some room for other stuff
the product is very useful for students it is very handy to carry your files , books and your laptop in this bag it is very handy as it provide enough room to carry # text books and clip file , along with your laptop it also has a separate section to hold your pens , mobile phones and wallets it is really worth buying this bag
after reading many reviews on many different backpacks , i <unk> that a # `` backpack for my # . # `` laptop was a better idea it fits perfectly , by that i mean if my laptop was any bigger then it would n't fit in the pocket that hp has made for it it 's a great pack for # `` 's but i would n't suggest it for anything bigger
i purchased this backpack to replace my hp black half leather laptop bag that was really heavy and worked for # years <unk> any problems so i bought this lightweight back pack price was the factor it does not feel as heavy as i thought but hey with this price its the best backpack that you can ever get . my # . # inch laptop is safe and i can carry my <unk> and couple of books in it i dont get tired by carrying this one around all the padding inside is good and light weight i know it wont last as long as my last hp laptop bag did which is still good if you feel you want a backpack that will last # , # years and move around a lot this is just right
this is the second time i have purchased this laptop backpack by hp i was first attracted to it for its sturdy look and construction , the number of practical compartments , and the fact that it could hold up to a # & # # ; laptop computer the first backback i purchased did the job for me i took it on several business trips - it could fit not only a standard # & # # ; laptop but several large file folders as well the straps were easily adjustable for different size & # # ; loads . & # # ; the construction proved to be sturdy over time -lrb- i did need to replace it because the one i got did have a tiny tear in one of the straps that got larger over time . this second backpack is equally as good , if not better i have actually been able to pack up to two computers into it and it still does not seem overly bulky or strained i will come back to this backpack again and again - well worth the relatively modest price
prompt delivery of product got this back pack for my # . # `` laptop and the laptop fits snugly in the bag slightly too small for a # . # `` laptop but it serves it 's purpose
i originally bought this for my brother who had a thicker gaming laptop it did not fit so i kept it for myself it is very nice i like the extra pockets and wide shoulder straps keep in mind it is for thinner # inch notebooks
this works very nicely and i have no problem recommending it if the price is right however , the side straps tend to get in the way when you are trying to unzip two of the three main compartments
plenty of compartments to put laptop -lrb- mine has a # . # `` screen -rrb- , cables , mouse , portable hd , and a whole <unk> of <unk> good bag . $ # . # is a great price i had free shipping
holds a # in laptop snug but not tight also has enough pockets for a four class college schedule sturdy , with very comfortable shoulder straps that cinch just tight enough for a small woman to comfortably tote things around without fear of it falling off
i needed to get a bag for laptop this came in handy for our <unk> able to pack many things in , and have room to spare plus it works great for carry on
glad i got this turned out to way better quality then i thought it would be . has plenty of storage . compared to the asus bag i was going to get . the asus only has compartments
this bag has held up for months now i carry my laptop , extra power cord , data cables and adapters it holds a decent amount of equipment i am glad i got the bag
i could not find anything even close to this in the store for less than # bucks ! this is exactly what i wanted for my hp # . # screen laptop the velcro strap will not close but it fits snugly in the laptop sleeve anyway so i do n't really need the strap ! i am taking an online course and i put my books , papers , laptop and extra accessories all in this with room to spare ! it seems to be pretty durable to me , however , i do not walk all over campus and it is not being lugged around every day
i 've had this bag for months , it was at one point my everyday travel bag , i was able to carry all my video editing equipment i can fit a # inch macbook pro along with a # inch pc , portable hard drives dvd player , case of dvds , and a few other things this is one of my favorite bags its still going strong no rips or tears and it protects my computers i 've traveled planes , trains and automobiles with this bag and it still kicks
purchased this as a gift for our son item came on time and is exactly as pictured and described compartments are roomy and well organized lap top compartment is decently padded zippers look sturdy as does the overall construction of the bag we 're very satisfied with this purchase
my company has used this exact model to give to employees who have a laptop setup the backpack is very durable , sturdy and stylish the value is high -- the bags last a long time and hold their shape well , and they fit some of the largest laptops available with ease , up to # `` models i would recommend this bag over some others because the pouches and storage areas are easy to get into and the zipper construction is very solid many similar laptop backpacks look great but have zippers that are a little iffy
after a month of using this pack i am glad i bought it i came from a swiss gear , ca n't remember the model , but it was huge and bulky it was a lot more than what i needed this hp pack is light , well-made , and compact i typically carry # `` binders , # medium size books , a # `` laptop , cord and other odds and ends and it still does n't feel bulky to me the mesh drink holder is a bit of a joke so i never use it the only thing i wish it had was an inside pocket with a zipper but overall i think it is a great backpack
my son was delighted that he could fit all the things he needs for school in this bag , along with his new laptop he loves the look of it and hopes to get lots of use out of it
i have just bought it and started using today my # . # inches toshiba laptop fits perfectly and there is n't much room for it to move -lrb- thus it 's less likely to get damaged -rrb- also , there is enough room for a college student to carry # textbooks , besides pockets to carry additional stuff -lrb- ipod , cables etc -rrb- there 's also a bottle holder in the side , which is useful concerning the durability issues , i obviously do not know how good the material is and how long it 'll last , but it seems to be made of a fairly good material so fat so good , paid # bucks for it , awesome purchase
this backpack is perfect for carrying everything that it needs to carry so far it seems to be sturdy and well balanced on the shoulders it has lots of little storage compartment so that you can carry extra pens or calculators , it even has a pouch to hold extra batteries and cords the ipod spot and cord port are also a big plus all in all a very good purchase
this backpack looks pretty good and has enough space to hold what i need i have a # . # inch laptop and it fits well a little tight but good enough
i would recommend everybody to buy this bag it was delivered on time and quality of the back is very good i had n't stuffed the bag much except from my laptop and a book
since this was listed as a # & # # ; notebook case i was concerned that it would not fit my new toshiba qosmio laptop it is a snug fit , but it cradles the computer inside its well padded compartment with extra room and pockets to hold the power cord , transformer , mouse or any other accessories i might need the backpack design allows me to carry it with me on my motorcycle this is a very efficient design and quality constructed case
i have owned this backpack for over # months and it still looks brand new daily it has carried two laptops , notebooks , textbooks and all the accessories there is no sign of wear on this thing it also has pockets everywhere i could want them i am seriously thinking about buying another one just in case this one does eventually wear out
just got it for christmas and so far i love it it takes my # `` laptop and books no problem sturdiness seems good only time will tell just love not having to carry two bags
i bought this for my son as he got a new hp # & # # ; laptop for christmas that did not fit in his current school backpack the quality seems nice with sturdy straps and seems only time will tell if it holds up to daily school use the laptop barely fits in the padded leave , but , it zips just fine however , there 's a velcro tab on the sleeve that is completely useless since it does n't come close to fitting over the end of the laptop -lrb- maybe if it was a # & # # ; -rrb- i will try to update this review as to its wear when school ends
always wanted this back pack , very loyal hp consumer unfortunately i did not have a laptop so when i received a hp pavilion dv # series laptop , as a gift , this was the first thing i ordered just very happy with the look and functionality of the product and very pleased with the timely manner it was delivered
i liked very much my backpack it 's perfect to carry my hp notebook the computer 's compartment is perfect my laptop fall down on the airport 's floor and the backpack protected it there is a lot of pockets to carry other items like pens , pencils , palms , ipods , cell phones etc . i really liked oh , it 's very stylish too , modern
good product , good sound quality , video and picture , recommended for those who want to enjoy something good price , well wrapped and arrived in perfect condition in reality i can not complain and i recommend the seller <unk> for not having qualified
looks good , feels good , must be good we will see how long it lasts my laptop is # `` and will not fit in most backpacks it is slightly heavier than most so i wanted a bag that would not add alot of extra weight this one is light and comfortable i have not had it long enough to throw it around alot yet but so far , so good it appears to be stitched to last my favorite part is that i can load many extras in the bag then throw it onto my back and the weight of my laptop is evenly distributed so that i hardly notice it lots of pockets for everything i wish it came in pink
i use this backpack to carry my laptop , plug & mouse + my lunch and even a book or two while i bike # miles to work the bag sits nicely on my back and does n't swing around even without the <unk> strap on the front there are # huge pockets , # front pockets for keys and other miscellaneous items , and side pockets as well it is well designed and durable highly recommended for bike travel
i 've been looking for the perfect laptop bag for my perfect laptop brand , and this is what i found it has three big pockets and two small ones it also comes in inside small pockets in the front for <unk> , memo books , etc . i could store my laptop , books , ipad , and other accessories with no problems i use this bag for college , going out , plane trips , and other occasions i would recommend this bag for any hp laptop <unk>
bought this for my sister <unk> much cheaper than any other backpack laptop and it fits my # & # # ; dell love it and recommend it to anyone looking for this type of carrier on a
good quality and good looking backpack holds laptop with its accessories has a good space to hold other items too a small umbrella , books , papers , mobile accessories it arrived on time and in prefect condition
this backpack is perfect for the latest -lrb- <unk> # -rrb- # inch macbook pro , and is a cheap solution beside this there are many pockets of different size , where you can store your remote , changer , and other electronics , without the risk of damage
my laptop fits snug and the extra pockets have room for my flash drives , power cords , etc . this was a fantastic purchase do not buy a sleeve , unless you want to make the fit tighter the cushions in the bag will do a great job
i can load everything i need in this backpack i carry a laptop , usb headset , keyboard , mouse , and misc . other supplies to the office every day the hp backpack has plenty of storage funny , it took a couple of weeks for me to find the middle zipper compartment the flap hides it so it 's not immediately noticeable i looked at several different backpacks and settled on this one because it would allow me to carry my <unk> laptop now i have a new laptop that 's a little smaller , but i 'd buy this one again if given the opportunity
i am loving <unk> earlier bag used to be bit heavy and so i checked for this and this was awesome it perfectly suits my laptop and also have multiple racks to place my things and it does not look big as much as fit in
we had this bag less than a month before the cheap plastic strap connector broke and sent my brand new macbook pro onto the ground in addition to having a fairly expensive -lrb- now junk -rrb- bag , my new computer was dented in the corner <unk> the warranty this bag is horrible and overpriced too
purchased two of these bags for my wife at christmas she used one of the bags for about # weeks <unk> the pocket snap broke off very cheap aluminum snap that breaks very easy the shoulder strap end ring that is connected to the bag is already lose and ready to come off these bags look great and my wife and her friends loved them , but they are so cheaply made that they wo n't last long
i bought this bag for my # `` macbook and i find it a little big in the sense that my macbook moves around a lot inside if i do n't have anything else in there with it the first time my boyfriend saw the bag he said it was ugly and absolutely refused to carry it for me -lrb- calling it a purse -rrb- and i still have n't really decided whether or not i like it it is very sleek and slim , stylish i 'm still <unk> the brown is nice but i think black would been a little better because it goes with more stuff i 'm not sure it was really worth the price and i was too lazy to send it back for a refund i did however use it as a weekend bag and i was able to fit an entire weekend worth of clothes in there -lrb- without the laptop -rrb- and my makeup purse and wallet
i actually saw this bag in the apple store for $ # . # , so i was thrilled to find it on amazon for $ # . # the brown color is complemented by the beautiful <unk> green lining and it fits my macbook pro perfectly theres a bit of a bulge , but the power cord does fit into the outer pocket i plan on keeping a pair of headphones , my school planner and an ipod cord in there as well my only complaint is that the shoulder strap and zipper pull are black , which shows a little bit of oversight design wise i 'm a design major , so all the details count to me luckily , my camera bag is brown , so i stole the strap from it also , its washable , which is a huge plus i 'm really picky about my things , but i highly reccommend this stylish bag as an alternative to a boring black one i 'll never have any <unk> with other peoples ' laptop bags
this is a good case for my # `` acer laptop it fits well and i still have a little room for some papers and/or cord/charger , if needed well cushioned and the <unk> are a must it comes with a shoulder strap , which i did n't expect -lrb- nor needed -rrb- a bit pricey , but generally a good buy
i love the handles on the case as well as the pouch in front it is very bright green -lrb- as compared to the picture -rrb- but that was what i was looking for -- just be warned the case has been working out perfectly for my needs and i highly recommend it to anyone looking for a solid case that 's easy to carry in and out of a backpack
i love this bag i have a new macbook and i find that this is a great case for it its protective , stylish and the material is unique i do n't feel that my computer is loose or anything the neoprene is a light material so it moves to your movement i am a college student so i feel that style fits very well with my lifestyle i have had many compliments and plan on getting more than one color when i have the money
i bought this case based on other reviews and let me say that i was not disappointed it fits my macbook pro perfectly ; nice and snug and it 's very easy to carry ; light weight and not uncomfortable i get more compliments on this ` sleeve ' than i do on other laptop cases and even my laptop holds my cords and a calendar ; not the most room but i just wanted something to protect my macbook
i first saw this bag in the apple store at a much higher price i was able to see it before i ordered it from amazon its a great bag , its light weight , fits my mac book perfectly also has a side pocket for notebooks , cables etc . the strap is padded and very comfortable so all and all i think its a great bag .
i 've literally been searching for what i consider to be the perfect laptop sleeve for # years this is it ! ! it 's tight enough to be a sleeve so i can throw it in a bag but also the convenience of the handle and front pocket
i rarely use that word but this bag was perfect i wanted to bring my laptop with me on vacation but refused to bring my briefcase i only wanted it for <unk> , and to download photos from my camera this case was small , easy to carry , protective for the laptop , and with enough storage space for just the right peripherals and my beach novel the fact that it has handles as well as a shoulder strap is a big plus , and i could lean it against the desk without it sliding down to the floor it looks good as well this is well worth the premium over other sleeves
i 've had smaller laptop bags that both protected my laptops better and still offered me plenty of space to put things away this thing can barely hold my laptop and papers let alone the adapter or extra cables it defeats the purpose of even bothering with a laptop bag i 'm gon na have to try and sell it or give it away
i highly recommend you not to buy this as this doesnt have any extra storage space even power adapter case is quite snuggly and i am <unk> buying this item i cant even store my ipod in this case the finishing of the product is smooth and leather quality is descent but its not multipurpose
i wanted a really compact notebook case that i could throw in a larger briefcase or backpack or carry-on bag when necessary this is as minimal as it gets since there is n't any room for anything but a few papers but i knew that before buying it , so i 'm not complaining -lrb- though a tiny bit of space for something -rrb- wound be nice i bought the leather one instead of the nylon one and am regretted it the leather looks really cheap -lrb- like vinyl -rrb- , the shoulder strap and the ac adapter add-on are both nylon imo , that just looks stupid having part leather , part nylon while i did n't use it to lug around my macbook , the padding does look nice & solid and would almost certainly offer good protection i 'll probably order the nylon model instead but i 'm also going to look around for other options
this seems to be the best case for the macbook and a great bargain at the amazon price of $ # the size is just right and the macbook fits snugly in the case there is a pouch for the ac adapter too everything in the case seems to be of good quality and brenthaven has a lifetime guarantee on the case the only thing i did n't like was the velcro lining inside it would have been better if they had just sewn it in seeing the velcro , i opened it up mistakenly thinking that maybe i could store something there i put the velcro back but could n't get it to be totally flush with the cover its not a big deal and i still consider this a # star case -- but , if you buy this , just do n't mess with the velcro
this is an excellent product and fits macbook better than any other case available in market i <unk> around each and every store , bought a targus case & returned it as i was not satisfied . i bought this one and i am really happy i could find the right case on amazon light <unk> padding to protect your <unk> look with leather <unk> fits only the macbook and the adapter not for people who want to carry other accessories like <unk> <unk> i will surely recommend this <unk> to every one who owns a macbook
this bag was perfect for my macbook it was elegant , beautiful and my mb just fit perfect into it beside i did pay more than u $ # when i bought it , im very happy cause my mb are completly protected again everything
i also received this bag as a gift at first i loved the lining as it was different from other bags and not so boring it has an organizational flap , but the downside is that it does not expand , so it is a tight squeeze for daily items there is a divided compartment -lrb- for filing -rrb- also , but it barely can hold a standard sheet of paper , and like the front pocket does not expand at all i only used the bag for two days before i returned it the weight is not distributed well and it is very heavy on one shoulder also , the coloring on the vinyl handles rubbed black on my blazer it already looked worn , but was still new not a great investment piece
i loved this bag it is professional , durable , and roomy however , the bag by itself is heavy add a laptop , some papers , and accessories ... and you will curse the day you bought this bag and once this baby is stuffed full of your precious possessions , it also becomes quite uncomfortable to maneuver in a crowded bus -lrb- or other form of public transportation -rrb- if you drive around and only need to get from the car to office to car again , the heavy factor may not be an issue but if you take public transportation and have to walk a lot , think again overall , this bag has been with me through thick and thin the handles started to fray after about a year , which was to be expected now i 'm having lots of issues finding a replacement for this `` almost `` perfect bag
it 's a great bag and the perfect size for me i love the fact that the zippers open all the way around the problem is that the handles are made of some sort of cheap vinyl type material after carrying the bag for about a year the handles are frayed and look terrible , time to replace it
the size is good -lrb- fits a # -in macbook pro -rrb- and the shape is slim enough to look professional the exterior looks as if it would repel rain and wipe off easily for the price -lrb- made in china even if it is a swiss company -rrb- , i thought i 'd keep it for business <unk> when i need to carry a laptop and various other items however , after i took all the tags off and carried it around the house for a minute , i realized that the <unk> zippers were way too noisy for a business setting the six `` jingling `` zipper pulls are the equivalent of wearing big , noisy earrings not for me
as a consultant constantly on the go , this bag works great as a `` mobile office `` room for my # . # `` laptop , the charger , folders , and office supplies the laptop does n't fit in the actual laptop part though , but fits in the middle compartment
i have had # of these bags , and they really are a dream -- roomy , sturdy , cheery interior the only problem is that the straps are vinyl this bag is my portable office , and i go everywhere with it but the bags only last # years because the <unk> straps wear out seriously , i now have to buy a # rd , not because the bag is worn , but because the straps are shot and are holding on by a thin piece of fabric wenger , pay attention this is a dream bag -- the very best on the market -- but it 's time to make those straps real leather
although this is advertised as a <unk> bag , i use mine for an everyday shoulder bag it is well constructed , which is good , because i have alot of stuff to carry also , it has alot of compartments for me to store my things overall , i am happy i made this purchase
this is my second one the last one i had lasted about # years and the strap started to fray there is so much room in this for your large laptop and all kinds of other items its also elegant for women must have for someone who travels for work due to all storage space
i found this bag to be very useful it 's great for notebook as well any other important paper work i also like using this along side <unk> klein nancy laptop bag it gives a certain professional style in any case , i recommend getting this bag it 's fantastic
just bought this bag at best buy very cute and stylish i holds my # . # inch macbook nicely along with it 's accessories and a cooling stand also it holds my organizer not meant for large laptops , only up to # . # w it comes with an additional accessory case the filing pocket does fit standard size # / # x # paper the sides open enough to place papers or items in but does not open to a # degree angle i read the first review and i hope she had a defective one
i travel extensively for work after my first trip with it , i can say it <unk> every other bag i have ever had the internal compartment just barely fits my # / # `` laptop , but it does fit i can pack more files and accessories into this bag without <unk> the zippers than i could with any other bag the multiple zippered and unzippered compartments make organization easy contrary to some other reviewers , i find this bag to be lighter than many others i have had the material looks nice , but is durable enough that i do n't worry about tossing it around finally , the <unk> interior is just fun a great bag
i was recently upgraded to a # `` monster of a laptop and needed a lightweight solution to tote it around with while carrying everything necessary to handle a meeting i came across this bag and instantly fell in love with it it is lightweight , keeps me completely organized , fits and protects my laptop , all the while being stylish and professional it has comfortable straps and the feet on the bottom of it help to keep it protected from dirt and grime the inside has a very cheery and colorful lining which is a nice added touch so far this bag has been able to accomodate all of my business needs
love the style and print in the inside of the bag i was nervous about buying it without seeing it first , but am very impressed with the quality and craftsmanship
a nice , stylish bag that works perfectly with my dell # & # # ; laptop i still have room for binders , notebooks , pens , notes , and a nice place to stash my keys and phone
i got one of these for my daily commute because my previous bag was too wide to fit on my lap on the bus seat without poking the person next to me or sticking out into the aisle this bag is fabulous it holds my laptop nicely in the padded pocket , and i can pack # inches of <unk> next to it i have no problem fitting plenty of stuff in the outside pockets - i usually carry glasses <unk> - <unk> , etc . it does what i need it to do i get so many compliments on the bag , and i love the colorful surprise inside my only complaint is that if it 's empty it 's kind of floppy , so it does n't sit on my lap that well on the bus other than that , i love it
the handle grip started falling apart from the bottom , not to mention the fraying seam stitches they rejected to honor their life-time warranty and wanted me present a receipt for warranty coverage it did n't matter that the product was a gift with no receipt , nor that many years have gone by these guys are not like jansport which honored their warranty without the excuse of a receipt
the bag is nice and of decent construction , but i ca n't recommend it because the zippers absolutely stink from day # the zippers were rough and one finally broke after about # months of use they need to use <unk> zippers and not the cheap junk that renders this bag very <unk>
about a month ago i probably would have given this product a rating of # or # , but after less than # months of use the seam on the zipper of the main compartment is coming apart i might expect that kind of quality from a # or # dollar backpack not a backpack that costs over # dollar
plenty of pockets , if not over stuffed seems to be of rough and tumble <unk> as the title said - <unk> <unk> was # weeks to india , through the middle east - both ways but on a day trip to ohio , the zipper on the pc compartment failed the coil separated from the material of the zipper * sigh * and it started out with much promise vendor for this item followed through on prompt delivery as promised , rating is for the product not the vendor vendor gets a # star in my opinion
this is my second wenger backpack even though they are billed as swiss products they really are n't ; they are made in china like most everything else the backpack lasted a while until a zipper malfunction not caused by rough usage hopefully wenger will honor my warranty claim my first wenger backpack needed a warranty claim and the new one is falling apart now too these work until you are doing real outdoor activity
the backpack is very good for carrying around your laptop because of how much padding it has it is very protective i myself tried to use this for school but its just to bulky to carry books in i dont recommend using this for carrying books unless you have no problem with a huge
this is a great bag as far as comfort and security of the laptop goes it is well padded and the shoulder straps have excellent shock protection and give i travel often and find that the backpack is quite bulky and heavy when i use it i feel like the bag is the same size as i am overall a good bag but could be made smaller -lrb- but for a # . # `` laptop -rrb- and lighter
the bag is great , it fits not only your computer but your million and one other gadgets that you may need to carry around i used the bag for three months , almost daily and then the chest strap broke it cracked and then fell off unfortunately , the bag does not have a back up strap that goes around the waist i tried to wear the bag w/o the strap but i find that it puts a pretty intense amount of pressure on your shoulders
the bag is wonderfully made and designed , but you should know this is a very bulky and <unk> backpack the design is great for laptops etc . but the size and weight are really suitable for an overnight bag , which does n't really work with this backpack since the spaces are not designed for it overall , would have gone with another for my needs , but could easily see others being very happy with it
ok , so i got this backpack , and it has n't been very good . one of the side pockets wo n't open , and i ca n't fit as much as the prior backpack did
these reviews must be from some pretty tall and strong people i am a # ' # college student , who is pretty <unk> by the way , but this synergy backpack was extremely bulky for my stature not only was i <unk> with the appearance , but also the functionality i could only carry two of my # + page books without feeling like i was going to tip over in addition , the straps were possibly too thick as i frequently noticed `` popped `` blood <unk> on my shoulders i suppose i will continue carrying two bags -lrb- one for my laptop and the other for my books , of course -rrb- until i find something better
