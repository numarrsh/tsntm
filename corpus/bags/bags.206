i really wanted to lie this case and i did when i first got it the screen cover and laptop case are very nice bonuses the top and bottom parts snapped on easily enough however , after about a couple of weeks there are already cracks in the top case i 'm returning it and will purchase something else
i like this product the case is a little cheap but i new what i was getting before i ordered it i mostly was looking for something to protect my computer from scratches the keyboard makes it difficult to see the light even when u have it on high power , otherwise it sticks to the keyboard pretty well , and does n't ever move the case was a nice bonus , not sure i would have paid extra for this bundle just to have a cover also the smell everyone is talking about is more like a new car smell less then anything else , it does n't bother us at all the mouse pad is cheap , almost like a plastic piece of paper , do n't rely on that as a great bonus i think i would have been better off just getting the case without the bundle
when the package originally arrived i was pleased the case is fairly good at protecting my laptop , but after about a month the bottom piece cracked the top part has remained in tact the screen protector and sleeve bag are useful the keyboard cover was uncomfortable to type on and would n't completely stick to the keyboard because it was slightly loose and stretched out i ended up later purchasing <unk> - teal keyboard cover silicone skin for apple macbook pro # & # # ; , # & # # ; , # & # # ; which is much better but i will say its a decent bundle package for the price
everyone uses a keyboard cover these days saves the day when it comes to spills i dont know if i needed the neoprene case so much , but the top case keeps my first ever mac from getting scratched does n't make it lighter though
not sure about the product they shipped twice and it seemed to get lost usps always seem to get something lost for me will have to try checking my shipping options before purchasing
the shell is alright but so hard to get off it actually cracked even when i was being careful the laptop does n't fit properly in the soft case when the shell is on it . key board cover is nice
when i first received it , i was very happy with the product however , after using it for about a week . the letters on my keyboard cover started to fade away and since the outside case is not hard shiny plastic , it is almost impossible to remove any stains or <unk> on it also , you have to be really careful while using this product as your macbook 's cover because the color is really bright , therefore all of the stains and <unk> will be extremely visible
if you 're looking for a cheap case , this is a great find the bottom part of the case left lines on the bottom of my mac cheap built , but like i said you get what you pay for
it was okay for the first couple days until the hard case had parts chipping off of it the keyboard protector took a few days to fit properly and the sleeve is very thin it 's not a bad product unless you like me who is n't too easy with stuff
exactly what i expected the hard case fit on perfectly and the keyboard cover works well the plastic screen shield was too hard to get on so i kept it off maybe with two people i could have done it , but could n't get it to line up and not have bubbles the soft envelope case is not the most amazing but it fits and does the job color was just like the pictures overall good product for the price , would recommend
i was glad to see how fast this came - just in time for my niece 's birthday the case fit well , and looks great , and was what she wanted -lrb- always a good thing -rrb- perhaps a little higher quality look with the plastic covers would have been great , but for the price you ca n't beat it thanks so much
easy to use of course there are always bubbles on the screen protector that i ca n't get out but other than that it is perfect protection in a slim package and in a great color i was n't sure about the keyboard cover but <unk> every time i wipe it clean that all that pet hair and dirt would be in my new keyboard already i use a different soft case that is cuter and has a handle but the hard case is great the color of the soft case is a lot lighter and would dirty easily in my life
all the products are great quality just wish the cover was darker and not clear wanted to cover a scratch and can see right through the cover other than that it was amazing will be watching for more
did n't know the snap on case was this type of weird material and is susceptible to get so dirty quick leaves greasy marks and is hard to clean sometimes
case and the keyboard skin fits perfect the only issue i had is that there is a tiny dime sized lighter purple spot but the rest is perfect i think it would be more work to return it so i 'll just deal with it
i just ordered this package for my macbook pro # & # # ; and overall i really like it the bottom hard case fits perfectly and looks great the top hard case also looks really good , but it is not as secured to the computer as i would hope for to be do n't get me wrong , it does n't come off at all , just when i open my computer sometimes i can feel the part that my thumb touches come up a bit the screen protector is great , just a bit hard to put on i still have some small bubbles in mine but as soon as the computer goes on you ca n't notice them the sleeve is great , and does it 's job completely when i read all the comments to see if i should get this package or not i was hesitant because a lot of people said that the sleeve smelled badly when i opened the package it smelled a little bit like factory , but after one day i could n't smell anything anymore the colors are gorgeous and i really think this package is worth buying -lrb- it 's a great deal !
i would recommend this product to all mac users who are in need of a case but are looking for more in a package they keyboard case is convenient and the sleeve is great handle the actual case with care , it can peel otherwise , i am satisfied with my purchase
i love the sleeve and the keyboard cover the plastic hard shell do n't fit , but i think most of the cost of this kit went to the neoprene sleeve , and i 'm extremely satisfied with that
macbook pro # inch -lrb- not retina the product has a nice color that <unk> to both top and bottom the keyboard cover fits well , but it will take time to get used to especially if you 're a faster <unk> the screen protector is hard to apply because the tab is at the bottom right on the back side -lrb- screen side -rrb- a bad thing about the case is the bottom part the part where it clips onto the macbook and the corners of it are scratchy and irritates your skin i was expecting more , but overall , it 's a great product i would recommend it
i give this a # star , because four of the # included parts are excellent -lrb- <unk> mouse pad , thats just a random part that is irrelevant -rrb- , but the screen protector is not good at all i 've used over # <unk> protectors , in the past # years the screen protector is the wrong size , and it near in possible to apply without a ton of bubbling , no matter the method . # % , buy this , but i suggest buying a different screen protector overall , everything else is perfect and feels great to the touch buy , buy ... buy =
i am a college student on a tight budget , and after my recent splurge on a macbook pro i realized that i needed to find a case , sleeve , etc . the first couple stores i went to had sleeves being sold for $ # just the sleeve that was too much for me , so finally i turned to amazon and found this top case bundle deal and for just under a total of $ # it is definitely a deal i received my package earlier than the expected delivery date , and everything was surprisingly good quality i am very happy with my purchase and i would -lrb- will -rrb- definitely purchase from this seller again
the color is a beautiful aqua blue i really bought this because the bundle was a great price the sleeve for the laptop smells like chemicals i washed it and let it air dry outside that removed the smell so far the case is doing its job to protect my macbook pro , but the piece that covers the bottom seems like it might not hold up
nice case and accessories i am happy with it i love the color , really nice and soft i would recommend it , just make sure you are buying the right case for the right computer
i love all components the only reason that the product is # stars is that my cover cracked a little everything else is perfect though and i love the color
the materials fit my computer well and were a great price this would have been perfect if the bottom piece of the case went all the way to the back of the computer and up a little for more coverage other than that these are great
honestly the whole package was a pretty good deal however , i thought that the shell could 've been of a better material but it protects my laptop which was my main concern so overall its a good buy
i like the rubberized case , it seems really supportive , and the keyboard is easy to use once you get used to it the only thing i 'm not a huge fan of is that i 've only had the product for about # months and it is really dirty but , that can always be cleaned great product overall and very durable the sleeve took some getting used to , as well
cheap , it 's alright . the laptop case is a lighter color it 's annoying how whenever i touch the case it leaves a fingerprint good for the price but do n't expect something too high
exactly like the pictures case fits perfect and nice sleeve bag to carry laptop around in keyboard cover fits nice but i have to remove when doing a lot if typing i give it # stars bc i did not receive the mouse pad with the
for the money i paid , i am very pleased with this product you get a lot of products that help protect your computer for very cheap the case itself is solid , and the sleeve is good as well i would recommend this product
i think this bundle is great , i just received it in the mail about an hour ago and set it all up the outer layer of the case actually feels premium but it 's actually a lower grade plastic , looks great though the silicone keyboard cover fits nicely but it can sometimes slip off i tried putting on the screen protector but there were too many bubbles -lrb- i 'm pretty bad at installing these things -rrb- , plus i figured that laptop screens almost never crack so it 's kind of pointless
im really impressed that the the package came in # days earlier than scheduled the case was easy and quick to put i really love the color but the only thing that i did n't like was the screen protector it was tough to put on and plus the air bubbles after you got it on other than that , i really enjoy everything else
the individual products are all very nice the keyboard stays in place and the cover is a nice color the only drawback is that the bottom bit of the main case does n't clip on so well do you need a little bit of tape
this product is exactly the color i wanted the case holds my macbook pro # `` perfectly , but you need to let it air out when it comes because it has a funny plastic smell at first everything works great , including the screen protector it 's a little hard to put on , but that 's because i need to practice not because of the product i new the computer case itself would have little brown specs on it in some places because of other reviews i read before purchasing i was fine with that because the overall quality of the product is good i have recommended this product to every one of my classmates you get what you pay for
this was a awesome package deal the screen protector does n't cover the whole screen but it is still nice however , everything else is pristine , and was just what i was expecting
everything came exactly as it was described online it all fits very well to the macbook pro and the screen protector even came with a free cloth to clean the screen all the colors matched very well the keypad protector is thinner than i expected it to be , however this does n't interfere with its function at all - does n't cause problems trying to type with it on as some other types do the outer case was also very nice , its a sort of durable , memory foam type of material overall i was very pleased and it all seems to be in good quality i would recommend this product to anyone looking to buy all these items separately - it 's an amazing deal if you were to buy these all say in the apple store , you could find yourself at $ # / $ # for the top of the line brands thanks so much
great price , cute set and love the keyboard cover does n't really provide the protection beyond just scratch protection and of course spills on the keyboard ... which is honestly the best part of the set i do n't find typing on the keyboard weird at all
i did not receive the product when it promised , but i do n't care because i have it with me that is it i could n't put the clear protector on because it kept leaving bubbles : -lrb- that is my fault
i bought this for my granddaughter for christmas for her new macbook she was getting for christmas also . she was so excited when she open this . she had no ideal she was getting either one , plus she just loves it . could n't of been any happier ! she told me grandma this is the best christmas ever . she just loves it , price was great ! thank you amazon for having this on your site . if your looking for something an ca n't find it shop amazon ! the price is right an your most surely to find it there just love this site !
i purchased the macbook pro # inch case and it was perfect fit perfectly no scratches on the cover & was shipped very quickly loved that a holder was provided also ! & # #
i got all # in such a good bargain ! the only thing was the screen protector was a little hard to apply without getting any bubbles . . but over all are great products
i just received my case today , before the actual expected delivery date given to me at the time of the order the hot pink color is gorgeous , i absolutely love , everything fit perfectly i already have an lcd screen protector so i did n't use the one included in the bundle -lrb- will save it for next time though -rrb- before i actually purchased the case i was a bit worried about it not being the same color as it is seen on the picture , i figured it was going to be a lighter pink , but no i was wrong , it 's hot pink , just how i wanted it i love it
purchased this for my new macbook and i must say i am in love very fast shipping color is exactly as <unk> in <unk> on with no struggles putting the back or top <unk> cover fits perfectly -lrb- read it caused muffled audio mine sounds just fine sleak , does not make laptop <unk> have been getting non stop compliments on how cute it is and where i purchased happy girl :
exactly what i was <unk> for wanted to let my macbook pro 's color shine through , while hiding some of the scuffs from a previous owner popped the case and keyboard cover on with no problems , the screen was a little more problematic -lrb- but only because i always have trouble with those -rrb- threw the mousepad away -lrb- seems like a waste of <unk> for a laptop set ! -rrb- , but am using the soft carrying case <unk>
i 've been wanting a cover for my macbook pro # & # # ; for quite some time now and i finally purchased one everything arrived in a timely manner and all of the components advertised where in the package this case fits my macbook perfectly the keyboard cover is matches perfectly with the keys i read some prior reviews saying that their did n't match up , but mine did i really like the this case
i recently purchased this item for a friend for her birthday and we both love it i enjoyed it so much that i purchased the black set for myself will definitely order from top case again
i love everything about this it fits my mac perfectly i also love the keyboard cover and computer slip i highly recommend getting this , it will protect your mac and look great
the case fit perfectly and the sleeve is nice too the sleeve gets dirty easily , but it keeps my macbook protected i agree with the other reviews about the funny smell of the sleeve , but i got over it the colors were exactly what i expected i have n't even attempted to put on the screen protector i took my keyboard cover off i do like it , and it keeps my keys clean , but it does get annoying when typing and i ca n't see the black light i simply put on a clear cover and it works better and the spaces between the keys are more defined than the ones provided in the package overall i am satisfied and will order from this user again nothing was damaged or bent when i received it
i love this product it was the exact color shown online everything fits perfectly and it very sturdy as well as light and easy to carry around i would recommend this to anyone who wants to protect their laptop
looking at the reviews , i was a little skeptical about purchasing this set when i received it , i was very satisfied everything fit perfectly and a nice color great product for the price
i bought this for my mac . i absolutely love the case and the key protector . they fit like a glove . the screen protector is great however i wasnt impressed my the sleeve , it feels cheap
the color is vibrant and bright and that 's what i love about it the hard case is durable and the silicone keys give a nice feel when typing the screen protector is a nice add but i had some trouble putting it on without getting small particles stuck in between the sleeve was nice but ripped at the seam after only a few times of use other than that , the material is great for the price i paid
i love this cover the color it true to what you see it delivered on time and a great fit i enjoyed it so much i ordered one for my daughter
it comes with everything and a screen cover i definitely recommend purchasing this if you have a mac but dont wan na spend $ # on a case at the apple
it is a really good product i totally loved it it fit my laptop perfectly , it is cheap , but the quality is not a problem very happy with this purchase
arrived on time and everything fit perfectly no problems at all true color , and well designed i certainly would purchase again and would refer a friend to purchase also
this is a great product and a wonderful deal it came in like # days or less honestly , i chose this and was unaware that it was for a pro and not my macbook air , however , the only thing that does n't fit is the bottom shell everything else fits , despite my mistake , this is pretty much perfect i love it
i have intentions to sell my macbook one day and so the purchasing of this is great all these items are very good the otter case , the pouch , and the keyboard cover are great ! ! ! ! the outer cover is nice to touch and is solid as well the pouch fits the computer perfectly and is made very well the screen protector too is great but i messed it up and had to toss it the keyboard cover while good is too soft and therefore made it uncomfortable to type for me so i do n't really use it
this was a wonderful case for my laptop ; it does just what i needed , it keeps my laptop from sliding off of my bed , helps me hold on to my laptop when carrying it great colors too
i was hesitant about ordering this after reading some reviews i am glad that i decided to go ahead and do it the case is attractive and was easy to attach it fit perfectly it looks great ... even my teenage daughter is envious i really like the removable key cover the carrying case is an extra bonus and i use it daily i could not be more pleased
the bag has a great number of pockets and i liked the unique cover with the metal latch i received the dark <unk> pack with the neon color stripes everything was great , the laptop fit perfectly and i used the small tablet slot for my kindle but only after # days of using the pack , the stitching on the inside liner started to unravel i was n't overloading the bag or anything on top of that , the velcro that secures the inside pockets was coming unstitched as well it does seem like it would handle well in the rain -lrb- perhaps not waterproof -rrb- but i did n't get a chance to test this out i also wish there was a waste strap overall , it 's a nice bag but the one i received was defective
i am new to owning a laptop and needed to find a way to transport my backpack and <unk> to both school and other places instead of a messenger-style bag , i wanted a backpack where i can support the weight on both shoulders instead of just one shoulder -lrb- ergonomics -rrb- the laptop area fits the # & # # ; apple macbook pro with ease -lrb- even with the laptop in the amazon basics sleeve -rrb- the side pockets offer easy access to smaller items -lrb- i keep pens , pencils , and erasers on one side and sunglasses on the other -rrb- the top pockets are where i keep my cables and such for easy access the only drawbacks i see to this backpack are the three inner pockets -lrb- one of which has velcro at the top -rrb- do not close tightly to hold things in place i simply use one of these for snack bars the shoulder straps could use more padding , but are better than some backpacks i 've seen overall , i believe this backpack is a great buy for the price and functions very well for a college student or anyone on the move with a laptop
it would be # starts product if it was better suited for # . # & # # ; laptops in fact i have to push my # . # & # # ; hp probook into the special compartment only with extra effort i would prefer the laptop easy slides inside with minimal tension other <unk> and backpack 's features are excellent
i purchased because i had borrowed my sister 's on my recent trip to vietnam it 's roomy and was able to take it anywhere it 's washable too love the blue color and lots of pockets
i guess everybody has different expectations in different <unk> of life this bag fits me perfectly as a young professional that <unk> to work fits my # in mbp fine not too bulky , but big enough to put in the things i need
maybe i just received a bad one , but neither piece fits correctly the top pops off all the time and the bottom wo n't fit properly at all i do have a # . # & # # ; macbook pro with retina display so i must give it one star because it 's pretty useless to me
the color was exactly the same as on the picture but when i asked my boyfriend if it fit on his mac he said it did n't fit its too small even though it says its for # in mac book pros id <unk> it three stars but the color is the exact same though just not fit as it should be
we have this for the full size macbook pros , and those fit much better , this one releases anytime you pick the whole laptop up on either the top or bottom cover , just not as good a fit
get 's a lot of attention am not sure about the feet and would like a more velvet gripping surface as it sometimes almost slips out of the hand
the case fits well and looks nice the keyboard cover that is included is a nice touch , but gets kind of annoying because it comes up with the screen every time i open up the computer
at first i missed a couple of spots where the clips are supposed to hook in it helps to get a full # view of what you 're doing close the macbook , and turn it whatever direction you need to in a order to see what you 're doing if it seems loose , you 've missed a clip
it 's a bit darker than i 'd expected , but fine otherwise be careful - if you like to use decals or other stickers , this blue will definitely make it much harder to see them
the hardshell plastic case looks great great for its price , the free keyboard cover was cheap and i could n't stop <unk> at it so i threw it away but to be fair it was a freebie if you want a high quality cover and you do n't mind spending a more it would definitely be worth it to upgrade but if you want something thats looks good and does the job this case is fine
it came pretty fast ; the parts all fit perfectly however , the upper side of the cover is hard to take off once you put it on i tried to take it off and clean it but fearing i would scratch it instead , i did n't get it off it 's pretty
i love the keyboard case and color very vibrant and pretty packaging was very good keyboard cover is very flimsy and i do n't really care for it i honestly ca n't compare it with anything else , because i have not looked at anything else
i has a speck case for about a month and it broke all to hell with very <unk> use after just a month tabs came off , bottom was falling off , awful for a # dollar cover so i decided to go cheap this time much better case at a much better price . yeah , it 's a little slippery feeling after the soft touch speck , but if this case splits after a month i 'd be really surprised i also not that it seems to add less thickness than the old case , which is nice they included a clear keyboard <unk> , which i really did n't care for , and i tossed it
very reasonably priced , beautiful color -lrb- blue -rrb- , easy to place onto macbook pro , and easy to clean the design is well thought out as well -- the computer does not get too hot thanks to the built-in ventilation slots on the bottom of the case
my <unk> brother is n't exactly easy on his tech products he keeps his iphone in an otterbox -lrb- for those who are n't familiar with that , it 's basically a <unk> <unk> for your iphone -rrb- he 's been using this on his laptop and has yet to accumulate a scratch or complain about anything that 's as good a review as i was looking for
as long as you understand it is something you buy for # usd you should be happy the legs seem better than its earlier version , but again i just need it to survive a year . it is perfect for people that go through airport and sit in meeting with # more macbooks
good shell , looks to be good quality it mounts securely and does not have any <unk> areas , at least right now comes with a keyboard cover made from a very gummy bear type rubber and does a decent job for free do n't know if it is comparable to speck , but until then it does the job i gave it # stars because it does not have any down sides as of this time i will update after some sustained use
i love this case it is strong and it even has a small kick stand on the bottom to make it easier to type on the keyboard glad i purchased it and i even purchased one for my # & # # ; mac
this product was excellent value for the price other comparable items were $ # or more it is very lightweight , does not add much in thickness to my mac , and is good looking as well
very pretty blue , fits like a glove and it protects the imac from getting scratches did n't care for the keyboard cover that came with it . it did not fit and everytime you opened your computer the rubber cover would shift i do not use the keyboard cover
i bought this for a # . # -inch macbook pro with retina display it fits like a dream , and seems very durable , though i have n't tested it yet , ; -- rrb- love the keyboard shield with it seems to protect well from <unk> of junk in the keyboard , with which i have had problems in the past the shield does need to be <unk> periodically , but that is easy enough to do beautifully stylish complement to my computer many thanks to awkward <unk> for his video on how to put the ipearl cover on the computer very <unk> and made the process easy
i chose this because i was really happy with the ipearl mcovers protecting my nook color and nook tablet and have been very happy with it my macbook goes with me everywhere so it 's important to have something else that can take the scuffs and shocks as well as help me distinguish my macbook from the others out there this cover does that and helps provide space for good airflow underneath to keep things cool
i had to send my mac book in for service and the clips broke off during removal so i ordered another one slight changes on the new version , but overall same great product i have tried several cases , but this is by far the best
got the blue color , and it 's a nice deep blue -lrb- a tad darker than the photo , but great looking -rrb- the plastic is a matte effect , so it should n't show scratches as much as my previous gen mbp 's clear speck case did the case did n't come with installation instructions , but it 's fairly self-explanatory the top of the cover , though took just some guessing as to which direction was correct there are little arrow <unk> in the cover , and those should be pointing down towards the hinge edge of the screen -lrb- there will be two clips holding on each <unk> side of the screen , and two holding onto the edge above the <unk> camera the fold out feet on the bottom are a nice touch the case also came with a bonus <unk> touch stylus and a clear silicone keyboard cover , too thanks mcover ! : -rrb- get this case
this case is rock solid and the extendable rear legs is genius fits perfectly , adds nice touch and excellent venting very unobtrusive and allows for me to put it into a dock you ca n't beat the price , and it 's probably the best overall value for a macbook pro case i also bought the clear shell love it , love it , love it
this case is incredible for only being $ # plus a free keyboard cover the color adds a nice touch to my retina macbook pro -lrb- yes the apple logo does shine though -rrb- all ports are very accessible , easy to install , kickstands are very useful , which help with <unk> if you 're doing something intense on the computer the keyboard cover is not appealing because there is a big ipearl logo on the space bar i have yet to take off this case as it was installed the first day i got the retina mbp overall , definitely recommend this over the more expensive cases out there
upon purchasing this cover , i thought it would be similar to the cover i had for my # `` macbook it was not at all it looks very nice when on the computer , but <unk> it is terrible the clips to hold it to the bottom portion of the laptop are in just the right place that it rubs against your wrist and is sharp when i decided to send it back , it took me about # minutes plus some missing skin on my fingertips to get it off the computer not made with comfort or functionality in mind
it arrived with a long scratch on it it 's a little heavy easy to put on and no trouble with it since the keyboard cover is flimsy and does n't really stick well the packaging it arrived in was pretty beat up as well i would probably try a different company next time
i purchased this case to protect the exterior of my recently purchased mbp with retina display i thought i would try this in <unk> of a plastic film like the zagg <unk> i thought this type of case would offer more protection if i , heaven forbid , accidentally dropped my laptop so far , so good the rubbery transparent plastic -lrb- ? -rrb- keyboard overlay was a nice bonus it does not seem to have affected my typing <unk> i am using it in the -lrb- hopefully -rrb- unlikely event that i spill some liquid onto my keyboard overall , i am very satisfied with this product
i love the color considering <unk> blue is my favorite color the only problems i have with it is actually getting the darn thing off and how much more bulky it makes my macbook pro with retina i am in love with the computer 's original thinness , but i am not impress with how much thicker the case adds so i only use the cover for the screen and not the bottom casing
fits perfectly : snug , light , color as described i love this case my only complaint is that the bottom 's piece right hook at the front of the laptop rubs agains the skin just above my wrist and that is really bothersome i fix hat by either being careful of wearing long sleeves even with this defect , i love the case
fits well , looks good , nice keyboard cover too do n't think it would provide a lot of cushioning if it fell , but that 's not really what it 's supposed to do good for the price too
eight years later -lrb- i love you , steve jobs ! -rrb- , we finally needed to replace our macbook pro and decided to cover the new one after much searching , this seemed to be the best rated for a lower price point , with lots of color choices there 's one corner that does n't stay latched , but it 's not really an issue i hate the keyboard cover , but seeing how dirty it is , i do n't want to subject our keyboard to the same <unk> , so it stays
this fits perfectly and is exactly as described the only reason i 'm not giving it # stars , is that there are some clips to keep it on the laptop that hit my wrists while i 'm typing on it that is n't very comfortable otherwise , it 's great
cover fits my new macbook pro # retina love the color wish the keyboard cover had the blue tint to match the cover i 've traveled with this several times and love the protection it provides to the computer thanks ! ! ! according to a person i know that works at apple , this cover is the same and the speck brand that cost much more
if you 're looking to buy a laptop case that is slim and colorful , this is the case to go with do n't expect to like the keyboard cover it is hard to type with it and comes off easily besides that , the case has a snug fit and looks good
daughter wanted a cover for her new computer chose one from the apple store but it was nearly $ # this fits her computer like a glove , was easy to install , and she loves the color i 've had one for nearly # years and it 's kept my computer looking great
