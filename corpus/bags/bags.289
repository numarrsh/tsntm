the case is perfect it 's for my daughters laptop , she is in high school the mac symbol shows through the case when it 's lit up , it 's really cool she has gotten lots of compliments
this case is super soft , and super cute the blue is just right - it 's not obnoxious i like that it protects my macbook air from scratches it was easy to put on and i have n't tried to take it off
i like it and think the grip and way it <unk> to the macbook air makes it very good it lasted twice as long as my speck before it broke a corner off which is saying a lot the plastic on all of them in the corners is the first to go but this one did last longer so it gets # stars for grip , lack of weight and design
this is more of a showy case than a protective case , it looks and fits well on the computer i personally have the # . # `` macbook air from # , and love the case . it shipped quickly and looks good
this is a very good cover to protect the <unk> will <unk> buy a <unk> in <unk> color i really like it is very good , i just do n't know <unk> material to use to clean or
my favorite part of this case is the mint green color i also like the rubberized feel of the cover it was a bit hard to snap on at first , but it has a great , snug fit
after seeing several of these around campus , i decided that i would take the <unk> and get a protective cover for my macbook air this product from kuzy has been great : easy to put on , stayed on with no problems , and has incredibly improved my macbook 's <unk>
kuzy apparently fixed the problems that some users are having with the case not fitting i have a new -lrb- ordered june # -rrb- model macbook air and this case fits perfectly i like the see through case on top , and the rubberized coating feels nice it does tend to get my dog 's hair stuck on it , but it 's easily brushed off the apple logo is clearly visible through the case , and the & # # ; kuzy & # # ; logo is really small in one corner overall i 'm very pleased with this case
i love this case it makes me feel safer with my macbook air , it fits perfectly and you can see the apple sign glow through the color is more of a tiffany blue than how the picture looks , which is why i like it even more !
excellent case for the money i was looking for a nice case for my new air and this is it . sleek finish gives it a rubberized look .
fits my new macbook air and keeps it clean from me it was a breeze to attach and i like the orange good : fits snugly and stays in <unk> : i do get smears on <unk> : i like
it is always great to get something as promised the cover fits perfectly and looks great it adds a personal style and protects my mac from being dinged up i would buy again
this case was easy to put on and it looks great i would recommend this product to anyone the red color case is just the right color not to bright i love to see the apple shine thru the red
after doing a little research i chose to buy a kuzy because it was rated the # # cover for macbook originally i had planned to buy a speck cover that looked very similar but cost more than twice the price after reading the speck reviews , i found that the reviews were mixed some customers said that their speck cases shattered and i certainly did n't want that for myself , especially at that price after doing some research , i had <unk> my search down to # different brands of covers for my macbook i chose this one because i love the color , it 's <unk> , and i liked that the case is rubberized this means that even a klutz like me should n't drop it lastly , i really like that the light from the apple logo shines through the case the color is a little lighter than what i expected but i do n't really mind it 's a great product and i really have no complaints about it
really great cover , better than expected had some trouble for # min to putting the bottom part on , if some has this problem just try not snapping it on , but sliding your mac into the cover ! ;
i bought this case to cover my macbook air just sometimes , but i got use to it and i 'm using the case everyday it fits perfectly and it is providing very good protection from scratches one small thing that i did n't expect was that the apple logo is covered with plastic too , but the logo is still visible when the laptop is turned on
it snapped on perfectly to my macbook air # . # & # # ; -lrb- # model -rrb- and it 's exactly the color i wanted for anyone who says it did n't fit their laptop - you obviously got it for the wrong laptop , read the details next time check the model # love love love ! -
just received my package tonight and it looks and fits great so far so good if you 're looking for great quality for a great price kuzy is the way to go :
i fell in love with the black kuzy case i had purchased previously for my macbook air , and was lucky enough to receive the orange as a gift i actually like this case a bit more because it gives my macbook a very <unk> look and feel again the shipping was extremely fast and the install was more than easy i recommend these cases to anyone who has a macbook or looking to purchase one in the near future i will continue to do business with kuzy because they are so great at what they do i can not thank them enough below is my review for the black kuzy # `` macbook air case . http / / <unk> # <unk> # <unk> # <unk> # <unk> ? ie = utf # & asin ; = b # <unk> # & <unk> ; = & <unk> ; = & tag ;
i was hesitant to order this because there were so many mixed reviews over whether or not it fits the new macbook air -lrb- purchased march # -rrb- it fits perfectly it was obviously made for this computer -lrb- as it should be given the description -rrb- it took some <unk> to get it on -lrb- like maybe # minutes max -rrb- but it 's on perfectly and it looks awesome i 'd definitely recommend this product and happily purchase another one
i struggled finding a case with a hold for the new second mic this one had all the features i was looking for fits on perfectly , does n't prevent the laptop from fully opening , and has good support on the rubber feet
this was the first of now # that we own nice fit , great feel , great protection my wife has the light purple and my son has the dark gray -lrb- my <unk> -rrb- keeps the macbook air sleek and safe
this cover has a very bright and vibrant color it has set my computer apart from others who has same <unk> i 'm often asked where did i purchase casing happy to tell them
this case is awesome it takes some force to have the case snap on initially , but once its applied , it looks fine the apple logo still shows through i carry my laptop with me a lot because i 'm studying computer information systems and i do n't want it to get damaged for how much i paid for my custom air this case has n't let me down one minor complaint : the grips on the bottom have come off any way i can get another set sent over
got this for my daughter and she loves it being a teenager , she has to keep up with the latest styles she especially wanted this to take with her when she goes back to college would highly recommend it very lightweight and priced very reasonable
i have been using my kuzy for about a month and a half now so far no cracks or any other complaints i feel this is a great product and love the color
love this case it has a nice soft feel on the outside which makes it easy to hold and not slippery at the same time it offers great protection to the laptop inside
not only was i pleasantly surprised at how easy this was to adhere to my new mac but it totally saved it 's life i was rushing out of my car and my mac fell from my bag to the parking lot to which i thought it was sudden death thanks toy new kuzy case , there was absolutely nothing wrong i will <unk> and forever have a kuzy case attached to my mac air ... <unk> in some fun colors <unk> my outfits :
everything fit perfectly and looked really good and feels good to know my girlfriends laptop is protected now one thing i did wish it had was the apple logo cut out . it somewhat looks like it is in the picture but it 's not cut out
when i bought this product i was really <unk> a <unk> kind of product it is not that it is simply formed plastic that said , i am really pleased with it i did n't have any problems `` installing `` it within # minutes from removing it from the box i had it on my computer for a second i thought it 's dimensions were incorrect ; i just had to adjust the plastic slightly to get it pushed onto the computer just right and it attaches at all the right places i did n't have any attachment issues where some of the other reviewers were describing it does pick up oils , but those can <unk> easily be removed by any cloth towel
great quality case it attracts greasy prints fairly easily , but i just wipe with a wet paper towel and that solves it there are two small cracks on the bottom of the case , but other than that this case has been perfect if the bottom ends up cracking more , i would n't hesitate purchasing another from kuzy
the used case is a little chipped in one part but otherwise it works perfectly and is pink which is my favorite color i 'm glad i did n't pay full price and bought it used
this is a great hardshell case snaps on super tight the semi-transparent plastic does a great job of showing off the glowing logo from my mba this model has vents cut into the bottom case to allow heat to pass through and not get trapped in , which leads to overheating the rubber feet are great for keeping your mba stable on slippery or <unk> surfaces
so i purchased the exact one for around # $ on amazon from a different seller i made sure that it was able to fit my air that i purchase late last year -lrb- # -rrb- however it lasted for # months , and it fit kind of loosely with my computer i loved the feel , and how it nicely fits my computer very good for it 's price
omg it was tricky getting on the device but fear not , it is a perfect fit on my macbook air # and looks like it was supposed to be there great price on a great
i 'm # % satisfied so much so , i 'm going to order another one in a different color just to change up depending on my mood it 's a great item , perfect fit , looks durable and a good price
i 've had this case for over a year now and it 's performed flawlessly exceptional value and still looks as good as it did when i bought it cheers kuzy for making such great product
so i just received this today , so we 'll see how it wears ... but so far , i 'm extremely impressed it snapped perfectly on to my macbook air # & # # ; , and the feet on the bottom of it will be so helpful from keeping the mac from sliding off my lap , etc . i 've had speck cases in the past for all my computers , and i see no reason why i 'd pay the extra $ $ for those vs. the kuzy brand cases in the future they see the same if not better
this case fits my mac air perfectly i love the color and the smoothness of it it protects my computer from scratches and dust so i do n't have to be extra
this case was purchased along with a & # # ; roocase & # # ; carrying case for a niece who received a laptop from her parents it was a big hit with her , and with her parents who worried about her tendency to drop -lrb- and damage -rrb- things that type of reaction <unk> it # stars
everything i expected easy to put on covers well and is n't to slippery color was as shown does n't add bulk and the stoppers on bottom better than the computers does n't slide off my desk when bumped
the color of this case is super cute and the seller service is absolutely great i got the product fast and it works well to protect my air without making it look bulky
i love this protective case it has a small amount of silicone feel that keeps it from sliding out of your hands , but not sticky enough to collect lint or pet hair -lrb- in my case -rrb- it snapped right on with no problems my laptop opens and closes with no problems or weird noises the <unk> on the bottom of the case keep it secure on different surfaces i love this blue it is like the color of the caribbean sea very happy with my purchase and highly recommend buying this product
when i bought this for my daughter it worked great , she loved it she uses it for school and its a great case its very sturdy and has a nice look to it
fits like a glove with absolutely no sliding or shifting the rubberized shell provides a smooth and soft feel wonderful to handle when using would buy again but price could be better
it 's nice to the touch because it 's very soft it 's very easy to put on , but i have n't tried to take it off yet i like it because i do n't feel like my mba is going to break every time i touch it anymore it 's translucent enough for the apple to glow thru the only thing i did n't like is the finger marks , you almost have to wash your hands every time before touching the case to avoid finger marks other than that i think it 's great
it fits tightly , does n't overheat the computer however , i chose the black option and you can see fingerprints all over the back it 's like a jelly rubbery cover with a matte finish
came exactly as described very nice easy to apply some reviews had a complaint of it being difficult to place not sure why i had absolutely no issues with this and it is very secure once on very happy with this product and especially with the color very close to the picture
i have owned this bag for just over six weeks as mentioned before in a recent review , the bag made a fantastic first impression i was still discovering features after three weeks of using the bag however , the shoulder strap loop secured to the bag ripped away without any sign of wear or tear it was a real disappointment that other bag i have owned in the past have travelled with me around the world for years before wearing out this one did not even last me two months find another bag this one can not take the stress
i have been using the backpack for a bit over # months now i was impressed at first , as it had a lot of compartments and looked sturdy however , i was proven wrong just yesterday , i got home and i noticed that my backpack compartment where laptop goes into was open -lrb- the zipper -rrb- i thought it was odd so i looked closer at the zippers and it turns out that the zippers were not closing correctly and the backpack randomly comes open while walking i 'm guessing it 's because zippers are somehow busted and the weight put on the backpack is too much so zipper comes undone like a zip lock bag i thought it would last at least a year , but i was wrong
yes it 's durable , it wo n't just fall apart it 's not made of anything special , but nothing cheap looking either i have # . # inch laptop and it fits well the is technically enough room to fit another small slim laptop in front of the big one , or a school book or two depending on how big they are i keep a cooling pad for my laptop that fits in fine it 's a small backpack , but not small laptop bag , if that makes sense it 's light and small enough for my purposes i wanted the smallest possible bag for a laptop this size , and think this is pretty close it 's slim looking and does n't stick out of your back too much over all i think it was a worth while purchase
this bag is really roomy and fits my two # inch laptops and my dj headphones comfortably surprisingly this bag is alot smaller in person wich i love and is well padded all around for protection
full disclosure : i picked this up `` used `` in a warehouse deal at full price , i 'd probably give it # stars , mostly because many -lrb- or most -rrb- of these puppies are just too expensive this pack is very well made the straps have plenty of adjustment , and make the pack a very comfortable carry there are lots of storage compartments , and all the zippers seem quite sturdy
it was light for traveling on the airplane , easy to unload for security check - love the pockets and layers to put other things to travel , used as a <unk> top carrier on plane recommend it for those who have bad back like me it was not too heavy and not uncomfortable
easily fits a # `` pc and distributes the weight between both shoulders so you do n't even think about it when you 're carrying it also has plenty of space to easily fit folders , binders , or a book or two also a water bottle , power cable or other essentials , but still manages to look sleek , not bulky have had for months and it has held up quite well seems durable and well made
this one will easily fit a # . # & # # ; laptop , with space to spare the zip seems to be well made i think my son will get more use out of this one than the previous version i bought
i have the black bag <unk> with red , very simple design and very decent looking for the current price -lrb- under thirty dollars -rrb- , you get a lot of bags for the buck it has tons of pockets and most can be closed with zippers for a laptop backpack that can hold up to # `` , it is lighter than my previous ones , which i think is important as laptops can be very heavy by itself the top handle is well padded in soft gel it feels comfortable to tote around your laptop is also well padded front and back the fabric is good to the touch ; it is not rough but soft and supple shoulder straps are also comfy very nice backpack overall at a very reasonable price sample item provided by the distributor for <unk> review
absolutly love this bag soo much storage and easy to organize pockets for just about anything you need the expansion zipper lets even my larger lenovo power supply to fit without any hassle also the luggage pass through has a zipper close at the end so it can double as yet another pocket for storing small or flat items feels tough yet light overall a sharp looking bag with plenty of storage for smaller laptops and any accesories you need
i love this backpack and im waiting for my college to start so i can test its resistance and quality the material they use to make this backpack looks so durable and its made very well so it is a clean job the only think that had me shocked little bit was the size of the backpack it is kinda big for a petite female
i could n't find what i was looking for at the local stores and this is just perfect it holds the laptop , mouse , and charger along with docs without being bulky
ordered this inexpensive laptop bag for bringing the work laptop home on occasional <unk> days works as advertised - strap is a little thin but sturdy enough , and the briefcase handle is actually nice and cushy also , it has a nice exterior pocket for a notepad seems to be holding up well , although i do n't use it often do n't know if it would be ideal for daily use -lrb- i 'd want more room for other stuff , and little pockets for pens and things -rrb- , but great for what i need it for
fits the # & # # ; laptop and a few accessories perfectly i even have a big power cable transformer and it is no problem i have other case logic stuff and it 's all pretty good value for dollar , this is hard to beat
i like the design , quality of construction and price of the case my new # . # & # # ; mac book pro could swim inside the case though ; there 's an extra # & # # ; in all three dimensions i could probably wrap a small bath towel around my laptop and then put it in the case , there 's that much extra room there 's one offset velcro strap to help hold the laptop in place , having a second one would be better the case has pretty good cushioning , so i 'm sure it will do a good job protecting the laptop , but i still would prefer a case that 's better fitting i do n't imagine that i would find one at this price point though
the case fits my # . # inch laptop perfectly as well as a laptop carrier stand , my mouse and my power cord ... the handle is very cushioned so i would say money well
i 'm very glad for having this suitcase it perfectly suites my notebook asus k # cm it 's slimness , good fabric together with the ideal sewing makes it the best purchase for your notebook
perfect for my hp notebook pc fits easily into the carrying case and good amount of storage for the accessories also takes a luggage lock for security with no problem would recommend this product to anyone needing a new laptop case
great material , padding and most of all room the only downside is that its to much room cuz i have a # . # inch laptop and it still has like # . # inches of room for my laptop to slide around i fixed that and bought a laptop sleeve and also the laptop sleeve gave it more padding the laptop i used with this case is a toshiba satellite l # -s
i intended this product to compliment the hp i am purchasing as a christmas present i do not take exception to its size or construction , however , i do not think the padding offers substantial protection for the computer i am returning it for another laptop case
we have a xenon for another laptop and were very happy we expected this to be the same but the back that slides over the carry handle is basically a strap - the version we have is the full back of the case we prefer that and will order in the future so we returned this one not a quality or seller issue ; it did not suit our needs
its a much softer material than what it looks like in the picture but for the price its acceptable and nice to carry i have my toshiba # . # in here and it fits
i was a little leary that my # `` dell laptop computer would not fit in a # `` slim briefcase , but to my surprise it fit with room to spare the little accessory pocket has a large enough area to carry a number of small items , an extra battery , and charger too i anticipated the quality to be very cheap but actually it is very good , much better than i expected i am totally happy with this purchase
i had purchased a designer bag before that was not built for everyday use i needed an everyday bag that was not big and boxy , but was slender yet sturdy this is exactly what i was looking for the zipped pocket on the side is also large and can hold an array of items priced it on amazon vs a large local retailer , & amazon beat the price by around $ # very happy with the purchase
was n't sure if this would work for my large screen laptop but it worked perfectly it is very lightweight and really is slim which is great when having to carry purse and books for teachers
this is a well made breifcase , that fits my # . # & # # ; laptop would have been better with more pocket space i had read the reviews and should have paid attention to that issue other wise it is sturdy and snugly fits the laptop , charger and cord i have in it it is a good looking product with the samsonite name there is a reason to buy it
the bag itself is great , perfect size and very light weight the tsa laptop slot was a definite bonus however , the strap makes an odd squeaking noise that i ca n't quite fix kind of annoying when walking through a quiet area
it is light weight perfect for # . # & # # ; laptops and have lot of space for other items on go . however there must be some rigid support at the bottom in the laptop
its a great case but ... the spot for my laptop is too small for it so i have to put my laptop in another area of the bag its great for carrying my books and papers though overall i like it
pros quality is samsonite size is adequate for me cons unfortunately tablet pocket is a bit smaller than microsoft surface , so i could not use the bag as i planned
just used this laptop bag on # regional jets did n't fit in the overhead of either one of them because of the wheels -lrb- too tall -rrb- also , when the back section is open to insert files , the bag falls down i plan to return this item
i returned this item because the zippers did not work i really , really wanted a four wheel computer bag , but they use cheap zippers make this with tumi style zippers = sold
i have used this product for about # months now with extensive travel in airports , dirt roads , <unk> areas , grass etc . while the bag and wheels themselves hold up the design of the bag is flawed as long as the bag is completely zipped up , the bag sits in a normal position however , the moment you begin to open either the front or back compartment either of which might have your laptop or files - - the entire bag falls over spilling whatever contents you have in that section everywhere if you open the section closest to the front it falls forward ; towards the back it falls backward if you have the handle extended when you open it - - then the bag falls over taking the handle along with it -lrb- which knocks people and other items everywhere -rrb- this is hugely annoying i replaced my old case with this one and while this one has better compartments and pockets and a much more durable set of wheels - i simply can no longer stand the falling over part so time to order a new one the only positive is that the wheels and the outer fabric case itself can withstand all kinds of terrain - too bad the case can not simply stand up
i really like this bag for <unk> use but not weekly or daily use it is a little small for what i want but my chief complaint is the wheels - they want to constantly run the bags in # degree motion ; walking through airports and traveling this causes some aggravation
have this bag for two months under light use and the handle is broken , i never had this issue with any other bags before . also a bit oversize for overhead bin in small airplanes
i like this bag and it is very tough but the retractable handle is held on with just two tiny pins one flew off and the bag is now not useable other than this problem , its well constructed
replacing the # <unk> bag with this one was not a good idea very tight fitting with less room for all your needs pockets are too small and zippers are too tight the wheels do not roll in straight line
i bought this samsonite as a replacement for a similar spinner from another manufacturer this xenon # is okay but i still wish i had my previous spinner for it was more stable when the main compartment is opened , the front drops down and the case usually tips over ; can lead to some awkward moments if the handle is extended
i bought this bag thinking that it would fit my laptop with # & # # ; screen the width description of # . # & # # ; indicated that it would fit fine & one of the reviews even stated that it fit a # & # # ; laptop perfectly when i received it , the tag states it will fit laptops from # & # # ; to # . # & # # ; , which is found nowhere in the description online i 'm very disappointed that i have to now return this bag & continue my search for something affordable & durable that fits
it is too heavy for me as a carry-on it is still good quality though a little too big for carry on under the seat in front of you on united airline 's economy class
it moves easily , i have the matching suitcase set , so i knew i wanted spinner wheels the back compartment has to be completely open , you ca n't just open slightly and slip your hand in , this is my only complaint as you have to expose all the contents when you open it
i had recently purchased a different case that was larger than i had thought it would be so much so that on smaller planes it would not fit in the overhead compartment i looked on amazon and found this one this is smaller but still fits my # & # # ; laptop well with room for some overnight clothes and other work items it seems to roll well and is pretty light the handle seems pretty sturdy
i travel every week while the wheels are not the best in the world , they work well when i <unk> this bag i like how much stuff it holds it was the only bag i found that allowed me to have both wheels as well as a strap to allow me stack on top of my other bag
i was looking for a moving office and did not want to break the bank this <unk> gave me what i wanted and thus far looks to be of good
you 'll have a hard time getting this in the overhead compartment i bought for my husband and did n't consider that he likes to have the <unk> area for his feet he tried to stow it overhead and it would not go without a serious fight
i needed a laptop rolling case that would also hold personal items if i attended overnight meetings or conferences the xenon accommodates a # + & # # ; laptop and can hold additional items my only complaint is its weight , heavy empty , very heavy with laptop
i bought the samsonite xenon # bag to replace the worn out bag i had been using for the past # years it is well made and has plenty of room for all your computer gear and papers i like the adjustable pocket to fit your size laptop very snugly and the oversize compartment in the back can fit some overnight articles for a trip the # wheels make this easy to handle and it also is small enough to fit under an airplane seat if space is tight
i travel a lot setting up at trade shows and job fairs and this is the best bag on the market lots of room for # days worth of clothes , -lrb- just no extra shoes -rrb- , laptop , ipad , and paperwork
yes . . the two little screws that hold the handle on need to be looked at periodically to be sure they stay put . . the twisting makes them come loose we got his as a gift to wife / mom to assist her in business . . she loves it plenty of room for for all her presentation gadgets , computer , papers , supplies etc . mobile office is a good <unk> for her , no complaints after six months of daily use
i love this roller bag it has enough room for my laptop and emergency items incase my checked bags do n't make it to my destination it has traveled # 's of miles with me
as an <unk> <unk> at several <unk> , this rolling office is just perfect for my needs not too large or clunky but very functional for carrying my <unk> , student work and basic <unk> materials i would highly recommend the samsonite products i have purchased in the past
this & # # ; mobile office & # # ; is an fantastic and perfect there are plenty pockets super little zippered slots finally i got a room for all kinds of things no problem to accommodate laptop hp dv # inside special pocket for ipad mini provided i like this
