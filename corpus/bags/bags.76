notebook case fits perfectly with the new case logic sleeve it 's also pretty cheap considering the quality and brand there is also free super saver shipping too , which is a good deal for me
i got this case not for a laptop but for a bamboo wacom create tablet for my friends daughter it definitely is made of nice material and has good padding in case you were to drop it unfortunately , i would have went with something about an inch or # <unk> for this particular tablet though the reason being when putting the tablet into the case it does n't quite have enough room for the stylus that hooks at the end unless you force it hopefully this review helps someone else out there that is looking for something for their bamboo wacom create tablet , that makes sense , to protect it
i chose this item because of the size as my laptop is a # . # ' i am so happy whenever i look at it as it effectively cushions my sleek hp # . # ' slim laptop beautiful ! !
this is an awesome case i was a little worried about my chrome book being a little fragile and one of the reviewers suggested this product it fits perfectly and there is room for the little wireless usb plug in for my mouse to stay in when i put it away it is well padded and it enables me to put it in a computer backpack that is made for a laptop and it fits quite well and gives added protection
it protects it well in my backpack and it is n't bulky at all there is obviously no room for the cord , but if you just want something to make you feel like you can travel with your thin air in a bag without worrying , this is it plus , it 's kind of fun to squish
i really like it it fits to my laptop and it is soft this is good choice for you if you dont have too much money and want to protect you laptop i recommend it
i just bought a macbook and saw this case and loved it it 's the cutest shade of pink and perfect for carrying around in my backpack for college i saw this at best buy for <unk> dollars , but chose to buy it on here because it was so much cheaper <unk> dollars is such a steal ! =-rrb- thanks amazon
got the # `` black to get through airport security for my lenovo ideapad y # , which is so huge for a # incher that it did n't fit in my old bags it 's extremely tight and the laptop can only go in the sleeve thinner edge first , but a tight fit is better than a loose fit maybe it will stretch a bit like a shoe i have successfully gone through lax security with my laptop in the sleeve
i bought this for my son 's laptop so he could carry it with him to classes he is pleased with the fit , feel and look he said it makes easier to transfer from classes and not have the books scuff the laptop cover there are some with handles , which this does not have if you want one with a handle , then you may need to look for another model or brand
was a little hesitant to buy this , but i did and i 'm not <unk> it the shipping was super fast , and it also fits well even with a speck case on my macbook it smells kind of funny , but i 'm just hoping it 'll go away quickly
i have a # . # inch hp pavilion dv # t , which is a little <unk> than normal , and it fits perfectly i purchased a laptop sleeve for # . # inch laptops and it was too small this one , probably since it was a # inch , fit just right
i 've seen some of the higher end sleeves and i was skeptical about this one especially because of the price i decided to go for it since i 'm not to keen on spending $ # for a laptop sleeve this sleeve is simple and you ca n't expect to much for $ # but it does its job well i would recommend this product to a friend
the case came in two days sooner than was expected the black is sleek and looks great people have been complaining about a smell it does n't smell a nice subtle case to complement your macbook pro
i like to protect my laptop even if my employer is providing it , i use this case every time i leave the office it is a perfect fir , perfect price and a perfect transaction see i like it too
i have no complaints this fits all my needs i did n't want anything bulky with pockets or anything this sleeve is nice and slim but is still big enough to fit my macbook -lrb- the last model before the series was <unk> -rrb- even with its ipearl hard plastic case on
this sleeve works well with the mac air # i went one size up on sleeve -lrb- # -inch vs. # -inch -rrb- to ensure that it would fit comfortably with my kuzy - air # -inch black rubberized hard case cover for apple macbook air attached it fits and there is a little room on the sides available
nothing fancy here , just well made and does the job it was intended for the laptop fits perfect , and the zipper works well my experiences with case logic products have been very good this is the first brand i look at when i 'm looking at protective cases
bought it just to have a case to slip my macbook in when transporting it around this case is not fancy but it gets the job done there is a little extra room when its in the case , but it really does not bother me
love this case fits my new macbook air # & # # ; perfectly and helps protect it from the elements i was n't using a case before but figured i should have one while traveling through china and hong kong did not add a lot of weight while traveling
i ordered this case for my macbook air # `` and it fit perfectly with no extra wiggle room the pink is a cute color and the case is very sturdy i have dropped my computer a couple of times and this case cushioned the blows perfectly
i really love this case , and i always have it with me when i take my laptop with me to places a good snug fit for macbooks pro # inch as it was described i really recommend it
this case is wonderful it is exactly what i wanted a snug light case to slide my samsung chromebook into for carrying to meetings , etc . then , this case slides nicely into my regular carry case for traveling , etc . i like the material and also how the zipper is protected from scraping the laptop when the zipper is slid and closed case logic is a really good company , been around a long time , and this case is another of their excellent products
nicely padded , simple <unk> design , strong zipper , fits over not just one but two low rise nano usb devices -lrb- on opposite sides of my beloved chromebook -rrb- if you need a case , this is a most excellent choice
this netbook sleeve fit my acer chromebook perfectly it gives me peace of mind when i 'm hauling it around because it seems sturdy enough to protect my laptop from bumps and bruises
a little bit big for the macbook pro # & # # ; laptop , but am getting a case for it as well so that should cut down on the size seems perfect for the price no complaints so far after having it for a few days oh , and it shipped super fast especially around these crazy holiday times
this is a very <unk> sleeve , sturdy yet not bulky at all it arrived on time , just as expected just got it a couple of days a go will recomend to others
purchased for my # . # inch vaio , fits well with room for my charger and usb cable ` impact foam ' wont save you from dropping your laptop , but most definitely prevents general in bag <unk> while in my bag with my monstrous books
fits my # . # inch screen acer one # quite nicely - just the laptop , without any accessories , as was intended it could fit something just a tad thicker , but not wider seems to be a well-made , sufficiently protective and extremely lightweight no-frills case - just what i needed ... now , will see how well it lasts
i had already purchased a case logic case for a tablet before , so i looked for the same brand for my laptop it looks and feels great i recommend it
i use global delivery for this and it arrived in <unk> in very quick time indeed - well before the projected date product quality lived up to my expectation have been using it for some time now and the build quality is quite evident in it function no issues with the zipper etc . well made stuff from a good supplier
needed a snug fit case for my ao # , it does all i ask it to do , and it also has a small layer of padding , similar to the padding in the shoulder straps of backpacks
it fits a # . # `` acer just right it probably protects the device as much as my laptop bag , which does not say much , but using both is good protection there is no handle , but with a # . # `` laptop , you do n't have a lot of choice it feels like neoprene and is nicely made i 'm happy with the purchase
this case is great for my # macbook pro # `` the padding is just what i was looking for : rigid , yet flexible it slides well into my bag , and the macbook slips out of the sleeve with ease my only problem with this product is that it could be slightly thinner width-wise , my macbook fits fine , but a small amount of air is around the front and the back of the case this is only a minor point , so it really should not deter anyone from purchasing this great sleeve
simple works people , give it a chance i wanted something slim and easy to protect my macbook and this fit the bill perfectly even with my ipearl hard case installed it fits easily into this case
this sleeve hits all the perfect points it fits like a glove , is well designed , and offers good protection i worry about small scratches , not just drop protection and i really like that there is protection from the zipper internally i purchased the # `` macbook pro size and it 's a perfect fit i could n't ask for more out of this product , especially considering the great price
i got this case for my # . # inch screen laptop sure it 's a little big bigger than the laptop itself , but it still does a fine job of protecting it i never feel the need to worry about the safety of my laptop
the package arrived on time i like the case , but i still think i <unk> on the shipping , which was my fault i love the inside protection from the zipper the case did smell a little like rubber and plastic , but that 's not a big deal my # . # `` macbook pro fits perfectly inside with my topcase cover i am satisfied with my purchase
this holds my # & # # ; hp <unk> perfectly and gives it some cushioning while i have it in my backpack great for some extra padding when you do n't want to lug a full laptop case along with you
this case is perfectly fits on my macbook air # . # inch im loving it very nice , am extremely glad about this product thank you for deliver on time i recommend for you guys as well
very satisfied with this product it fits my # & # # ; lenovo laptop perfectly with little room to spare ! ! ! exactly what i was looking for it gives an added protection when carrying around in my backpack
i bought this to go on my hp envy # us # & # # ; -rrb- it fits fairly well , though it 's not snug by any means i would have preferred a tighter fit , but it has n't bothered me enough to find something else the build quality is impressive and it has held up quite well in the time that i 've had it i use it mostly to protect my laptop from the other contents of my backpack -lrb- books , binders , etc . -rrb- and it 's done that perfectly i 've yet to drop my computer while in the sleeve , so i ca n't offer any <unk> into how well it protects against impacts it feels like it would offer a bit of protection , but not too much again , i think it 's more suited for keeping laptops from getting roughed up in bags than anything else for the price & # # ; $ # , i 've been <unk> impressed
i had a similar bag that i purchased from sony for my vaio and it was way more expensive than this and the material are the same i put my mac air # & # # ; that has a plastic cover in this bag , and it fits perfectly
this thing is awesome feels like its built to take a bullet , so to speak it is however a bit loose for my asus but i guess that 's room to fit my hard drive as well
ordered two of these cases , one for a # `` macbook pro and the other for a # `` macbook pro with retina display the # `` fit perfectly but the # `` was way too big for the new # `` model the case is well made , inexpensive , and i highly recommend it ... just note the # `` one is too big
i have an acer aspire v # g laptop and man does it just barely squeeze in here i got this so i was n't just sliding my laptop in of my molle ii <unk> pack scratching it this does a great job of protecting it from scratches and adds a bit of comfort when carrying it around in my bag
the sleeve arrived very quickly and look really good it is a present though so have not actually used it yet but it looks just like it did online and the size looks good . hope it fits my sons # & # # ; laptop
my cat loves to snuggle in this case it 's hard to get her out of there sometimes she has already <unk> closing the zipper when she is in there could n't be more happy except my only complaint is when <unk> has an <unk> oh in there it is hard to do away with the <unk> scent
i picked up an asus computer and ordered one of these for it fits like a glove and i can take my laptop through airport security without taking it out of this case
this is a great case i have <unk> from case logic before and i 've never been disappointed the is very well made , non-slip outer shell so i 'm confident it wo n't slip out of my hands the zipper is great , never binds
i own a samsonite backpack with padded space for large laptops , but i felt the need for additional protection for my thinkpad t # so i purchased this sleeve the laptop fits just right , being easy to put it in and take it out there 's some space left , since my laptop is narrower than the sleeve , but i expected that i could probably fit the power unit and cord there if i needed to once in the sleeve , they fit perfectly in the backpack : it does n't move and poking from every angle always finds padding i own an older thinkpad t # p and it also fits in the sleeve , with enough spare space for the power unit and cord , so i 'm planning to buy another sleeve for it one thing i particularly like of this sleeve is that the zipper does not go all the way around , just about one fourth of each short edge , and the <unk> long edge this makes it feel more like a pocket than a cover other sleeves i 've had in the past were always breaking at the zipper because of it 's length
this case is exactly what i needed , was n't too bulky either and is well padded simple , plain and affordable fits my acer v # aspire # . # & # # ; really well , even has some room to spare
fits my macbook air # . # `` perfectly it 's perfect for when i take it to school and i would recommend it to anyone with a macbook air the color is really nice too
this is a great product i put my small notebook in it when i travel i rarely have to take it out of the case going through security and it gives my notebook a little added protection during
i bought this case with my chromebook it fits nice and is snug it 's one of the thinnest cases i 've used i 'm completely impressed i would recommend this to others if they are looking for a good case
i bought this case for my boyfriend as a gift i was afraid that his mp # would n't be able to fit in this case since he has a speck cover on his he tried to put it in the case and it was a tight fit but it fits without the speck cover , i think it will fit better the color is a nice shade too
i just invested in a hp envy touchsmart # t all <unk> out for close to $ # bucks funny thing is i usually always had my mom custom make me my laptop sleeves for previous laptops from very soft blanket like material there were always amazing i was close to doing the same when i got this new one , but chose to <unk> the sleeves that were out there my sister has a mac book pro and has one of these case logic sleeves i really dug it so i found it here on amazon like i do for everything and gave it a whirl needless to say , it turned out to be super dope my one concern was the computer getting scratched by the zipper , but the other reviews were correct when they said case logic had designed a great rubber lip that makes scratching a non issue love this thing ... definitely recommended to all y ' all
i came here looking for a # inch case similar to one i purchased a while back for my sisters laptop the one i have does n't sell anymore but this one is amazing it 's build quality is great considering the price and it holds the laptop well does it 's job great
great value , it is really firm and protect my chromebook # from every potential damage source also , is a really nice looking item if you have any # inches device , this is your protective
this case fits my hp ultrabook -lrb- # & # # ; widescreen -rrb- quite well although it is intended for the # . # & # # ; macbook <unk> the case offers plenty of protection and seems quite durable , even after owning it for several months
case is the perfect size for travel and for the unit i carry in the backpack and was looking for something thin to protect the laptop from minor scratches . the case was actually thicker and more protective that i thought great item ... great
this is pretty well designed and is definitely good enough for traveling or even just storing it i have used it quite often since i bought it and i am really liking it so far
perfect for my asus <unk> # the <unk> # has a weird shaped battery that comes off the back , so i was a little worried about the getting a case and considered sizing up to a # `` this case is doing the job just fine
this case fits my # & # # ; hp probook series laptop perfectly -lrb- with no room to spare ! -rrb- but that is what i wanted ... a well padded , protective sleeve to haul my laptop around the dimensions given were spot on i have n't given the case & # # ; years & # # ; of use yet , but the quality appears to be very good with strong seams , zippers and stitching
this fits my mba just fine and has a little wiggle room to include my mouse in there as well if i were to be super critical , i would say there is a little too much wiggle room if i was carrying just the computer i wanted something that i could use when carrying my computer around as it is incredibly light and i worry about getting it scratched or worse dropping it i highly doubt this would protect it from any drops , but from day-to-day abuse , it does what is intended
love it , it is a great fit for my samsung chromebook i can slip it in quickly , know that it is protected and it is not bulky to carry around
my husband uses this case and it works great , he packs it in a bag and it stays safe and sound great quality item , exactly what we were looking for
i have an # . # laptop -lrb- not netbook -rrb- and this works perfectly i wanted a small laptop so i could easily take it with me without having to take my messenger bag all the time , but i needed a way to protect it this sleeve allows me to carry it in any bag without having to worry about damaging it fits it snugly and does n't add a ton of bulk
fantastic sleeve for my google chromebook fits it snugly and protects the device well since it 's neoprene , i may take it scuba diving with me the next time i go
i love this beautiful zipper case for my macbook air it provides a great fit , moderate amount of protection , and is light weight - just what i need for travel if needed , i can put the cord in as well , but usually do n't because i like the flat , smooth look and feel of it this sleeve protects my computer while i carry it in a purse on the airplane , and i keep the cords elsewhere just perfect for what i needed
i needed something to protect my laptop since i carry it to school i carried my laptop to school without a sleeve and a part of it chipped off , so i went on amazon to buy something and i came across the case logic laptop sleeve it came and it fit in my backpack , it 's not heavy , and it does a good job protecting my laptop i feel safe carrying my laptop around now since i know that this case does it 's job
i bought this cover for my new # inch macbook pro and if fits perfectly the sleeve cushioning provides good protection without being too bulky love the pink color too
this is a perfect fit to my # `` samsung series # ultrabook , # . # `` x # `` since it is so hard to find a perfect fit i just want to leave a moment here so other people could buy it
i got this from my new dell inspiron # -lrb- # series -rrb- and it fits perfectly the quality is good , the case itself is really light and it does what it 's supposed to
bought this for my # `` macbook pro and it is just about the perfect case for low profile protection or for use with a case that does not have a dedicated laptop compartment
i really <unk> track pads i always use a & # # ; <unk> & # # ; low-profile usb wireless mouse with any laptop i purchased this item to hold an acer c # chromebook in a non-padded tote and it works perfectly the sleeve never snags on the <unk> and provides plenty of cushion for the occasional jostle
initially , i bought a laptop sleeve by cosmos because it was slightly cheaper in price but it was infinitely cheaper in materials this one by case logic has sturdy materials that are actually able to cushion the blow of any bumps and knocks to a laptop
case is soft and cushy , but firm enough to keep the laptops safe mine is a # . # & # # ; and fits like a glove details like the zipper is a nice touch , color-coordinated with the sleeve itself
i 've been using this to transport my macbook air # . # inch back and forth to school in order to prevent any external damaging to the case , and finer particles and debris from entering the case it has worked <unk> my laptop still has no visible dings or blemishes
the chromebook fits nice and snug in there , and the <unk> of this case is awesome i also like the <unk> look it 'll be subjected to wear and tear ; will come back after a month or two to see how it <unk>
my husband bought me a chromebook -lrb- which i love ! however , after just a week i already had scratches on it , thanks to my clumsiness and an <unk> three year old i needed to get a sleeve for my chromebook but when i went to the store they did n't have anything in the right size my chromebook is around # inches i found this one on amazon , bought it and have been using it ever since it 's nice an sturdy and has the right amount of padding to protect your <unk> just make sure you check the dimensions of your laptop versus the sleeve so you do n't end up with any unpleasant surprises
well , there is nothing to say bad about the product , overall i liked the product at the prize i was looking for ... so there was no <unk> , product was in great condition
this is my first disappointment from a built product i had the vertical laptop bag , but wanted the tote for both look and weight distribution the <unk> sleeve for my # -inch mac was so snug that it tore out within one week of use i 'm keeping the tote , and still using the sleeve , but i am annoyed that the size and quality are slightly off on this offering in terms of looks , i love it and the neoprene <unk> straps are super comfortable
i gave this three stars as it is just a great bag ; light and compact ; it really does n't look or feel like a computer bag - very feminine however the lining in the computer compartment is faulty ; it looks like it may rip any minute there is ... what looks like a `` slash ' indent on the side of the compartment ; i hope it holds up i do n't live in us so it is not easy or practical for me to send it back otherwise i would have returned it right away
this tote met all my expectations save one : that there would be enough room in the pouch mind you the laptop still fits , but it 's just pretty snug it would have been nice if it had a bit more room in the pouch on the sides so that the laptop would fit in easier but so far , so good it does a good job and i 'm satisfied
i was looking for a lightweight laptop bag to carry my macbook pro to work in every day and this was perfect it does n't add too much weight and has enough room for my ipad and the power cord as well i have n't tried to use the sleeve with a hardshell case , but the neoprene has some stretch and can probably accommodate it if you 're using one
very nice bag works well for carrying my kindle fire and i pad and all charging cards , with spare back up battery as well as some purse items and it still holds a few files one down fall with the bag is no shoulder strap to use it as a cross body bag if they come up with the same bag with a strap that can make it a cross body bag i 'll buy it again keeps things dry in a lite rain shower would highly suggest the bag the four stars is because their is no shoulder strap to use as a cross body bag
i love how the shape of the bag stays intact no matter what you put inside the bag super nice and protects against hits and water nice for ipads and # & # # ; macbooks you can fit the # & # # ; but in the outer compartment -lrb- no zipper -rrb- , which defeats the purpose
it 's light weight and holds everything i need it too i wish that the whole thing could zip up -lrb- only the laptop sleeve zips up -rrb- but overall a good bag
i love this brand in general i have many of their oven <unk> and several styles of bags so of course i looked up what they had for lap tops this looked great because i love over the shoulder bags vs just a sleeve i like this bag a lot there is a compartment for the laptop and room on each side of it from other items such as an ipad , notebooks , etc . my only complaint is that my # `` macbook pro barely fits im a little annoyed at this because i wanted to get a shell for the computer but there is no way it would fit . . i barely got it zipped if you have a # get a # `` bag . if i could do it over i would . other than that . . love the bag
i received the product in good time i 've used the product for # weeks now and i am very satisfied with its quality and durability it is very lightweight and built using strong material i would recommend this product to anyone
i just got it today though i just ordered it yesterday with amazon prime the bag looks great i really like <unk> its the right size , not too big or too small perfect for school and my mac fits perfectly in there
i love this bag everybody likes it , it looks fashionable , its made of neoprene which is great when it start <unk> or so the laptop has its own space with zipper in it , a little tight if you want to put your laptop and u are in a hurry , but i love it ! i recommend it # %
i bought this bag to use as a carry on for my last flight - it comfortably fits my macbook pro , a few magazines and notepads , all of my cords , cell phone and wallet it 's very comfortable to carry , even when full , and i love that it does n't look like a laptop bag a zipper would be nice for when you have to put it under the seat of the airplane but it was no big deal , and it does stand upright on it 's own when the laptop is in it i highly recommend the neoprene cargo travel organizer by built ny -lrb- also sold on amazon -rrb- , as it is perfect for keeping your cords and charges organized anyway , i love this bag so much i often carry it around in place of my regular bag , and i always get lots of questions and compliments about it great buy and highly recommend :
i was eyeing this bag for months before i purchased it and i wish i had purchased it sooner it fits my # inch macbook pro like a glove and i can fit a couple of books and notebooks in the bag as well -lrb- i am a graduate student and it 's perfect for daily use -rrb- it feels much better on my shoulders compared to a cheap canvas bag i was using before
i like mine but i wish it had a zip to close the bag so other people do n't get to see all the contents of my bag i bought mine for work travel to house my ipad , work docs and handbag contents i think an outer zip would make it perfect
my # . # lenovo yoga would n't fit in the center zip part that 's meant to hold the laptop , but i just put it behind it and put my cables in the zippered part it 's very well made and does n't feel heavy on my shoulder
i just love this bag and it will do its work i just took it out and it a very strong bag with all the other reviews i made an excellent choice
my macbook air fits perfect ! you have room for cables , external hd , phone , etc . i am very pleased with it , the colours are really nice ... it could be a great gift for christmas
very cute and as pictured works well as a tote ... love the centre zipped pocket which cushions and protects my ipad and leaves lots of room on either side for other stuff : -
excellent - fashionable , durable , protective and convenient it 's strap is the perfect size to <unk> it over your shoulder , and the built in laptop storage is soft , fuzzy and provides a little division within the bag helps with organization i love it
