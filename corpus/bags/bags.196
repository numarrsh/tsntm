i liked the feeling of the cover soft and the keyboard fits well the main complain is that the top cover does n't exactly fit my mac # inch mid # the cover is a bit bigger and the apple logo looks blur
the bottom fits really well , but the top part not so much not that it falls off , but there is a slight sort of bubble between the top surface of my laptop and the case the keyboard cover fits very well but it takes a bit to get used to typing with it it 's probably not necessary unless you plan on typing with greasy fingers
it is an excellent case to protect your macbook however , your finger prints will be completely noticeable on the top cover and i have n't found a product that completely cleans it off it 's made of some kind of material that makes stains appear even more plus , i 've tried to take off the cover and i feel like i 'm going to break my laptop therefore i have n't been able to take it off otherwise , its good the keyboard protector works well the letters on the keys no longer light up but that 's not a problem if you can type without looking
i was looking for a deeper purple , but this color was all i could find the case is already cracking in several spots and it was difficult to put on
i like the color and the feel of the case but i 've only had it for # months and the corners are already so broken it needs to be replaced i do n't throw my computer around it stays in a bag when it 's traveling i just wish the case could have taken a little more abuse
the price is a good indicator of the quality of this product the case fits relatively well , but the <unk> on the case itself began to flake off within two weeks of purchasing the product the keyboard cover fit well but is quite sticky and makes it difficult to type quickly there is also some issue of attracting dirt and dust overall , this product is appropriately priced the low cost comes with some unfortunate <unk> if you 're just looking for a cover to protect you macbook and are not too concerned with the appearance , then this case should be fine for you if you would like it to appear nicely , i would recommend a different case
the case was easy to snap in place but i have difficulty attaching side items due to the slots partially covered the keyboard is a bit difficult to type on at times other than that , it is worth the price and looks great
this cover lasted for about # months before it started to crack i know have small pieces of plastic missing from the corners the color of the case is beautiful but , any oil from your fingers will discolor the case -lrb- and can not be wiped off -rrb- so do n't touch the case unless your hands are completely dry and clean my laptop is <unk> for and i do n't treat it roughly by any means so , the fractures can definitely be contributed to weakness in the case i love the keyboard cover , however , and it is still going strong i wish the case would have lasted longer
if you 're really into all your stuff being perfect , this probably is no good it 's got character the keyboard cover sticks up a bit , but the case fits fine , stays on , and covers up the huge ding in the back of my laptop , which is why i bought it i mean , i 've had it for a least a month and even if the case broke right now i would n't feel bad having to buy a new one , cause it 's such a good price
it fits well as described by the seller the only problem i see so far is that my lap top gets hot real fast especially if it on for a
the cover is nice but the keypad protector is kinda crappy it does n't stay in place well seems like it kinda does n't fit and the lettering is off a little than the actual letters on the keyboard , so at times it bothers me , but i am a picky person
it arrived in a timely fashion , but when i put the case on , it did n't fit comfortably the top <unk> up so there 's a gap between my computer and the case
i was confused at the price for so many things that would normal cost more the keyboard cover is great i love them and swear by a keyboard cover to keep the <unk> out of my keys as for the case , it snapped on really well , but it lets dirt and grime in between the case and the laptop it kept the computer from getting scratches , but i did n't like how the snaps for the front got in the way of resting my wrists when i type also , the little rubber circles on the bottom portion of the case to keep it from sliding fell off about a month after use
it is somewhat thin the color is nice packaging was poor the first one arrived with the bottom piece broken on the sides although seller was quick to replace the item , the replacement arrived again with a crack in the same thin plastic bag despite my asking for some padding i will not buy from this seller again
i had this for a few months when i noticed that it was cracking at the corners my laptop never left my desk so i think it cracked from heat i will need to get another since the cracks are getting longer
the bottom portion fits properly to mac , but upper portion does not fit well it creates a space in the centre and there would be bulge at the apple symbol , which reduces the back lit <unk> . if someone sees this mac with this cover it would be hard to <unk> that its from apple ! ! ! ! . . # star is only for quality . . missing the stylish look
it 's a good product for the price you get what you pay for at such a price it 's a good product the keyboard skin was a bit torn and the case fits but it is n't a perfect fit it sticks out in some places but overall it 's a good
this is a bit more neon than i had hoped for also i am a mess with pens , and neon orange did n't do much to conceal man numerous pen marks i got on this case i will buy a darker color next time , but the case does an ok job for protective reasons
the case was lost in the mail , or the merchandise was never sent when ordered it wo n't ask for the specific model number , but when complaining for not delivering it they ask me for the model number in order to send the correct one the fit is a bit bigger and the case is somehow a little loose
shipped fast and they are okay the cases do n't last long and the key covers make it harder to type but they keep the dust out i would n't order them again though
it is okay . i was hoping it would fit flat on the laptop but it doesnt the apple sign looks <unk> through the case the middle of the case is slightly bent out and does n't lay flat the picture is <unk> overall , it is fine , it fits the laptop -lrb- it clicks in -rrb- and the bottom half of the case is perfect if i spent any more money than i did , i would return it but it is fine for the worth of
it is a great product and protects really well however , it came in the mail with a defect it 's nothing extraordinary , but it looks like the side kind of got melted . . however , i still used it and the damage does n't really <unk> anything
fits great on my macbook pro even though i 'd love to see the apple symbol show brighter the top right key on the keyboard cover shows a the & # # ; power & # # ; symbol and not the & # # ; eject & # # ; symbol i ca n't believe they messed up so big on this
the rubberized hard case cover holds up well but the keyboard silicon cover bubbles up and wo n't lay flat -lrb- which kind of ruins the effect and purpose of having the keyboard cover -rrb-
the only thing keeping me from rating this # stars or more is the fact that the <unk> on the keyboard cover did n't match <unk> up correctly with my laptop the case is great and should help me protect my laptop from accidental bumps , scratches , and unseen spilled items case is true to color , -lrb- i ordered the red case with red keyboard cover -rrb- and everything looks great no complaints about the color or style or anything since the <unk> on the keyboard cover do n't line up correctly it makes the letters look blurry when i 'm trying to type i 'll order a different keyboard cover from somewhere else since their relatively cheap on this here
this case over all is great as does what it is suppose to but the bottom <unk> of the case started to chip after # weeks then after # months it finally cracked i believe the cause was that the bottom case was slightly to small for my macbook pro , -lrb- # & # # ; by the way -rrb- other than the bottom portion cracking , the top casing and keyboard cover are great
quick shipping , worth the money i posted pictures of it in royal blue only cons are the keyboard protector <unk> perfectly flat and the eject button is <unk> as a power button but it does it 's job and does n't affect closure or leave prints on the screen
the case is great perfect fit and easy to install the only issue i have with the case is that the edge where my wrists go is a little sharp it sometimes scrapes up my wrists -lrb- i actually solved that by lightly <unk> the edge with a <unk> file . the keyboard cover is ... problematic i ca n't seem to type with it on looks cute , but i make so many typos that i do n't really use it
the cover case snapped on fairly easily and has done a good job of protecting the computer i teach in # different locations every day & my laptop travels with me while the keyboard cover does help to protect it from dirt & spills , i do n't like how the keyboard feels when using it i tend to not press hard enough
i have had this for a few months now , i have not actually dropped it yet , but i have a few friends who have the same case and have dropped it so i would consider this a very protective case
got this item , keep in mind , you pay what you get this item is pretty decent , but i have to say , my gf bought another set that is cheaper than this and it 's pretty good but i am satisfy with mine , so yeah
loved the product -lrb- and color ! -rrb- while it lasted i do n't think i 'm hard on the case ; however , three corners were cracked within the first eight or so months while i liked having the keyboard cover , i must be hard on the keys because several were worn through in that same time period i finally removed the keyboard cover recently after finding moisture started to accumulate around the keys guess it 's time to order another one
this item shipped fast and was exactly as described they even shipped to an <unk> address the keyboard cover works great and helps keep dust and dirt out of my laptop the outer hard shell also helps to keep my laptop clean i 'm not sure if it provides a high level of protection from damage , but certainly helps color exactly as depicted
i have n't had any other case , but let me tell you the keyboard cover for this case is perfect -lrb- i prefer it to the bare mac keys -rrb- the case itself also adequately protects from any bumps , etc . my only complaint is that it is a little difficult to put on and off
the case fit my computer but i would 've preferred it to be more fitted or tighter being clear i wanted to be able to see the apple glow and the decals i have on my laptop
so , like others have said , the product does arrive in very flimsy packaging i 'm talking a thin white plastic bag covers your beloved case here the purple is beautiful as pictured , and the keyboard cover is quite soft and fun to type with just know that my package had several holes ripped into it by the time it arrived on my doorstep luckily the cover and case were not damaged the product did arrive early for me , however , and i appreciated that the case does show staining easily ; try not to touch with dirty and/or <unk> hands the case will show fingerprints as clear spots on the cover , it 's very interesting , really in the end , i do love my cover and case , but i deducted a star for packaging others may not be so lucky in getting their case in one piece
oh , this is the best , most fantastic hard case cover for my mac laptop the keyboard cover not great the keys have smudges on them and missing parts on the letters and numbers but for the money , it is a superb deal i bought another black keyboard cover at apple and it did not cost much money and now i am totally happy i do recommend buying it and would buy it again
the case provides a decent amount of protection , but i would still suggest not bumping your mac around too much it 's nice because i paint a lot and it keeps the metallic finish of the computer from getting paint of it all in all i 'd suggest this case to others
easy install , reasonably snug fit , got what i expected the keyboard cover is a nice idea but i ca n't type as fast on it so i leave it off a lot decent product for the price
it 's bright and fun it serves it 's purpose well by protecting your computer but the bottom piece seems to be getting a letter looser the longer i 've been us using it also , it takes some getting use to with the keyboard cover -lrb- i just ended up taking mine off -rrb-
great quality for the price i purchased a case just like this at the apple store for $ # and it broke within # months this one is the same quality for a fraction of the price
this is a lightweight , sleek option for protecting your macbook and keyboard still getting used to typing with the keyboard cover , still have n't figured how how to keep the case top and <unk> together , and i still have n't <unk> with it but for home use , it does the job well and the price was right
gives your laptop a mean look and the keyboard cover is nice so your keys do n't get dirty it does n't seem like it 'll protect the laptop much though
well the feeling of these material is amazing the <unk> is much <unk> now when i type the case part was a bit loose so i had to put something inside to hold it firm other than that it was a good purchase
does the job and protects my mac i like the keyboard cover too since i eat by my laptop a lot and it protects it overall , it 's a pretty good case for college students
i purchased the pink cover for my # inch mac book pro and received one that was way to big for a # inch the pink is not true to the color , as well i have contacted about the case so it is a matter of time before i receive news just bought this laptop and was eager to make it girly and it just did n't happen
this is my daughter 's third case for the past # years she has her lap top just like with any item which goes through constant usage , there is going to be wear and tear the case does eventually crack and the key pad does get out of shape after a year of daily frequent usage it 's a great case which protects the lap top
the case came very fast after i ordered case - i love the color d it 's very nice and bright orange goes on and comes off very easily i like it . keyboard cover : alright this keyboard cover sucks it prevents you from typing fast , and makes you press down buttons you do n't intend to the keyboard cover is crap overall , # stars i would recommend the case , not the keyboard cover
hard case cover fits great and looks nice the keyboard cover does n't really fit and comes off easily , but i was n't expecting much for that anyway it arrived exactly when expected to
this was a good investment as a college student it came with a free small mouse pad which was pretty cool i got the aqua color and it looks perfect putting the hard case on my macbook pro was really easy and it fits perfectly
i like it ... and has an excellent relation <unk> the costumer service is excellent they always answer and fix any problem in less than # hours for sure ... is a good hard case for the macbook pro # inches
this case is durable and cute i am really a fan the key protector is also great since i tend to be messy i would recommend this to a friend
this was a terrific deal it 's just what i wanted for my new macbook pro the hard plastic covering snaps over the top and bottoms of the laptop and feels really solid the little rubber mat for the keyboard is super handy it even comes with a screen protector i 'm very pleased with this purchase
the hard case is a little bit cheap of material , you can easily see smudges on it , but it does the job of protecting your laptop and is firmly in place keyboard protector is great , never slips off , all though it does take some getting used because it makes the keys a bit thicker
although i liked everything in the package , this seller claims it fits a # `` mac book pro this product does not fit my laptop it is way too big and i need to unfortunately return it now
my likes are : the pretty color purple on my mac . the different look and feel i get when using my mac . shipping was on time when promised price was and is well worth it my dislike ; none !
i have been very pleased with the hard outer shell it truly keeps your computer much cleaner and offers a fair amount of protection i was n't a huge fan of the key board insert , but i prefer the feel of the actual keys
i just bought this case on a friday and i received it that monday i am very pleased with this product even though it is not the best quality , it serves its purpose i bought it to protect my computer from scratches and dust , and it works great the bottom case though does not have a perfect fit , but that 's okay i would buy this product again in a different color
i received the case cover # days ago , it is easy to set it and great for your mac to be protected the keyboard cover is perfect sized and seems to be durable
the case fits wonderfully and adds an extra measure of stability when working on glossy surfaces the only ding is the keyboard cover ; it was cumbersome to use and was too opaque for the keyboard <unk> to be very effective
i am happy with my case it is a pretty lilac purple it fits well , except the key cover is slightly bigger <unk> , i am sure i will get use to it it arrived with in four days
fit perfectly for my macbook pro the plastic is a little cheap though ; chips pretty easily but a beautiful purple the case looks a little better in person but pretty much the same color as shown
the case is great i love the color and the fit my laptop doesnt overheat and it keeps it from getting scuffed up i used the keyboard cover for about a week and then decided that i preferred the keyboard without it it fit fine , but i found that typing did n't go as smooth with it on overall , this is a great purchase and i recommend it
i am always leery of ordering items on like that have a color i want because if i ca n't see it in person it wo n't be color i want ; but i love this color it is exactly what is pictured the keyboard cover does n't seem to be cut properly , it hurts the tips -lrb- sides -rrb- of my fingers when type
i ordered this for a christmas present it shipped and was <unk> fast ... got it within a few days it wasnt packaged the best the over-all fit was perfect i was worried about the rubber keypad cover . read some other reviews about it not fitting right this ones fits i would buy again its worth the price
this product is good for the price it 's cheap and functional , though it does n't look the best or feel the highest quality i 'd recommend it if you 're looking for a cheap case
it does the job i thought the gray would be darker i was hoping for a little lighter than black , maybe a grey black it is actually the same color as my macbook
there were some rough patches i had to file down along the edges with a nail file , but other than that this case is awesome . it protects my laptop like a dream
i was pretty happy about this case it is definitely true to color it is exactly a tiffany blue the only problem i have is with the keyboard cover it came all folded up and now it will not flatten out , so it does n't stay properly on my keyboard which is disapointing otherwise , i really like this case
i ordered the case , and received it within a few days easy to put on and take off , great fit the keyboard cover is good but has minor flaw , not one to bother about the only thing i am not enjoying is that i use my laptop very relaxed , and when i rest my wrists down they edge of the cover is a little scratchy so ca n't be completely comfortable with it
-lrb- other reviewers who mention bottom falling off are n't clicking it into place right mine did that at first , but once i got it clicked on , it had n't fallen off . -rrb- only small complaint is that the clip part is near where my <unk> rest on the edge of the wrist rest , making it sometimes slightly uncomfortable -lrb- scratchy -rrb-
although the bottom part got broke , i do n't know how still fits and can protect well i have on black and really like it recommend this case , also it is very
works okay , protects the laptop and i love the color it gets # stars out of # because of durability i travel around with my laptop and all of the corners have cracked
i just got this cover in the mail today , and i like it the cover is very strong and protects the computer very well the silicon keyboard cover looks very very nice , though it is a bit hard to type with it , but it takes some getting use too overall , i recommend this product the price is affordable and its really good quality , icing on the cake it ships fast
the case snaps on easily the color was a little lighter than i expected the keyboard cover is pretty useless it does n't comfortably fit on the keys , which makes typing annoying some of the symbols do n't even match up to the actual keyboard i ended up taking it off the mousepad is pretty flimsy and useless as well as a whole , a solid case for it 's price better than paying what you would at an apple store
this is a nice cover but i do not use the keyboard pad because it felt strange when i was typing but i mainly bought it for the cover so my laptop would n't get scratched so i am happy
after # months of use the case works fine the keyboard cover is lifting a little under the space bar and it wo n't go down it seems like it got stretched out somehow
had purchased a more expensive case for my macbook pro that cracked and fell apart so far this purchase has met my needs fits well and is doing the job i had issues with wrong size top being delivered but was resolved timely by the company
i ordered a different <unk> case for my laptop a while ago that case constantly slid off and arrived with fingerprints this one is tighter and fits perfectly while it still gets fingerprint marks , they are easily wiped off with a dry paper towel very pleased with this purchase i love the <unk> finish
this case was a great investment it feels very sturdy and well made as i type this review , the clicking sound of the keys is muffled a good amount and it does take some time to get used to typing on it i ordered the case in hot blue / turquoise and it 's a bit more green than in the picture which is perfectly fine by me you also get a free mousepad in the matching color along with your order which is nice bonus other than the keyboard cover , this is a great investment for your macbook and a great price as well
the case along with the keyboard cover was definitely a great way to customize my mac book pro , but the only reason why i did n't give it a five star was the product seemed a little bit cheap i guess you get what you pay for , either way its is still an awesome case
got this as a gift for christmas and i was a little embarrassed to give it it 's kind of cheaply made however , they loved that the keyboard cover matched it adds some personality to the laptop
i just received my rubberized hard case cover and keyboard cover for my mac from topcase and i must say that i really like the color it 's exactly like the picture and fast shipping i was shocked at how quickly i received my order : -rrb- assembly is easy as well
i like this case but the corners are cracking and pieces are <unk> off where i need them the most i <unk> my corners protected and not have a hole in my case from where it broke after only # months i know that may be a good time length for a case but i wanted it to last longer for the amount i paid for it
product arrived on time and was exactly what i expected fit my laptop perfectly just have to wait to see if it holds up i read several reviews that said it cracked within a few weeks or months i 'm exceptionally careful with my laptop so i 'm hoping it lasts
the shell itself is great i love the texture , and i i love the color , although it was more teal than i expected the keyboard cover , though , does n't quite align with the keys correctly , and typing with it was difficult at best
i love this case it protects my macbook stylishly without added bulk the color is beautiful , and it snaps on easily the only thing i do n't like is the keyboard cover it is hard for me to use while typing so i just use it as a dust cover when i am not using the computer compared to what you will find in brick and mortar stores , this is a steal
i 've been through two other brands before purchasing this cover for my macbook so far , so good it has n't cracked , chipped , or lost any of the rubber feet -lrb- problems i experienced with previous brands -rrb- the only thing that was disappointing was it turned out to be more gray than i expected i ordered the & # # ; clear & # # ; color , but the color definitely has a gray tone to it , so you ca n't see the vinyl decal i have on my computer but , as long as it protects my computer , it 's not a deal breaker for me
the case came extremely quick and was exactly what it looks like it is a bright blue case the keyboard is a little more turquoise than it looks in the picture but the case is hard very bright
great item to change your color for your laptop , item is available in multiple colors too material is rubbery and yet hard enough to protect your laptop and keyboard i would recommend this
i am very happy with this purchase it even comes with a keyboard <unk> i was thinking it might be one of those really thick rubber things , but that was a bit <unk> for the price it is perfect for my needs i have another macbook taht i somehow dinged , and if i had bought this for it , that would never have happened
i had a pink computer and traded it in for another with the standard silver body i bought these to bring back my pink computer and am not disappointed am <unk> again when i use it it fits perfectly and protects the key board from any liquid spills it 's lightweight and slick so it slides in my carry case easily did not give it # stars as the rubber feet on the bottom are peeling a little
i just got this , and i think it 's pretty ok the color -lrb- i got purple -rrb- is a little <unk> than in the picture , but still nice the keyboard cover does n't fit perfectly , but it fits well enough to not be a problem , and i imagine that with a few days of use it will settle down onto the keys a little better given that the cases i 've looked at in stores were around $ # , this is definitely a good value for the money i 'm not sure exactly how much protection it will give from dings , but it should do well to prevent scratches and it looks pretty nice
make sure you get the hard case cover for the mac pro with retina display i did n't notice that small detail and the cover did n't fit i had to send it back but the return process was amazing the money was refunded in no time and the package pick up was simple
this is an overall good , quality case i bought it for my wife 's macbook to keep the scratches off the surface the only thing negative i have to say is that the keyboard cover is very awkward feeling , which is why i gave this # stars you ca n't beat the price though
great cover , i use it daily but the keyboard cover is tricky to get used to the only thing i saw that was wrong is the letter positioning on the cover was off compared to my
i have had my macbook for # years now , and my husband has been <unk> me to get a case since i bought it this does the trick it snaps on fine and seems to protect it well the only thing i do n't like is the keyboard cover it just feels weird plus , i was told at the apple store that macbooks cool through the keyboard , so i 'm not sure i would want anything that could potentially keep that from cooling effectively
it is not the color pictured , which is fine , i actually like the color better my main issue was that the keyboard looked worn out , did n't fit exactly and the eject button was labeled a power button . but other than that , great buy
very satisfied with this case cover and the color is fantastic as well i was a little skeptical about ordering this case because of the price i thought it would be cheap and flimsy i 'm glad i ordered it
i get compliments on this case all the time it was a great price and protects my macbook from daily wear and tear i dropped my computer recently and i was very pleased with how it handled it the quiet touch keyboard cover is nice , but i ca n't type as fast at work with it overall , great
