i love these mitts they are pretty , functional , and super handy i tossed a bunch of old mitts that had simply died over time and needed replacing i got the set - two mitts , one holder that you actually slide your hand into , and the handy dandy lid holders it 's amazing how often i use those little lid holders my one caution is that they really are tiny i have small hands and they fit perfectly i can wear a size small of the rubber dish washing gloves i ca n't imagine anyone with medium hands even using these my husband wears <unk> large gloves and these bug him because he does n't feel like he can really grip anything well
love these gloves and hot holders like the way they protect your arms when removing hot items from the oven my wife , however , finds it difficult to hold onto things with the gloves because of her smaller hands
not the color i was expecting i thought these were going to be a beautiful light yellow and grey instead they are a very dark yellow but the product is made of great quality material
the gloves are fit my hand nicely they are also large enough for my husband 's hands the lid holders are quite small but efficient the entire set fits in a small drawer next to my <unk>
i was looking through the lightning deals before christmas and saw these and immediately found my husband and dragged him in front of the computer and said & # # ; you wanted to know what i want for christmas these . & # # ; so he bought them , and i love them i had never seen the little lid holders before , but they are super awesome - i use them all the time and the mitts are nice and thick as well and they 're pretty , of course
oven mitts are something that just do n't get replaced very often i bought these because my old one had gotten a hole in it and also because it was on sale i was n't familiar with using this material and did n't really know how if i was going to like it it works wonderfully and is so stylish the length is perfect for protecting those arms
these work very well , and being neoprene , they do not get saturated with water or oil like fabric <unk> do my favorite part of the set is the little tabs that loop around your <unk> lid handles , giving you a nice cool tab to open the <unk> lid from without needing a glove i did n't even know such things existed , but now that i have them , i use them constantly
after only a couple of weeks of use the <unk> on both straps fell off , and one of the magnetic snap closures lost the side the strap snaps into although i like the way the bag looks , the materials and workmanship are not worth the price of the bag will not buy from this brand again
i like the bag , nice finish although synthetic leather but it 's ok , comfortably snug into your shoulder however on my first real use -lrb- on a flight -rrb- , one of the straps broke so i 'm returning it if you guys can straps and design a little robust , i 'd buy it again
i have gotten many compliments for it it is made from durable material , and looks professional the only thing that i would suggest to users is to treat it with care i have pulled the straps too hard at times , and the magnet is a bit loose now i would recommend this product it came a bit damaged from the shipping and handling i would suggest the seller to ship it in a box , and not in a bag
really nice bag so far no problems i carry my laptop and a notepad in it everyday to college the only issue i have is , i thought it had pockets on the sides , but that 's just a design side pockets would have been great to carry a bottle of water or something no worries , still like it
i love this bag it 's inexpensive for the look i get stopped by so many people asking me where i bought this bag i get a lot of compliments on it i wish they sold more bags like this for the price
this bag does not fit my # -inch laptop , although mine is a little bigger than many you would need a relatively thin # -inch laptop to make this work also , as some other reviewers described , it has a <unk> inner lining i also do not like that the zippers for the main pocket do not extend toward the base farther , so this does not open as wide as i would like it will get the job done and serves as a replacement for my previous backpack , which was falling apart , but i do not think i would really recommend it to anyone
the price of this backpack can not be beat considering all of the storage space you get however , if you have a # & # # ; laptop like myself you may find that the height of the backpack makes it annoying to put one in and take it out my # & # # ; samsung sits so high that it almost squares off the top of the backpack i know not everyone will have this issue with their # & # # ; laptop but i just wanted to make it known i was also disappointed with how short the back straps are for some of us & # # ; kids & # # ; we like to hang ours down pretty low i 'm sure this was designed to be worn correctly to help your back but it feels a bit tight and uncomfortable again , tons of pockets and over space to keep all your techie or school stuff with you , but just a couple things that keep it from being perfect , for me
zipper on front kept coming apart since this opens to the base of the backpack , i almost lost an item double check this when you get it ! give it a few solid <unk>
i chose this bag since amazon basic never let me down before it worth the price it has many pockets as described and big room however the bag is made of poor materials that makes it very rough also the bottle pockets are not big enough to fit my bottle
i got this from my # inch laptop it will not fit with any usb coming out of it , like one the small ones even for a mouse other than that , it does seem like it 's a decent quality , for being so cheap i would say it would be great for a # . # , or # inch laptop full disclosure : comparing it to my rosewill bag , which i love , so if i had to buy it again , in short , i would buy the larger rosewill
i ended up returning this backpack because it is n't near the quality i was anticipating it has a lot of storage space and compartments , but looks like it was assembled at the same factory that does all the walmart backpacks the straps are hard , and do n't feel like they would be comfortable for any long period of time i spent $ # more on a ogio backpack , and i am very happy
i love the price the only potential problems are the following the computer pockets are not heavily padded there may be actually be too many compartments for my taste i get a little confused about what i put where it is relatively slim and flexible for my needs i wish it fit a dslr better , but i knew it would be marginal for that use case when i purchased it
i have to admit - when i found this product , i was quite concerned it would be a cheaply constructed bag i ordered it because i needed something quickly and did n't really want to spend a bunch of time shopping around for the perfect pack i did n't want to spend a ton of money either , since i would n't know what i was getting when the pack arrived , i was quite surprised by what i found it 's a durable quality , with solid seams and heavier material than i expected the zippers are plastic , which is not my preference , but the bag seems to be designed well enough that the load did not strain the zippers even when fully packed for a recent international trip overall , this was a solid purchase and a really attractive price the bag looks good , functions well , and exceeded my expectations
the bag fits a # . # & # # ; laptop quite snuggly , but it fits nonetheless there is a considerable amount of space in each of the available sections , along several accessory pockets for those smaller items the # mesh side pockets are big enough for a standard plastic water bottle , but not big enough for a nalgene water bottle taking it on a couple <unk> so if there are any issues i find with it , i will edit my comments accordingly as it stands now , good solid bag for the price and it does fit larger laptops
i bought it to take on the airplane mainly for my laptop i am a senior , and having it on my back instead of carrying it , relieved the strain on my lower back will be using it all the time now
i got this backpack as a quick replacement for one that broke in the middle of a school week it 's a great backpack , with lots of different compartments for different items , but it 's not nearly as big as the one i had , which was kind of a <unk> if you do n't need to haul a lot at one time , it 's great but , at maximum , could only hold my laptop and about # textbooks comfortably , with small notebooks and folders included
very nice bag with lots of compartments and plenty of room for laptop , tablet , notebook , and accessories i especially like cinch straps to adjust the width to your items top zippers were a little tight at first , but quickly loosened up
this is n't a bad laptop bag lots of compartments which is good , or will be , when i can remember which zipper goes to which compartment not a huge amount of protection , but i 've seen less in some of the brand names i can fit my # & # # ; and my # & # # ; together in this -lrb- the netbook goes in a sleeve so neither is damaged -rrb- there is still room for both cords , some notebooks , books and all manner of junk that i managed to shove into it while i was moving both the laptop and net book survived the # mile trip , in the trunk , in this bag it 's sturdy and efficient
the innards might not look pretty impressive at first sight , but the product is pretty robust great for lugging around a full-sized laptop and all manner of school stuff plenty of compartments inside to pack stuff in separately and the bag itself is pretty light in weight good buy for the price point if you 're looking for a regular use backpack for school or work
i ordered this backpack in anticipation of a # -day vacation to universal <unk> and a royal caribbean cruise i needed something to carry my laptop where i could easily remove it for security , and that had lots of pockets for my travel papers and various things i needed to keep my # yo busy this amazonbasics laptop is well-made and sturdy with a variety of pocket sizes and places to put stuff whatever material they used for the inside of the bag makes it very loud and & # # ; crinkly , & # # ; but also easy to clean there is at least one pocket that seems extraneous and almost gets in the way , and when all the pockets are closed , there is an over abundance of zipper pulls but the bag traveled very well and i like the sleeker style of it the backpack is a bit much for everyday use -lrb- just in bulk and number of pockets , etc -rrb- , but i 'm happy to have it for future travels
simple , effective , functional , well priced , simply packaged - what 's not to like ? -lrb- ok , the interior pocket fabric is a bit rough <unk> , but that 's about it ... a product line that more <unk> should copy - simple goods that do the advertised tasks this full sized bag handles either of my laptops -lrb- # . # dell or # & # # ; hp -rrb- and a galaxy tab <unk> 's keyboard -lrb- in the amazonbasics tablet bag , along w/a few accessories the straps seem sturdy enough , and the outer fabric is dense enough to ward of mild <unk> / wear zippers and fittings also seem to be properly set it place , and work w/o catching or snagging # stars indeed
my husband and i recently flew to <unk> and needed a pack to carry all our modern day electronics and this pack served us well recommend for anyone that likes to keep all the devices in one place
found this backpack to be attractive and functional with a variety of useful compartments and pouches seems sturdily constructed and was pretty comfortable , even when loaded down with my laptop , a <unk> book , a couple magazines and some papers , and some <unk> and various items of clothing took it on a recent vacation trip , and it did its job admirably
i really needed a backpack for carrying my laptop , and after looking at many of them online and in the stores , this one <unk> to fit the right combination of price and storage capacity so far the backpack is handling all my storage <unk> very well , and it looks like it 's been made well too plenty of pockets for all your stuff , and a dedicated padded area for your laptop
i really love my backpack it is <unk> , yet fits everything i need to and more it is very simple and has a that extra flare of my favorite color orange it has nice material that feels sturdy and is rather comfortable i like that it has a lot of conveniently hidden pockets and # water bottle holders
i bought this backpack and absolutely loved it it was spacious and fit my laptop well but , it did n't even last me a month the inner <unk> sleeve was completely falling off , and the plastic holding the strap on completely broke off causing the backpack -lrb- containing my $ # laptop -rrb- to hit the cement sidewalk . super disappointed with the quality i would not recommend buying this
i received my bag on may # th , to day is may # rd and the bag is broken the buckle on the strap snapped in half as i was putting the bag on i now have a nice size dent in my ipad from when the bag hit the ground after the buckle snapped avoid this bag , look for a higher end one if you like the style
this bag is absolutely horrible within three weeks of getting it one of the straps broke a few weeks later another strap broke the straps to the zippers have broken or fallen off overall it 's not worth it to buy this product
i had low expectations because of the cost , however i did expect this bag to make it through one overnight excursion to chicago zipped it closed and opened it once and the zipper separated , never to work again next time i will spend my money on a quality bag that will last
i really liked this bag unfortunately after only about a month 's use the plastic adjustment piece on the strap broke in half as such this will be going back and i will be looking elsewhere to replace it
the material is very thin the backpack is not sturdy at all it can barely fit my # inch laptop the strap is thin and narrow my back is quite uncomfortable when using it
i regret buying this back because it just look like a cheap replica of the herschel bags it 's ok for the price though best for little kids it 's kind of too small for a # yr old
i bought this backpack for a cute bag to have on vacation to be able to shed layers if needed during long days away from the hotel my first time using it was on vacation and on day three the zipper broke i did n't have more than # pounds in it however , it is super cute i loved the hidden pocket on the back i just wish my zipper stayed in tack for my whole vacation
just for it today and it looks awesome it does look a lot slimmer than it does in the picture and looks like it wo n't be able to hold a ton of stuff but it 's pretty much what i needed have n't been able to use it yet but i already like it we 'll see though
it seems to be a good quality backpack , but a little small for me you can fit a laptop , and # or # books there 's no room for extra stuffing
it 's a little on the small side and one of the zippers messed up not long after i started using it other than that it 's super cute i 'm still using it
i love this bag it 's the perfect size for my laptop , a few <unk> , power cord , small lunch bag , etc . it also fits perfectly in my work drawer -- out of site during the day i love the color , the pockets and the <unk> i 've used it for # weeks now and all zippers and latches are still holding up i would recommend
it 's perfect to carry around on a sight seeing trip or for plane travel , definitely not intended for heavy use if you want a stylish backpack that can carry your laptop and some notebook then this is perfect
when i first received this backpack i thought & # # ; <unk> this is small , my giant laptop wont fit . & # # ; but boy was i wrong although it looks small it really fits a lot and it 's super cute i would totally recommend it for college students like myself who carry a lot on them ! :
product description is accurate and the material is much sturdier -lrb- in terms of quality , not stiffness -rrb- than i expected it also arrived much faster than the estimated delivery date so do n't <unk> if you think you 'll have to wait a month to receive it in all <unk> , you probably wo n't and you 'll be pleasantly surprised with your backpack
my wife was looking for a good laptop bag when i came across this it looked great i was even more impressed when i saw it first person wonderful quality and keeps her macbook safe it has a <unk> look to it that is another thing we both liked its worth the money
arrived faster than expected and quality and color of the backpack is quite good i bought it for my daughter in fact she picked it and another one to complement she is happy with both bags
when i got this backpack , i loved it so much it had plenty of space for all of my things and it was super cute but after about a month , i noticed the strings were changing color then the strings clip broke and finally one of the buttons fell off making it unable to be used i had to throw it away because it was n't efficient anymore i would not get this backpack because it will just fall apart
i purchased this for my # day trip to <unk> to hold my water bottle , wallet and any <unk> , and the bottom of the bag got a hole in it the # nd day the pull tab for the outside zipper <unk> also broke on the # st day it was disappointing all around
i loved the colors and pattern but the bag ripped within # quarter into college i have to purchase a new better quality one this one is not worth the # dollars seems cheap and it really literally is cheap i used to put notebooks and lunch inside and it could n't take # water bottles and paper and it made a huge whole on the bottom and the hooks <unk> :
this backpack is pretty but the left pocket thing <unk> ! ! and when you wash it and dry it the color disappears i do not recomend this ! ! this thing is very
wear my white pants and next thing i know the blue from the back pack i 'd in my white pants and ruined them and it 's to small thought it was going to be bigger ca n't fit anything in
the product i received was not as pictured the logo on the front is in chinese and not as pictured the drawstring was not put together the quality of the product seems minimal
my daughter wanted a canvas backpack so i finally found one that she really liked this is a cute pack that seems to be well made , especially considering the price on amazon
looks great but with the yoga # s it does not go in to tablet mode easily with the cover as it is a little too thick if you do n't plan on using it much as a tablet this may be alright for you ... but then why buy the yoga in the first place if you wo n't use it as a tablet
i was not expecting this cover to be translucent this will work to protect from scratches but that is all also there is too much bulk to allow for tablet mode , it puts too much pressure on the hinges it does fit nice and it looks cool , the color is brighter than the picture which was a plus shipping was super fast
i think i should 've listened to the negative comments about the color and gotten a purple one instead it looks a bit cheap but hey it is $ # it serves it 's purpose and it snaps perfectly i can bend it back and use it like a tablet too so
i liked my new case , it just didnt turn out to be the color that i chose it was a darker green and the picture made it seem like a lighter one other than that i like it and it got here quickly
it got here a little late but it 's fine , thank you for the case it also is n't the color that is shown in the picture , it 's a deeper green it does what it needs to do
the product that actually comes in the mail is not what the picture shows or what the description says the case is a light purple and see through it is not a deep purple that looks matte do n't buy this product
the only great thing about this product is price it 's not deep purple at all , it 's light purple the bottom part of the case wo n't stay snapped on , it keeps coming off which gets really annoying at least it was cheaper than most i guess if you 're buying this product for the color of the case , do n't bother , it 's not the color you see on the picture
the actual hard case was good and fit well as long as the sleeve my problems were the laptop cover not being sticky in the least and the screen protector bubbling up no matter how carefully i tried to put it on the screen
i liked the color and the pouch that was included , however the bottom piece for the computer did not fit properly to the macbook it is as if it was a tad too small so it does not snap on and stay on to the computer i did not return it because i liked the other components and i really like the color , however that small flaw does annoy me from time to time
i received my order today and was very surprised to see visible dark finger print smudges on the soft sleeve bag -lrb- inside a plastic bag container -rrb- i & # # ; m not sure if the person who packed it forgot to wash their hands but it was disappointing to open the box and see that otherwise , the rest of the materials provided were good the yellow covers snapped on easily , the keyboard cover fits well -lrb- typing on it now -rrb- and the monitor cover is thick and translucent i would love to say that i would recommend or order from this vendor again but the sleeve really put me off
i barely have a month with it , i am very careful with my things and the sleeve already ripped also the case cracked on a corner and broke off the colors are different from the picture but other than that its ok
not satisfied the hard case did not fit the computer it was too big that 's the most important thing in the package and it did not work color not as seen on the
i thought i should mention that this product is a bargain . # things in one discounted package is a steal but anyway this product has served me very well the only thing potential customers should know is that the case can break relatively easily i bumped into a wall on the corner of the case and now i need to get a new one because the corners that were holding the laptop in the case broke off but i plan to buy another case from the same company very soon
great price for all four things loved it , specially the keyboard coat except that the top part of the computer case its a little bit heavy for the thin mac book air
my case got to me within # days of it being shipped i was in shock so a + for delivery the product itself is awesome it fits my laptop perfectly with no fuss the color was exactly the same as in the picture normally i do n't give reviews on anything i buy but for this product it was a must
i love this case it is thick and sturdy and the material quality is very high it does n't get smudge marks on it as easily as the other rubberized cases i have had , plus installing and removing it is so much easier than any other case i have ever had i have this for my # inch macbook air and it fits
the case is exactly as described fits my macbook air perfectly the keyboard cover makes looks great on the protective sleeve is perfect fit , and matches the color of the case it was a great deal for all three color matching products
this was delivered on time and with no problem i was well informed of when it was going to show up and it came with no problem color and everything that the seller offered was exactly as promised i loved it
it 's fine i had those hard cases with color but those ones easily break so i went ahead and bought this one its not fantastic but i think it does the job i just bought it to not get any scratches on my macbook pro
i thought this case would be a little more <unk> with padding , but none the less met my expectations for the price the fabric looks as though it would get dirty very easily it does fit nicely though , i was pleased that this sleeve was big enough to fit the case on my laptop a lot of people complained about a smell but it did n't particularly bother me
this case is great , it looks nice and hold my # & # # ; macbook pro retina very well the downside is that the zippers are not as smooth as i would like , they take a bit of force to use and it 's oversized for my # & # # ; late # retina in thickness it was made for a much thicker laptop , especially since the # & # # ; retina is so thin
it 's convenient for travel , but not regular , daily protection i purchased this for daily protection , but , because it does not allow for overheating protection , i only use it for travel
i needed something to protect my computer if i decided to ride my bike and for some reason got into an accident or accidentally dropped it so far , it 's seems rugged , zipper almost never gets stuck -lrb- never gets stuck around the corners -rrb- it 's light enough that i do n't notice it when i carry it around with my computer only con is that if you 're not too careful in how you are closing the case , the straps get stuck in the computer or it causes the zipper to snag easy fix : close computer first , then case this allows the straps to close above the computer , and fold nicely on their own so they do n't get in the way of the zipper i have not had the chance to test it against accidental water spills , but it seems tough enough to protect my computer against that type of damage overall great case for its price tag would definitely recommend
i really like the design and the shape of the case the only thing that keeps me from giving it an extra star is that i wish it was lined with something soft the way the incase brand cases are but it seems like it 's going to keep its shape really well since it 's more of a hard case
strong protection , however if you want to listen to music you 'll need to take the laptop out of the case as the audio insert hole is covered up fortunately , i 'm still able to charge with my # & # # ; mac in the case
like i mentioned in the subject , this is perfect fit for the latest # & # # ; macbook pro -lrb- a # -rrb- adds a <unk> 'll bit of weight , but that complements the protection it offers i kind of hope the surface had been a bit more <unk> , rather than being just plain and rough that would have been a bit more comfortable to hold yes , this is not a thule , but definitely worth the price
this laptop case is sturdy and rather professional looking i have an older , dented macbook so laptop sleeves -lrb- as opposed to shells -rrb- are my only option , and this is definitely one of the better ones i 've had
-lrb- for those who care : i have a late # & # # ; macbook pro retina -rrb- it 's a good case i do n't love the texture of it -lrb- my last laptop had a soft neoprene cover -rrb- , but it 's sturdy i like that i can keep the laptop in the case during use , but can take it out without any fuss it 's a little fussy for charging in it , though - the edge of it -lrb- where the zipper is -rrb- presses the charger out of place unless it 's sitting * just right *
got this case for my sons macbook pro he says it fits well in the case wanted a little more protection especially when it is in his backpack inexpensive protection for an expensive laptop
my husband loves this cover for his macbook it 's sturdy , protects the macbook no matter what gets on it -lrb- it withstood our cat <unk> it and it 's still in great condition -rrb- and it 's relatively inexpensive
this case rocks it is lightweight but sturdy enough to protect my macbook pro from bumps and bruises it folds easily and stays where i want when open what 's not to like about and expensive yet durable case for our laptops my only negative and a small one at that is it lacks a carry handle guess that 's not sufficient to dock it one star full # for this unit due to the excellent design and construction weatherproof zipper definitely a nice touch as well
if you plan to travel with your macbook pro # -inch , this is a necessary accessory well made case and fits my mac very good why would you spend so much on a laptop and not protect it
i bought this for carrying my new macbook pro # around my college campus it fits my laptop perfectly and protects it in my backpack i do n't have to worry about scratches , getting banged around , etc . made of good fabric and with high quality . also zipper is waterproof that gives me a peace of mind to even carry this cover outside in rainy day and not to worry about my mac getting wet great product , certainly worth the price
finally , cases that look nice , made from quality , and also affordable everything for mac these days are ridiculously expensive i would highly recommend this case for people with a macbook # & # # ; do n't let the price fool you
i wanted a case to protect my mbp retina when it was being carried around in my <unk> around campus , and this case has been great for added protection i 've had it for a little over a month , and have no complaints the quality was better than i expected it 's lightweight , and fits my mbp retina snuggly it has a nice waterproof zipper overall , i 'm very pleased with it
the laptop case is a good combination of rigid protection for the laptop and cushioning that absorbs bumps i had a rigid case for a while and then bought a neoprene sleeve the runetz is a combination of both i do n't have to remove it from the sleeve to use it - just a quick zip / unzip the elastic bands hold it open at a good angle ; i wo n't have to worry about breaking the hinge like last time
i ordered this hard case because i thought it was rubberized and that you could see the apple logo through it neither of these <unk> is the case the cover is made from a cheap plastic that is not uniform and has visible marks where it was cut out it looks horribly cheap and was nothing like i thought it would be
this cover does n't provide much protection for some areas of the macbook -- it 's not flimsy but is n't very substantial either more important , it provides no protection for the rear bottom corners of the laptop -- they 're completely exposed i immediately took it off my laptop , put my old cover back on -lrb- which does protect all corners but is # years old and starting to crack -rrb- , and packaged the cover for a return i ordered a different cover that is more expensive but also more substantial and covers all corners hopefully the new one will do the job
the description states that a # . # inch laptop , inside their clip-on mosiso case will fit in the sleeve bag , but it will not i tried and tried because they match and are cute
it fits my macbook -lrb- mid # -rrb- and the color is cute <unk> it 's barely rubberized , instead of rubber feet , mine 's has little white foam feet so its slides around the edges are really rough and <unk> i literally had to take sandpaper and sand the edges of the case so it would n't scratch my wrists anymore
i took out the bottom part of the case when i went to the apple store for a check up because i was <unk> some computer technical problems and then i put it back now when i pull the screen up or down it makes a click noise thus , i gave it # stars . its cute but i guess it 's not meant to be taken out
i have had difficulty ordering a case like this through amazon , i was sent the wrong model , or wrong color many times & # # ; . but this one finally works true to color , great fit , hopefully durable snaps on the front and back and <unk> to protect it pretty well great price for a great product will be <unk> : -
i was happy with this it fits my computer very snugly and has a lower profile than my other cover it 's is a very bright red , which i purchased on purpose because people are less likely to steal such a visible computer i like that the apple light shines through the back the little foot pads on the bottom are also great you can put it at an angle and there 's no way it will slip my old cover did n't have those or the vents now my computer stays cooler too i recommend this
awesome smooth , soft , plastic , transparent all of the cut outs for ports , cd drive , and <unk> are fully accessible and precisely in the right places clicks on firmly & tightly does n't show fingerprints , dust , and offers excellent overall protection some cases come with plastic fold down feet this one does n't , less to break having any case at all does hold in warmth a little more than without it , although i have n't ever felt it get more than slightly warm , i check it every hour of running time im very pleased
