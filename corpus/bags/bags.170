like another reviewer , i had also purchased the speck cover for $ # . # and will be returning it though i did prefer the `` satin touch `` feel of the speck , the overall value of this cover made it an easy choice in particular , the fold out feet and vented bottom make all the difference it 's a rich and bright blue , easy to spot , a snap -lrb- literally -rrb- to put on , and provides great protection
i like the cover the blue color is vibrant it was super easy to install , took about # seconds my only complaint is it picks up smudges way too easily it 's not hard to clean , but any time it gets touched , it picks up smudges i do wash my hands frequently and keep a clean <unk> i think it 's just the material please also be aware the cover has a <unk> feature - there are little feet that fold out - so these can add a bit of discomfort if you 're using the computer on your lap not a big deal ; just something to be aware of overall a good cover and i would recommend it
i got this case after treating my new macbook air like an <unk> for the first few weeks of ownership this case is hard , fits well , and provides protection from minor nicks and scratches i doubt this cover will help much if the laptop was to fall off of a desk , but it provides enough peace of mind for me cover snaps on and can move a little if one of the ` latches ' <unk> -lrb- hence the # star review -rrb- but again : device serves its purpose
it 's very easy to install - it 's just snap-on - and it even includes a clear keyboard cover , which i did n't realize i think i preferred my other keyboard cover because this one is slightly difficult to adhere , but it works pretty well the case is actually a brighter blue than indicated in the picture , which may or may not be a con it works for me because it 's my school color , but i was hoping for a more sleek , satin blue the case also doubles the weight of the macbook air , but then again , it serves its purpose
i like the cover it is light and allows for the apple logo to shine through problem is the clips break very easy it did not take long before one of the clips broke i have since removed the cover it stays on even with one of the clips broken , i just get irritated when the on corner is loose i do like how you get the working angle my air never got hot with the cover on and it does protect the mac
great product - very durable , exactly as described , easy to attached , etc . only little annoyance is the one leg seems to be slightly smaller and does n't stay in place so as the computer is carried or moved the leg makes a squeaky sound that 's a bit annoying
well it 's not too bad it fits but i see where people complain about one corner of the bottom not snapping it if you shift it a bit then it does hold sad to say that mine did n't come with a free cover but ipearl promptly corrected it . oh and the apple logo you see on top is n't part of the cover it 's the light from the notebook shining through
fortunately , the keyboard protector that comes with this is not needed to install the case that portion of this product is garbage otherwise , the case is very slim -lrb- was actually surprised it is still thinner than my old # macbook -rrb- and seems to be sturdy we 'll see how it holds up the rest of spring semester
i just received this case for my macbook air and so far i 'm very impressed at first i bought the belkin case , but i did n't think it was venting the heat well enough this case has vents on the bottom and in my opinion a better design plus it 's less expensive regardless , i highly recommend a case for the macbook air not that this computer really needs a case , but i 'm more comfortable protecting the exterior
this is a really attractive cover that fits the top and bottom very well i am happy with my purchase , except that it adds weight i did n't want on my mac air it comes with a keyboard cover which may be appreciated by some , i found it hard to type through the cover
i made the mistake of purchasing the # & # # ; when i have a # & # # ; macbook air i planned to return it but my sister wanted to have it , she does have a # & # # ; older version she says it would shatter on impact if dropped , but the small lifts on the bottom of the case really help out her wrists when writing so , if you buy it , buy it for the wrist comfort , not the clearly ineffective protection
i have a beautiful blue cover for my mac air - # inch it fits perfectly i highly recommend it but the silicone cover is all wrong the top row characters are labeled for the mac pro and do not <unk> to the macbook air -lrb- macbook air does not have an eject <unk> . that was very disappointing
this cover is super easy to put on and does exactly what i wanted it to : protect my macbook from surface scratches it adds almost zero weight and the small kickstands on the bottom give it an easier angle for typing on a flat surface
i bought this before i bought my macbook air , i wanted some protection prior to <unk> out into the wild the unit fits very well and is a bargain at half the price of the similar speck unit my mcover also came with a very thin clear <unk> keyboard cover as well , a nice
i love this case it 's beautiful to look at , and the legs on it allow me to type with better ergonomics i could not be happier with it wife loved it , got one for her macbook air too
i bought the mac air for my wife i felt how thin and slippery it was in spite of the fact it was a present , i <unk> asked what cover she would like if she had a new mac air
this case is perfect it went on with no problem and keeps the laptop safe from scratches i also like the clips on the bottom that raises the back up in the air
i love this it fit perfectly and it even comes with a cover for your keyboard it has little clips in the back to turn your laptop at an up angle . how awesome is that and it fits wonderfully i must say again . i love the color and the apple shines through wonderfully
it works fine , but the part i like most are the legs on the bottom that tilt the back of the laptop up it 's easier to type and read with the computer at an angle
i had originally purchased a cover for my macbook air from the apple store because of their meager selection , i purchased an item i was not completely happy with -lrb- seemed loose and flimsy -rrb- but felt like i needed to protect the computer immediately so of course the laptop eventually slips out of the case and drops to the floor while i was moving it luckily , the internal components seem to be undamaged -lrb- ssd ! -rrb- that 's when i looked into amazon not only does this case fit onto the computer securely , it looks great affordable and stylish , it 's a solid purchase as always , i should have looked to amazon first
i 'd been eyeing this case for a couple months when i finally decided to order it i could n't be happier it was delivered quickly , snapped on in a minute , is a wonderful blue color , and will protect my mac from getting scratched ! # stars all the way
updated version for the # macbook air -- this one will not block the extra side microphone -- highly recommended , keeps your macbook air protected and in pristine condition and when everybody else has one , you will have an easier time keeping track of your laptop when its in a case like this
i love the way this cover makes my computer look and the <unk> on the bottom is a great feature i will agree with others that the keyboard cover seems to muffle the sound as the keyboard is where it comes from , but i have removed it anyway since i do n't eat or drink around my computer
this case looks great and is very thin , so it does n't take away from the slimness of the air the only criticism i have is the added weight is a little too much for the hinges , so occasionally the screen will fall backwards or forwards at the extreme angles
this was super simple , snapped right on to my computer and looks great a coworker had it and i thought it was really cute and wanted the same one met all my expectations for a computer cover :
i had a different one of these that did n't fit the newer version of the macbook air i got early in # this one fits very well and was easy to quickly snap on i especially like that , unlike others , it has ventilation slots to keep the laptop from over heating the blue color is gorgeous and transparent , too , so the apple shines through my last macbook got quite beat up from slipping onto our <unk> floors never got damage internally , but every time i brought it to the genius bar they noted it and were concerned that the dents on the outer shell might indicate problems with this ipearl hard shell cover case , hopefully i will keep my new mac dent and scuff free the foldable feet were a bonus that seem like they will be useful , although i have n't tried them yet
my first macbook air seemed to scratch easily , so when i bought a new one , i immediately bought this cover it arrived on time and was simple to install i 've had it for two months and it stays on well i also find no issues with using accessories as there is plenty of room around the ports the cover looks good i recommend it
i wanted a non-bulky cover for my macbook air that would protect my laptop while allowing me to carry it in my backpack i have been using this cover for about half a year and it still looks great i like the rubber pads on the bottom that keep it from slipping while using it on slick surfaces
bought this cover for my brand new mba # inch it was much cheaper than the options at the apple website it installed in just a few minutes and did no damage to the device i like the kickstands in the back for a more ergonomic feel when typing the blue color is vibrant , very pretty overall , happy with the purchase
this is a great accessory for your macbook air it gives you a better grip than the smooth polished aluminum when carrying it around and adds style to your mac keeps scratches away and its easy to install if you own a macbook air , you need one of these
this a great product it fit like a glove and was easy to install lightweight yet so far very durable the actual color of the product was accurately depicted in the photos at this price it is a great value
for the price , the case is not bad i just needed something to protect my macbook air from scratches not long after i put the case on , my mba -lrb- purchased august # -rrb- dropped so i was relieved that there were no dents plus it 's still transparent enough that you can see the apple lit up i do n't have much use for the stand that come on the
i simply love my blue hard shell cover for my new macair it is good looking and keeps my computer safe from knocks and scratches i 've seen others , but i love my color best the cover was recommended by someone in an apple store
this is an excellent product , and in my experience , the very best out there yet i just got a new macbook air # . # `` model a # and needed to protect its beautiful finish this does the trick and gives it some color as well the logo shines through , the ports all accessible , installation a no-brainer -lrb- although someone posted a video on how to put it on in this product review i watched it and , thanks to the reviewer , found this works great -rrb- installation instructions do not come with it but it is hard to get this wrong just watch the video and line it up at the corners and it will happily snap in place earned my top review and a full # -stars
i ordered this cover for a mac air i bought in june it works great and fits perfectly the legs that fold down help when typing lengthy pages would highly recommend this product great service from the seller arrives quickly
previously had purchased the speck covers for my macbook air they were junk i returned # different sets because of broken clips during installation saw these covers from mcover and decided to give them a try they actually fit the macbook air and i am able to remove them if needed without issues as well they even look good i purchased a blue set that looks awesome
product is of great workmanship <unk> is spot on ; with just a few clicks , my macbook air is sporting its new `` dress `` not to mention that it will now be protected from accidental dings i am already browsing through for additional colors as a way to spice it up every once in awhile get yours now , you will not regret it
i love this cover and to my surprise it came with a keyboard cover as well i have a macbook air # . # in and it fits perfectly it is easy to put on and looks great on the computer i have had it for # weeks now and so far so good i highly recommend this product , especially for $ # your not gon na find a better steal for your buck
received item in great shape looks better than what 's in the photo it was difficult to find a cover for the mac air # inch laptop , and this one fits perfectly
this is the second ipearl case i 've purchased , since my previous # . # & # # ; apple macbook air was stolen the case is light , easy to snap on , sits securely on a desk or surface , and keeps annoying scratches away from your laptop
given that apple designed the mac air cover to be so fragile and easy to scratch , this ipearl mcover hard shell is a necessity not a luxury it fits precisely , it protects the air book , and in this bright blue it 's hard to lose your laptop out in public this shell is n't exactly light weight , but it does not double the weight of the mac book air as commented upon buy another reviewer as a bonus you do get a soft plastic keyboard cover , so do n't be tempted to buy the cover that amazon offers to sell you as a separate item along with your purchase of this hard shell the included keyboard cover works well but i prefer the feel of the keyboard sans cover , so your choice whether or not to actually use it i highly recommend this mcover hard shell
i found this ipearl cover to be just what i wanted it fits my macbook air perfectly i worry that the little plastic tabs securing it to my computer might be too fragile , but so far there is no reason to think they will fail my son says the cover defeats the purpose of getting a thin macbook air , but i disagree it does add a little bit of bulk , but also a lot of protection
the case took no time to arrive , and was super easy to fit it i thought it wasnt the case at first since the bottom piece was a bit loose , but once it clicked into place it was fine love the texture and came with a keyboard protection which i intended to buy at a later session so that was nice as well definitely recommend this product
i go this very fast and it fits the macbook air # & # # ; great the macbook belongs to the school system , so we were n't allowed to write our names on it , but with these cases we can write our names and school on it as well i am hoping that it will last as long as we have the macbook it is n't a heavy plastic , but seems durable
love the color and the fit of this product , catch ever so <unk> on the hinge area when opening it , but that does n't seem to be a problem the fit is <unk> , and the product works great
i ca n't believe how expensive most of these type of shell cases are this one is made in usa , reasonable price , shipped fast it is easy to apply and seems like it will do the job i want , which is protect my shiny new macbook air from incidental scratches of course it will not protect from drops or spills but that 's not what it is designed for i have a case logic case this goes into for that love the aqua color one foot does seem looser than the other which is slightly annoying but not enough to return or exchange it overall i am very satisfied ; you could get # of these for the price of one of the other brands
i ready it everywhere but i thought i would be different i never even leave the house with it before it cracked it looked sweet apple glows thru the plastic
i bought this product used , and it came in almost perfect condition my only issue with this case is that the fingerprints appear everywhere i would 've preferred the dark green color , but i bought the black because it was cheaper if you do n't want fingerprints , i suggest purchasing a lighter color edit : about # months later , this case has cracked at pretty much every connection point , so the laptop may not be as secure as it used to be i 've dropped my laptop maybe once or twice , and that was only about # feet , off of my bed , onto carpet the cracks are growing , and i really think the case is too fragile to be worth the price
the feel and look of the case is way better than a lot of the other cases that i 've had however , i 've only used this for less than a few months not to mention `` light use `` i see little small cracks all around the edges of the case . $ # plus for this case i am not sure if it 's worth it pretty disappointed at this moment
in the beginning this cover worked out well . after a month or two the case cracked in all the edges and cracked right down the front of the laptop not the best product i 've purchased for my laptop ... bought another cheaper and more
after using it for more than a month , i can say that it saved my macbook air from a lot of scratches and a small bump it 's a great exterior protector from minor bumps and major scratches though one thing that concerns me is that , when i do heavy <unk> or edit something in <unk> on my laptop , it gets more hot that it would have normally and the clip on system is n't really that effective when taking off , it sticks very tightly and people worrying if this would put scratches in your laptop , no it wont
i like that it 's ` soft ' and not super hard very hard plastics will scratch the hell out of your computer if a spec of sand or dust gets between them it loved it until the bottom half broke a tiny bit around the power cable side under normal use it did n't hold on very well after that loved it , but i got a soft case instead , because it adds shock protection it 's a great slim case , so it 's up to you on how you 'll carry your computer
so far , it provides great protection and looks good from a distance every little finger smudge shows , however , which is a bit of a let down you can see the apple logo shine through the material , given the <unk> -- which is a nice touch
i bought because i had one with my mac book pro i 've had this new one for over a month and i have two cracks in it not sure if it was my fault or if it is just too thin . whatever the case , its cracked and quite possibly will get worse i will not purchase another one
this cover has gotten a lot of attention from everyone who has seen me with my macair in fact , one guy thought that the new mac air was coming out in black i think it looks really slick and professional , plus it feels nice draw back is that it 's already cracked on the sides from minor <unk> , so do n't expect heavy duty protection for your mac for the most part it will do well for minor <unk> and will protect from scratches if you want something more durable , look for another cover or casing i take my mac in a bag where ever i go , so i 'm not to concerned oh and it looks really cool , especially when the apple logo <unk> up
it definitely adds weight to the thin and light macbook air it does n't add much girth , which is great the big drawback is the added weight on the screen is obviously not what the hinge is intended for , so the screen tends to fall back if not on a stable surface a very small issue , but worth mentioning overall , it 's a great product
with this case on , people mistake my macbook air for ipad or black version of macbook air apple logo glowing through this case is really gorgeous but it tends to capture the heat inside the case also it adds weight to the screen , making screen to lean forward can be annoying at times one time i dropped my macbook air on a hard asphalt road but the case protected the laptop very well
the case fits my new -lrb- # -rrb- # & # # ; macbook air beautifully , is lightweight , and has an <unk> satin finish i have n't found anything else that compares in terms of those features my only concern is how hot the bottom of the device gets without there being any ventilation holes in the case i think this is a design flaw i am now ordering a cooling fan mat to ensure the device does not overheat
i love this product it fits my mac book air perfectly , it 's a quality product , not cheesy but not bulky just what i wanted , <unk> enough but keeps my macbook air clean and off the table , no new scratches and it stays in place i love that it shipped quickly
i 've had good experience with speck products in the past during the iphone # antenna reception <unk> , otherwise referred to as ` <unk> ' , i was <unk> in receiving a speck pixel skin hd <unk> of apple right away , i felt it to be superior to the incase case that i was familiar with on my previous iphone # g so , i 've decided to give speck a second look when i was looking for a suitable case for my # `` macbook air i can say that i chose well and i 'm confident in my selection of it it fits well , has a nice satin feel to it and , overall , it covers the external parts of the aluminum shell fairly well
its simple , light and effective just like that mac air . great buy . they could not ship to my location -lrb- a military base overseas -rrb- but got to my place in the states quick
after a horrendous experience with a <unk> hard-plastic cover , i sprung for the more expensive speck cover this product is designed to exact tolerances , so it goes on and off easily without changing the air 's ability to close tightly also , you get a nice , grippy texture
this product is a terrible buy the mount is very difficult to attach to the mac mini moreover the mount i purchased got stuck on my mac i had to pry it off near where one of the three mounting <unk> would not release i would avoid purchasing the h-squared mini mount for the mac mini unibody at all costs
i purchased # of these for an <unk> in a <unk> these were <unk> <unk> and simply took too much time to set up i could not manage to get all three points at the same time i left them with only the <unk> two the only reason i would suggest them to another person is that i do n't see other options out there i feel i would have been better off just <unk> the removable plate to the wall . if i only would have known that before i charged my client
purchased this and although we are keeping it , i am not very impressed with the locking mechanism as stated in other reviews it really is a great idea , but the lock does n't really lock it at all , which allows for it to be taken off the mount quite easily and if you live in <unk> country -lrb- like me -rrb- it makes me think it will pop right out of place i also prefer the older style
this mount works ... eventually it 's a real pain to get the mini to lock into the mount once the it 's screwed into place in your selected mounting location seems you have to hold it just right if i were to do it again , i 'd go with another mounting option
after mounting the device it was discovered that with a slight twist on the mini , it would simply twist off of the two `` unlocked `` screws and with just a little more effort the screw with the security feature would also release we ended up applying a few well placed `` <unk> `` of silicone between the security replacement plate and the <unk> portion of the <unk> while not the best possible remedy , it allowed us to mount the mini , but only in the interest of being able to get the unit mounted within our designated <unk> h-squared mini mount for mac mini
i was trying to make more space on my desk when i came across this mount as much as i like the mac mini , it still takes up a lot of space on your desk installation was very easy thanks to the supplied mounting paper , and i had the project completed in no time while this mount works great , i 'm not sure that drilling a couple of holes in the apple mini bottom plate would n't work just the same and i do n't know that i would trust the mount to be the only security if i was concerned with theft , but overall a solid product update - # months after buying this mount , the mini is still on the wall , and looks great i did mount the mini cable side down to protect the ports from dust , and i still think this was a good idea - the top does collect a little
this mount works fine and looks good but there are two things you 'll need to keep in mind when you 're installing it first , install the mount to a wall <unk> do n't try attaching it through your <unk> using the supplied <unk> <unk> the amount of pressure and <unk> needed to attach the mini to the mount will loosen the mount from the wall second , attaching the mini to the mount when the mount is on the wall is n't easy because the mount keeps the mini close to the wall , which is the reason why most of us are buying it so , do some breathing <unk> , relax , or take a pill before you try attaching the mini you 'll be pleased with the results either because the mini looks good on the wall or because the pill has n't worn off yet either way , it 's a nice mount
awesome device to mount the mini up under the desk it has the airflow needed to keep it cool and is out of the way easy to install and easy to uninstall for upgrades or warranty work
this is a nice little mount for the mac mini it is fairly easy to mount using the included template for holes i found it necessary to remove the small lock screw and slide the lock mechanism once mounted , you can slide the lock mechanism back into position and replace the small lock screw the locking mechanism is probably more for keeping the mac mini from being <unk> off the mount plate rather than a theft <unk> device
i installed four h-squared mac mini mounts in about two hours the mac mini looks great installed i would suggest these to anybody who needs to free up desktop space
these incase sleeves are great to put your computer in , but its not the best protection which is fine my only issue with the incase sleeves is the fact that the lighter colors stain so easily thats the only reason i give them # stars get the black
protects laptop for # cost as the competing products snug but good on mac book pro and can be used as stand alone when you want to carry just the laptop the <unk> the <unk> green is a little odd for business settings but for # the cost of black i can fake being <unk> vs
being that i did n't pay a whole lot for this -- i am very impressed with this product after i got my macbook pro , i went to best buy to look for a laptop sleeve and there was no way i was going to pay $ # + for one of these i looked on amazon and got this bad boy for $ # the lime green can be considered unprofessional i suppose if you have a serious career , but i figured that being an <unk> girl and a freshman in college , i can pull it off the only thing i do n't like is that i ca n't fit my charger in the case , and there 's no strap i just slip it in my schoolbag all and all , i think it 's cute and it works well for what i do
this case is for my wife 's # & # # ; macbook air it fits the macbook very well , not too loose , not too tight the case itself has a clean design and looks as though it would offer a fair amount of protection if ever gravity checked it has dual zippers with a slip lip under them to prevent them from rubbing against the finish of the laptop i would recommend trying this out
love the color and the inside is very soft i keep my macbook air in it whenever i 'm not using it it fell from a bed to the <unk> floor while in the case and the computer was not damaged not sure sure how good it would be for a hard fall , but it is a great case to prevent it from getting scratched or dirty
fits my # in macbook pro excellently and the color is <unk> ' if you like a <unk> case and you 're a fan of incase , it 's worth it , although i got it on sale $ # ... normally i believe they 're around $ #
after ordering another # `` sleeve that was too big for my mbp , i was <unk> glad to have found this particular sleeve first , the price can not be beaten it fits my # mbp w / retina display nicely and it has an interior <unk> lining that holds the computer well it 's not quite snug , but it 's the proper size the color is as you see in the picture : -
this was actually a smidge larger than my mac so the computer moves a bit , but other than that it is good the fabric can get snagged , but i really do n't mind the outside of the case looking a bit used
there is n't much to this sleeve , but the color is vibrant , the neoprene is rubbery and soft to the touch and the lining is fuzzy and nice there is nothing about this sleeve that exceeded my expectations or <unk> me , but it 's a good product , and the price was very reasonable
it protects my mac book which is all i care about it is easy to slip in and out of this case so i am not tempted to leave it behind when in a hurry
this sleeve is everything that i needed the inside is a nice , soft furry material and the color is vibrant , but not annoying to all those <unk> out there , the bag -lrb- when left opened -rrb- looks lumpy and uneven , but when you put your macbook actually in it , it looks fine
i had one for my # & # # ; macbook , so when i upgraded and <unk> , this was my first choice it adds cushioning for transport inside a backpack , offering some protection i have not had a hard shell case , and do n't anticipate acquiring one
i love the color of this sleeve ! my laptop is very smooth and i am so afraid of dropping it when moving it from place to place - this sleeve is not only pretty but practical
i was thoroughly <unk> to find that this did not git my # & # # ; macbook air . it slips around inside also smells super cheap - like when you buy cheap plastic knock <unk> there 's a particular odor associated with it left it out to see if the smell would go away but i 'm likely going to return this i did however test it on a # & # # ; macbook pro , and it fight better , though not as snug as i would 've liked again , <unk> , that this does not work for the air not even close
i searched for a cover for my # & # # ; macbook pro this product came up as one of the top rated the material is very flimsy and thin it would hardly protect my computer it is also much too big to fit the computer & # # ; it is a general # & # # ; size and not something specifically for the the macbook pro
i recently bought a new macbook pro my previous case was by & # # ; incase , & # # ; and it also was a neoprene , so i assumed this would be of similar quality this thing is a piece of junk i do n't feel as though my computer is even protected in my backpack super thin , poorly made do i expect a case to protect my macbook if i decide to toss it out the window of course not however , this cover is virtually useless will go back and buy the ` name brand ' case now , instead
this case does not fit the new # & # # ; macbook pros with retina display , it is extremely large for my laptop i do not recommend buying this product if you have the new macbook pro with retina returning this case was not a pleasant experience the topcase customer service was pushing my to k <unk> the case and when they finally said they would issue me a full refund , they did not
i bought the topcase in purple to replace my old laptop case i was hoping this would be thick enough to handle taking my laptop to class i have a # `` macbook and the sleeve is too big the sleeve is also too thin to provide any sort protection i 'm honestly too scared to travel with the case out of fear of something happening to my laptop if you are looking for something pretty this could be the deal for you if you are looking for a case that will protect your laptop , keep looking
the chemical , toxic smell makes this laptop sleeve not worth purchasing i left it outside for # days to remove the nasty smell and it still <unk> i will be ordering a different one
the case does not fit and its not quite what i expected it had dark brown spots in the back and it was wrinkled in the front i would like my money
<unk> this because i specifically wanted something for the macbook air and got something foe the # inch macbook s obviously it does not fit my macbook air very disappointed
first of all , when it came , the packaging left some permanent indents on the case also , it is way too thin the sewing job of the trim at the top flap was terrible , and the case had this yucky chemical smell never getting something like this again i just threw it into my amazon drawer where it was never seen again
i bought this case and was expecting something that would hold my computer comfortably , but instead i got a case that feel apart within a week and my laptop was constantly sliding all over the place i would not recommend buying this product
literally the case is giving me a headache it might just be the one i received , but it smells awful other than the smell , it is a nice color
my mac fits into this sleeve perfectly but i realize it is n't what i really wanted i need something with some kind of handle to carry it with this i have to put my laptop in it and then put it into another case i find this to be an extra unnecessary step
the reviews about the horrible chemical odor are true , and i should 've listened to them the scent is truly nasty , even from across the room it smells like petroleum , an odor that does not fade away with time do yourself a favor and look elsewhere , even if you have to pay a little bit more yes , the colors look fun , but they 're not worth the <unk> headache you will suffer from the odor as a secondary observation , the sleeve in person looks cheap to my eye i bought the orange , and you can sort of see the black neoprene underlying the orange color , so the color is not as vivid or as pure as one might expect
i purchased the sleeve for my macbook air # & # # ; laptop and the sleeve is very loose , which is not safe for my laptop also , it has an unpleasant rubbery smell that leaves a stench on my computer and other soft surfaces i set the sleeve on
this cover smelled very bad like oil or gas can not get the smell out it 's too bad as i waited for some time for delivery , and now i ca n't even use it
