this bag was great , until i was <unk> and hit a branch on the road i <unk> off my <unk> and <unk> across the pavement this bag ripped and flung my # & # # ; macbook pro onto the road
i was pretty satisfied with the product for the first # months after that the strap broke i used some duct tape for repairs , but then a few weeks later one of the zippers broke it was downhill from there it stil gets # stars because it 's pretty cheap , and i guess you get what you pay for
three months after bringing it around everyday with an acer # & # # ; laptop and other stuff it started to give way first the little strap thingy went after i lifted the bag with it about # times i had to cut off the rest of it after that the straps started to fray , one after the other i almost <unk> when i saw this because i really love the bag , plus i was the only one around with one like it -lrb- <unk> , was -rrb- now i 'm considering buying another on but nothing in the v # brand i must <unk> the makers though because they turned me into a part time tailor i was all over the bag with my needle and thread and that is why i have it up to this day it 's a year now and i 'm gon na advise someone to choose another bag i 'm not bashing the makers of the bag but i 'm just saying that if you need something for heavy-duty , <unk> , <unk> carrying ... . . buy another bag , not this one
i bought this for easy carrying of my new work laptop the handle on top has come off on one side , which i find weird i only use the handle to pick up so i can put it on i do n't carry the bag by the handle
it 's a pretty standard case , but padding is a little weak and it feels cheapy but the price is about what one would expect honestly , i recommend finding a cheaper bag at a <unk> store as you do n't get much protection or quality at this price point anyway still i use this case
this is a very good backpack except for one thing ... the top handle broke that 's the strap you would use to hang the backpack onto a coat hook it broke after about two weeks and i never overstuff the backpack to make it heavy other than that , it 's a really good backpack i just have to set it on the floor or a table since the top handle broke but the rest of the backpack is in great shape
the bag is nice looking , lots of room , plenty of nice pockets for your stuff however , the carry handle on top lasted about # weeks before one side ripped out not a bad bag , but you get what you pay for
this case is just what i was looking for it is light weight and fits my # inch dell <unk> laptop i had wished that it had a little more padding but it will work we me about to start college this will defiantly help me transport my laptop comfortably and securely
the first time i received this case , i was disappointed to find that it did not fit my hp g # laptop with it 's # `` widescreen monitor then i found out that they sent me the wrong one , one made for a # `` monitor amazon was great , as usual , and replaced it with the correct size , and it works perfectly adequate pockets inside for the things one would usually travel with , and enough padding to serve it 's purpose of protecting the laptop all in all , this is a nice case for the money
i already had a backpack so i wanted to get something a little smaller and mobile that i can take with me to work i thought this would be a great choice and i was n't mistaken this messenger bag has several pockets for pens , id , <unk> , and whatever you can fit in it the front closes with velcro on the inside it has two zippered pockets , one of which holds the laptop and has another extra storage space inside it also has the added bonus of have a drink holder on the outside on both sides which is somewhat small but useful nonetheless this is a social
this low cost laptop case was a good buy at the price it works , it holds my laptop , charger , and a few accessories it will not hold a great deal of other things , if you need more storage , spend more money
i 've never been a fan of messenger bags , so i 've been looking for a bag that i can wear as a normal backpack while not looking like a high school student the inside is super sleek and can hold all of my stuff with ease the zippers are nice and solid , and will not break easily overall , a really great bag that i wholeheartedly reccomend this is a social writeup
good case for the price gave it to my husband as a gift large laptop cases are hard to find at this price he keeps the laptop at home so i do not know how well it travels or how long it will last , but it fits his needs
this laptop bag looks sleek , functions great and is comfortable to carry and has out side zipper for quick access love the velcro inside both pockets zipper which i love two mesh side pockets for water bottles has a handle and an adjustable strap which is great for me since i am a petite woman this bag - unlike most bags does not feel too big or cumbersome and there are not a lot of useless pockets all over this bag is sleek , smart and a great laptop case this is a social writeup
i think it seems great so far does n't look like plastic was used for the strap attachment and the material seems thick enough for my laptop protection i have only had about a week and it fits my # `` laptop like a glove and has a velcro strap to hold it in place the front pocket can fit a few flat things in it and disks and a notebook i really like it and the price seems to be really a good deal for the quality of the bag edit few months after having it * has not broke but occassionally it will just unsnap and the bag hit the floor twice now could be my error but something to watch out for either way as a <unk> computer is in it
i was surprised with this case when i received it for such a low price i expected it to be very thin and cheaply made it is made of high quality neoprene and fabric , and seems like it would protect my laptop really good there is one downfall that i noticed the only place that is lined with neoprene is the top and bottom of the case the area around the sides that connects the bottom to the top of the sleeve is not lined with neoprene i would be worried about any protection if a laptop was dropped on its ' corner or side , but it should protect the top very well
... but it 's all you really need it offers enough protection to feel confident that your laptop is protected by bumps and offers enough space for additional things that it 's not a hassle to carry around your accessories i got this primarily for it 's cost : <unk> ratio -lrb- if that 's a thing -rrb- and i 'm pleased
i actually love the sleeve as far as quality and design goes the extra zipper pocket is fabulous the only reason i knocked a star off was because i think it 's a little to thick for <unk> for a sleeve it fits more in the case category i think i have an <unk> hp envy so i have ample space for it to play around in the sleeve , but i would prefer a snug fit of course , that 's just personal preference other than that the sleeve is great and seems like it will last a lifetime
seems like a solid case but , for my # `` lenovo ideapad the fit it way too tight width-wise -lrb- it 's actually hard to get the case to zip-up -rrb- <unk> -lrb- <unk> -rrb- the fit is just right the case is also too tall -lrb- <unk> -rrb- , leaving too much extra room in that dimension i 'll probably be returning it and waiting for something made explicitly for the ideapad
i recently purchased a new asus notebook , so this was a must it works well carrying my pc and all the manuals and cords etc . it has many velcro sealed pockets and even looks fashionable it fits the # . # `` asus i have perfectly , and would recommend this for anybody on a budget
a real no nonsense quality back pack ideal for the professional on the go who carry and protect their notebook if you have a # `` or a # `` macbookpro this pack offers everything you need the stitching is strong , materials feel durable and the exterior is simple and clean as i said a real no nonsense type of backpack i really like that the secondary pocket hold your keys on a clip and has an opening for headphones to pass through for a music player in the pocket with the listed price , most ideal for those with a budget too this is as social
this laptop bag is very light and durable it has many compartments for files or charts there is even a compartment for business cards , id 's or your credit cards it has an elastic strap to keep the laptop in place this is a social
this case fits my laptop perfectly , with some padding to help protect the laptop has closing compartments that is very important , i do not have to worry about small things getting lost
this bag 's design is geared towards large <unk> and <unk> <unk> , where durability and wear over time are primary concerns as such , the construction of the bag is heavy-duty with an eye for durability one could expect a lengthy usage from the bag , as it can withstand a lot of travel abuse over time and still look good
i bought this backpack a few weeks ago and absolutely love it i have a # . # inch acer laptop and it fits perfectly i do wish there was a little more space to put my folder in there without it fitting really tight but i would rather carry the folder than the laptop so it works for me ! !
i got this bag and when i opened it up i found that it was exactly what i expected the bag does n't have the heavy load capacity i hoped for , but `` hey , it was # bucks ! s i am satisfied with what i
good price for what i get it 's a great case with a good number of pockets it could be a bit more cushioned but my laptop has n't had any issues yet so i guess it does what it 's supposed to do overall not bad
this is a great lightweight case for the money for everyday use for my # & # # ; laptop not a great deal of extra space but i was aware of that before i purchased it access is easy and is perfect for my use i would recommend this product
if you 're just looking for an affordable case to carry around your laptop , this is a nice case for the price , but i still intend to be pretty careful when carrying my laptop around with it there 's only a thin layer of padding all around the case is flexible , and just barely fits my asus n # s -lrb- # . # x # . # x # . # inches -rrb- i 've added a couple pictures if you want to see what i mean there are a few flaws in the zipper , where the zipper sometimes gets caught on some loose threads , so it 's not a perfect case , but it will definitely work for me
we bought this as part of my daughters <unk> gift we are giving her the laptop & wanted to make sure that she will have a way to carry it around campus -lrb- when she goes on to college -rrb- since we have n't given it to her yet i ca n't give a higher rating as far as i can tell , it is a nice case and will be perfect
i receive this bag & it fits my hp g # <unk> # us # . # `` laptop perfectly i am very happy with the bag & the price future will tell on the rest ; however , it will do the job i want it for it is not all that frilly , but is functional and well laid out if you are looking for a no nonsense computer bag that fits the # . # `` computers , this is it if you are looking for name brand , power window and something that will survive and protect your computer from a fall out of a second story window although , if you want protection from that fall , i would put myself before the computer anytime but then that 's just me
i <unk> my laptop case to my brother who lost his in a <unk> this is an okay replacement , but not as good as the one i had before which was sturdier i do n't like the way things spill out of the upper lid when you open the case , maybe it should be zipped
this is not a high-end bag , but that 's not what i was willing to pay for , anyway it stores my laptop securely with enough padding that i do n't worry too much the pockets have enough room for cords and a wireless mouse works very well for the price i paid
there is really nothing to special about the bag but it is exactly what i ordered and its durable the bag has slots for pens , mouses , cords , chargers anything i fit my mac book and my ipad in there with plenty of room left i <unk> it to anyone
this is a nice backpack for carrying up to # & # # ; laptop laptop area is padded and one can also carry a tablet in that area which has a separation sleeve for that adequate space and zippered areas for cords , chargers etc . back pack is made well
our macbook air fits perfectly in this case and is . held securely it is well padded . my only complaint is that the front pocket is a little tight to hold the charger , but it 's fine
other reviews have pretty much covered this so i 'll make it brief usual amazon fast shipping ordered on monday arrived on friday fits my # . # `` laptop perfectly enough space to carry the power supply , mouse , couple of cd 's and a folder of misc . papers construction quality excellent perfect for light travel use looks better than the picture excellent buy for any price amazon 's price makes it a no brainer
i like the case it is small but it has lots of storage in it after the laptop is in plenty of room for the cord and charger i even have room for the camera charger , i think if you are looking for a in expensive small case to carry a # `` to # & # # ; laptop this is the one to get
arrived quickly than expected and the bag looks good i 've been using it for a few weeks now and no complain about it the only problem is that i <unk> the size and bought # the # in model should have been good enough for my laptop
<unk> bag to carry your laptop <unk> along with your other belongings ... light weight and great support for your bag if things get heavy . . i recommend this product to students who walk miles on campus . great quality and looks like it would last a lifetime !
i needed to get a case for one of our <unk> 's new macbook air but could n't spend a bunch of money on it , so looked around quite a bit , reading reviews and comparing features and quality i was hesitant about the quality with the price of this one so low but took a <unk> on it and it turned out to be a great bargain yeah , it 's not a victorinox laptop bag , but it 's a good one and serves the purpose well
i would never have been able to find a case like this to fit my gateway laptop had i tried shopping around town the price is excellent as is the quality very nicely made for the price point , well padded with plenty of storage for power cord and other items my laptop is heavy but this case makes carrying it so easy can either carry it like a briefcase or wear it like a messenger bag either way , the case is not bulky or awkward exactly as shown in the picture the case arrived exactly as scheduled by amazon as usual so zero complaints there these days , i have given up wasting gas and time shopping for items around town that i usually end up not being able to find anyway can not beat the price of this laptop case if you are looking for a functional and professional looking item
after trying shoulder bag after shoulder bag to carry around my laptop , i 've <unk> so tired of the straps getting tangled , the weight all sitting on one shoulder , and bag just not working for me then i tried this laptop backback , and i know i 'm never going back with easy access , plenty of padded storage space , and the knowledge i have everything i need on two shoulders , this is the bag for a guy like me who is constantly on the go this is a social writeup
its a great price , nothing fancy no leather obviously but has everything you need to transport your # inch laptop and has a a zippered front pocket to put cords , cables mice etc . also has a <unk> slot in the back to put papers and other things all in all a great case for a great price
this case is well constructed and has plenty of room for cords , papers , mouse , etc . i feel it is a good value for the money i 'm really happy i chose this case
this is a good , solid bag if anything , i wish it was a tad smaller , but i wo n't complain zippers work well , without snagging i have n't yet tried the shoulder strap
had my doubts about ordering this case since it was inexpensive turned out it 's a great case , especially the front pouch which has pockets and plenty of room for power supply , mouse , mouse pad , and any extra items like a camera you may want to tote a # inch toshiba laptop fits just right inside the case , not tight , not loose
i have to say i was a little skeptical at first but this bag has proven to be a great value and a well built product i bought one for my wife and i and both bags are very durable and have held up very well as other reviews have said there is n't much cushioning in the inside if you drop this bag with your laptop in it , it 's possible to damage the laptop however , if you are a careful person this bag is most definitely worth it buy it you wo n't be disappointed ! ! ca n't beat the price
i was looking for a cheap laptop bag with a strap and found this for # i immediately ordered it because the price was great fairly enough space inside and seems to be of long-lasting quality . there is n't a lot of cushion to it , which i was looking for because i already have padding for my laptop if you 're looking for something with plenty of cushion then i would n't recommend this for you , if not then its a definite buy
after # years of using this backpack every single day , it got pretty messed up -lrb- threads started coming loose on the bottom , bottle holder elastics falling apart , and one of the zipper handles came off -rrb- i carry a lot of weight in it , macbook pro , charger , a book or two , and so on i only paid around $ # shipped on amazon back then so did n't really expect much from the backpack while looking on the manufacturers website , i realized it said & # # ; lifetime warranty . & # # ; i contacted v # and i received a new backpack in the mail several weeks later not very many companies honor their lifetime <unk> , or if they do , there is all sorts of red tape involved which usually requires paying for the shipping out of pocket and sending the old item back v # did n't do any of that crap and sent me the new backpack hassle free and at no cost to me i wish more companies were like this one
i bought this backpack for college and it goes great with my asus laptop it 's greatly made and has a sleek design i love it it 's just the perfect size for a # in laptop very simple and clean , yet so slick
love this backpack spacious and perfect size to carry around everyday while carrying my backpack a round everyday in other bags i would end up with backaches , but this bag provides lots of support and i have no backaches ever ! i highly recommend it
this bag has been durable and convenient to use for the few months i 've owned it fits many items , laptop , power cord , usb mouse , headphones fits two water bottles nicely , and the parts have n't worn out yet mostly weather proof - and i live in <unk> buffalo , ny highly <unk> <unk> bag
works great but unfortunately is too small for my bf 's new computer i had also gotten the # inch so now i have # spares . guess i will hang on to them in the unlikely -lrb- hopefully -rrb- event that it frays
this case was a christmas present to my husband , he recived it very quick and was in perfect condition , him is very happy with this present <unk> you very much
i use this backpack more than my briefcase laptop bag its just easier to lug around the airport i like that it has # zippered slots but is still really thin it fits under the seat on the plane as well the price is is just right too
this laptop case was exactly as described it had enough space not only for my laptop but for other items such as my laptop electrical cord , pens , markers , small books ect i am very pleased with it i used ot for travelling overseas and had no problems
i gave it a # manly because of the price it was insanely cheap , i was only getting it till i saved up enough to get a proper laptop bag i expected this to break after a month or so based off everyone 's reviews but to my surprise it 's still going strong i use it daily with # laptops a # . # & # # ; and a # & # # ; and sometimes also a # . # & # # ; the bag even & # # ; full & # # ; is pretty slim if you 're looking for a bag that will work even just for a little bit this is a good inexpensive option
this case does everything it should it has enough room in the main compartment for my # . # inch laptop in the other compartments i am able to fit my charging cord , mouse , and mouse pad and still have plenty of room i have never dropped the case with my laptop in it so i do not know how well it protects whats inside , but i do n't think that 's what it was made for in the first place <unk> does what it should and still works even after the nearly # years i 've been using it
even though it is n't a top of the line , best brand product , it is still amazing it does exactly what the other ones do , but this one also comes with a lifetime warranty who can say no to that
<unk> bag , fits my # `` notebook perfectly i love the zippers and think they are great for all my other small devices perfect light weight best for the price , also very nice
i got this for my boyfriend 's birthday in april # , and he loves it it 's exactly as pictured we both have the # `` macbook pro 's & it fits perfectly and securely there is a pocket in the back that is big enough to hold charging cables , but it does not close the inside is well padded with a strap to secure the laptop down highly recommend to anyone looking for a very simple carrying case for their laptop / notebook that 's # `` or less
this is a well made bag it holds my # . # laptop along with an <unk> laptop cooler the zipper pocked holds the mouse , charger , cables and other misc i have no complaints and i recommend this bag
great light case has lots of room for other things such as a charger in the back and pens and pencils in the front pocket i also put a school book in side the case and it all fits great the shoulder strap is nicely padded as well
i 've owned a few different laptop cases in my day from backpacks to <unk> , they all have their <unk> and weaknesses , but i find this product to be quite <unk> it is made of what feels like a very sturdy material , there is nothing flimsy about it all the velcro strips are secure , the strap is a thick material that will not rip easily there are several extra pockets all over to make it your all-in-one laptop bag the padding on the inside is sufficient to protect your laptop from the average dent and bump , but probably would do little if you dropped it that however , is not really the purpose of this bag it 's convenient , practical and all around good quality
got a large laptop and a bike works great . # inch with room for a cooling pad ? ! ? yes and more room for other stuff like battery and accessories definitely a great buy
this product is great for the student to go the flap is a good way of keeping the laptop safe from damage and makes it easily to access my laptop quickly i also like the extra pockets it has for my mouse and other equipment i carry around it makes it easy for me to carry around anything else i need i also like how it has a space for my water bottle and i like how the zippers are big and smooth to scroll this is a social
first of all , the bag came shipped in great packaging , and it came fast the laptop fits perfectly in the bag -lrb- make sure you measure your screen first before you buy any bag ! -rrb- and i love all the extra room for <unk> , pencil/pen holder and pockets in the front the bag features a strap to hold the laptop in place which i really like , and it does a great job limiting the movement of the laptop while moving around the shoulder strap is very thick and has been very durable i was going to buy the backpack style but my husband convinced me to buy the messenger style i think i like it better the style is sophisticated yet simple i think it 's a perfect item for anyone with a laptop , as it holds everything you need and more
i was seeking a new bag for my macbook pro # & # # ; and this bag fit the bill it makes a nice cozy home for my laptop and i am able to store other accessories i can even put my ipad in here too so it is a great bag for a student or the <unk> traveler seeing that i utilize it to transport my laptop to work , it has exceeded my expectations and will do the same for you
we now have three of these cases for our # -inch laptops two are # -inch toshiba satellite c # <unk> and the other is a # -inch acer we also have three <unk> # & # # ; widescreen laptop notebook sleeve soft cases for added protection when travelling as they are a bit on the roomy side , which is better than it being too snug though i only wish they had a compartment alongside the computer where you can store your power cable my first laptop in the # 's was like this i do n't like putting the power cable with its transformer in the top zipper pouch where , due to rough handling or something heavy falling on the case , it might accidentally damage the screen but , all of the cases seem to be manufactured this way now as you can tell from my owning three of these cases , i like it and its price
i do n't carry my larger # . # & # # ; laptop around but once in a while i need to it fits well in this case this is not a heavy duty case but it does have some protection it did exactly what i needed it to do
purchased a few months ago and still looks and feels brand new if you want a laptop case that does n't cost an arm and leg and will last you a long time ... this is the one for you
i had to use this backpack to carry my laptop around downtown when i was working in the city it held my # & # # ; pavilion easily and never felt uncomfortable or like it was going to break or rip it is very durable , light , and the straps are comfortable too if you walk around a lot you might even forget you have it on it also has a ton of storage options for the little things you carry around cell phone , keys , pens , flash drives , etc . well worth the money
i have had many laptop bags , none that are functional and practical than this one it has different compartments for practical use light weight and very comfortable to carry i have not seen a better bag out there i would highly recommend this bag to anyone that has to carry a laptop very good value ! stylish and functional a very good buy two big thumbs up ! ! !
i am so pleased with this bag padding is just adequate and its design is great , looks really expensive it has alot of room to put adaptors , mouse , cds and anything else you can think of it fits my # . # great i really love this bag
this laptop backpack works great for me i mainly use it to shuttle my laptop and books around campus it pretty much meets all the demands i have for it , but the mesh pockets could be improved on at under $ # this backpack is a steal another great thing about this bag is that its not marked up with <unk> brand labeling , which many other bags have been abusing for a while now overall , the construction is solid and i would highly recommend this to the average person looking to use this for their basic needs this is a social
quality materials , excellent protection for my laptop , front pocket has plenty of space for essentials . back sleeve pocket is big and useful awesome price and arrived in good time . highly reccomended
great looking bag seems to be well-made and of sturdy construction handle is much more comfortable and `` balanced `` -lrb- when you carry by handle , the bag actually hangs straight -rrb- than my last laptop case would recommend to anyone
very practical bag as a graduate student this bag is very practical since i am able to fit my # inch laptop as well as other papers and my organizer the front section of the bag has space for pens , pencils , my cell phone etc . i like the overall color contrast - black exterior and light book color along with the durable handles it also has the option of being turned into a messenger type bag this is a social writeup
the # inch case was perfect for my # . # laptop i was even able to fit my mouse and charger in it -lrb- as well as other small things -rrb- the shipping was also great -lrb- and on time . -rrb- the handle and strap are very durable and comfortable to hold i would recommend this to anyone looking for a laptop case
i have this laptop case and i take it with me everywhere i work full-time and i take it to work and i also use it for school it has different storage areas to organize myself and not just throw everthing inside the material is also easy to wipe down and my laptop fits with a lot more space available by social writeup
i carry my computer around in this bag everywhere i go it 's got thick padding , nice stitching , and boasts a very attractive design it also a lot of compartments to place all of my work-related items cds , dvds , pens , notebook , etc . it holds up well even when i overstuff it this is a social writeup
i had a regular old case that my work provided for my laptop ... suffice to say , i should have bought this backpack # year ago light , good padding , can fit what i need ... great product
i got one it works very well better than adequate padding ensures protection for my computer and gear more than enough pocket space for all my <unk> and cords the material is great for people on the go -lrb- feels strong , <unk> -rrb- , and the bag itself looks very classic -lrb- the all black makes me feel important when i 'm on the go i would recommend this product to my friends , family , <unk> , and anyone who is in the market for a laptop bag this is a social
i use this backpack for all my college classes it has several different sections the first section has a protected area for a computer , and then other large spaces for folders , notebooks , etc . it also has a spot to hold my iphone , and has an opening that i can run my headphones out of to make calls or listen to music also , plenty of spots for my pencils and pens mesh pockets for my random cords and stuff all around a great product
looks just as pictured a little more plush than i imagined really fits tablet and dock or small notebook , so bigger than i <unk> cool for women ... maybe not so much for guys i regret getting it
it does the job of protecting my tablet -lrb- asus <unk> -rrb- and keyboard , but it is a bit chunkier than pictured the color is cute so i 'm okay with it and returning it would probably cost more than just keeping it
fits ipad # in a folio case with room to spare this case also has a lot of padding for protection there are no pockets or sleeves , no mesh screen divider , just a simple padded case designed to protect your netbook/tablet i own a blue and an orange one and they are great
i purchased this for my surface pro , knowing that it was bigger than what i needed the surface pro fits in it perfectly though there 's a bit of extra space where i 've actually stuffed the power supply when i needed to travel seems to be built with quality , and feels like adequate protection against accidental drops the inner lining is soft , and the friction between that and the outer felt on the keyboard cover keeps the surface snugly in place the profile is definitely bigger than a neoprene sleve , so if you 're looking for something small , this may not be the case for you
it is the perfect size for the surface rt . it is not tight at all , so you can take your surface in and out with ease even with the board attached it provides good padding you still do n't want to drop it , of course it works fine if you want something simple -lrb- without tons of extra pockets -rrb- to protect your surface -lrb- with or without the board attached -rrb- this is a good option this green color is fine , by the way
i actually purchased two cases for our new surface one is a hard cover and the second was this targus bag happy to say that the hard cover case fits -lrb- although snuggly -rrb- into this bag so we have added protection the bag looks great and is obviously well made the only drawback is that you do n't have room to store the charger with the device , but that was n't a big issue for us i 'm very happy with this purchase
i got this for my asus t # , which fits with room to spare : this sleeve is more <unk> for a # : # screen rather than the widescreen t # the padding is great , pretty thick without being clunky there is also padding around the edges including the zipper which is nice , some other sleeves i 've tried have ignored the edges which are a very likely impact spot i got this to put in my bike <unk> as my full laptop case -lrb- which i originally got for a # & # # ; laptop -rrb- is far too big for that have n't noticed any problems with the vibration of the road
the sleeve is thick and soft enough to protect the tablet i use it with my microsoft surface and it fits well and easy to grab in hands it also works well with the touch cover
i purchase this case for my moko -lrb- tm -rrb- folio cover case with <unk> stand for my samsung galaxy tab # . # and its the perfect fit and very secure i will highly recommend this for samsung galaxy tab # . # and samsung galaxy tab #
i purchased this bag in august # it was perfect for bringing my laptop on trips , working at conferences , and toting my -lrb- non-laptop -rrb- stuff back and forth to work each day i used it daily , but less than six months later , two features are broken first -lrb- and not too importantly -rrb- , the rubber tab on the handle is broken off - not a huge deal , but i did hook my car keys to it at work so i would n't lose them second -lrb- and a bigger deal -rrb- is that the drawstring that functions to keep things from spilling out of the top of the bag itself -lrb- under the front flap -rrb- came <unk> in the channel i ca n't seem to get the line fed back into the channel as long as i bring home very little from work each night -lrb- ha ! -rrb- , it works fine however , load up with a bit more stuff , or try to transport anything that 's not flat in it , and it comes spilling out in my front seat i 'll be purchasing a different messenger bag now
this bag is very functional the laptop fits well inside and the padding provides good protection there are useful pockets for the cord and other accessories my main complaint is that it looks much better in the picture than in reality i particularly do not like the wording across the front which is not visible in the picture
the bag looks nice but feels cheap it does hold the computer nicely and has pockets for other stuff but if i had known before i bought it that it was plastic that does n't feel very nice i would have looked for something else it is pretty though
it 's a fantastic bag because it has a lot of pockets and its great for school the only downside is that the bag is bulky an there is a small amount of space inside it carries a lot of extra padding
i bought the bag for my # `` laptop and found the bag a bit too big for my use there are many pockets for cords and chargers and books but i did n't need that much space the interior is well padded for protection and the outside looks like it will stand up to wear if you are looking for a bag to carry lots of stuff - this is the one for you it 's perfect for school or work and is quite feminine
this bag was even better constructed than i thought it would be for the price the only downside is that the larger outer pocket is divided into three sections so it was n't as usable as i had hoped overall i ca n't seem to find any real faults with it and that is saying a lot since i have # young children who have tried to ruin this bag already lol
