i bought this more to protect from scratches and because of the handle to carry it with the handle is already starting to fray from the velcro , but all in all , not a bad buy it gives enough to also include my power cord and mouse it will not protect from falls or crushing accidents
the case is of good quality and has inside straps to secure the netbook from sliding around or for using within the case the case came in a huge box with a wasted use of large bubble wrap the case could have been <unk> shipped in a padded or cardboard envelope the value in price compared to retail is about # to # more colors , like blue would have been great if offered , but black was all that was offered overall the product is what was expected and is of quality materials with a good zipper which is coated it looked larger than what i imagined , but due to the padding , is correct in <unk> to the computer and is still a lot smaller than a full size computer bag
i purchased one of these bags about four years ago and loved it so decided to buy another even thought the quality of the bag is reasonable it is obviously being manufactured by a different distributor using <unk> quality materials and not as happy as i was with my original bag
this bag is nicely made and the smart strap is wonderful the only drawback -lrb- the reason i did n't give it a # star rating -rrb- is that my # `` laptop `` just `` fits
i was sold on the retractable strap and the check free compartment where you do n't have to remove the laptop from the case to go thru security at airports worked well today on trip it is also larger than a pc case , without being large and bulky this is good case at great price
fits so snugly , lining is very thick to protect your precious macbook pro , accessory pocket fits a usb wireless modem , external hdd , macbook power adapter and cord , earphones very portable , material and construction are very robust , and chic
i love this case . . it 's not too big , not too small it has a pocket for my charger , and it sits up vertically so i do n't have to take my computer out of my book bag to get it out the only thing is my # . # `` mbp fits in there pretty tightly i do n't think it would fit with a hardcase , but other than that this is a great case , and i do n't have to worry that my macbook pro is n't protected
i just recently bought a # inch unibody macbook pro i looked and debated for weeks on the perfect case to protect it and yet stylishly accessorize the mp i settled on brenthaven because it was recommended by macpro users as a very secure , top of the line case i 'm not disappointed it fits my # inch pro like a dream it 's so snug that it 's even hard to get out the selling point of the case for me was that it comes with a built-in external pouch for a magazine , the power cord , and a <unk> phone all the other cases i looked at had nowhere to put the accessories i knew i would bring with me on a trip another plus is that it comes with handles and grips for a carrying strap which can be bought separately i 'm very happy with my purchase
fits my # . # inch net-book perfectly , but the colors are a lot brighter than they seem in the picture works really well to protect my net-book while its inside of my backpack
i like this brand , and i have another one for my own ipad that fits perfectly unfortunately , this one is a little too roomy for an ipad it 's cute and made well , though
i love this it fits my pink # . # `` acer aspire one with or without the # -cell battery it 's only a sleeve , so it 's great for when you do n't <unk> to lug an extra bag to accommodate all your accessories the foamy material gives excellent protection , and the # <unk> zipper is good and sturdy surprisingly , it fits perfectly in my dakine <unk> backpack , giving my shoulder a break from <unk> carriers i 've bought a <unk> bags and sleeves for this netbook , but this is easily my favorite and do n't get me going about how adorable the design is
use this with asus # -inch netbook has a couple of inches of space after netbook is in bag i can fold it over or add the power cord or usb keys soft , two zippers at top enough protection to keep dirt out and protect it from scratches did n't want a hard or bulky case that was too big small was the reason for getting a netbook so a small sleeve works well
this is definitely a comfortable backpack that can store everything you need for college but if you intend to use it for college be warned that it is not safe from rain i do n't understand why they would make a backpack that 's made to hold your $ # - $ # investment and not protect it from one of the few things that could ruin it if it rains lightly while your trying to get to your next class on <unk> it will leak through the zipper and most likely damage your laptop this is a deal breaker for me it does hold the laptop well and protects it with cushioning it can hold a good amount of notebooks and books the front pocket has a few compartments for random things the straps are comfortable even with a heavy load but if they made a better effort to reinforce and protect the laptop compartment from rain damage id give it a few more stars
i just wanted to add to anyone thinking of getting this backpack that it is great i have gotten the green one and it actually holds my # `` laptop it takes a little adjustment but it works lots of pockets to keep things that you might use from time to time and lots of space con : there is only one thing that is bad about this backpack if you insist on putting # lbs of stuff into it the straps seem to want to tear i understand that this backpack probably is n't meant to hold that kind of weight but that is how i use it
i am quite happy with this item i have had it for two months now , it is well built and sturdy the straps are comfortable even when you have your laptop in the bag great item , good price quick delivery
has plenty of room and i like how the pockets are set up one large one with plenty of room for my laptop plus extra , and two good sized smaller sections it 's great quality , which you will pay for , but it 's worth every penny
<unk> about the # . # x # . # x # . # inches spec . # . # inches is unbelievable thin however the picture looks ok , so i still bought it the bag turned out to be quite thick and has plenty of room even with a laptop the # . # inches spec may be a error colors are not so good red and dark blue together looks dirty but anyway you do n't use the color to carry books in a word , great backpack
this product came so quickly i 'm impressed with the service also the product itself is great , has plenty of pockets and storage for things other then books i have a # in laptop and it fits perfectly
i bought this for my husband for christmas and he really likes it he wanted a comfortable , durable backpack to carry his laptop in to work everyday , and this fits the bill it 's well made with several pockets and compartments , and really protects his computer the design and cobalt color gives this backpack a grown-up look , so it does n't look like you 're borrowing your kid 's book bag it was much more affordable on amazon than at our local office supply stores , and the vendor i bought it from was excellent
i purchased this laptop bag about # months ago unfortunately , the zippers have already worn out and the bag has started to fray i am now looking for a laptop bag from a different manufacturer
my asus laptop is a tight squeeze , but i am using the case the outside flap is awfully tight i can not use the padded part for the computer ... it wo n't zip ... too tight
my only issue is that the security area is very very very snug for my # & # # ; dell studio laptop i kept it as the price was so good and the laptop fits well in the & # # ; regular & # # ; area i do not travel that much and did not have any storage case for this laptop if i traveled a lot , i <unk> would have had to return the case
this case is stylish and functional i like the pockets on both sides and the way it protects my laptop it `` carries `` easily and fits well under an airplane seat several years of use has <unk> the exterior a bit , but it still looks pretty good
this is a great bag it is a tsa checkpoint friendly design so i do n't have to take my laptop out of the bag when passing through the tsa gates my only problem has been that after about # months of hard daily use the zipper on the document section has broken in looking around this is still one of the best designs for air travellers i have a # `` laptop so it drops in easily and has plenty of space
this is actually my second one of these messenger bags the first one i had for about two years , then it got ruined by somebody who had a little too much to drink -lrb- i wo n't go into more detail . i checked out lots of other messenger bags before buying this again , but ultimately decided it still seemed like the best option , especially for its value it fits my # & # # ; notebook perfect the bag is very durable and did not break , tear , or start to fall apart in any way after two years of constant use this bag can comfortably hold a surprising amount of things , and the top handle is quite useful the material is very strong and firm the lack of plastic buckles , found on many other bags , is a huge plus overall , this bag is very durable , stylish , has lots of good features , and i would n't recommend any other messenger bag over it for a # & # # ; notebook
i totally agree with the reviewer ` the closure that <unk> ' i had high hopes for this ` purse ' since i wanted one that would accommodate my kindlefire , this fit the bill except that the closure is so frustrating and annoying and it does bite i 'm afraid that the closure will be the death <unk> of this case i would like room for a ` holder ' for bottle water , but that was my bad for not noticing when buying the should strap ` shoulder pad ' is sewn down therefore when <unk> the strap , the padded part is not located at the shoulder , another bad design flaw now what to do with it since i 'll not be able to cope with the flaws
does not fit a surface rt pro # very well - the bag is well made but too snug , also wish i could take the strap off when not needed
i have a asus transformer and i really like the two compartments to store the keyboard separate , but i do n't like not having a zipper to close the two compartments the flap that snaps over is <unk> if using the handle , to be more secure you have to use the strap if the bag had a zipper on top with a carry handle on each side , it would be much better with tablet and keyboard , the weight causes it to sag if holding it by the handle otherwise , good storage and very well padded
i was looking for a carrying case for my ipad # and wireless keyboard and , i discovered this targus citygear netbook case this case fits my ipad and wireless keyboard perfectly it even has additional space and pockets for me to store my <unk> stash of ipad connections and accessories i compared this product extensively to the <unk> <unk> portfolio and , in my opinion , i made the right choice the targus case costs about half as much as the <unk> portfolio and has a shoulder strap -lrb- which the latter does not -rrb- after about a month of regular usage , i have n't noticed any issues -lrb- such as wear or a reduction in quality or functionality -rrb- it 's light , portable and comfortable i highly recommend this product
it fit easily with my acer # . # `` , also tied fit to acer # . # `` netbooks everything are good but the front buckle a little hard to use <unk> i like it good price from amazon
great little netbook case for my hp mini- # nr though rated for a # . # inch netbook , works fine with my # . # inch mini will also hold power brick and wireless mouse could be a little deeper but i 've got no complaints vendor was fine , too delivered product in reasonable time with no problems
this bag is the perfect size for my ipad plus it has room for my book -lrb- yes , i * do * still read paper books ! -rrb- , the charger for the ipad and <unk> . other papers sturdy and lightweight , it works really well my only complaint - is i find the snap buckle is really tight - making it hard for me to get it open at times now , with that said , i must <unk> that i have very weak hands - suffer from a little arthritis had i know how hard it was to open , i probably would have passed however , i do feel that my ipad is very safe and secure in this bag if anyone knows a way to loosen up the buckle
looking for a small messenger bag for my # & # # ; tablet and keyboard the bag is great for the tablet , keyboard -lrb- logitech k # -rrb- , phone , headset , ac cable , microfiber cloth . <unk> and a small notepad but not quite big enough for anything else would like it to be slightly larger so i could fit a lunch in it too for my work commute plenty of padding , but would also have been nice if they added swivels to the strap overall very pleased with the product
i bought this for my new hp touchpad -- it makes it easier to carry both the tablet and my kindle in the same pouch , along with chargers and other necessary extras , without getting too bulky the bag is a great size , has a nice professional look , and as i mentioned -- spacious , without being overbearing i only have one complaint , and i plan to remedy it myself : the shoulder strap is `` permanently `` attached there are no clips so that you can remove it i plan to break the plastic holding it in place and using carabiners or something similar so i can remove it when i please aside from this very minor complaint , excellent bag
targus is an absolutely wonderful computer accessory manufacturer especially with their laptop bags it is not much to say in this review , the product description tells it all i was surprised how much i could put into the bag , so make notice of this the bag is sturdy and protects both my netbook , dvd <unk> , portable hdd and different cds , dvds , chargers and cables i did not give it top marks on quality of materials , since -lrb- obviously -rrb- there is better quality materials out there but do not get me wrong , it looks great , and the materials is top notch for the price , and protecting the netbook the only thing i would have liked on this product , is a more comfortable handle , and a bigger cushion on the shoulder strap other than that , i am very pleased with this <unk> must buy for those who wants style and protection for a great price -lrb- i cut of the zipper handles and put on some of my own to personalize it , and it looks great !
as stated in previous reviews , this case is perfect for ipad # and accessories the apple wireless keyboard fits great in compartment # # it is rather stupid -lrb- yes , stupid -rrb- that the shoulder strap is not removable that would have added maybe # cents to their cost
i really like this bag because you can practically put anything in it ; i traveled with my kindle fire , headphones , keyboard , phone , camera and everything else i would need on the go it 's got plenty of compartments and space i recommend this bag to anyone
we have an acer iconia w # , and this thing holds the tablet , accompanying keyboard , a mouse , paper , pens , stylus , business cards , etc . you can shove all kinds of things in here with all the pockets it has it is very lightweight , but protects the tablet from scratches , etc . , and allows you to bring what you need with you
i picked up this bag quickly on my way to the airport i decided on this one because of the shoulder strap and felt that hands free was best being already loaded down with other stuff holds my earbuds , splitter , charging cable and block with plenty more room and storage i put my iphone in the outer zippered pocket and my ipad in the main compartment which fits snugly with a silicon jacket on by tucking the shoulder strap into the cover before snapping closed keeping it out of the way and not just dangling when i prefer to use the handle it 's called citygear and i live in the city which made sense to me , i was hoping for a new messenger bag anyway with this bag i am comfortable traveling around chicago with my ipad in tow recommended this to my aunt already got one for her travel needs
all my expectations were met with this product i got a little netbook a while back and carried it around in a <unk> for the longest time it is a neat bag that has lots of compartments and is great for business trips
very good quality , lots of storage inside , front pouch does n't allow for much but it 's well organized my tablet feels very safe and secure and looks great in this rugged carry bag at work or at play
i think this bag is perfect for my needs my galaxy note # edition fits perfectly inside and it also fits with the keyboard case on as well plenty of space for other items as well
i bought this for my dell mini # -lrb- # . # `` -rrb- did n't want to buy a netbook sleeve , because i wanted a place to store an external mouse , the ac adapter , and maybe # small data cables for various purposes this fits them all perfectly without it becoming overly bulky i bought the netbook because of its compact size - i needed a case equally compact the quality seems to be pretty good , as well as the value for the price i read a review on another retailer 's website it was the `` best `` for the `` buy `` -lrb- nudge nudge , <unk> <unk> -rrb- the person really liked it , but thought it was a bit pricey that 's because their `` best `` price was $ # more than amazon 's
basically , i was looking for an attractive netbook case this one was by far the most attractive , stylish and functional in fact , when i am not toting around my netbook , i use it as a carry case for all my electronics , like my iphone , <unk> headset and charger and nikon s # and charger i also have room for my checkbook and some other stuff a wonderful , rugged yet elegant case has many uses and particularly as a carry all for all your electronics - with all it 's dividers and pockets - it ca n't be beat
i have this bag for a little more than a year and decide to write a review this bag is small enough to use everyday without feeling that you carry too much this bag is real good just to carry your daily tech stuff to work or school it fits my # inch hp touchpad perfectly in the big slot there is the smaller slot that can fit a smaller tablet or book if needed -lrb- i folded a <unk> shopping bag in there just in case i need to carry more things back from work the outer compartment fits a usb charger , external battery , usb headset , some cable , pens , keys and still have room for junk i had fitted a # oz m & m ; there and it closes fine * i just wish this bag has like a slot to hold an umbrella or a bottle but i have add some clips that will hold it fine
i needed a nice padded carry case for my new ipad needs -- # not too large , # good padding , # this case covers these needs plus has space to add a few items -- charger + cord , cleaning cloth , ear buds , stylus , etc . . good shoulder and hand strap really nice padding for protection easily fits the ipad and netbooks good price and # days delivery using prime
i almost bought a different brand my wife mentioned this one i checked multiple reviews on many different makers of ipad carry cases i took the chance on this one it 's logically designed and has quality construction costs a tad more ; however , you get what you pay for
i use this bag to hold my acer aspire one # inch net book and it works great the main compartment has plenty of room for the average size net book , however , anything over # . # inches is going to be a little tight the main compartment also has a soft sleeve meant for an ipad , but it will work for pretty much any tablet or a kindle the bag has enough room in the front pocket to hold the power supply , as well as a few other small odds and ends the bag is small , which makes it great for carrying around for a while it is made very well , and seems lick it will last for a while i am in it and i find this bag very useful i can take a netbook , driver disks , extra usb drives , and a few small tech manuals , as well as a kindle with reference materials : -rrb- overall great bag for the price
fits quite a bit in a small area i carry a microsoft surface pro # and my ipad -lrb- gen # -rrb- in it and there is an internal pocket for each one holds the chargers for both , stylus ' for both , earphones and a few other necessities easy to access when needed and travels well
great netbook bag , small with enough storage for your power cord , cell , # writing instruments and some other small items i love it padded interior , and a space for a notebook or e reader
the perfect case for my itouch and ipad it is everything i was looking for to keep my investment save and all in one place i highly recommend this product
had looked at the same bag in a major big box electronics store it was half the price and delivery was in # days you save money and receive the exact same product in a timely fashion ... life is good
i was looking for a smaller bag to carry my ipad and few other items , and this bag hit the mark plenty of protection for any electronics i might have in it and enough pockets for me to carry a couple pens and a small pad of paper
for $ # i was expecting something made out of all cheap materials , poor quality , but acceptable but targus decided to make this a very durable , padded messenger bag i can not believe this bag is only $ # shipped i 'm using this for my asus transformer fits my keyboard dock , and tablet in the two different padded slots , or fit when docked together , with very ample protection much space for any usb mouse , cables , or anything else you carry with your netbook/tablet i 'd definitely recommend this bag over anything else on amazon for someone looking for a high quality messenger bag for their netbook/tablet
i ordered this netbook case for my asus eee pc received it in like # days which was great it fits my netbook in it perfectly theres a spot in the front to put your charger and other misc . supplies if you choose to . it has a carrying strap which is adjustable to any length you want . it also has a normal carrying handle
i bought this bag to use with my ipad i have the basic book style case i bought from apple and i wanted a bag that was big enough to fit the ipad in the case this fits perfectly , it does have a little extra room in case you have a slightly larger case on your ipad i would say maybe a half inch more in length there is also room for me to carry my husband 's ipod and my <unk> device and the chargers for everything which is what i was after i was looking for a bag to use when we went on trips that was small , yet would hold these three devices this bag fits the bill and the price was right
i was looking for a small hand held with shoulder strap case to carry my new ipad with otter defender case and accessories in and found this one at fry 's i did n't buy it there because i knew i would find a better price on amazon it 's great and i love it just wish they came in other colors
this bag is great for carrying my tablets and accessories the compartments help organize everything the only thing that i did not like is the shoulder strap cushion and the strap was stitched together but not a problem i just removed the stitching that attached the two together , the strap cushion sticking was not part of the stitching that attached the two together that stitching was not part of the shoulder cushion , it was only for attaching the two together great little bag
this was the perfect fit for the asus eee transformer tablet we can fit the tablet , keyboard , and accessories nicely in the bag and there is not a lot of room for it to bounce around so it is well protected
its bright orange as i requested and looks good but has one huge problem the case is incorrectly cut on the left side so that it is impossible to insert the earphones in the proper hole as it is half covered by the plastic
this case seems to made of good quality material and i really like the color and texture putting it on my macbook was easy and it seemed a perfect fit until i tried to use my headphones the cutout on the side was just a bit too narrow to allow the jack to be pushed in all the way the same was true of the other end the power cord connector had to be reversed to fit well enough to make connection both problems were solved , easily enough , with a sharp craft knife and an <unk> board i know i could have returned it and my solution to the problem <unk> more to my <unk> than to amazon 's extremely fair return policy but that said , i really liked the case and if the fit was better i probably would have rated it # stars
as mentioned , its a good cover for the price however , the side of the bottom case -lrb- where there 's a gap for the power , usb , headphone , etc . ports -rrb- comes up a little short - literally the case covered up about half of the headphone jack on a brand new # macbook pro i just cut out about another half inch of the side of the case with a utility knife and everything lines up perfectly now , but it seems like that kind of problem would have come up in testing
this product is much better than what i thought i would be receiving i saw a hard & # # ; see-through & # # ; orange case at best buy -- on that case , it was so easy to get fingerprints just from touching it this product is textured with a rubberized coating , so i do n't have to worry about constant fingerprints the case is great only problem : on the left side , the case covers part of the audio jack , which made it to where headphones could n't connect -lrb- i have the apple <unk> and tried a different pair -rrb- so i used some medical scissors to cut it a little bit and used an old file to file off anything that looked funny ca n't even tell i did it love this product , i just wish i would have gotten it # years ago
it just arrived this morning , and i put it on right away on my # `` macbook pro it was a real tight fit almost felt like i was gon na break my macbook putting it on though once it was on , it looked beautiful the bright orange definitely was n't my first pick of colors , though once i saw how it looked ; i honestly did not mind one bit it looks and feels like an incase ca n't give it # stars because of the headphone jack but for the price , it was a steal alright fixed the headphone jack problem too just got to mod it a bit
this is my second incase hardshell case that i 've purchased for my macbook this case is a bit thicker than the last case i had which causes the screen to not open fully and i have to turn the charger around to get it to plug in other than those two things i am really happy with the case and i like the thickness because it does offer more protection
the case is sturdy , and the orange color is vivid it snaps in pretty securely my only problem was that i had to file off a little excess plastic to fit my headphones into the jack i only needed a cardboard nail file ; it was nothing major definitely a bargain
perfect fit to my # apple macbookpro great protection and i like that it 's a see thru so i can see my apple light up when in use however , they do n't last forever this is my second one in three years , they develop cracks and i do n't like seeing them cracked so i finally got another one this one was a great deal at # . # much cheaper than in the stores , if you can find them they are getting <unk> deducted a star for the breaking , some may not mind that and it is still a protection for the case even if it 's cracked
i would give this # or # stars if it were the correct product the similar product we have received seems to be fine , so far this item states it is for # inches and its interior width is # . # inches when we received it , it was clearly marked `` # inch . our # inch -lrb- a tad under # . # inches wide -rrb- laptop would not fit i measured the interior and it measured # . # , not # . # inches across we returned it and have replaced it with one for a # inch laptop the # inch fits it well i suspect it would be a tight fit for a # inch , but would probably do the quality seems okay , but its specs are wrong and it will not work with all the devices listed
awesome case for my mac ! fits great ! looks great ! feels great ! only thing that would make it a little better would be if it had handles ! but overall great for the price
this case is very smooth on the outside and the inside my macbook pro slides in very well and this case provides good protection from scratches and other small nicks it would n't save the computer from a drop but it is still a great computer case
unfortunately i had to return because i was unaware that i was given the wrong size laptop at purchase , so it did n't fit will consider buying another since i have another laptop this size
this laptop case came in perfect brand new condition , packaged and all i love it it looks just as it does in the photo and it has actual soft fur on the outside
it 's well made it 's real leather it looks like it should cost over fifty bucks i just which the clasp was a bit better the case is very large , rather bulky it overall looks over professional however
this product would be great for your standard toshiba or a bulky older gaming laptop its very high quality and i was shocked at how low of a price i found it for on amazon i guess i did n't read the dimensions for the thickness which they do have listed as over # . # inches with the original macbook pro that is less than # . # inches thick , there is a lot of room to spare i guess when i go to the bookstore i will slide in the power cord , and about # <unk> notebooks or if i have a text book to read it could easily fit inside it looks great when it 's filled out nicely . the bottom is sturdy and the magnetic slot through clasp is very high quality feeling but if it 's not filled out , the top is sloppy and hard to hold on to i plan on using mine for business meetings and sliding in about # <unk> boards with my mounted presentations inside it looks very professional , but slightly masculine
this case was exactly what i needed it was a perfect fit i own a # . # `` sony vaio el series laptop i was worried it was n't going to fit because this laptop is actually quite bulky but so is the case it is beautiful black leather <unk> with oils to make it last longer best of all i got it for $ # shipping included this case definitely looks like it 's worth $ # i would n't recommended it for <unk> laptops this case is quite thick
i was amazed when i received the leather slipcase quality of the leather is top grade and the price is fantastic fits my acer # . # `` laptop like a glove a super buy
the picture looks a bit odd it looks like a worn out targus case the case looks a lot nicer brand new i bought mine from best buy but figured i 'd write a review here it has a lot of padding compared to other cases i have my ipad in a smart cover and a back case and it fits this sleeve perfectly with just a little bit of room left the only thing i wish this case has was a small pocket for my <unk> other than that , it 's a great case
i bought this for my surface pro , and so far , it 's done a great job very soft case , and it holds the surface and type cover perfectly there is a little bit of extra space vertically , but it 's not a big deal the case is very soft , so i have no worries with it scratching my computer it does n't hold the power brick however , and there 's little room for anything bigger than a deck of cards
this case provides some real protection at a reasonable price many similar products have no real cushioning if you 're after something that provides more than just a scratch barrier , this is it my acer one # inch fits with room for an external mouse receiver to remain connected on a side usb port be advised , tho , that no soft shell cover will provide the shock resistance of a hard case i place my covered notebook in a travel bag along with accessories , and i feel pretty safe overall , good value for the price
i purchased this case to go along with my <unk> net book it fits the mini # net book perfectly i went through many cases before selecting this case the reason i selected this case is because of fit and thickness of padding it has a much thicker padding than the cuter , sometimes smaller cases this fits the dimensions of the hp # perfectly , and even leaves just enough room to slide in a small mouse or extra battery
the sleeve is great it 's well padded , well designed , streamlined , soft , durable , and aesthetically pleasing the dimensions as listed in the product description , however , are not accurate my laptop -lrb- x # i , including the # cell battery -rrb- measures # `` x # / # `` and does not fit i 'm returning this and hoping that targus makes a # `` a # sleeve
as others have said , this does fit a thinkpad x # pretty well and it 's pretty thick , so your laptop will be well-protected however , if you 're only looking for a thin neoprene sleeve to protect your thinkpad while it 's in your backpack or briefcase , this targus case may be overkill this case is much thicker than i need , but i 'll use it until i can find something thinner -lrb- unfortunately , there 's really nothing else out there for an x # yet .
this fits perfectly around my # . # `` asus # b , and it is padded beyond anything i 've seen of this type this is an excellent sleeve and fits snugly , and it assures me my netbook wo n't get damaged of course , this is just padding , i do n't think it 'll survive a fall or anything , but that 's not its purpose recommend this item
i searched all over for a sleeve that would fit my lenovo x # with the # cell battery , as the laptop is an odd size , bigger than a netbook and smaller than a # inch laptop everything i tried was way too big -- which <unk> the point of having such a small laptop this case is the answer yes , the fit is very snug -- it takes just a bit of <unk> to get my laptop in but not more than an extra few seconds the reward is a really high quality case that fits perfectly and does n't turn my small laptop into a ginormous beast this thing is really nicely padded -- feels like much better protection than your a standard neoprene sleeve
when i ordered myasus x # <unk> , that put me in the market for a sleeve cover i carry my laptop in my swiss gear backpack , and i was just looking for something to protect it from scratches and give a little additional cushion while in transit it also helps keep dust out when it is not in my backpack or in use i did n't find a lot of choices that i liked in the # inch size , but i have used targus sleeves in the past this sleeve fits my x # e perfectly , and it meets my needs perfectly i have trusted the targus brand for years , and this sleeve only <unk> my past experience i highly recommend it to those looking for a sleeve for their # . # inch laptop
in just # days of use a pocket from the second compartiment lost some stitches and almost the entire sewing in # days the lateral pocket is very fragile too
i recently traveled with this backpack it was very easy to get my laptop in and out of it for security i wish the capacity were just a shade larger in the other compartment i use this for my daily commute and carry my lunch and usually a book it 's not quite roomy enough for all that but if you are just <unk> your computer and some files , it 's perfect
constructed well , with lots of storage <unk> -lrb- pouches , safety <unk> , etc -rrb- the pack is also lighter than you would expect , but still has a padded spot for the laptop with velcro closer to keep it in place
if you need a laptop backpack , do n't miss this one comfortable padded straps , plenty of <unk> around the computer and ample compartments for the other stuff you need and want to carry this backpack is a great value and you wo n't be disappointed
targus makes good bags , i 've had them for years and always been happy with the quality the only odd thing about this bag is the placement of the top carrying handle , its not on the top of the bag , its slightly off to the side which tends to shift the carrying weight
as others have said , it is frustrating that the small handle on this bag is offset , and the large handle on mine squeaks really <unk> i do love how much stuff you can fit in this bag and all the pockets , and i like the way it looks so i do n't regret buying it overall however , it will never stand up on its own on the floor -lrb- it always falls over , no matter what is in it -rrb- and carrying it around by the small handle is not comfortable for very long
i spent a lot of time shopping for laptop cases in the local stores i found this one but amazon had it for about half the price and free super saver shipping i love it it has plenty of compartments and my # . # `` laptop fits great the only thing i would change is the hand hold at the top it has one off center which makes it awkward to pick up i would either center it or add an <unk> handle on the other side i got used to it and it would not prevent me from buying everything else is an a
it is a good bag that offers good protection to a laptop . it has significant padding to aid in this my only fault was the length of the strap i wish it was longer that prevented it from getting a #

i searched for something like this for hours ! the green is gorgeous - kinda <unk> or <unk> green there is a pouch on the top of the flap , one on outer side of the bag , a zippered compartment with mesh on the inside , then two more zippered compartments -lrb- i added photos to help -rrb- at any given time , i have my macbook pro # `` fitting snugly with a thick textbook , three one subject notebooks , calculator , pens , pencils , keys , etc . i only gave it four stars due to the unfortunate creaking noise made by the plastic hooks on the shoulder strap overall , it is very comfortable to carry as well , if you do n't mind creaking down a quiet <unk> while others are testing
good value for the money , though the bag does hang <unk> with the laptop inside looks a little weird , but not too bad if the laptop is placed in the middle pocket
it 's been great using this bag , its sturdy and i love the <unk> green , the only thing is the long strap squeaks all the time while i 'm wearing it , and it came a day late other than that it 's perfect
this is an excellent messenger bag very well made , nice quality there is even a pad at the bottom so your laptop or tablet does not hit a hard surface
