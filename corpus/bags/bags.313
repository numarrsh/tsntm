i bought this for my husband computer and i think it 's nice it 's snug and flexible , not at all rigid , but he does n't like it and for a good reason it has one significant flaw the laptop can not shut while it is in use my husband is a <unk> and he needs something that can take a beating i do n't think this product is going to cut it i think this product would work for most , but not for my husband
excellent protection and grasp making it easy to hold on to it does not allow easy access to usb ports on side -lrb- hp # . # in -rrb- so corner must be pulled back
this is a nice cover for laptops but it does n't state that it wo n't work if you have an extended battery on your laptop , hence why i only gave it # stars it has nice features and the color options are great and i wish it would have worked
gives my laptop a new , tougher look works great and was easy to put on remember that this is universal ... it is made to fit most laptops -lrb- a universal remote control does n't control all devices - so why would this be any different ? ? ? ? i had to give up a usb port for mine , but it 's still worth it as far as it protecting laptop from scratches ... there are still exposed areas , this is not going to totally protect your laptop , but it will help i will purchase again ...
fitting the protective cover was not a problem to install and it fits snug and there is no problem closing it the ports however have to be carefully cut out to allow full <unk> for the laptop but for me , that 's <unk> here or <unk> can adjust to it and friends will ask where i got it from it only got a four star for that slight alignment <unk> protective addition
i love how this hugs my laptop ... not sure if it will protect it if dropped -lrb- not trying to test that theory -rrb- but i really like how it looks so worth the money
perfect to help protect kids computers i have # boys and they all got laptops for christmas they each have a different color so it is easy to distinguish whose is whose love how it keeps the laptop gripped to a surface , the laptop does not slide around ordering one for
i am very pleased with this purchase the laptop cover fits my laptop perfectly it is very durable and protects my laptop from scratches it was also very easy to clean and install onto my laptop i love the green color i am glad that they have the cover available in a variety of colors i recommended the laptop covers to my friends and family
it fits perfectly over my toshiba satellite # . # inch it is all silicone and fits over the computer like one of those stretchy books covers i have had many compliments on my pink silicon cover it even has a textured underside so it will not slide i recommend this product my computer is protected and absolutely adorable
this was a very smart purchase it adds extra protection for my laptop and is thin enough to still allow room for my laptop to fit nicely into my boho laptop sleeve
i had left my laptop on the arm rest of the couch one day , my husband accidentally knocked it off and cracked the corners right above the hinges eventually the areas that had been cracked completely broke off leaving unsightly holes on the corners exposing missing plastic i ordered this to cover it up and protect my laptop from any possible future falls it fit my laptop perfectly , it looks really neat and covered any visible damage from before
it arrive chipped bummer ... decided to use it cause it was so cheap and stupid to return broke after # days you get what you pay for plus it made my computer look cheap
it cracked as soon as i took it out of the wrapper paid a decent amount for it to crack right away i would have been better off wearing it without a
the seller advertises that this is compatible with the june # macbook air -lrb- it even lists the model number as well -rrb- , which is inaccurate i purchased the blue case , and it covers both of the microphones highly disappointing , as i wo n't have the opportunity to return it do not buy this case if you have the latest macbook air
i fell in love with the feel of this cover when i got it it looks great , too but it did n't last the corners are cracking off and i 've had it less than a month turns out it 's cheap plastic the four padded cushions are cheap , too , and are obviously not built to last what a disappointment
i ordered the pink case , however , i received the orange one the case pretty much fits , but one of the corners does n't quite snap on ; it 's not <unk> how i <unk> my laptop in anyway speedy delivery , good price , good quality
fingerprints are really obvious against the matt black product itself is ok it was easy to snap on , and fit snugly # of # of the non-slip pieces at the bottom came off but it was easy to super glue back on
not a bad case , although the <unk> was <unk> and came with a scratch on it it was just put into a thin padded envelope and was punctured en route very lazy packaging ! otherwise the case is pretty good - fits snugly , although the attachment snaps off a bit in the middle every time i open it -lrb- i just snap it back on -rrb- perhaps i have n't put it on quite perfectly , but ca n't figure out how to get it off to <unk> it the clear glossy finish is nice , but shows up every scrape from putting it in & out of my briefcase i think i liked the ipearl better , as it was not so glossy and seemed to fit a tiny bit better
really cool look and material feels awesome and does protect the mac from scratches and bumping around what really did n't make me happy was after installation , i noticed i could n't open my macbook all the way there was extra plastic that is n't even necessary blocking in the back my friend has a similar case from another manufacturer and it does n't have that issue i did want to return this at first , but i thought it was n't worth the hassle i took some tools and carefully <unk> off the extra plastic in the back and now it opens up properly
good quality , nice texture and color to it the apple is not as transparent as the picture made it seem it would appear i feel it should have been a little cheaper though the quality of the case i got does n't quite match what i paid i would look around for a different brand in the future
i wanted this case so there would be some space between the bottom of it and my desktop i thought the bottom of this was n't going to snap on , it 's so sleek and the clasps are so subtle but once it did , i 've never had any problem with it slipping off i love the fact that i do n't eve notice i have a case covering my macbook air -- and , the fact that the apple logo shines through
not that it 's the hardest product in the world to install ... but i was surprised there were no instructions , not even a <unk> sheet of paper it was packaged well , little chance of arriving scratched or broken thanks to good packaging i 've had another hard case for a different laptop , this one lets you see the logo even when the backlight is off , most of the others appear not to be able to do so
bought this after seeing one of my staff owns one for his # `` macbook air it has a matte finish as suppose to a glossy one & what i love about it is that the apple logo still <unk> shines through the case it snaps on pretty tight & seems hard to take off been using it over a month now , protecting my mba from scratches from daily use but not drops there are spacious cut-outs for the ports on both side no overheating issues it has cut-out vents on the bottom & for some reason has white foam feet pegs that i end up using a <unk> black marker the only downside i saw was that even though it has a black matte finish , you can still see subtle finger smudges on the cover
the case arrived quickly its easy to put on . only <unk> is the top part does n't clip on all that well however it protects the corners and thats really the point
i received one for the previous macbook air generation , which did not have the proper mic holes on the left side kuzy was quick to send a replacement while not requiring me to send back the first one upon fitting it to my macbook , i saw that the clips on the back corners of the bottom plate did n't allow the lid of the laptop to open fully if i were to try to open it without noticing this , i suspect it could have bent the bottom corners of the laptop 's lid or <unk> the hinge i took some tin <unk> and made two small cuts at an angle to clear the material on the clips on the bottom cover , problem solved not a huge deal since it works great now and this was much less expensive than a speck case , and the modifications do n't look bad maybe they 've fixed the problem by now the soft touch finish feels great it does show finger grease but is easily cleaned with a damp cloth
this is a lovely case that fits so well it is hard to get off once on only down fall is it was a little scratched when i got it other than that it seems better than previous cases i have had
it looks great it feels great but like other reviewers have said it does tend to crack a tab on the back was rubbing and cracked on the second day it still stays on and has no issues with performance but i wonder how much longer this love <unk> will last i 've had it for about a month
the product came as described and it fits my computer my only issue is that all of the balance pegs on the bottom of it have fallen off ... like i said , its okay
i chose this rating based on speed of delivery -lrb- local delivery but nonetheless -rrb- , accuracy of the described item , price and reliability i currently own the same product on another macbook for over a year and has been holding up quite nicely the only reason i am not giving it four stars are the rubber foots they are not <unk> in the indentations where they are designed to be i had the same problem with my older case cover one can remove them and stick them where they 're supposed to be , but that 's assuming you are able to without tearing away too much of the adhesive otherwise , super glue must be used in spite of this , for the price you paid , it 's a good product
with careful placement , these skins fit snugly over the laptops i can only imagine the careful measuring required to get these to go on , yet leave no clumsy wiggle room they do fit nicely , have a nice soft feel , and hold up well in appearance over time my guess is they are the best mac laptop skins for the money
i had previously owned a pink cosmos rubberized hard case and decided to switch it up and get a black one instead it fits my macbook air snuggly , but not snug enough for me to have issues with removing the case what i loved about this case is that , unlike my cosmos case , the rubber soles of the laptop is quite sturdy after carrying around my laptop with my cosmos case for just one day , all the little rubber soles of that case slipped right out of the case and into my bag it was n't a big deal at the time , but it was still pretty bizarre to find my case missing soles all of a sudden one thing that i am not thrilled about with this kuzy case however , is that it picks up so many visible finger smudges but that is to be expected of a black case with this type of material finish i still love it nonetheless , and will not be looking for a new case anytime soon
just bought this to replace a speck case that had cracked it fits much better , looks superior , and has better <unk> than any other case i have tried i would highly reccomend this product
i have had this case for about two months now and today was the first time i took my macbook to school the case protects it so well , plus you ca n't beat the cute sky blue the only downside is it rubs just a tiny bit when opened and angled back it still opens all the way and does not do any damage to the macbook honestly i did n't even notice until about a month after i had already been using it daily it does n't make a difference to me because in all the product is pretty high quality
i bought one for my macbook pro laptop and now this # nd one for my macbook air great fit , durability and appearance i do not write online reviews often but i absolutely love this product
i bought this cover in red for my new # & # # ; macbook air snapped on in under a minute keeps the laptop well protected yet still allows for access to all ports and the apple logo glows through ... very cool i may get a couple of other colors just for different <unk> ... but hard to top red
i <unk> my days of having the black macbook , but i love and want to protect my macbook air this is the perfect solution great protection for the machine and it fits perfectly
the kuzy case fits very well and does a good job of protecting my # & # # ; mba while the case is n't slippery , it is smooth i 'd have preferred a little more texture to provide a more secure grip because the mba is so light , there 's a tendency to grasp it with one hand and a more aggressive texture would help prevent it from slipping out of your grasp
it is a great case the rubberized outside provides a good grip , the case itself keeps my mba cool and protects it from scratches in response to <unk> # 's review , the case i received does not cover both mic holes the cover is exactly as what is shown in the pictures there is one hole over the right mic hole , and the left mic hole is uncovered along with the ports to the left of it i own the gray case it could depend on the color you choose
good fit and nice feel to this hard cover wo n't slip out of my hands like my previous clear cover like the color , too ... not to bright but still enough to accent the already <unk> mba design
i 'm very impressed with the quality of this case my wife bought a similar case from spek , and it 's not nearly as good -lrb- plus twice the price -rrb- it has a rubberized texture for easy holding very thin , so it do n't feel like it adds much to the overall size of the macbook air the soft rubber feet were a nice surprise also , the mic holes are not covered up like some reviewers reported
love this red hard case cover , it has a rich color and a beautiful finish it 's not semi transparent like some others therefore looks great i put the apple sticker that came with the computer on mine
i loved this case when i used it with my macbook air it helped protect my machine from the regular dings and scratches that occur from day to day use these seem to be particularly common with macbooks , so i wanted to keep mine clean this did the trick and also made my macbook more <unk> i 'm a huge <unk> , so this was important to me needless to say , i 'm purchasing another one for my new macbook pro right this second
a perfect fit for macbook air # . # top and bottom snapped on without any problems i had top and bottom on in about # minute , that 's how easy it is you can see the apple logo through the top the look is great i also removed the top and bottom to see if it could be done without much difficulty the top and bottom can be removed very easily i am very happy with this product
i was looking for a cheap way to protect my new # model macbook air i was a little worried about the case covering the new dual microphones on the latest release of macbook air 's , but i 'm happy to say that it does not cover either of the microphone ports that being said , it did take some <unk> to get the top part of the case on at one point i was pressing so hard on my macbook and the case that i was afraid i was going to break one or the other i did eventually get the top on and figured out that if you put the front clips on first you can then work your way from one side or the other across the back to get those clips in place the case does not in any way hinder the opening and closing of the lid , and provides a lip all the way around that is high enough to accommodate a keyboard protector overall i am very satisfied with this product
i 've had this on my macbook air # & # # ; since the day i bought it no chips , cracks or issues with the & # # ; rubberish & # # ; texture totally worth the price and a no brainer when compared to the speck cases i 'm going to <unk> another color so i can mix and match
perfect cover that adds protection without the extra bulk , making it easy to carry in my purse for work and travel price is reasonable for the case after seeing mine , now my husband is considering purchasing one for his mb air
absolutely love this case ! it is hard enough to give protection but has a smooth rubberized feel to it that is very nice to the touch it fits perfectly on my macbook air # . # & # # ; -lrb- mid- # -rrb- with cut-outs for all ports it is translucent so you can see the original material shine through after using this i will never get any other kind of case this was exactly what i was looking for
it 's been a good while since i first purchased my kuzy cover and it 's still going strong , even after being used everyday , almost all day very happy with this purchase
i really like this case i like it so much i am going to get another one in another color or two fun to change out ... got the matching keyboard cover and everyone is asking where i got my computer
first use for travel the zippers are ripping i like the color but after one use with a standard laptop if the zippers are ripping already i am not feeling too happy here
if you are looking for a pink backpack this is not the one for you my boyfriend sent me this as a surprise and this backpack is nothing like the color in the picture the actual backpack is purple and not pink ! !
i was between this backpack and one other one the reason i went with this one is because it was said to have a cell phone holder on the strap there is a small mesh pocket on one of the straps , but there is no way you can fit a cell phone -lrb- iphone -rrb- in the pocket it was also advertised to have a laptop sleeve , tablet pocket and a mp # player pocket yes , there is a headphones port in the back but there is no mp # pocket to work with the headphone port , only the laptop sleeve and tablet sleeve amazon and the tags on the backpack make it sound like there is a dedicated mp # pocket and their is not finally , this backpack is not pink , it 's purple both the amazon website 's picture and the picture on the tag of the backpack make it appear pink , but in reality it is purple
the backpack is sturdy ; well organised ; cute soft color ; lots of space and useful pockets ; good design it 's true , that the backpack is not exactly as pink as the picture , but it 's definitely a great color , somewhere between this nice pink and the closest purple shade possible i bought this for my girlfriend and when friends saw her - they wanted it as well we both love the product definitely recommended ! :
i bought this for my daughter in college it definitely has plenty of room for everything it is very sturdy and made very well the only thing my daughter has a complaint about is that it is a bit too bulky for her and would have preferred it to be a bit lighter
best backpack i 've ever owned theres a slot for everything you have the tablet slot and the two water bottle slots are the two that i found most useful very stylish and comfortable
i ordered this backpack for my daughter who is heading to college this fall she wo n't really be using it until then , but she really likes the look , style and storage i will agree with some of the other reviews on the color it is darker than the pictures show not a bad thing , just good to know i would recommend this as a very good backpack for a student plenty of room and seems to be decent protection for electronics the warranty is nice to have also and the swissgear brand seems to be top-notch
very light weight and has enough room , plus the extra pocket for a tab is just what i was looking for i 'm traveling to europe for business and needed something light and durable i have another swissgear backpack that i use -lrb- just a lot heavier -rrb- but i 've always loved the quality and comfort of swissgear and the color is great ! ! it may appear a little brighter and <unk> in the picture online but if you like <unk> i do n't think you can go wrong ! !
i love the color -lrb- and it is a dark <unk> pink or <unk> , which is my favorite color it is not & # # ; hot pink & # # ; as some have complained here it has an enormous array of compartments and the bag is built very sturdily with lots of cushioning to keep electronics safe this is the best backpack i 've ever owned
i really love this backpack because it has so much room to put my book and laptop plus whatever else i need to put in there i would recommend this backpack to anyone
this bag is super light and i constantly have to check that i 've actually put my laptop in it because it does n't feel weighed down generally speaking laptop bags are heavy and never stylish <unk> but this bag fits both needs i generally carry a # in laptop , a tablet , travel mug in the side mesh pocket and shoes i would not say there is a ton of padding in the laptop pocket but i do n't require a ton anyway the lightness of the bag would make it good for kids and little ones i 've used it while travelling as my carry on and i fit # laptops , a small purse and then smaller things in the front pocket without any problems
i bought this cover to fit my daughters new laptop , i purchased it because it was featured as items that are frequently bought together it does n't fit the laptop at all what a waste
i thought this case would be lighter in color and more colored in general it 's more of an opaque kind of see-through case so it only slightly read blue if you want a burst of color , go with something else
although our laptop was listed among the models it would fit , it was not compatible the bottom is n't even close to the structure of the actual laptop and the top is loose fitting , not snug like one that fits properly i will have to try again on this one packaged it back up but not sure how easy it will be to return
the case was a lot more transparent than in the picture while it fit my asus , it is n't something i 'm going to use i just bought a soft laptop bag instead
fits my laptop well , but the cover is transparent not solid as the photo appears it looks bad on my pink laptop so i 'm going to have to get a skin to make it work
the bottom shell has some issues staying on it often unclips itself also , with both the top and bottom shell on , you ca n't fully open your laptop though , it is overall useful i 've dropped my laptop once or twice from a short distance and it 's protected it
it is an item to help to protect your laptop , so i think it is a good choice buying it however and the color is too light it is not like the picture i bought the light blue -lrb- aqua -rrb- , but it would have been better if i bought the blue one it is only an acrylic -lrb- or maybe plastic -rrb- cover and nothing more , but i like it because it help protect my laptop and allow use all functions -lrb- all air and cable <unk> stay unlocked -rrb- i like the holds on the bottom , it helps me to type better and helps to avoid laptop get so warm
i do n't know that i would believe that this helps protect the laptop from drops or anything but it is cute and the little legs help with air movement it snapped into place with no trouble so ca n't really ask for much more it does what it does well
fits perfectly , looks nice . . took off a star because you need to press down slightly on the bottom part of the case when opening the screen all the way i think i can get used to it though !
unusual # piece construction that clips over the front and back of the vivobook quick and easy to install remains to be seen just how sturdy this system is
i bought this for my asus vivobook @ q # e i thought i had an ill fitting cover until i realized i had the top on backwards it snapped on snugly once i turned it around the legs do seem flimsy -lrb- also superfluous -rrb- , but they seem to work okay with the legs folded in , the laptop sat fine on a flat service the color is great , and it definitely protects the laptop chassis for twenty bucks , i am extremely glad i bought this item
i was scared when i read that some customers have bought it and did n't fit their laptop it fit mine great and i do love the color and how it looks on it i would totally recommend it to anyone with an asus
i notice they have changed the <unk> since i bought mine , they no longer have it listed as being compatible with the acer iconia a # that 's because it does n't work with the a # , but when i bought it they said it did i 'm glad they corrected that but it did n't help me too bad they did n't test it on the different tablets before listing them as compatible , it would have saved me a lot of time
the tablet is too big for the case - hangs over the side and you can not close the case i was disappointed because the keyboard was nice ! ! ! i sent it back
although this item arrived on time , it came with no packaging except a plastic slipcover , and <unk> protective packing it also had a standard usb connector instead of a micro usb , which was not stated in the description , and there was no form of instruction included
the connect cord is not very durable it broke with in just a few months and the wires were not fix able would also be a better product if the tablet was more secure meaning , keep from sliding out
i love the cover part , it is nice , looks good and protective i was n't in love with the keyboard it was slow to respond , and seemed hard to use for me but some kids may love it you just have to try it out
product was priced fairly arrived on time exterior is sturdy , keyboard works well the only concern that i have is that if you pick the <unk> up without being very careful , the tablet can slide out either end of the case
i create on my acer a # and this keyboard is just what i was looking for at a good price it 's battery life is good -lrb- better than the tablet -rrb- and key feel is nice the only issue i have with it is the <unk> placement of some keys like the <unk> which i use a lot , but i 'm getting used to it
although the keyboard layout was a bit strange , key travel is good , better than a & # # ; <unk> & # # ; style , and for a mini keyboard , the layout is pretty much complete the case fits the iconia w # tablet perfectly the amount of & # # ; grab force & # # ; is limited because otherwise the plastic tablet case would probably be damaged the result is that you can not carry the case vertically otherwise the tablet will fall out however , normally one carries it horizontally so the tablet stays in the case just fine
i really like the finish and i prefer how it looks over just the chromebook it broke on the third day i owned it one of the little hooks that hold the bottom piece on broke off i am now only using the top
case arrived damaged and they should consider doing a matte finish for this laptop and bottom desing all closed not happy but o well maybe a <unk> color would change my mind wich im not paying
the case upon initial <unk> looks great , great looking cover and color <unk> it cover too much of the area around the edges sometimes you have to move the tablet to <unk> portions of the screen and thats not good
it made the chromebook too heavy and reduced the light weight feature of the chromebook for carrying , but it serves it 's purpose of protecting the chromebook i took it off
i like it and it looks nice holds up and does what it should my only complaint , which is a big one , is that when the bottom half of the case is on , the mouse click tends to sink into the computer frame unfortunate , so i had to take it off
# stars - for receiving the package ca n't really say much about the case just yet , but it is working out pretty well # stars - fits perfectly on the chromebook and has stands under for more airflow , not that you need it since chromebooks dont have built in fans - # star - reason why i am giving this # stars for now is cause it smudges easily would love to see a matte version
this is a very easy to apply snap-on case for the samsung chromebook fits just fine but sometimes the bottom part is a little <unk> what i do love is that it has kick stands which make typing a lot more comfortable when using the chromebook on a flat surface it is not a solid black you can see through it a little , so maybe you would prefer one of the brighter colors it 's okay value for what it costs but i do wish the bottom would snap on tighter and not be so squeaky
top half of case came warped every time i open the chromebook the curved portion around the hinge catches on the lower half of the case and make a horrendous cracking sound unless i hold it down poor quality craftsmanship
the plastic is cheap and will do a little to protect my laptop there are two tabs on the top piece that keeps getting caught every time i open it up might just break them off as i do n't see a real need for them
ordered the black cover it installed easily had a problem with the lid cover it would not stay in place after opening the lid once or twice the # small hinge covers would work up and and start to bind called ipearl they apologized and sent me a new one they told me that i could cut off the # hinge tabs if i <unk> too and it should still work i did that and every thing worked when the new lid cover arrived i decided to keep it for a spare
the # piece hard shell case snaps on nicely to the samsung chromebook it gives the whole book more rigidity and durability my biggest complaint about my chromebook is how flimsy the plastic case and screen seem to be this makes me much more confident that it will not be damaged
perfect fit on my # . # samsung chromebook now i realise the clear option would have looked much better than the black one i got , but i 'm still very satisfied with my purchase and would definitely recommend it pros : very easy to put on comes with legs on the bottom variety on colours that look just like the photos good quality , snaps perfectly onto chromebook item is exactly as described cons : shows finger print marks . :
i really like this product my only concern was getting the case to snap onto my chromebook when i received the case , i attempted to put it on my chromebook at first the bottom of the top piece did n't want to slide into place at the hinge after about an hour of usage , the case slide into place and stopped moving around sometimes the top piece pops out of place on the side , but that 's only a minor inconvenience and does n't happen very often it probably only does it because of something i 've done i 'd recommend this product to anyone looking for a case to protect their chromebook from scratches
this is the only shell case i have seen i bought a broken and scuffed up samsung chrome book and repaired it this skin case looks good and fits tight but it creaks and feels cheap compared to a similar design on my ipad the bottom shell also seems to retain heat although it is not hot when using the chromebook without the shell it seems cooler
snaps on snug ; hard plastic wo n't cushion from drops , but will prevent nicks and scratches if transported around bought for my high school son 's chromebook that he takes to school with him every day so far it 's lasted over two months without anything breaking on it
this case is everything it needs to be i bought this for my google chromebook and i 'm glad i did -lrb- i like the black look as opposed to silver -rrb- anyways , good for the price
i like the color and it fits the chrome book perfectly just like in that picture you see , one hinge on the cover was already messed up and it did not grab my laptop very well it keeps it loose so i do not understand i have to be always careful when i open up my chrome book so it doe n't break
used for a child 's laptop that travels to and from school each day i would not rely on this as the only protection from drops - we use a padded sleeve inside the backpack for that purpose but the ipearl hard shell case has prevented damage from bumps and scratches we had no problem getting it onto the computer and it has stayed in place with no problems
good fit for the chromebook and protects it fairly well i purchased this hard case and a soft sleeve as well because my son is required to have a chromebook at his high school so far the case combination has protected the chromebook from minor falls the screen failed -lrb- whether due to a fall i do not know -rrb- , but the high school it <unk> did admit that they were having trouble with the screens and replaced the chromebook otherwise it has survived being in his backpack and tossed on the locker room floor , the car floor and on various furniture at home
i bought my used chromebook for a cheap price but it had a corner piece of plastic broken off and scratches on the outside this shell covered up those areas and added to the overall protection of my chromebook gets four stars because i feel the stand legs are a little weak and i do n't use them for fear of them breaking
