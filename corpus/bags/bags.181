great company with great products i would say this is the best backpack i have had to date it fits a good amount of stuff while dividing it up into good compartments while <unk> closer to you than any other backpack of capacity i do not have to worry about having the backpack stick that much out from my back i expect it to serve me for another few years
i 've had this backpack for a year , and have used it once a month for my drill weekends in the air national guard for this year i have carried a laptop that has a # . # `` screen , and it has done it with no problems i just bought my hp pavilion m # that has a # . # `` screen and was worried about the fit the laptop compartment of the backpack holds and protects the bigger laptop fine , and i had no problem putting it in and taking it out of the backpack now to see if it will last as long as my last backpack i 'll let you know in about two years
i have had this backpack for almost a year now , you ca n't even tell i carry this backpack with me everywhere because of my job the extra money i spent for this backpack was worth it
saw from one friend and decided immediately that i want one and of course , this is a great product for travel overseas , camping , you can fill almost everything ... worth it for the money i paid i believe though price keep <unk> here in amazon make sure you get the best price before you purchase quality product and i recommend for frequent travelers and students
this bag is great for organization and storage options i have used for # months now and it seems extremely durable the structure and weight <unk> of the bag is very comfortable
i would rather review this once i have owned it for a full year -lrb- if it makes it that far -rrb- it has held up really nicely so far but it 's only been one month so i ca n't fully comment on durability as far as the bag itself i really absolutely love it i would n't change anything really it 's a solid product in regard to features the laptop compartment is large enough to hold my <unk> # which is rather large for a # . # inch laptop i would have liked to have just a tad more space in there but hey , it does fit anyways , ill update my review in a few more months if they continue to sell this bag
i love the scan smart section it really saves me the time and energy of taking my laptop out each time i go through tsa the backpack itself holds quite a bit and i was happy that it was able to hold my # in laptop , my nexus # and my dslr camera and accessories comfortably with room to spare the bag itself is rather bulky and has a large profile , so if you 're wanting a slim backpack , this is n't the bag you want other than that , it feels great and distributes that weight of its contents very well
this is the best laptop bag i have ever purchased there a place for everything and so easy to get my laptop out at the airport screening stations
this laptop bag is spacious , has seperate compartments for your laptop and ipad , and a front pocket to hold anything else you need to bring it is amazing how much this holds also has a unique pattern on the back that allows airflow to your back , which is helpful when walking around airports the carry handle is also aluminum reinforced so carrying the bag in hand is also a breeze i 've had my bag a few years and still looks as good as the day it came <unk> of the package would definitely buy again
i ca n't believe how quickly i received this backpack i received it # days after i ordered it it 's big enough to accomodate my # `` toshiba , my workout gear , water bottle and makeup it 's got a nice padded back for extra comfort , too
- fairly sleek protection , like many neoprene sleeves - price -lrb- mine was about $ # -rrb- cons - some of the stitching on the little trim bits is coming loose or just completely missed after only # weeks - i regret choosing a velcro closure it is a bit loud to open and creates uneven thickness where the flap doubles over zipper would be preferred
it does fit the macbook pro retina which is hard to find however , i was n't very pleased with the construction it was not well made and i do n't think it will last
the sleeve fits a # inch macbook pro very well , there is no room around the computer however , the sleeve itself is very thin more pricey alternatives will provide a significantly better protection this sleeve will protect from scratches and smaller objects
it 's a prefect fit for my # mbp it 's tight but that 's the way it 's supposed to be it is n't going to protect from big impacts but is perfect for protection while in a bag with other items it does smell a bit funny but i imagine that will go away with time
i was looking to buy an extra sleeve for my laptop and was totally expecting this product 's quality to match it 's cheap price however , i was pleasantly surprised as the sleeve is soft and seems to provide good protection for less than ten bucks i would n't say no , if you 're looking for a no-nonsense sleeve this one should fit the bill should fit almost any # `` laptop , i tested it out on my vintage # macbook pro and also a friend 's retina macbook pro this sleeve fit both of them snugly and does n't add too much extra bulk
i 'm happy i found this product , it was just what i was looking for i wanted something thin and <unk> for when i throw my laptop in a padded backback sleeve , just so it 's not completely bare if i want to pull it out and put it in another bag this is great , it fits the dimensions of my macbook pro perfectly it should provide protection from scratches and even a little shock absorption without much added bulk the way the seams come together on the sides even provides a little extra protection there , just what i want for storing it vertically in a backpack though if you 're looking to slide it into a messenger bag sleeve , it does add a little width to your laptop only # of an inch to each side but that was enough to make it too tight for me highly recommended if all you want is a simple neoprene sleeve that fits your macbook pro
use this sleeve when traveling with my # `` macbook pro the computer fits well within the sleeve without being too snug or too loose it is certainly a bargain compared to most other neoprene sleeves designed for the macbook
i really <unk> this & # # ; cover/sleeve ! , it 's just & # # ; so cool ! & # # ; i like it ! , it has this certain feel of security & comfort that just makes you want to leave the macbook in it whatever you 're looking for get this regardless ! i still have a hard cover on it from ipearl ! , but this you just ca n't beat the comfort it brings both of you -lrb- u & mac : -rrb- in addition
while i wish it were made of a little bit thicker material , it did a great job of protecting my new notebook computer until my new case arrived snug fit , soft interior , and easy to use
i thought that this laptop sleeve would fit snugly over my # . # inch laptop but it is actually rather loose i am not completely satisfied with the material either it is n't the nice squishy material of other laptop sleeves but more spongey
its alright , nothing fancy its more of a dust protecting sleeve ; no protection from falls or any hard impact for less than # bucks , its worth it if you need good protection , then look elsewhere
i have # & # # ; hp laptop and this fits really loosely onto my laptop the padding is nice i do n't like the velcro closure either as i have dogs and end up with lots of dog hair stuck in it
i just bought a chromebook to replace the old toshiba laptop i 've been <unk> for several years i needed something to store it in and protect it and this sleeve does the job the only downfall is that there is n't a pouch for you to store the cord in
the case is a bit too thick and makes it a little bulky to carry my # `` inch laptop is thin and the case is a bit big for it but over all its a good quality case for the price and it arrived sooner than expected
for # bucks , this is definitely a great little sleeve it 's a snug fit over my alienware # -lrb- # model -rrb- , but it does fit after a little bit of stretching definitely would recommend over the # dollar aw branded one it also fits an hp chromebook # , albeit very loosely it offers a little bit of extra padding while your laptop is <unk> in your bag overall , great product for the price
it is super soft and little stretchy to accommodate a variation of sizes i am currently using it for a # & # # ; portable monitor that fits when i stretch the top a little to meet the velcro
it is n't sturdy , but i do n't need it to be it has indents in the very insubstantial foam that lines the inside , just from being strapped into my backpack i have n't had that problem with previous cases it 'll do for now
for the price , one ca n't go wrong it arrived many days ahead of its shipment notification product is perfect for my dell # . # & # # ; laptop it does the job of protecting my new laptop , that 's why i gave it # stars the product uses velcro fastener i am not sure how the velcro would leave my laptop without scratches when i i put my laptop back in the sleeve i chose not to return it because of the price will probably be looking for another sleeve that offers my laptop more protection
i expected a little more padding for the price but whatever , it does what it needs to do i bought it to sew it into the lining of a backpack and it 's currently doing it 's job just fine the fabric has n't ripped yet
my laptop fits in it it 's nothing fancy it protects it from getting scratched or dusty not great for traveling , just good for storing in the home or as an additional layer if you can then place it in a portable bag
this is good coz it is exactly what it shows , except that the colour turns out a little darker it fits my # inch laptop w a little space left to put in my wireless mouse too
this is n't made of the <unk> materials , it doesnt hold its form the best , isnt the most form fitting notebook sleeve i 've seen however this is n't expensive , it gets the job done it stays shut and <unk> protects my laptop from the college laptop <unk> i am
it works great and fits in my backpack the only thing i would want is a pocket for the cord but definetly would recomend if you want something cheap that does the job
i am very happy with this case that i got i think it 's well worth the money and will do a very good job at protecting my laptop it will provide very good cushion and protection from being moved around in my backpack the velcro & # # ; sticks & # # ; very well i was worried that my hp pavilion dv # xxx would n't fit inside turns out it fits perfectly not too tight and not too loose : -rrb- oh , and it did n't smell weird when i took it out of the packaging , which is always a plus
i bought this nearly a year ago and the case still looks new after <unk> daily use the quality is high and none of the padding has diminished this is simply a scratch case though and would not protect a machine from a fall therefore , if you need something to protect your computer from any damage beside scratches , this is not the case for you
it arrived early and works really good . i just needed something to keep my laptop safe because laptop bags are too expensive right now . so this works great for
i got this to hold my <unk> # `` mobile monitor when i travel it 's a little big for the monitor , but it does the job the neoprene is n't firm , it feels more like a foam bag than anything else do n't expect this sleeve to protect your electronics from anything other than scratches of course i knew this going into my purchase so i 'm not deducting any stars
my backpack has a laptop divider in it , but not much padding this sleeve slides right in that space i just lift the lid to remove the laptop and the sleeve stays in the packpack the dimensions fit my inspiron # z , nicely
it did n't even fit my computer i double checked the specifications for size multiple times and it did n't fit my computer when it came then the company would n't let me return it
within two months the case had cracked while i was removing it -lrb- on the top panel -rrb- the edge of the bottom panel cracked from normal use -lrb- i have n't ever dropped it -rrb- the rubber feet all fell off within a few months pretty much garbage at this
my first time purchasing from kuzy and i did n't like the material it has a lot of marks and stains that i thought would come off when i cleaned it but it did n't
i purchased this cover for my macbook pro and within a # weeks of using it , the little rubber <unk> on the bottom of the cover already fell off my laptop only sits on a table , i never take it to class or anything so i do n't know why the rubber grips would come off there 's still one intact , but even with it , my laptop is sliding all over the place would 've been a nice case if the bottom grips were glued in with super weak glue want my money back or a replacement bottom case ! ! ! ! ! ! rip off , ca n't even use it because i 'm afraid my laptops gon na fall of the table
what a disappointment the case arrived quickly , and the fit is very snug but after one evening of use , i have removed the bottom half in favor of my old speck cover because the lower case attaches with two `` clips `` placed on the front , just to both sides of the trackpad that means my wrists rub over them constantly when trying to type or use the trackpad this is a very poor design choice my old speck case has its clips on the sides , leaving the front edge <unk> and comfortable i probably wo n't even bother returning it , because of the high shipping <unk> but please , consider whether ridges on the front of the case would be a problem for you
i have bought this item in february and the delivery was quick and it seemed to be a great product it fitted my macbook very well and the first few weeks it worked well so my initial feedback -lrb- which i was asked to give by kuzy shortly after delivery -rrb- was # stars however , after about # months the shell literally started to crumble it got cracks and parts just fell out this all happened while hardly moving the macbook , i mostly had it on my desk now , # months down the line , i need to replace the shell i am very disappointed
make sure you check the return policy because i clearly only ordered one of these and two came i had to pay to return the one and the first one had a few flaws in it
i was very disappointed i was so excited about this product i absolutely loved the color it looks like a tiffany blue i have an macbook pro # in i am very careful with my computer and it has never been dropped it is usually on my lap and not on a hard surface after # months , i noticed cracks in the corners it is falling apart it 's <unk> because i loved it up to this point
i was thrilled with it at first ... it fits well and is easy to put on it has n't caused any scratches or other damage to my computer and seems to have protected it well over its life the grips on the bottom are great as well however , i 'm a <unk> student and carry my laptop everywhere with me in a padded sleeve in addition to this case i put this case on in august and it was a couple of months before the front , bottom corners of it were cracked by march , i had to throw the bottom away because there were chunks coming off of those same corners of the bottom piece the cracks in this same area in addition to cracks that formed at the tabs holding the piece on began pinching my wrists and forearms while typing , so it had to go it 's a great case , i just wish it lasted longer for # bucks
im happy with the kuzy cover but the color is not true to what it shows on here , also shows hand prints and marks very easily this color packaging was simply plastic wrap , thought it could of quite easily been damaged or snapped on delivery
the color is exactly like the picture , which is definitely what i was hoping the only thing i wish i did n't have to deal with is the fact that is does n't always feel completely clipped onto my computer which was the reason i bought the case in the first place the bottom part had # black rubber knobs that immediately started coming off and causing my laptop to be unbalanced on a flat surface it does its job but the quality was disappointing
i bought this case for my macbook for what it cost , it 's a pretty decent case ; all the ports are cut out well my only issue is the keyboard cover did n't fit as nicely as i would 've hope , but i can live with it
the case fits well and seems to do its job , but beware that the pink colour is more of a salmon colour and not the baby pink that it appears to be in the picture
this really is neon yellow and the satin feel to the case makes it look and feel much more expensive than it is great product , only did not give it # stars because the bottom piece sometimes needs to be pushed back into place
i was very happy the way the product fits and how the apple logo lights up so well with this cover i color looks similar to the picture the only complaint i have is that it is so difficult to take off i was excited when i got my case , so i put it on immediately just to see if it would fit low and behold , when i tried taking it off , i thought my fingernails would come off anyways , i was able to get the top off after trying for the # th time just to wipe down the tap of my laptop and any fingerprints
so i just received the cover today , and boy is it wonderful the packaging was extremely <unk> , everything was tightly wrapped with plastic , and then put in a nice cardboard box the cover fits snugly on my macbook , and it 's the most gorgeous of <unk> so far it seems like a wonderful product i would recommend to everyone !
it 's such an awesome cover for being so cheap it came in with the little black feet on it <unk> but i took them off and put them back on correctly , they 've been fine since the case feels really nice and is a tight fit
the only reason it is not # stars is because i feel its not shock resistant enough for me i dj and need a heavier duty case . but for regular everyday use its
my kuzy case arrived today , and so far i love it it 's rubberized and feels amazing , and i love that the apple logo shines through it i was a little worried that the color would be off -lrb- after reading some reviews about the raspberry color -rrb- , and the raspberry is more of a wine color than the <unk> shown in the photo regardless , i think it is a really pretty color and it still goes with my pink keyboard cover overall , i am very satisfied with the case , but i think the photo should be updated to reflect the actual case color would -lrb- and probably will -rrb- buy it in other colors
this case turned out to be pretty good i just opened the package just a few minutes ago and put it on it fits perfectly except there are a few noticeable scrapes on the front , which i am not pleased about the color is a tiny bit darker than on the image but its a perfect color
i got this for my daughter and she really loves it the cover is hard rubber and she also got the rainbow keyboard for it it 's perfect for college as she takes it everywhere the color was exactly like it was shown you will live <unk> ! ! : -
i got this case for my sister in october when she got her macbook the case was thick and went on the mac well it also was a pain to get off , so that showed me that it would be on tight the little pads on the bottom stayed on the only thing was that the corners on the bottom piece was cracking she was n't doing anything that was forcing it in an abnormal position then after we noticed that , the bottom piece started to pop off sometimes her room is also in the basement , so i am not sure if the cold made the case do that or what also since this case is thick the apple logo is hard to see
i really like this product the color of this item is true to the picture and it 's pretty easy to snap onto the computer however , there were a couple of small scratches on the cover i got . . nothing worth complaining or worrying about , though the cover has a smooth texture to it -lrb- rubberized -rrb- and it looks very neat and polished i would recommend this to anyone who wants to protect their computer or add some color
i 've gone through # other cases since i got my computer they were both speck cases , and while i liked how they looked , they did not last very long this case seems sturdier , and the design allows you to tilt your computer back a bit more the clips that secure it onto the laptop are a little bit bigger , so it feels like they will stay on it is also vented more than the speck cases , so my computer does n't overheat the only thing i do n't like is how easily fingerprints show on the back i hate smudges , so i just wipe it down with an electronics cleaner
i am really happy with my kuzy red cover i especially dig the feel of it ! it shipped in a very timely manner and is working out great i highly recommend it to anyone looking to protect their mac
i really really like it works great and all and nice texture however it is quite cheap have had it for like # months and a small piece chipped already
this case is a perfect fit for my macbook pro and was super easy to snap on the color is pretty accurate to the picture as well and it has a nice rubbery finish hopefully its as durable as it looks
i like it , it seems to get the job done the one downside i would note is that it is really difficult to clean if something gets on it , even just from your hands , it seems the more you try to clean it , the more it smears
its a good case . purple is my favorite color so it was people clear i would get purple . i got it fast not really a long wait for it i snapped it on and it was easy and simple . . the only concern i have is that mine is dirty and has spots . how can i clean it ? ? ? other than that i love it
this tiffany blue case fits perfectly on my new macbook pro # ' the color is just as the picture shown , even the keyboard cover is a nice color , but the keyboard cover does n't fit well on the keys it 's kind of a disappointment because i was really looking forward to having a nice matching keyboard cover to go with it it will probably take some time to get used to the keyboard cover overall the delivery was very fast and arrived even before the delivery dates
the cover is just as i expected . i am not a fan of the keyboard cover . it looks nice , but makes it very difficult to type other than that , the shipping was fast and easy
this case is great it 's exactly the color that i wanted and it fits the description very well the only thing that i do n't like is how the back of the bottom part of the case does n't completely cover my laptop other than that the case is a great purchase
i love the color of this laptop cover . soooo pretty i ordered this cover in <unk> # and i just had to order another one because the sides have been breaking : -lrb- but this item is so cute i think its worth ordering another this time i ordered a laptop sleeve so i have extra padding and hopefully this cover will last longer also , i bought the keyboard cover which is still in good condition although the d key has rubbed the color off and the black is sticking through it other than the wear and tear i recommend this product as long as your okay with knowing , that one day it will probably break . \ p.s i 'm using my boyfriends account so this review is n't by a guy in case any one is curious
it is n't completely clear like i was expecting but it did n't have any scratches and fits perfectly its thick plastic and i think that it 'll protect the laptop well and ultimately thats its job the shipping was extremely fast
just bought this case for my macbook pro # . # & # # ; and i love it its true to color - has that nice tiffany blue look i was a bit concerned with some of the reviews i had seen on youtube , but i ended up ordering it and i have no regrets i was a bit <unk> about the ` rubberized ' part , its not like the silicone on a phone case it just has a softer feel but a hard underlying body to protect your mac the fit is snug and i have <unk> to all my ports i 've never purchased a speck case or one of the well known brands but for # $ this is a great buy
it works well for its function , to protect your macbook . it 's different from my last case from ipearl this case seems like it will last me a lot longer my ipearl case i owned , the snaps that held the case to the mac broke off
i 've always wanted a yellow macbook pro cover , but speck -lrb- the only brand i trust -rrb- did n't make one for a # & # # ; so i ended up having to find one on amazon , and i found this the color is just like expected it is firm and sturdy it was a little hard to attach the bottom covering , but you 'll figure it out - the & # # ; shoulder & # # ; portion of the bottom of the mac is the only part that does n't have covering it feels kinda naked but it 's not a big deal
overall i 'm really happy with the case and i love the color , but it chipped on the side within three days of putting it on my macbook ! it sticks to surfaces well though , and i 'm hoping that was just a weird , rare mishap
i love purple before , i had the clear one , but i actually did n't realize that i got the rubberized one i like it , but fingerprints are really noticeable the corners have chipped , but maybe that means i just have to be more careful with my laptop
i got this case in red about a year ago and it served me very well and i had no complaints until about a month ago and it started to get major cracks because of this i decided to get this case again in blue and i hope this one lasts another year <unk> to get <unk> <unk> to all <unk> cracked after about a <unk> not cover back corners <unk> line this is a amazing case for the price at $ # . # right now and i recommend to anyone looking for a quality case on a tight
i really like my kuzy case i just wish the back was covered as well but it just snapped right on and easy to take off it really keeps the dirt out too
i love the color and the way that this product fits my macbook pro it snugly holds the corners and edges so i feel like my macbook is very protected the product is working just the way it was intended to and is so far meeting all expectations i held for it
i had a speck case on my macbook before this one i ended up selling it to a friend i could n't help but question this case because it was so much cheaper than the speck case -lrb- $ # -rrb- i was very impressed it is a great case that fits snug , and you ca n't beat the price i definitely recommend it
i absolutely loved the color and the top part was a perfect fit but the bottom half was not , this is why i gave it four stars , the bottoms is kinda loose but it 's doable , other then that i love it
i love the color and lightweight composition , it arrived quickly and well packed i have found it to <unk> ad strong . i love it sometimes if i grab it wrong it pops off , but not
kuzy cover is significantly cheaper than say a speck cover - and does a pretty comparable job have had it for a couple months now , all i see are some slight hairline cracks near a corner and clip-on others ' speck covers have broken by now color is great does n't cover any ports and seems made for # & # # ; macbook only real complaint is the sticky feet on the bottom keep falling off and have lost their ability to stay on the cover which is annoying otherwise , good product
thought there would be no logo but there actually is also it fits perfectly but the edges have cracks all over and does n't look quite clean though i chose this only because it was colorless and transparent and with this price , i think it 's not a bad deal however there are some downs -lrb- such as the cracks -rrb- with this price , again , it is not a bad deal compare to other rubber cases
i bought this case when i got my new macbook pro because i wanted to protect the outside from any scratches the turquoise color is just how it looks in the picture it protects the computer well the one downfall of the case is mine has cracked on both corners on the bottom piece i have never dropped my computer for it to start cracking so that is frustrating other than that , it is a great case
overall , this is a great little hard case and it 's shown no signs of wear or tear after a few months use however , the color that appeared is more of an aqua color -lrb- still a nice shade -rrb- and the clasps on the edges that clip over your laptop are prone to slipping a bit
i absolutely love the color of my case the only downside to it is that it dirties very easily i took my mac to the apple store and the <unk> had such dirty hands and left brown prints all over it i tried cleaning it with a baby wipe but i do n't want to ruin the color otherwise , the case is great just make sure your hands are clean and you do n't store it in areas where it can get dirty
i love the case it is a wonderful blue green color , but the keyboard is a different color and is slightly off they are both cute but the case is more green and the key board is more tiffany blue
good price for a nice , functional case the color is pretty too i <unk> a bit putting on bottom piece , but only because i did n't notice the small tabs that needed to be in place first the only small issue i have -lrb- why i did n't give it five stars -rrb- is that there are two small tabs on the bottom piece that are exactly where i my wrists are when i am typing they are a bit irritating a previous reviewer mentioned this too it would n't stop me from buying it , but when typing long papers , i may remove the bottom cover it they bother me too much
some people are complaining about quality or that it doesnt fit etc etc . wah wah wah , i wonder if they want cheese and <unk> with all that <unk> personally i installed this one a macbook pro # `` # and it fits like a glove the lower side has vents which is perfect for ventilation since it can get hot when plugged in all in all i think it rocks for the price and have ordered a second one for a friend i will say it is not perfect and the lower corners by the screen could have used better fitment <unk> for the price i wont complain i simply love it and it make my macbook pro pop while protecting it it is a <unk> of a hard plastic material with a rubber feel to it , very soothing on the fingertips # stars cause of the minor corner issues , we cant overlook that no matter how nice it looks and feels if it were not for that i would have given it # stars all the way
i purchased the mint green , love , love , love it ! ! ! ! ! ! it is matte and def protects my macbook pro since i have dropped it and have no scratches or dents i even bought my boyfriend one in another color
i love everything about this case it came in pristine condition and exactly as i ordered it it fits my macbook pro beautifully , snaps on and off with ease , and looks great i 'm extremely pleased with this product :
the cover looks exactly like the picture it was easy to put on just line it up with the laptop & make sure you hear a snap to know if its properly on there also , when putting the cover on the back of the screen make sure the kuzy logo is on the bottom other than that you 'll have no idea which way it goes like me lol i would consider the outside of the cover rubberized even though the inside of the cover has this smooth plastic feel
i purchased this kuzy hard case cover to protect my new macbook pro with retina display i was a little apprehensive at first , because i could not find any cases to fit the new macbooks , but this case fits so well i love the color and its durability i definitely will be purchasing more cases by kuzy
my mom has always gotten kuzy cases for her macbook air , and whenever i 'm back home , i 'm always reminded how much i like hers so ... i finally got one of my own i 've had many cases for my macbook pro , and they were either leather , or totally plastic i like this because even though it is plastic , the rubberized satin cover over the plastic makes it look and feel much better . hard to go wrong with these cases has vents on the bottom so it does n't overheat , clips in perfectly , color is true -lrb- i got a tiffany <unk> pretty -rrb- and it 's easy to keep clean kuzy really is the best brand for macbook covers for the price . would n't recommend anything else
i 'm not sure why some other kuzy cases received mediocre reviews ... this serves its purpose ! it also fits just like it should some argue that it 's hard to put on , but i did n't find any issues
im very skeptical about ordering these kinds of things over the internet , in most cases i would rather just go spend the retail amount at the apple store -lrb- $ # + -rrb- i took a chance and i am completely satisfied ! i love my new case and absolutely love the color : -rrb- it fits perfectly over my macbook i 'm very happy with my # $ purchase
i ordered this case for my macbook pro and it looks great on it i read reviews on how it doesnt look raspberry pink and they are correct i would say more of a raspberry <unk> wine color ... more red then pink but i still love it and it feels great and fits snug i would order again thanks kuzy ! !
i first saw this product on one of my patient 's parents macbook pro and from there i fell in love the color is not for the color shy it is bold and vibrant and demands attention the cover fits like a glove on my macbook pro allowing it to easily slide into the neoprene case i use to tote my laptop to and from school i am very satisfied with my purchase and would recommend it to anyone looking to make a bold statement with this <unk> orange cover
