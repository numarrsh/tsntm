the targus military messenger bag is really good it is light , and still protects my # . # `` mac pro it has a separate padded laptop section plenty of room in the main compartment for a few books , cords , a newspaper or magazine it works well as a lightweight water resistant casual bag for carrying a full days worth of work , school or entertainment
this is a very well-made backpack that i use when i am transporting my computer - but also just to take back and forth to work lots of pockets - plenty of protection for your laptop - a quality product
i 've used this backpack for a good # years , and i love the design , but only recently has it begun to rip around the top of the main pocket , possibly due to carrying heavy textbooks this backpack is awesome , but it does n't seem that long-lasting , so be weary of that
this is a well made bag and well thought out design the computer is on the opposite side from a & # # ; briefcase & # # ; compartment i use this for teaching and the other bags i had were less easy to organize and find things in construction is solid and it looks different from all the plain black computer bags which i like
like the other reviewers , i was really impressed with this backpack i served in the military for # years and have had any number of commercial backpacks i love it sturdy , light , plenty of compartments probably best for middle school and high school boys by the way , the image on this particular page is not that of the backpack most of the images that refer to this item are correct , but the big image at the top right now is a `` briefcase `` like item , and not the backpack be assured , you will be ordering a backpack if you order this item
i bought this for my hp envy # beats edition and its a perfect fit it looks great , has a super soft interior in the laptop sleeve which is spacious enough to hold any laptop you might find and a folder or a book or two even and then it has its other zippered pockets as well which provides you pretty much all the carrying space you 'll likely need and its yet to get a tear , fray , or rip anywhere on it for me even with how rough i treat my equipment beautiful design , sturdy , and spacious all for a really affordable price this backpack has a whole heck of win in it <unk> i highly suggest it
i spent a ton of time researching bags for laptops i carry a # `` laptop and a # `` laptop for work and this fits both of them with tons of space to go i 've always used the `` swiss `` model backpacks in the past and have had nothing but trouble with their zippers this is a very good bag for a great price
i recieved this product quickly and am very pleased the company even sent it in a flat rate box that saved me money on shipping costs although the backpack had to be folded and crammed into the box it wasnt damaged or anything i do believe the color shown in the picture is slightly brighter than the physical backpack actually is but i really like the darker green color i have a # . # inch laptop and was worried it wouldnt fit until i tried it there is enough room for an # inch laptop haha there is plenty of space for everything i need very very satisfied with this product and will recommend it to others
this bag looks great , holds nicely through rain and shine , and has n't shown any sign of wear and tear after daily use for over a year ca n't go wrong at the low price and with the high quality construction
this is a nice , sturdy well made backpack it has a well padded backside for comfort when carry around a lap top we made the mistake previously of traveling with a regular backpack with a lap top inside and the result was a lot of getting <unk> in the back by metal corners and <unk> over who would carry the pack so now we wo n't have that issue any more the green outer material is made of polyester so it seems like it will be water resistant , if not water proof however is has n't rained since we have been using is so we have not been able to test this out yet i 'm not entirely sure why it is called a military backpack other than its color however it has an attractive appearance so it would be a good accessory for either someone with a military interest or just your average lap top user
i rated this low because of the simple fact that the picture is not what the bag looks like there is fairly large print across the front that says <unk> lifestyle how hard is it to just post a picture of the actual bag so i know what i am getting , after all i am paying honest money for it , so post an honest picture so if you are expecting the bag to look like this when you get it , well your in for a surprise as far as the quality , well it seems to be really good otherwise i would have rated it a # star
this did n't even occur to me while choosing the bag ... but there is no handle on the top so to just pick it up and move it akward you have to grab the whole strap <unk> then that , it 's a great bag
this case is beautiful and has plenty of storage space for accessories but i found it to be a little awkward to use the flap over the front is a little cumbersome i had ordered another case to compare the two and wound up keeping the other one
bought this for my wife it looks feminine yet is still formal enough for a business environment she loves it plenty of padding for the laptop only two small pouches on the front -lrb- under the flap -rrb- so there is n't a whole lot of other storage capacity it works well to hold her # & # # ; laptop a few pens , cell , phone , and a some files all she really needs
the item shipped very quickly and was found to be exactly as advertised i bought this for my daughter to use for school and she loves it great storage space with a nice thick shoulder strap the only negative , is that she found you can not remove the inner <unk> meant to protect a laptop she will only be toting books so having that divider removeable would be a bonus i 'd recommend this buy for sure
i was not disappointed with this bag at all i have no problem fitting my laptop , kindle , a couple of books and all my cords needed for everything i like the compartments for pens , cell phone , etc . great bag at a great price
i used this as a carryon for my laptop and lots of other stuff it fit under the seat well and held my # & # # ; hp pavilion laptop perfectly had room for power cords , an ipad with cords , a couple of books , magazines , and some misc other things the strap is comfortable to carry love this product
this bag is light weight , weather resistant -lrb- especially in rain -rrb- , roomy it holds my surface pro , various cords & accessories including a wd ultra ext hdd and various folders or even my lunch it is easy to carry -lrb- either shoulder or cross body -rrb- i love that there is no added weight to the weight of the things you carry and the bag is beautiful
the bag is beautifully colored exactly as shown the shoulder strap is quite comfortable and the padding inside is more than sufficient it fits my personal and work laptop beautifully with plenty of protection the bag is easy to gain access to with the flip top opening , even when on the move i like the <unk> of the strap so it can be worn cross body or over the shoulder i 've had other laptop bags that were far more expensive and did not suit my needs anywhere near as well i could not be more satisfied with this purchase
it is beautiful , well constructed , and sturdy my daughter has it slung over her shoulder while walking and bike riding to the local library i would highly <unk> this bag and would purchase again
i made sure to measure my laptop before purchasing this bag , luckily it was the perfect size the padded pocket is amazing , snug and the velcro strap is very nice , prevents my laptop from slipping out unexpectedly i love the extra space and the outside pockets this bag was made very well , the strap on the inside is textured so it does n't slip off your shoulder , nice touch there 's nothing worse than watching your laptop slip to the ground . * <unk> * i love the pattern on the front of the bag too overall i think this bag is great , and i would recommend this bag or any others from this company to others i use it for school , so it 's perfect i hope everyone else is as pleased as i am
gave this to my sister as a gift for christmas it fit her # inches laptop it is a bit tight but once it is in , it is securely protected she loves the shoulder straps very much she said that it is very soft and comfortable and she might just use it as a book bag to school too
too many loose stitches by the third use the lining was coming away and fraying the bag came with about # places where the end of the sewing was not tied off and the thread became exposed
the finishing was not there at all there was glue all over the stitches there was a cut on one spot and the liner was so see through that you could see the unfinished material under very disappointed for the price i paid i bought a red <unk> handbag for the same brand and it was # times better in quality and finishing overall , very disappointed
the only reason i did not give this bag # stars is that the <unk> where not listed in the discription of the bag and my laptop barely fits but it does fit and i love , love , love this back pack it is very sturdy and well made and i know i will use it for years to come there are a lot of pockets and compartments on the inside and out if you are going to buy a laptop back pack and invest in a good one i recomend this one my laptop is # inch screen so anything bigger wont fit this bag
i bought this as a christmas gift and was not sure how the color would turn out i thought it might be too neon , but it was a beautiful almost <unk> green rather than completely neon like i had mentioned it was a christmas gift and the person i bought it for seems to like it and is using it
for the price you ca n't beat this bag it 's <unk> bag also fits smaller sizes it comes with a <unk> for your charger you ca n't beat the price overall satisfied just wish they 'd stick t <unk> they say as far as the cleaning
had to search all over for a messenger bag style laptop case that actually fit my laptop this one is great and recently brought it on a trip out of state since you can open it `` butterfly style `` it made getting through airport security a breeze while everyone else had to take their laptops out of their cases to go into bins
i bought a pink one for myself a while back and i was so pleased with it , i bought my dad one he loves it and takes it everywhere i wish they had a darker blue one or a more manly colored one but it does the job great case overall my friend even like it so much she purchased one for herself
this is an excellent laptop bag has plenty of room for all your accessories , manuals and cords this bag even has room to throw your wallet , cell & keys so you can condense great quality <unk> durable a must have
recieved it today for my girlfriend the only issue we have with it , is the front pouch the velcro does n't match up and it 's hard to close besides that it 's exactly how it 's show
i bought this laptop case for a christmas gift for my mother she has a larger laptop and this was the only case/bag that i could find to fit the laptop she seems to be pleased with both the color and the quality of the bag ; i would recommend this item to others
i liked these so well i bought # it fits a # . # laptop nice and snug with storage areas for your peripherals if you want something affordable and well made this is it i was amazed at this case compared to all the ones i saw for $ # more at the real stores i did n't get the cloth but who cares the color is a bit brighter than the picture but not gaudy this is a deal
i am very <unk> with this purchase it was a christmas gift along with an ipad # for my husband the stand worked for half a day ! ! ! soon it would not adjust to various positions and slips off ... save ur money buy something else
this is my third kickstand the first two were primarily metal construction , one has worked very well for about three years , the other , also three years old , failed recently so i ordered a replacement from amazon my first impression of the new one was that it was exactly the same unit as my prior one as i opened it , i realized it was n't even close it does not open smoothly , the little computer rest legs appear to be plastic waiting to break i love the design of the stand and the ability to fold it for travel i wish they would have produced a better quality product
really sturdy & heavy duty & good for kitchen cooking like a book stand but seriously we never use it . just lay it on the counter or prop up with legs or hands if you are hands-free type something built in wold be <unk>
i bought this for my mom 's gtablet the gtablet is approximately # . # pounds this stand did not hold the tablet sturdy enough if on a slick table , the weight of the tablet could often move the stand thus , she had to put the stand on something which would n't slip even if she managed to do that , since she would frequently have to touch the tablet 's screen , often that would be enough to move the tablet this stand is just collecting dust at the moment as i have now found a case to better hold the tablet
i <unk> to this product from a previous purchase the first time i bought it , this product had a black circle instead of a grey one -lrb- and still shows black on my previous order page -rrb- the difference is more than just color , though the `` new `` version is made completely of plastic and is a lot more flimsy than the original the original -lrb- black circle -rrb- had metal parts , which made it heavier but sturdier i find it strange that amazon treats them as the same , when they are clearly very different i recommend <unk> the one with the black circle and metal parts instead
i did a lot of research on the type of stand i wanted for my new tablet , and this was the stand i chose i found it very versatile , and very sturdy , well worth the money , light-weight and easy to pack for travel
this stand is awesome it fits easily closed and tucked away until it 's ready to be used then , pop it out and voila , the perfect travel stand for your ipad i do a lot of <unk> for my <unk> business -lsb- ... -rsb- using it and i can angle the ipad for the audience i 'm <unk> to i can also set it up quickly and put it away quickly and easly when done the four stars -lrb- instead of five -rrb- are for two reasons it 's a little heavy nice from a quality stand point , but just a little heavier than i 'd like to have as one of <unk> items i pack when flying -lrb- it all adds up right ? -rrb- # . the little fold out legs that <unk> the ipad could have been # inch longer to support the ipad when it 's in a thicker -lrb- speck hard <unk> -rrb- case it will hold it with the case on but the extra length would give me a little more confidence
i actually use this to elevate my macbook and bring the the screen closer to eye level helps me <unk> less there is a store called relax the back , all about good posture & ergonomics , that sells this for twice the price and it does n't even come with a fancy carrying pouch like this one
have had this stand a few months i do n't think i paid this much for it , which seems a bit on the high end when comparing it to other options if you 're looking for portability though , it still may be worth the price to you folds up nicely and is lightweight , yet sturdy you can adjust it at different angles , which is a nice touch actually , just about everything on this stand is adjustable , so it will work with your ereader or a table other than ipad , if that is what you 're looking for
compact when folded , a snap to set up and nice looking to boot one note ... if you want to keep this on a narrow shelf and use it as a tablet easel , it does have a bit of a large footprint in order to set the stand with enough of an angle to hold a tablet without risk of it falling forward off the stand , you 'll need an <unk> shelf depth of at least #
thought i would use this for the ipad more often ... kind of cumbersome to carry around it holds very nicely though ... could see a real benefit for a laptop if you have the need for
the only complaint is that is is a bit bulky , but is smaller than some of the other stands adjusting the angle is the best feature the legs that the ipad sits on seem cheap but we will see how they last
there were a few stability problems when it is folded up it wiggles around , however while in the bag those issues are ignored it works great for my ipad and # inch macbook pro i might even buy another one to fit both of them at the same time its really nice for the ipad to have it in vertical and horizontal
i got this so that i could carry it around with my ipad , it works great and is very portable since it folds up it has a decent weight to it so it feels pretty sturdy when its closed it seems to ` wobble ' a bit left and right , but i have n't notice it get any worse overall i would definitely recommend this
product serves its purpose it works great for watching videos and reading i bought it for my kindle fire however i did have to do some maintenance on it when i received it just a little super glue fixed it right up but for the price , i could n't expect more
this stand works very well with my acer iconia a # tablet i like the fact that the stand can be adjusted to a wide variety of angles , and the fold-out feet are long enough that it supports the tablet while still in the case it folds up very easily for storage or travel
this is one the best adjustable stands for my ipad and for my hp touchpad the white color looks beautiful with the white ipad but best of all it also folds up compactly for storage or to be carried with you i used to have a tough time holding my tablets but this particular stand makes the viewing angle so adjustable and comfortable that i really have come to love using my tablets even more i did have an apple front <unk> already for the ipad but the angle is so low that i totally prefer this stand at the bottom of the two legs that hold the tablet , # little grabbing tabs come out to hold on to the tablet the price is really very reasonable for an item engineered so well very highly recommended
a very sturdy piece w/o any sharp edges , which is very important to me because i know my # year old daughter will try to grab it and play with it does what it 's supposed to do at a reasonable price i 'm happy with the product
i researched other models i thought i had settled on one , but then something just told me to buy this one i do not regret the decision at all i really like this stand it is durable , i can leave my <unk> # ipad # cover on , and the ipad still fits comfortably on the stand i can also leave the ipad # plugged in while on the stand without having to turn it upside down the pictures do not show it , but the stand does have a setting that places it on a small incline for typing information comfortably into the ipad yes , this product is heavy , but i see this as a positive because there are metal parts , improving the durability and stability of the stand i most certainly purchase this stand again , if i needed another one
the measurements advertised are to tight in reality it is not <unk> leather , it is a kind of <unk> ; the problem is that it <unk> without any protective coat and get stains with <unk> including
this backpack is very <unk> i carried it as my carrying when i went on vacation last month it also good for everyday use if you have to carry a lot of stuff around with you what i do n't like is the <unk> they 're very hard and dig into your arms they need to have some padding because it takes leather a while to become pliable
i purchased this as a christmas present for my wife she likes the leather and all of the zippers work she wanted a bag that was big enough to hold all of her electronics and other stuff in she loves it
i 'm incredibly pleased with this backpack it 's wider and shorter than others , but fit my # inch laptop just fine , with lots of room - enough for a bit of clothes for a weekend away it 's sturdy and comfortable to carry my only complaint is that the metal tabs on the zippers -lrb- the pull tabs -rrb- sort of <unk> when i walk it 's a very attractive and well-made bag and i expect it to last years and years
i absolutely love this bag it looks even better than in the picture sure $ # is a bit pricey for a backpack , but the genuine distressed leather and durable spacious craftsmanship is really worth every penny i can not only fit several textbooks , notebooks , binder , and laptop , but the large side pockets even let me keep snacks for on the go <unk> between classes i do have to say that it is a little wider than most backpacks , but not wide enough to look odd or overwhelming i recommend this bag to anyone looking for a great leather backpack that will last them a while
i have a # -inch macbook pro and this item did not even come close to fitting my laptop i do n't know what they are measuring , but the shell was way too big i received a refund on the order , but i had to pay $ # to ship it back to the seller
i was sent the wrong size in this case , and when it arrived the box was crushed along with it cracking the case inside and it had scratches all over i was told i would have to pay to have it returned
nothing special about this case it protects your laptop from getting scratched price too high for a simple case hope there will be more color choices like the cases for # `` and # `` macs
i purchased this # month ago in november # , right after i bought the last mbp # `` first , the biggest benefit is that you can maintain the original look and feel of the mac since it 's see through , it almost feels like you have no case at all and second , it 's so easy to put on , and take out for dust cleaning that i only did twice it just clips on and off , hassle free strongly recommend if you are looking for a case to prevent scratches yet want to add nothing to the integrity of mbp aesthetic
i have put this on the mac and never looked back some say you should remove it periodically and clean underneath but i have not i do not think any scratching is going on under there so i am going to leave it alone i do not remember any difficulties in installing this cover set i am very , very pleased with it
i knew i wanted to have a case for my laptop to protect it and i did n't really want to lose the stainless look this case has been wonderful it protects the laptop and i still kept the stainless look as it is
my family has many laptop computers which get a lot of use and are `` traded `` amongst us , then they are eventually <unk> when we get a new one , we immediately put a spek cover on it and when it 's time for it to `` move on `` to the next owner , it looks brand new we can get top dollar for our very used -lrb- but not abused -rrb- laptops thanks to spek ! one of my sons was in the military ; he took his laptop on deployment to iraq when he got back , the `` <unk> `` needed some repair when we took it in to the shop , they could n't believe it had been to war , they thought it was brand new , thanks to the spek cover he had on it !
i waited for my mac cover to come and it turned out to be a red hard cover for a # `` macbook i would n't order from this seller again amazon did take it back and refund me with no issues , but that does n't excuse the nonsense this seller is pulling
i was very excited to received this product it is visually nice however , it arrived to me with a broken corner i notified the seller and <unk> did n't respond to my request unfortunately , there are not many products out there for # ``
one of the few cases for the # incher wish it came in other colors but overall the quality feels good only thing is , when you put the bottom piece on the computer gets super hot i only use the top piece
satisfied with this product there 's nothing special about it , it serves it 's purpose it 's hard , it stays on , does n't move around and it 's not too bulky i would recommend this to anyone who 's looking to purchase a new notebook case
i got this case along with a used macbook pro # `` -lrb- early # -rrb- i bought last week it looks good , fits well and is easy to put on/take off the only beef i have with it are the clips used to attach the bottom case to the mac , they 're in exactly the wrong place for my normal typing position and they 're sharp i 'm thinking i 'll take the case off and lightly round the edges of the clips with some # grit sandpaper to see if i can fix it other than that it 's a nice case
being new to macbook 's i did n't realize that there was that big a difference between the unibody and non-unibody macbook pro # 's - they are both aluminum apparently the difference is big enough that this did not fit my pre-unibody -lrb- <unk> # -rrb- pro # at all - had to return it that being said , it looked like a good case so i gave it three stars , but make sure you have the correct kind of aluminum macbook pro #
this package was shipped extremely quickly and arrived the next business day when i payed for standard shipping the top piece is a little wobbly in the back but it is fine , its stays on , # it looks and seems great the reason i give this a # is because it came with some marks on it but that is <unk> will post a full review on
it is a nice case , a little bit fragile , the material can be scratched very easily but it is elegant and convenient the product arrived in time , very well packaged and in perfect condition
i accidentally purchased the wrong size case for my computer they were very accommodating and allowed me to return the incorrect case in exchange for the right one they sent the replacement fairly quickly as well the case is easy to install , though one corner does n't quite clip in right -lrb- that might be an error on my part -rrb- it 's great for the money as well
worked so well , i bought another one this clicks onto my unibody macbook pro # `` and provides more protection than the tape i was using , and looks nicer it does add some thickness to the laptop , but not much the bottom also sags , but is n't much of a problem i do n't believe i 've had many <unk> issues with the case on now i can cover it with star trek stickers like the cool kids
i like it i just do n't like the price i had to pay for it for what it is you know you are so wrong all i have to say you really got
i really like this product it protects , looks nice , and seems pretty durable my only complaint is the cover wraps around the corner located next to the power supply , preventing you from plugging in the power supply correctly if you want the cord to wrap around the back of the computer , you have to plug it up with the cord coming towards you and then bend it back the other way not a super big deal , just a little inconvenient
i received my black speck macbookpro # `` snap case today the case is sharp looking , fits very well and seems to provide good protection against scratches and dents i wish i had gotten one sooner it is not however a replacement for proper padded protection if you are using this in conjunction with an actual lap top case then it will be enough if you are throwing it loose in a backpack or messenger bag/briefcase not specifically designed to cradle your laptop , you will need a sleeve i also purchased a black incipio denver padded <unk> for my macbook pro with the speck hardshell on my computer , the fit is tight in the incipio sleeve , but works well just a heads up to anyone who is considering both products like i did macbook pro # -inch <unk> - denver nylon sleeve -
it is perfect fit for my mac # `` i love <unk> products see thru satin hard shell case for # -inch macbook aluminum <unk> keyboard mb # <unk> -lrb- black -rrb- - does not fit white
this case fits my macbook pro # perfectly , and the satin finish gives me a better grip on my laptop it 's a sleek look that does n't cover any of the ports and really dresses up my mac
this case is the best it adds a clean , professional look to the laptop and i love the satin finish it makes it much easier to hold on to when carrying it also adds a bit of <unk> to the machine which really helps if you travel often oh ! , did i mention how cool the apple logo looks shining through the <unk> cover
product when on easy so far so good just got in the mail this afternoon . looks awesome and feels great should keep from harming my expensive macbook pro . the apple light shines thru when you open the laptop
this is the second case i have purchased the first was a clear speck case for another # inch macbook pro i had the unfortunate experience of needing to leave my first macbbook at an apple store to have them replace a failing hard drive they would not accept the laptop with the speck case to have the card replaced when i came back to pick it up my computer the aluminum shell had # big scratches in it they did order a replacement aluminum shell at no cost to me , but this was proof once again why you need the protection of a speck case ! ! when your laptop is on you will still see the apple logo nicely through the speck case they are easy to take on and off and simply a must if you want to keep your expensive laptop looking like new
this is an excellent case for protecting your mac but the main reason i got this in black was to disguise it i did n't want to be sitting around with a glaring # & # # ; macbook with its lit up apple logo so now it looks like any other <unk> pc and not a target
i am very happy with this cover , it does n't leave any marks or residue on your computer , it is sturdy and has kept my computer safe from multiple scratches from metal objects
thanks for the case it works fine i use it everyday and it was worth the price slightly dirty when i got it but it ended up getting <unk> the more i used it so that was fine
this cover fits perfect ... looks great ... feels great yes , if you drop you laptop it will break ... do n't drop your laptop this is not meant to be an armor cover but scratch protection with a great look and feel it works to that end better than anything i 've seen out there highly recommended ... makes you 're laptop look special also ... love that
ease of install was great does add a little bit of weight but hey overall this product is great not too mention how much money i saved buying it through amazon instead of the apple site
when i was looking this up , i wasnt sure if it was gon na be really bulky and i kind of wanted to keep the apple logo showing on the back of the screen well , i took a chance and decided to order it price isnt bad got it in just a while ago and its great it hugs the body of the macbook pro just right , it doesnt make it feel too bulky the feel is great , that `` satin `` feel they have on the description of the product is just right and you can see the apple logo so all in all i got what i was looking for only bad thing was the shipping time , i thought it took longer than it should
the cover fit my # `` macpro like a glove also got one for the wife 's # `` macpro they look great , and all ports are open so you can get to them easy i got them to help the cover from getting scratch they will not save the computer from a drop
the fit is superb i ca n't rate anything else now but i will update asap i want to know : -lrb- # -rrb- how durable -lrb- # -rrb- does it scratch my mbp -lrb- # -rrb- does it make the laptop hotter <unk> update ****** works super ! ! -lrb- # -rrb- has n't broken yet -lrb- # -rrb- not enough movement in with the case to cause scuffs in the mac -lrb- # -rrb- no heat problems i play a few games such as the demanding sc # the game is so demanding that while playing the battery actually <unk> while it is plugged in ! no heat build up
adds considerable bulk for my mbp , but the extra protection is worth it i carry my # `` mbp in a # `` swiss army slim case and this adds just enough bulk to the notebook to make a snug fit
great purchase , fits perfectly no problems with purchase or product ! ! yay too many words for the minimum review if this is the case now i 'm not gon na leave reviews in the
the carrying case itself is great quality but the case does not fit a # & # # ; laptop very well i have two different hp laptops -lrb- both pretty slim -rrb- and its a struggle to get either in i would not recommend this bag to store a # & # # ; laptop in
i bought this case for my husband 's # `` laptop that he takes everywhere for business unfortunately , we 've only had it for a month and the zipper has already broke as well as the seams are starting to come unraveled not to mention that the <unk> on the case is not very thick giving us concerns that it has any sort of protection for the laptop that it 's carrying we ended up throwing the inland case away and ordering a built brand neoprene laptop case - much thicker and sturdier
the bag barely fit my # . # laptop and when held by the bag 's handles it seems like the stitching is about to let the handles go i am not sure how hard was it to make a sturdy bag but this bad is not
product comes with a net sewn into the inside of the case , right at the bottom that prevents a # . # inch laptop from sliding all the way inside once this was removed , the laptop slid in fine the net is about three inches tall and fits way too loosely inside the bag , so it would never really hold anything as far as i can see its only purpose is to get in the way easy fix , i turned the bag inside out and tore it out now the laptop fits fine
the bag for some reason has a net divider in the bottom where the <unk> supposed to go computer gets tangled in it and it is a struggle to just put the computer in an option would be to cut the net divider out which serves no function otherwise it is a very cheaply made bag , so you are not getting a bargain if i had to do it again , i would spend a few dollars and get something better on the plus side , the powersupply fits in the front pocket and it gives minimal protection to the laptop
sleeve fits my # . # inch screen gateway nv with a tiny amount of room to spare the external zipper pocket is more than large enough to fit a power cord or mouse foam padding is not terribly thick or thin , so it should provide an average amount of protection for a cheaper laptop sleeve seems like it 's of good quality , and the bag comes at a very reasonable price
i like this notebook sleeve it fits my hp computer just right i am happy with this purchase i would recommend this to anyone looking for a carry case cover for a # . # computer i like that it has an outside pocket as well
we wanted something sleeve like that had some pockets and handles we did n't want to have to put our sleeve in another bulky bag , just something light and easy so my husband could take it back and forth to work this is perfect the pocket is big enough for the wireless mouse and charger
