i 've had this case for # weeks , and in normal transportation , the four corners snapped off and the case does not work anymore i am disappointed that even though it 's a low price , it broke very easily
the case looks nice , and it almost fitted perfectly on my mac air # & # # ; the bottom case was a bit stretched , it 's not a perfect fit i had the top cover put in wrong the first time , and it was very difficult to take the case out i hope i do n't have to take this case off in the future , unless i have to break it or something just to take it off
originally , i was sent a case that did not properly fit my # air , but after writing a critical review , the company insisted they send me a new product i had it in # days and it 's excellent for only $ # i 've already put decals on and decorated my shell and i get a ton of compliments the customer service was outstanding and i will definitely order again
the ipad cover looked pretty good and shipment was prompt i must have ordered incorrectly though as it was a <unk> for my i pad air i did n't realize that the ipad air was not quite as large as the regular sized ones the <unk> me asking of my problem and <unk> the situation to my satisfaction they are a fantastic company to <unk> as they really care about their customers ! i would not hesitate to order anything from them again and would like to recommend them to everyone it 's a # star <unk> in my opinion . : -
i love this case , i took a risk on ordering this case since there was only one review albeit a positive review the case arrived quickly for me and fits the case perfectly it seems more sturdy than the speck case i had on it previously that cracked for a third party case to be better quality than a case apple tries to <unk> to everyone is rather impressive i would highly recommend this case to anyone i know with a mac it has a great price its ultra sturdy and well made
this case is exactly what i saw in the brand name store the cost is reasonable it works ! -lrb- i use my computer in a <unk> class room and having a functional protector is important .
not as substantial as i expected it to be might protect from scratches , but it wo n't protect it from a drop the bottom piece stays on and it may give the advantage of preventing overheating since it is slotted for air flow the piece for the top will not stay on -- falls off multiple times a day it is easy to apply as it just clicks on over the top but since it wo n't stay on it does n't do much good and the constant falling off is so annoying that i just eventually left it off
very nice cover with cool colors but you have to be a little careful when opening the laptop not to pull the cover off it just snaps on but once you get a <unk> down it wo n't be any problem . + + +
this is an excellent cover for the chromebook has vents to prevent overheating i have n't removed it off of my product since buying it i definetly recommend it to other chrome book users
this is perfect i love it ! only thing i feel should be mentioned is that it does n't look like the image it is darker and more a dark <unk> purple and opaque but , it gets the job done and is a snug fit i take it with me to class and it gets tossed in and out of my backpack daily , and does n't come off i am here seeking a white one now thanks for a great product
i like it quite abit it is n't a protective cover as in , if i drop it will it bounce , it 's a hard shell , i can pick my chrome out of a bunch -lrb- in my house -rrb- a mile away be sure you pick the right one
this really fit my google chrome laptop just perfectly and the price was worth it and it arrived when expected i really love this mcover and i would recommend
this is very pretty and snaps onto the outside of the laptop easily i do n't see it protecting the laptop a lot , however , against a child i think it 's mostly going to help prevent scratches on the outside and it 'll make it look pretty
this cover fits well i love the design there are no tabs on the keyboard side that i hit -lrb- unlike my macbook cover -rrb- the color is a little darker than the picture - it is more of a dark blue instead of the lighter blue in the picture other than the color - it is a great product !
i ordered this the same day i ordered my chromebook , it fits perfectly , it 's great protection , and i love the color i also love the fact that it has the collapsible feet
best backpack for the asus g # series laptops ... hands down everything else i 've tried has been too tight or does n't feel padded enough this one was made to fit like a glove , literally
only backpack i found to really be one hundred percent sure my asus rog laptop would fit it has much more space though you can fit your entire gaming <unk> in it and it is well made
i bought this after seeing the video showing my style of asus rog computer slide into it and zip closed i had purchased a different brand that could supposedly hold a # inch laptop but not the asus rog just could n't close the zippers now i have a bag that can hold everything that i can think of to go along with my computer i am very happy with this back pack
i bought my g # laptop back in january , and have been looking for a good bag/backpack to store it in ever since i saw the articles stating the nomad was coming , but since it was n't out i had to <unk> several of the other brands bags could n't accept the g # series ' heat sink at the back of the computer i ordered the bag , and it came in less than # weeks , -lrb- despite being & # # ; unavailable & # # ; -rrb- and over a week a head of schedule it has not gotten a lot of use yet , but i 'm just waiting to use and abuse it the g # fits wonderfully , with enough room to be easily removed , but not so much that it bounces all over the place initial appearances and performance indicate that this will be a great investment to mate up to my g # i will update this review periodically with any new information after i use the bag more
i ca n't say anything but smile this is totally worth it for asus g # series it fits so perfectly in it and very comfortable to put it on i 've been suffering for # months taking my laptop to college and friend 's house by hand , but i ca n't say more than i 'm very happy about it
gave this item a # star as i measured my hp laptop exact as this item was described & needed to be about # & # # ; bigger for my laptop to fit . product was good , just not big
i ordered this sleeve for my laptop thinking it would leave a little bit of wiggle room and still be able to close even though i really like the color of this sleeve , it does n't fit my laptop . i was really disappointed
fits my asus laptop well , good stitching quality and zipper , but unfortunately this case smells like an <unk> bomb - harsh and chemical tried airing in the sun , no help tried washing with strong detergent , baking soda , vinegar - no help . will be leaving it outside in hopes the smell will die down somehow
unfortunately this case does not fit my asus # . # & # # ; laptop from the dimensions listed , it appeared that it would , but when i received the case my laptop did not fit otherwise , the case seems like a great deal for the money
i do n't know why but it is super hard to find a # inch laptop sleeve in stores this is cheaper and better looking than any of the other sleeves i 've seen .
it fit my toshiba quite nicely and the color was exactly as i expected it to be according to the picture it also came with a little pouch for i do n't know what , but overall , i was satisfied
with my husband 's job , he carries a backpack to work with him i thought he might benefit from this one , since it has a sleeve for his laptop really , it was too lightweight to be useful for such heavy use it 's a perfectly fine backpack for light use we 've decided to use it for one of our boys & # # ; overnight at <unk> 's house & # # ; bag , and it works great for that purpose
this bag is a bit smaller than i expected it will my laptop , but it is not very spacious there is very minimal padding and straps do not wrap around the body at all it does not appear to be constructed for electronic devices it is not intended for hiking either , but appears to be a decent pack for school supplies , notebooks , or a change of clothes the main compartment has an inner pocket , but it is wide open on top and does not zip or velcro closed
the most distinctive feature of this backpack is the angle zipper back , which gives it a bit of style and an <unk> <unk> to the back pocket however , half the pocket is above the zipper so it 's not usable except for a large item -lrb- like a notebook -rrb- that you can maneuver to fit under the top section inside is one roomy area and a smaller mesh pocket for organizing smaller items there 's also one mesh pocket -lrb- not two , as in the description -rrb- on the side for a water bottle the exterior dimensions are approximately # x # inches which is on the small side it would not be useful for a high school backpack meant to carry several textbooks , though it could be useful for a younger student to carry lunch and a couple of notebooks it 's extremely compact and light weight -- the box from ` amazon was so small and light i wondered if there was anything inside this would make it a good choice if you are traveling and want to put something in your luggage for day hikes construction appears to be fine , good solid zippers and no defects in the workmanship
this is a sturdy backpack it is a simple design with room for a tablet or laptop there is nothing special about it but it does the job it is lightweight and well made
the backpack is probably fine for someone in middle school that does n't carry many books also , that takes good care of it the material is very thin , much thinner than comparable <unk> backpacks so i do n't think it will last very long we 'll see it is also a little small , hence my mention of not too many books , both because they might not fit , or if they do , they are likely to tear the backpack that said , the backpack by itself is very light , which is nice - not much extra weight from it the # tone colors are nice , and it will do fine for smaller kids i 'd say it 's for <unk> school aged children
this is a nice all-around backpack for kids , but is probably fine for many adults as well the material looks fairly rugged for general use , but it 's probably not quite <unk> 's quality , but that 's not what it 's marketed for anyway it 's very <unk> and you can really cram a ton of stuff in it the laptop section is a nice touch and fits your standard # & # # ; laptops or smaller there are a bunch of pockets within the backpack where you could store phones , pencil cases , notepads , etc . note that while this backpack is geared towards kids , it 's definitely on the large size , so for those under # or so , it may be a bit on the large side still -lrb- small -rrb- my # -year-old has been using it daily the last few weeks and really likes it and does n't mind the size at all - actually likes being able to fit more things in it likewise because it is on the large size , i can wear this backpack very comfortably myself , so it 's probably a good bag for a fairly large age range
this is both an attractive and very functional bag with a padded section to carry your laptop or <unk> while the bag is hanging up , which mine often is on a door hook in my office , the main compartment allows the bag to be opened fully there is a typical water bottle pocket , a storage pouch for your small stuff and a good sized main compartment five star is a trusted quality brand and i would recommend this product for students or others , all ages
this five star <unk> and backpack is very well made -- strong and resilient with a lot of side pockets and little nooks for storing things both my girls immediately tried to claim it once i opened the package ; it 's attractive enough for older kids not to be embarrassed by , and it looks like it 's going to stand the test of time so far , so good
comfortable , adjustable straps let you wear this backpack for a easy hike or carrying books around campus it has enough compartments to keep what you need within easy reach the only drawback is the durability the fabric feels thin so i & # # ; m not sure how well this would hold up to serious hiking for days or any type of rugged environment
i use this backpack for airplane trips it 's more versatile than my professional laptop computer bag -lrb- which i pack in my suitcase -rrb- it can fit a lot of stuff into its multiple compartments its padding adequately protects the computer it 's comfortable to carry on my bag - even when it 's weighted down with books , a computer , and my other electronics
this bag is of decent quality and has a lot of great storage , pockets , etc . <unk> , it seems <unk> , but that 's perfect for my needs i wear it when i bike to the gym and it holds my shorts , shoes and towel with ease it 's comfortable to wear and has the necessary space to carry everything i need
roomy backpack with nice comfortable straps the padding is a bit thin on the inside bottom , so i worry a bit about my laptop when kept there the only other thing that feels a bit awkward is the straps coming over the top of the bag this makes the bag more comfortable , but it makes it a little bit more complicated to zip everything up and go for the price this is a great deal , we 'll have to see how long the padding takes to compress
looks just as pictured i have the macbook air # inch with a clear hard speck case and it does fit quite snugly because of the hard case it almost does n't velcro closed , but it is still functional i like all of the extra pockets for other electronics , as well as the handy extra case for the charger though it likely would n't save my laptop from a bad fall it does protect from everyday jostling around
this laptop case is so classy and nice that i wish i could wear it as a sweater : -rrb- it is soft yet sturdy and protects my laptop from scratches it would not protect the laptop if you drop it or hit it it seems to protect just as well as my old , padded , ugly and <unk> laptop case the grey is a bit darker than pictured but very nice this is a unique item that looks <unk> i absolutely love it plus you can not tell that it is a laptop case ... maybe this will keep my laptop <unk> -lrb- yet to be tested -rrb- arrived extremely quickly & would recommend it to a friend
the sleeve is much greater than i expected , especially for so cheap it fits my # & # # ; macbook air perfectly and has the perfect amount of pockets for everything i carry -lrb- even one for my ipad it seems to be a decently made product but i have n't owned it long enough to speak on its <unk> durability all-in-all i am very happy with this product
i love this case i really wanted something stylish but protective , and this is perfect i love that i can fit this in my backpack and that it has really nice padding the inside is lined with gray suede and it really protects my macbook air # inch well i definitely recommend this case
rarely do i buy something that makes me feel like i got way , way more than i paid for this is a truly well-made , functional and attractive envelope for my macbook air highly , highly recommend
i bought this bag for my mac book pro and it has been a great backpack i can carry my laptop without worry and has enough room for mice and a small wireless keyboard
after searching for literally the last month , i have to say i am happy with my purchase of my brenthaven pro this pack is the only one for under a hundred bucks -lrb- shop around -rrb- that i really trust with my mbp the protective padding around the computer is tough and thick all over the oversized zippers seem very secure with the lifetime guarantee , the bag is worth the money the looks are n't super cool , but that helps when you 're on-site all day and do n't want people to know what is in your bag it is an understated powerhouse
i bought this for my macbook pro and it is a life saver , literally i accidentally ran over it , with my macbook pro inside it , and it saved it the laptop did bend a little but it still works this and apple 's high quality are a perfect match
this laptop backpack was the best choice for my # `` macbook pro and all the usual gadgets that go along with it i had seen this bag in a computer store but purchased it through amazon ... seeing as it was a little bit less money that said ... it was not the cheapest priced backpack out there but it 's build quality stood out among it 's competitors if you need a well made , long lasting laptop backpack ... you should consider this product it 's not the most fashionable bag out there , but it 's ruggedness , spacious compartments and wearer comfort more than make up for the serious looking design
after extensive research i bought one of these for my # `` sony vaio super to travel with plenty of room for mouse , flash drive , power cords , cell phone and any other small electronics or accessories after a year it still looks brand new purchased a second one as a christmas gift
this was purchased for my husband to use with his new macbook pro if you want a slim , flexible backpack , then this is not for you this backpack is large , sturdy , and very well made with pockets for everything that you can think of it comes with a great warranty that i doubt we will ever need this product is meant to go the distance
it does the job and i still use it today -- had it for almost a year the problem is the stitching on the inner lining -- the stitching that <unk> the outer canvas material with the inner material soon after i bought the bag the stitching began to fail this made for an unwanted hole between the lining , sort of a third pocket where small things tend to fall and get hidden -- like my jump drive or ipod <unk> the other negative is the outer side pockets , the latches that keep them closed they unlock with just a slight nudge not a big deal since those side pockets are very deep and nothing will fall out unless the bag gets turned upside down the bag has a nice look and is roomy , and was cheap just poor stitching
this bag is great i 'm using it to carry my macbook # `` and fits perfect <unk> all the accesories including a # genius <unk> the design is great and the material seems like will last forever the only bad thing is the side <unk> , does n't fit anything and when you put something inside , it 's very <unk> to reach due to the size of the pockets p.s . sorry for my english
i bought this just to lug around all of my things for class , but i have wound up using it for my computer i 've bought computer bags in the past that advertised # . # size , but my computer would n't fit my computer fit very well in this one i 'm very happy i bought this bag
i just got this and have n't actually used it yet , but i figured i 'd add a few comments since i <unk> on them so much when i was selecting a bag the most important thing for me was a bag that could fit school books as well as my # . # `` computer , and this seems like it will do the job i was able to fit about # `` of books in and the bag was able to comfortably close -lrb- and i might even be able to squeeze more in -rrb- it claims its width is # `` , and that was the best i could find when i was looking at the specs of different bags online some drawbacks : no handle on top to grab , which i did n't use often on my old bag but it does come in handy no special slots for pens or small items ; just a zippered pocket -lrb- which i 'll try using for <unk> -rrb- and an open mesh pocket -lrb- the description mentioned something about a full organization panel , but i 'm not sure what that <unk> to . the side panels seem a little thin , and since that was the first thing to tear in my old bag i 'm hoping this wo n't be a problem overall , it does seem like a good bag and i needed it for the book space , but keep in mind that it does n't have some of the features that you might be used to
i got it in a matter of days i thought it would n't get to me in time for school , so i contacted them about <unk> it but it came in time the color is a bit muted than in the picture , but that 's not a problem it has many compartments , for your laptop , notebooks and there are two sides for your water bottle will fit , which is a bonus then the front pocket outside it is big enough to carry like your wallet and pens
i am a college student and needed a computer bag that was durable , protected my computer , and i could lug around campus this bag looks great in the pictures and it 's exactly that it is really durable inside and out . i would prefer a little more room for things however it is completely functional the strap could also be more comfortable , so if you carry a heavy load often i would not recommend this bag this completely works for my needs and i really enjoy using it
i really , really , really , love this bag i havent had it for very long but i am very happy with this buy the price is great and the bag is even better it has room for everything i need to carry with my laptop and has padding so it will help keep it safe from damage the style is cool too ... though the cloth on the inside of it has a design i 'm not all that crazy about i still love it i recomend it to anyone who wants a good <unk> bag for a great price
this is a high quality bag i use it as a `` man bag `` so it 's a little big for me but i was unable to find anything near this quality bag for the price the large inner pocket has divided into # sections which will hold # `` laptop in one easily in the other one is also a zippered pocket and cargo net pouch for quick access items there are # end pockets under the end of the straps which appx # . # `` i use it to store the face plate for my cars head unit and cell in the other there is also a large zipper pocket on the outer flap appx # in `` you ca n't go wrong with this bag i did n't measure the the bag but my appx sizes pretty close the straps are thick and wo n't roll on you
i use the bag for work , since it is bigger than i thought i am able to keep all my stuff in there great for me since i dont have a lot of space at work and am always moving to different locations
the quality and design are <unk> i use it daily for books and files , occasionally for a laptop instead of my wheeled laptop case additionally , it is an excellent value
love the bag it is nice and stylish for me and my husband it 's very strong and it protects the laptop with the padding in the bag it has a place where you can put your charger , a book or so , phone cable , and lots of other accessories for your computer i even had room to put my camera in the bag as well i am pleased with my messenger bag and how it protects my laptop
i absolutely love this bag ! i was looking for a bag that would hold my # . # `` wide screen laptop , and this one fits perfectly my laptop does fit a little snug , but all in all it is exactly what i was looking for it has plenty of room for the cord , mouse and any work papers , so it does double as a briefcase it is also a very stylish messenger bag the only drawback is that it does not have a small handle on top of the bag , or the strap across the back to attach to a rolling suitcase -lrb- not that big a deal for me -rrb- i would highly recommend this bag to anyone who is looking for a bag for their laptop
the item i purchased appear to be low quality with several imperfections the item did not appear the same as the product i purchase from a retail company for my other laptop - material , thickness , stitches and logo is upside down
bought this sight unseen , and was iffy on the price the outside material feels a bit cheap , the inside lining feels ok -lrb- furry protection for your laptop -rrb- fits the rmbp # & # # ; a bit loosely the pockets are probably good enough for the adapter and a few dongles , maybe an external hard drive no secure pockets for small tablets , though as a laptop sleeve it works well , but as an overall office bag it falls a bit short on expectations
this case is well constructed , it fits your macbook like a glove . the cord barely fits into the front pocket , there is zero extra space in this bag for anything other then your computer and charger
i bought this last month and so far it has been great it is nicely padded and soft on the inside and my macbook pro # `` fits perfectly , definitely recommend it
this is exactly what i was looking for when i went on a search for a bag for the macbook air i just purchased i wanted something slim , that would fit my air , without it being loose my other # inch laptop bag was too thick that even strapped down it had too much room to play this bag is a decent size , fits the air nicely , has two pockets in the front that can hold smaller items theres a rear pocket that does n't zip that can hold the charger , or my ipad mini just fine it would have been the perfect bag , if it was a little more robust , but then again that would make it thicker and heavier <unk> was what i was looking for and i got it in this bag
just enough room for the air and charger , a couple of pens and a notebook perfect for the minimalist who wants a balance between protecting the laptop and not carrying too much weight well thought out design , nice shoulder strap option
made for mac , but it fit 's my dell xps # perfectly the case has nice padding all around , is about # the size , and a fraction of the weight of my previous case
used this case for the hp laptop pavilion # pc and it was a perfect fit securely held the laptop extra pockets fit the mouse and power cord case is very durable overall quite satisfied with the construction and durability of the case my son uses it daily for school definitely would buy again and recommend for anyone to purchase
this case is great , the materials and construction is of the highest quality it 's only flaw is the # front pockets , which are a little hard to get into , your hand barely makes it thru . it also has a short back pocket but you ca n't put much there than a small book or a notebook . other than that is a great case , more like sleeve with handles .
we 've carried our mackbook pro in this case many times it 's well padded , sleek , yet has room for the charger and even a mouse if you use one we feel safe with our device in this case
like the case on the computer i was at it looked blue , but it is <unk> or their fancy name for purple mbp # fits perfect even with case protector on it side pockets barley fit the charger had to take the plug in off pack the charger before you put the computer in and you will have a little easier time
it is a perfect sleeve for my rmbp i really like it this is the second of its kind that i have bought in the past its simple , elegant , cushioned on inside
this was a gift for my mom , who had recently gotten a macbook and was toting it around in a backpack ! the case fits like a glove and it 's comfortable to carry it has handles and a shoulder strap and the price was excellent all in all , a great deal and a great product
i love this case i had recently gifted my macbook pro to a good friend because it was -lrb- do n't laugh -rrb- too heavy to lug through airports the unibody construction attracted me to the macbook pro ... the air version is where i want to be this case is awesome in it 's simplicity and lightweight construction i can carry the power cord , the ethernet dongle , and ... if i choose , the outboard superdrive
i first bought this case at a local electronics store , but amazon had it for $ # less ... so returned the other one before i used it got this carry case in # days . . great amazon service and delivery enough room in outside pocket for my kindle fire hd , plus section for the charger for both
i bought this for my # & # # ; sony vaio and it fits perfectly even with the optional extended life battery there are plenty of pockets to hold a wireless mouse , charger , and other small accessories nicely lined and padded
first found at best buy paid $ # decided after do n't know why i did n't check first but anyways i wanted to check ratings on it and amazon popped up with the same product for $ # ! i returned the bag to best buy same day waited a week and literally got the same exact bag i wanted because it has the exact description on amazon and i love it ! it 's really soft on the inside , has a long side pocket and two small ones in front with one zipper that perfectly fits your charger and cord so worth the wait
i like this sleeve because it has handles which is great because i can pull the laptop out without worrying about dropping it it is light and durable the interior is great with the soft faux material to prevent any scratching the laptop nice to carry with shoulder strap if you decide to carry you laptop i like the pockets to put other things like the external dvd/cd drive for my macbook air this was priced much better than the plain sleeve at the apple store
this bag is fantastic it is very well made and fits my macbook pro # & # # ; -lrb- late # -rrb- very nicely there is just enough room in the pockets to fit your charger and a couple of other small items the pocket on the back of the case is very handy too i would definitely recommend this case for anyone that wants a very well made case to protect their mac
this case is extremely well made i 'm impressed that the machine stitching is reinforced and the fabric is good quality which is very durable the inside has a # sections one side is a very soft pocket which holds the computer and is spacious enough so my computer fits well even with the protective sleeve the other is large enough to hold papers , pencils , and even a book which is very convenient there are zipper pockets on the outside my husband bought one almost # years ago and it 's still in great shape so when i got a computer i automatically chose this case i like the strap so i can carry it over my shoulder or wear it messenger style so my hands are free the deep purple color is feminine but also professional this is a great case
i bought this bag as a gift and it 's great it seems sturdy , the lining is very soft , and there are a number of compartments for different items the only downside is that the outside pockets have somewhat awkward closures and the openings are n't wide enough as a result
this is a very durable well made bag needed something with a shoulder strap + zip pockets for my laptop + accessories that is protective from all our seattle rain this works perfect
wow ! ! this case was more than i anticipated i 'd seen a similar incase at our local apple store , and it was way over priced when i ordered this case , i thought & # # ; maybe it is n't like the one i saw at apple & # # ; . . but boy was i wrong it has plenty of space for your mac book charger , and the front of it i can even place my ipad in i really like the felt cushioning as well to protect the mac book great buy ! !
i looked around for a case that would not be too cumbersome and yet hold all the things i needed for my macbook air the thing i like about this case is that it fits my computer - which has a translucent protective case attached - quite snuggly and has exterior pockets to carry cords and other paraphernalia i looked at a lot of cases and this one was the best value for the money
i bought this case for my daughter 's macbook i have the same one for mine and love it this one was much less expensive than in the apple store - thank you
this bag is just perfect for my # & # # ; macbook air and the two zipper pockets are large enough to hold power adapter , small notebook with a couple pens my # & # # ; tablet also fits -lrb- barely -rrb- in one of the front pockets which is great construction seems very durable so far it is even better than i had hoped
i have this case 's bigger brother which has held up very well when i needed a case for my zenbook , there really was n't another choice enough room for everything you would need in there for accessories does n't add much weight , and is easy to access
this is the case i was looking for it is durable , comfortable shoulder pad , nice color and it is weather resistant i wanted it to fit my ipad and the keyboard and have room for paperwork and it does
this case is great for a small laptop or ipad it provides a pretty good cushion for protection , and the color shows little to no dirt at all very nice , sleek & simple , but professional laptop bag
i 'll put this as simple as possible i own a macbook air # , this bag fits like a glove it 's protective , well made and very light it 's also very comfortable to carry around all day i 'd buy it over and over again
this bag is great , it has enough space to carry a # ' macbook pro , it also has many pockets to put other stuff , the desing and materials are great too
i loved this case my wife does too so i bought one for her i bought the # & # # ; case for my # & # # ; macair however i have to squeeze it the cord
bought this for my lenovo thinkpad x # and it fits perfectly has a nice soft and padded interior to help protect my laptop just the right size and great quality for a <unk> laptop carrying case side pockets with zippers have room to store extra cables , power pack , and an external hard drive and whatever small documents you like very satisfied with this case
this bag is perfect it fits my # `` mac like a glove what i like most about it is the choice between handles or the strap it also has pockets in the front for the power chord , pens , etc . very well made as well , i think i have had mine for about a year and it is still in great shape
this item was packaged great and it is really nice i would have preferred if there was a pocket inside to hold the power cords , but i found a way around that it actually arrived early so i would definitely buy from them again overall this was a good buy
i needed a carry case for my new computer , and i love this design for the price , it 's great the padding is very slender , but it 's more than enough , provided you are not rough with your computer i 've traveled very comfortably with my laptop in this case
this lap top case not only had a perfect fit for my large laptop it gave style and class ... i was impressed and very satisfied will definitely recommend to another diva
this bag is so original and so gorgeous i have no complaints whatsoever i am a consumer that is drawn to unique pieces and for the price , this was an absolute steal this purchase is yet another reason why i so love my amazon
i recently purchased a dell # . # laptop and it fits like a glove i happen to think the portrait is also sexy so when i got it i was very pleased with my choice
