it is a nice backpack , do n't get me wrong however , it is heavy and not very comfortable imho the straps are also not very long i sent this one back and got the bandit # and am much happier
this is a well-constructed bag i did my homework on the front end as i needed a functional bag to hold my # `` toshiba although the laptop did fit , the width was too tight the company stood solidly behind the product and refunded my money promptly -lrb- and tried to work with me for a replacement -rrb- this bag is as good as it gets but for state of the art , thin lap tops
this is an excellent bag , with great organization and layout in terms of how many pockets it has , and how much it can hold it has one fatal flaw for me , however : my laptop was too big to fit inside it my laptop is a # . # inch screen , and has dimensions of # & # # ; x # & # # ; x # & # # ; about one inch of my laptop sticks out of the top of the bag when i put it in , and i can not even begin to zip it up if ogio makes a similar bag that is two inches taller , an inch wider and an inch deeper , i would probably give it # stars
exactly what i wanted my only & # # ; eh 's & # # ; are the price -lrb- thought amazon would be a bit lower -rrb- and how long it took to ship and lack of <unk> about the shipping ogio makes very good quality products , so i guess i should have expected to pay $ # , but , now ive seen the same backpack in # stores -lrb- not online -rrb- for $ # less
i 've had two ogio metro bags over the years and each has been exceptional , lasting over # flight miles before starting to look ` tired ' -lrb- always the handles that fray - zippers last forever -rrb- so when i purchased a dell precision m # -lrb- # `` laptop -rrb- i headed straight to ogio for a bag this one is very nice ; same build quality and i would be keeping it if the laptop fit - almost a full inch sticks out the suspension system is well thought out , but it costs you several inches in the bottom and is not removable or adjustable , so it just wo n't work for me also , although the overall dimensions seem similar to the metro , all that padding around the suspension system means that main cargo compartment is much smaller than the metro 's the search goes on
i was looking for a replacement for a jansport that i had for # or so years jansport does n't make anything like this anymore , but the ogio is great the laptop compartment is very well designed your laptop does n't go to the bottom of the bag when you drop it in from the top , being stopped before it hits bottom the only thing i wish they had was a divider in the main pocket for holding # / # x # sheets of paper
this is the most comfortable backpack i have had i attended a convention and had my laptop , ipad camera and other things and never felt uncomfortable also there is plenty of room for all my things and finally special <unk> storage for laptops , andother electronic equipment
this is a good backpack very durable my only problem with it is that i wish it had a file folder divider in the main pocket but it 's really not that big of a deal
really like the bag very flexible design with plenty of storage and numerous compartments for electronic goodies , adapters , etc . only critique is that the bag is really expensive surely , it is a quality product , but $ # is pretty steep unfortunately , it looked like the best bag for my needs so i paid the $
amazing backpack great all around i weight # lbs and my height is # ' - # & # # ; and this backpack is still a little too big for my frame the shoulder straps do tend to dig into my shoulders when the straps are n't properly secure i would consider a smaller backpack but great quality and tons of pockets though some are kind of useless or too small love it though strong tough and looks like it can take tons of weight not for small
holds all my stuff and very well made i think it will hold up for years to come in one of the side compartments , there is a bungee type strap that i can not figure out - wish the bag came with some <unk> or something also , the straps do n't fit my shoulders very well - i 'm normal sized -lrb- # ' # & # # ; # lbs -rrb- ... straps just not form fitting at all not a deal breaker though
if you are looking for a backpack to carry your electronics that has a bit of durability this is for you it is good for the college student and business man good for wearing with your business clothes .
this is a one of the nicest laptop backpacks i have seen unfortunately my # & # # ; laptop will not fit and i had to return this the dimensions of my laptop are # . # x # . # x # . # when the laptop is placed in the backpack it will stick out about # & # # ; too far and the zippers will not zip one review that i read said that he used a knife to cut off the bottom of the padding and was able to get their # & # # ; device to fit the specifications for the pack say that it is # . # & # # ; lengthwise however the rounded ends cut the maximum device length to # . # & # # ;
the only reason i did not give it five stars is because the bag has trouble staying upright when it is at about # % capacity otherwise this bag is one of the best i 've owned i currently used it to haul around some of my music gear -lrb- <unk> , cords , guitar stand , etc . , -rrb- and it is very sturdy love all the pockets for all of the different stuff i have to carry with me it is comfortable on the back and has space for macbook , ipad and then some ogio is the way to go
i used this pack to replace a similar sized pack that i have used while traveling the globe it is very well put together only draw back i have is that the shoulder straps loosen on a regular basis when it is not being worn , however when it is on and under load they stay put as they should great bag and would recommend to anyone looking for a new bag , ogio has many bags to fit your specific need global <unk> :
lots of room , laptop pocket seems very safe and secure after reading most reviews , both good and bad , i was a little concerned with how rugged it would be it is as well made as my # year old one i have only one zipper issue and that is with the laptop pocket and it has to do with the extra stiff padding that is protecting the laptop easily worked through as it is a known stopping point overall , its working out great
this is probably one of the best back packs i have ever bought certain pockets are lined nicely to prevent items from being scratched it easily fits a laptop with a # . # & # # ; screen which also has a keypad on it you will not be able to fit a # & # # ; laptop in it the straps are very comfortable as well i had probably # pounds of stuff in this bag and although it felt heavy it did n't put any extra strain on me getting it on my back was a different story , but once it was there ? no problems at all strongly recommend this bad to anyone that is looking for a high-quality back pack maybe i will update this post in # years to let everyone know how it is holding up ... who am i kidding , i wo n't do that
i fly all over the place , and i always bring my # & # # ; macbook pro and my ipad # on all my trips this has adequate space for those items , accessories , and much more i love the sunglasses case ... my last ogio , while great , did not offer as much protection for the computer and sunglasses as this one does i love the water holster on the <unk> i miss the ticket sleeve for the airline tickets that my last ogio backpack had ... otherwise , there 's nothing wrong with this bag at <unk> if you travel a lot and take a lot of electronics and accessories with you on trips , this is great backpack to buy
fair amount of space lots of little pockets if your into that sort of thing the computer slot is ample for a # & # # ; toshiba and the vault is cool for phone the zipper on the strap for the phone would be cool if the iphone was half its width , good idea poor execution
not sure if its anything i should worry about or not , but the material is really thin for something that is holding quite a lot of weight so far though not a complaint in the world seems very sturdy , holds a ridiculous amount of stuff , and is very lightweight one thing i like in particular is the back panel , not sure what you refer to it as , but basically the part that rests up against your back , its very comfy it also has a very deep channel that allows lots of airflow which if your a sweaty person is awesome i will warn that the pocket that your laptop goes in is really tight if you own a lenovo y # p i mean really tight , but at the same time its great to know that i do n't have to worry about my laptop <unk> around everywhere
this replaces a older backpack from a different manufacturer i have had this a about # month and feel the protection for my macbook <unk> and phone are excellent traveling with this great , it has enough storage for me to pack all the chargers , magazines , snacks with room to spare
this bag does everything that i need it to do i love the padded top mount sunglasses compartment i am a college student and this pack carries all my books and supplies the laptop area is well protected and my # inch laptop fits nice plus this pack looks great i highly recommend this backpack and the quality is excellent
the build quality of this bag is very good and the fit on my back is very comfortable even with my typical full load of laptop , charger , other peripherals , and a full # l water bottle , this bag rides lighter than expected with the great fit design the middle pocket is larger than expected and i am not even <unk> its capacity very glad that i researched and invested in this bag
im not sure the type of ogio bag i initially had cause it was given to me from a vendor , and has lasted years till it got a hole on the bottom this bag has so many pockets i dont have enough stuff to put in all of them the stiff laptop holder makes the bag more rigid , but i love this so the bag never slumps over even when almost empty the only con i can think of is the straps dont stay in place they constantly move , this is a minor issue for me as the bag it wonderful for my daily use
looked at lots and lots of backpacks online and in person trying to find a durable bag with enough pockets to hold my business laptop , lots of papers , laptop accessories , and other small work related items this had enough compartments that are easy to access and i especially appreciate the protection it provides to my laptop while still allowing me to gain ease of access it is on the expensive side compared to most other backpacks <unk> but the only one i could find that was functional , appropriate appearance for work setting and will last me a long time
i checked out a bunch of bags and ended up selecting this one from ogio it has a bunch of pockets that are well-placed and size the right way i like the <unk> case on top - it is very useful i can actually put two pairs of glasses in there the only issue for me is that there is not a good way to attach this to a carry-on bag when walking through the airport next time i get a bag i will probably pay more attention to that feature
my gear is my <unk> and all my portable gear stays in this backpack when not in use , so i can just grab it and go extremely well built , almost too many pockets and the zippers never jam it 's a sick bag
i really like it i only traveled with it once so far i bought it so i can take it with me as a carry-on bag and it has to fit under the seat in front of me , which it does i really like all the compartments if you like to have things organized inside your back pack , this one is the one
enough space to fit everything in , but not so soft that it sags when not full literally a pouch for everything you can think of really comfortable even when full and heavy finally a product that makes it clear the manufacturer thought of everything i would need
i love this backpack it fits everything i need even the huge , <unk> intuos artist pad that i bought can be carried in this backpack . i ca n't close the zipper over that thing but at least i can carry it around with good protection for it
very well designed , room for everything , solid protection in sleeve for lap top , with a protective space at the top of the pack which could hold a variety of things , including a phone a bit pricey , but at this point i would say that it is worth it
put # computers # tablets with chargers camera zune portable hard drive pens note books paper work binder 's sun glasses everything i need for my engineering job needs great quality and built to last a <unk> long time best pack i have ever owned
this is a great bag for your gadgets holds your laptop , ipad , cameras and extra bits and pieces i 've not seen a bag this good before even with all the gadgets in it i still have room for a nights clothes in it
received the bag about a week ago , much quicker than i expected bag has pockets for everything and is very well made pocket for laptop seems a little tight but am sure fit will improve over use also like that because of its fairly sturdy construction it will stand when placed on the floor and not flop over on itself would definitely recommend , just know what you want to carry and use the bag for
i am a med student , i carry everything from # binders + a book or # + lab coat and <unk> this holds all of that and considerably more including my macbook i love the straps and the material of the pack itself . this is the # nd back pack i 've bought from ogio my last one lasted # years and deployments to iraq and afghanistan before the zippers busted off and got a hole . you want to talk about quality here you go when ever i need a bag i buy from ogio the extra cost is worth it
i went through a few different backpacks before i settled on this one i love it and take it everywhere with me it has more pockets than i know what to do with and holds everything i need to carry with me i even took it as my sole source of luggage when i flew , and it held up great , not to mention it looks great i 've had it for awhile with no problems and could n't be happier
ogio simply makes the best bags , period this is the # rd bag i have purchased from them ; all are superior style and quality to anything else i have owned highly recommend any and all ogio products
only had the bag for # months i use it daily , but never overload the bag -lrb- usually just a # mbp and a legal pad -rrb- the seams on the bag where the straps attach are starting to give out on both sides
bought this for my husband who travels for work he complained that it does n't fit under a seat in a plane very well and does n't stay closed because of a <unk> snap
i 've tried quite a few laptop bags ant this is one of the few that is n't bulky , but has enough space to carry my # ' macbook pro and ipad the supply does n't add to much bulk the full length zipper pocket under the flap is helpful for odd 's and end my only gripe is with the inside pockets that are too loose and not deep enough to hold or organize things anything you put in them will fall out , so they 're relatively useless i 've had the bag for about # months now and so far the <unk> material does n't show any serious wear overall i like that 's it 's stylish and functional
this bag looks good , and professional i bought it for the quilted interior , and just the right amount of space for everything i think the huge flap is annoying though for usability , but it works well for the function of & # # ; looking good & # # ; which i suppose is half of its purpose anyway
- constant compliments on the look of the bag - perfect size for light travel - material is really good quality - phone pocket is really <unk> - the clasp does not hold the flap closed very well any slight pressure will release it - the shoulder pad on the strap will not fit around the adjustment bracket - the shoulder strap bracket slips pretty easy , you will have to adjust it fairly often
mine arrived with a dead battery in the remote that 's a very <unk> situation should a send it back right away also very difficult to figure out <unk> for the two batteries in the tag which are a different size from the dead one in the remote plan to use this to help my # year old mom find her debit card she puts it in safe places that she ca n't remember i hope the battery life is long enough to out last her short term recall very prompt delivery
i was going to get this as a present for a relative of mine who travels all the time however , i 'm glad i tried it out before i wrapped it the batteries are already dead returning for a refund
i had ordered three luggage <unk> and was disappointed to find that none of them worked we were n't able to use them for our trip , and was n't until months later that we realized that only # of the nine batteries included worked it was like a <unk> trying to match up the <unk> combination of batteries to find out which work now i have the bother of replacing batteries which never worked in the first place
i purchased several of these but not all of them worked but the ones that did really amazed me , even with airport plastic wrap on the bag weather <unk> or colored the only thing that bothered me was the size of the beeper and the material it was made out of and if the manufacturer can add an option to add like # cards `` <unk> `` per beeper with micro led <unk> it would be a real blast for us heavy travelers -lrb- large families -rrb- to easily relax away from the luggage belt where every one else is waiting to see what is coming i have tried it , and it really gave me a peace of mind on my last several trips but bothered me to carry several <unk> on each trip
i should pay attention to previous reviews . strap tore in a period of # weeks the only thing i carry is the laptop so image if you get paperwork or another laptop inside
the bag design is nice , there a lot of pockets that are well planned for all the items you would normally carry in a bag like this the top seam came completely undone and repairs have to be done through samsonite - you have to drop the bag at one of their locations , and the closest one to us is # miles away then it can take # weeks to get it back and they ca n't say whether or not it 's covered until they receive it we just threw it out and bought a briggs and riley - it was more expensive but you get what you pay for i recommend b & r , especially if you 're a business traveler
the bag itself is perfect for me to carry my ipad and other small <unk> to work it even has space for my lunch however , i am very disappointed that with the first order , no strap was included -lrb- and it is supposed to be -rrb- so i returned it to amazon i received a new bag with a strap but that strap is now coming apart at the seams -lrb- literally -rrb- i am very disappointed i am also disappointed that i ca n't return it because i am a few days beyond the return period
i kept searching a bag big enough to put in my power , mobile phone , charger , books ... and everything this one works perfect for me the only issue is it becomes so fat when i put everything in
a compact little bag that holds all my office needs and can be used daily should be sturdy and should have separate compartments for my ipad and kindle this bag delivers on all the above and then some more it holds my # & # # ; thinkpad very well and has two extra sleeve compartments for my ipad mini & kindle lots of other small pockets to hold items and feels very compact even after its stuffed the material used is excellent and seems very durable samsonite never disappoints highly recommended and a steal at $ # sale price
mid size bag perfect for my # & # # ; ultra book and files i have an ipad that slides into the tablet storage nicely but i do n't think it would fit with any sort of a case on the ipad
the bag is nice , but please note that the # `` size does not reflect the size laptop the bag will accommodate the bag 's tag actually states that it 's for laptops in the # `` range i purchased this bag for my # `` laptop , and while it does fit in the bigger inner portion , it is unable to fit in the designated pouch and therefore less protected
this bag is <unk> for the price , the material is n't the best , its a bit too bulky , it does n't have a zipper , it just closes with the flap which was n't expected next time i 'll put out a little more money and get something more classy
the only reason i do n't give it # stars is because it only has # carrying handle which means the weight is <unk> distributed and it sits lopsided when you carry it other than that , the bag is well made , comfortable and spacious it is a great buy , especially for the price
i purchased this messenger bag for my fiance when his old one -lrb- not a samsonite -rrb- started to fall apart after five years of use this bag is a well made bag with many pockets for organizing the items you put in it it even has a nice place for your laptop and tablet being from a well known luggage manufacturer and coming in at a reasonable price point also make this bag a good buy he likes the bag and uses it everyday as it fits everything he needs to bring with him to work
this bag is well worth the price and will serve my needs perfectly it is durable has many options of storage , while still <unk> laptop shipment through amazon was a breeze and very fast pays for me to stay a prime member
i bought this to replace another messenger bag i had after using it for a few months , i 'm pleased with how functional it is and it 's much lighter weight , yet holds alot more than my previous bag - light weight - lots of storage pockets i can stash an amazing amount of stuff in it and still do n't fill all the pockets - # . # & # # ; laptop fits easily - nice size , not too big - sturdy and holding up well so <unk> - very little padding to protect the laptop i took a detachable pad base from my other bag and put it in this one to at least better protect the bottom
wo n't fall off your suitcase has a wonderful strap on the back made specifically for upright luggage handles room for cables , tablets , phones , documents this is a keeper better than my ogio
i first found this bag at a department store but thought it was over priced and am so glad i found it here for a better price i use this more of a business bag i do not carry a laptop but i am glad that it has so many pockets and zippers
great bag for school , work , and travel laptop is well protected , durable build , comfortable strap the giant snap that holds the lid closed ca n't really be snapped with one hand - not a huge deal , and still much better than velcro as you add thick items to the bag , it bulges quickly - much better for carrying thin items like any messenger bag interior pockets in the large main section are made from that fabric mesh stuff - ca n't hold <unk> small objects just get a small zip-up bag , a la a small toilet kit , and keep your small stuff in that i think that 's a better idea anyway
i have been using the laptop bag for over a week and it is great i use the overnight bag section to carry extra files and folders and it has plenty of room for everything i need the only downside is the handle it is very wobbly and i am not sure how long it is going to last the rest of the bag is made of high quality products , but the handle is attached poorly i am going to contact the seller regarding this issue
this office pack rolls easy and the handle works great . the sides are very stiff , meaning you have to unzip the zippers all the way to to the bottom to get things in and out of the bag it 's not the most convenient bag i 've had , but it is easier on the back
i 'm still using it i wanted a rolling bag that held a laptop and some papers this bag has a second compartment which you could store clothes i mostly keep junk there , if anything i wish it just had the front portion and not this second compartment i have n't traveled on an airplane with it so not sure how it fits under the seat it rolls easily and seems as though it will last over time when extended for rolling , it has two height adjustments which is good for people of various heights , i suppose while not as thick as some i have seen , i wish it was smaller
fits just fine under most normal size airline seats just do n't expect to also be able to put your legs under front seat the only thing is i wish i had gotten a bag that was security checkpoint compliant it can be a pain to have to unzip all the way and get out from in back where they have the padding but i ; m never worried that my laptop will be damaged that is for sure also , the extra compartment in the back is small due to handles ... so it 's not like you can use this to pack over night items i usually carry my jewelry and other electronic items i do n't want in my checked luggage
pros : fits under plane seat , sturdy , attractive plenty of room for laptop , files , and additional items narrow enough to maneuver down the aisle of the plane cons : you really have to fully open the zipper compartments all the way around to access the inside the structural support is stiff so it is very difficult to open a compartment part way just to stuff something in i consider this a minor convenience however and it is the only complaint i have thus far
good package with that much of needed space only gripe is the pull out handle , though it feels flimsy , which isnt <unk> with the impression samsonite <unk> i am concerned with its <unk> in the long run and hope i am really very wrong about this
i have had many laptop bags for both office use and travel this one is flexible for stacking with my luggage and rolls smoothly my only wish is that you offered other colors more attractive to women like a rich <unk> brown <unk> grey
this bag is sturdy , rolls well , and has a nice long handle i can put my computer , a decent amount of work , and my ipad and ipad keyboard in there without problems i would n't mind more space , but i do n't know that i would trade more space for lower organizational functionality so i think that this really is the best bag for my buck love all the little pockets and compartments , loves the separators , and loved the price
great way to haul papers , computer , files , etc . without exposure to <unk> handle extends well , laptop packs in the middle for protection and has plenty of compartments for files , pens , etc . another carry-on can also be carried on the top of this if necessary
my husband loves this brief case he use to carry his books and papers and laptop in a hand held brief case and it wore him out now he can tuck everything in neatly arranged areas and , most importantly , pull his brief case with ease would recommend to anyone
bought it for short business travels and am very happy with the product . feels very durable , handle not as flimsy as some has mentioned . great luggage at an excellent price ! highly recommended
this is a great rolling bag that holds all my business essentials and fits under most every airplane seat that i have encountered i tore the front zipper stitching but probably my fault when i overloaded it i would buy one of these again
you definitely get your money 's worth with this bag plenty of room for a laptop , books , binders , clothes . retractable handle works great shop amazon rather than st * <unk> great bag for the value
i am a teacher , and i needed a bag that fit all my & # # ; teacher & # # ; stuff this bag is perfect i regularly transport # ipads , a laptop , and graded papers this bag comfortably and safely fits all the necessities i have flown with the bag , and it fit under my middle seat , but not under my <unk> seat rolls well , even when packed tightly
this is one of the most beautiful bags i have ever had i highly recommend it to any one who is looking for daily office bag perfect size and look
i am very concerned about the warning on the bag that says its using chemicals known to cause cancer , birth defects and <unk> problems ! i am surprised they are allowed to sell these bags without having that warning on the website first had i known i probably would not have bought the bag now i am just thinking whether to use it or sell it
i 'm happy with my purchase i live and work in downtown seattle where practically everyone is sporting a backpack because i walk a mile to and from work , i purchased this bag to hold my work files and laptop so i would n't have to carry a load on my back each day i prefer backpacking in nature rather than carry # lbs on my back each day in an urban environment the bag is sturdy , well made , and moves easily over uneven pavement i & # # ; m sure i will have this bag in use for years to come
bought for my son and he can put all his paperwork and laptop in it with room to spare product is quality in its look and style was delivered on time for his birthday you wo n't go wrong with this item
the very first day i used it , i had my work laptop and my personal laptop -lrb- both macbook pros -rrb- in it and i picked it up by the strap after a few steps , one end of the strap came completely free of the ring and the whole thing fell to the cement i quickly inspected my computers to find that my personal laptop , previously in <unk> condition , now has a nice buckled corner and damaged usb port i continued to use it and forgot a day or so later to be careful with the strap , and the exact same thing happened this time it was on the carpet , but still samsonite , i expected better from you if you are reading this , i deserve <unk> the design of those strap buckles is ridiculous if they are slightly twisted when you pick it up , they come right off
i purchased this less than # months ago and already the little <unk> from the padded areas are showing up all over the inside because the seams have failed all it has carried so far is my # & # # ; macbook pro and a few papers i replaced a # -year-old targus for this one , and i 'm very disappointed never buying samsonite again also , that photo on the product page is misleading ... there is no way the # handles stay together on their own as there is nothing that comes with the case to enable that they just hang separately
i read reviews about the straps coming off etc . after receiving the bag , it does not appear to be of high quality construction , so i treat it very carefully when i pick it up and carry it no problems so far , but i know that i have to be careful when its weighted , as the straps do seem as if they may come lose
i bought this for my son who 's in college and starting a new internship he liked the material that this briefcase is made of rather than a leather one the size is perfect and has just the right amount of pockets and zippers for organized storage let 's hope it holds up well
having reviewed the capacity of this bag online , i went ahead and ordered it my dell fits perfectly -lrb- albeit a little tightly -rrb- into <unk> and i am very pleased about that the additional pockets are great for storing additional items like my logitech t # bluetooth mouse , etc . what more could one want
i travel a lot and this bag has lasted awhile . i 've taken it on numerous trips through airports and hotels and it has lasted still looks great and is fully intact
took a trip to alaska for the # xmas holidays & bought this item for my laptop it also holds an extra battery , charging cord , granola bars , <unk> <unk> , etc . you get the idea great item & high quality
this tote was purchased solely for the purpose to carry my laptop it has been less than a month and the straps are hanging by it 's threads the tote needs strong dependable straps for security especially if you are carrying a laptop
i bought this bag for my wife for christmas to replace a bag that she used for # years this bag fell apart within three months of regular use regular use is carrying laptop to and from work , monday through friday the bag itself is in excellent shape but the handle is coming apart so bad it is a risk to your computer to use it wo n't buy another product from this company
this bag has great compartments for your laptop and other items you may carry around i always feel like my laptop is safe and my belongings are organized however , the outside of the bag is rather cheap i noticed both of the straps are starting to rip after just a month and a half in short , i do n't think its going to last much longer and a bag that is built to carry a laptop should sustain the weight of one
initially when i bought the bag , i was impressed it 's large and pleasing to the eye now however , few months later , the straps are almost falling off after normal wear and tear i would recommend that you choose another bag this one does not offer value for money
i bought this bag to accomodate my macbook air and supplies , plus act as a purse for a business trip to europe after a week , the straps were already fraying and one of the straps tore where it attached to the body of the purse it 's been about six months and i 'm tired of lugging around such a <unk> bag it holds everything just fine , but do n't expect it to look nice after many uses i expected more for the price
i bought this bag in june of # i use it # or # days a week to carry my laptop and a few other items like a notebook or two and the charger as the bag is very roomy inside about # or # months ago , the straps started shredding where they touch the top of my shoulder after inspecting the straps further down , i can see where the staps attach to the bag , they are about worn through and on the verge of breaking off the rest of the bag is still in pristine condition but the straps have rendered it useless ... in # months considering the cost , i am very disappointed
i bought this bag specifically to accommodate my laptop and a few other items such as notebooks the size is adequate ; everything i need can easily fit into the pockets and main carriage area the problem is the lack of quality in the straps after one day of use , the threads that bind the straps came loose and the edge of the straps began to peel even though the bag still & # # ; works , & # # ; the frayed edges and loose threads in the straps render it useless for any sort of appropriate usage
initially i really liked this bag it was a great price and seemingly good quality looks much nicer than what i had been using ... but i purchased on january # today is march # and the handles are almost falling off . all # places where th handles are connected , just above the rivets , are holding on by a thread and i noticed today they 've raised the price to almost double what i paid
i really like this bag but the handles are almost broken i am just using it for work and have n't put anything too heavy in it , so i 'm a little disappointed
it is not as i expected it is almost plastic in nature not as pliable as i had hoped i wish i went to an actual store to buy a laptop
very nice bag held my laptop , purse , and papers for work i generally only used it one day a week to carry my laptop from home to work the handles started fraying after # or # months , looking completely unprofessional i finally gave it up and bought a bag with cloth handles
the bag holds everything i need but the straps are starting to fray a bit and i really wish they were thinner - they slip off my shoulder pretty regularly
i bought this as a working computer bag and while i 've only been using it for a few months i 'm already worried that the straps will fall off so i 've gone back to my old bag not recommended for anything heavy , puts too much strain on the
bag started off great i loved this as my work bag however , after # months , the straps began to shed and wear down now , i need to replace my bag ! :
