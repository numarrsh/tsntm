i had a tough time making a decision on a case for my # inch retina macbook pro i 'm very impressed the case fits the computer almost exactly there is a small gap in the middle of the display side at the hinge area , but it does n't bother me the pads feel substantial at the bottom of the case , and the edges of the case are rounded so they do n't cut your skin when you use the computer overall , i am very happy with the purchase and would do it again i imagine that the case will crack over time , but that is the entire point - the case absorbs the energy from impacts , rather than the computer
i recently bought this for my macbook pro with retina display -lrb- # inch -rrb- it snaps on perfectly and it 's clear , which is ideal to show off my <unk> decal ! ; -rrb- anyways , so far i am loving this case ! :
the bag i received is not leather it is a plastic bag and in no way looks or feels like leather in addition , it is a pretty tight fit if you want to keep anything in the bag besides the surface ; such as the mouse , power cord , etc . . i also have a keyboard i will be buying another bag that can allow me to keep all of my surface & # # ; stuff & # # ; together in no manner does it come close to <unk> this
one of the velcro pads on the bag 's flap has already come loose the pad is about the right size , but could be a little thicker or have deeper pockets i am thinking about returning it
love everything about the bag except the craftsmanship the stitching began coming out about # weeks of use and now the strap on one side has pulled off this was with very light use its really a shame as the bag looks very good and is very useful in its design
my surface fits nice in the bag , and it is set up nice to hold a lot items i really like the bag the only concern that i have is that the material is cheap quality -lrb- like a kids backpack -rrb- , i hope that it lasts
bought this bag in march this year and it is a perfect size for the surface pro and the stuff i need to carry around with it also great for plane flight since the small size makes it easy to get in/out from under seats however the quality could be better , just had the stitching on the front flap come apart all along the side was able to fix it by <unk> down the side but seems some other places also have the stitching on the front flap coming apart still usable and i take it with me every day still but would have liked a higher quality bag even if had cost more as it is this is one of the few bags that 's really made for the surface pro
the bag is bulky , lots of padding if i were to ship my surface , i would put it in this bag there is only an over-the-shoulder strap , no handles this bag does not make my surface mobile at all would not recommend if you want to put your surface in a backpack
the bag is custom cut for the surface and it fills up rather quickly if you try to add any other items in there the surface charger itself took up almost all the other available space i made the decision to return it since i do need to carry a few other things with me if you just want to carry the surface and nothing else , this is fine i also did not like that there was n't a handle on the top i did n't even think of that when i ordered it but it became apparent when i first got it i 'm going back to a traditional laptop bag for more space and a handle on top the material seemed like a nylon windbreaker with moderate to heavy use i worried it would n't last
this bag is a good design and it has room for the power cord , mouse and other accessories that i keep with my surface pro however , i ran into a problem where the stitching on the velcro holding the outer flap down started coming apart over the course of a week , the stitching broke until one day the velcro stayed attached to the bag when the flap opened i assumed this was a defect with this specific bag and returned it and purchased another unfortunately , i am seeing the same issue with this bag , though much slower why this should happen with normal opening and closing use , i do not know it is disappointing as i really liked the bag
the stitching started to come loose after only # months in one small spot i ignored this and kept using it some of the velcro patches are coming loose now , and it has been about # months
not a complaint , i have been used to carrying a laptop bag for years my surface is much smaller and works well with this bag i just had to get used to a much smaller profile
this bag holds my surface tablet and some accessories there 's also room for miscellaneous papers , writing instruments , and other small items i was disappointed that folders do n't fit well and i ca n't fit any of my school books -lrb- i 'm a teacher . but overall , it is as advertised
the case crown bag was a very good choice it has all the necessary features that i was looking for it also has great style and is very easy to carry the bottom line is , it looks good and fits the surface rt perfectly
the case is stylish and compact , perfect for my surface and the few bits of other gear that go along my only reservation is that it is more on the fashionable side than the practical i use my surface for business , on trips and in the field , this bag would be perfect if it were made of more durable cordura nylon and the strap used swivel clasps instead of square buckles i do n't mind the lack of closing clasps , the velcro does just fine , and the interior works well , while keeping the overall profile slim and the weight light so , if casecrown made a more <unk> version , i would certainly pick one up
nylon type shoulder bag - plenty of room for power supply and cables - surface , external keyboard , external mouse all fit just fine - room for business cards , some office supplies i was looking for something sized to the surface pro , that would hold all of its accessories , and be lightweight this fits the bill just fine
this is the best bag for my surface tablet that i have found it has enough storage capacity to carry all the accessories for my tablet and many other things i like the messenger style of the bag as well
this bag fits my microsoft surface tablet perfectly along with a text book and a few other things for school it 's a great bag the thing is , the velcro parts of the bag seem to almost come off , but i just used super glue and they stayed on for a while it 's a good bag , especially for the price
i bought this for my surface rt as a carry on for a trip to europe it also held my neck pillow , eye shades , a credit card , an id , boarding pass , passport , a notebook , ok i could go on of course , i also used during <unk> once we got there if i had one nitpick i would like a brief-case type handle the shoulder strap was the perfect length for me , both over the head and drop it is very well made and i look forward to using it on my next trip
i bought this for my rt tablet and it is very good and protect my tablet the outer flap do n't have enough velcro so i feel little bit uncomfortable it have lot of pockets where you can keep pens , cell phone and etc etc .
if the bag had a small handle on top it would make it easier to move around on top of a desk or when getting items in and out of exterior pockets did n't know that would be a feature i would <unk> when i was selecting the bag overall it has plenty of storage space for a phone , chargers , files and other small items
i bought this bag for my surface pro # tablet love all the compartments all are easy to access and holds # x # file folders along with my tablet without any problems i also like the velcro closures on the front flap but one of the velcro tabs on the front flap has come unstitched i had to hand sew it back on the only thing i would add to this bag is a small handle on the top of the bag
i like all the pockets and storage but the two things i do n't like is the shiny nylon material and the lack of a handle -lrb- only has a carrying strap -rrb-
i ordered this item for my microsoft surface and accessories it is a very good quality case that looks very nice there is a ton of pockets on this bag and my surface nestled in the back pocket rather nicely i have a bluetooth keyboard , a mouse , some flash drives , and an hdmi cable inside i do n't have a need for all of the pockets , but it 's nice that they 're there its a steal at roughly # bucks
i purchased this when i purchased a <unk> surface rt . i wanted something to keep the device safe but also that looked stylish this messenger bag was just the thing it fit the surface perfectly , and , despite its compact size , it had a lot of different pockets to put writing supplies or surface peripherals in the only reason i returned it was that i returned my surface due to technical issues otherwise , i would have kept the bag and happily so
it has pockets to carry everything , i can wear it cross body or over my shoulder like a purse so far the quality has been great highly recommend this product
i have been using this for the past month and this bag is surprising me every day there are dedicated sections to keep your charger as well as an internal zipper where i keep the mouse for the surface # i am backpacking , on my vacation right now , and the whole bag -lrb- with its contents -rrb- fit in the traditional & # # ; laptop & # # ; section of the backpack all-in-all a great buy
a great case and a pleasure to carry lots of places to put other stuff as well the only complaint is the strap , it needs something to keep the two pieces of it together a minor problem
i 've been searching for the perfect <unk> bag this is the one for me perfect number of pockets both of my surfaces fit fine it 's easy to access everything i 'll be buying more from this brand
the messenger bag fits the surface pro + pro charger just fine with space left for my wedge keyboard , wedge mouse , an extra stylus in the pen holder and even a vga adapter pretty good for the size
i need something that could carry my surface and other essential items quality is good and enough room for cords and snacks at the price it is a good deal
this thing is great is exactly as described and does exactly what i need it to do and then some ! shipping was fast if you need to carry your surface pro and cables <unk> and stylus and papers and get this thing ! !
we purchased this bag to hold all of our electronics when traveling it held the tablet , # cells , kindle , and the <unk> we were also impressed that it fit into our carry-on bag no problem when we got on the plane we just pop out the bag and we have our toys for travel its nice to have everything in one place , but do be security conscious
this was exactly what i was looking for in a bag to carry my surface around in has plenty of room for everything i was even able to carry around my new wheel of time book around in it 'cause it 's got so much room very well made , too very happy with this product
this bag is very nice right now i have a surface , usb hub , usb ethernet adapter , portable <unk> drive , usb serial adapter , and a few other small things this bag looks nice and holds quite a bit
i needed a bag that was light but would hold the surface , its charger and the kensington <unk> adapter -lrb- plus some extra space for my phone charger -rrb- fits everything nicely with several extra pockets for occasional needs well made and appears to be long-lasting the lining is orange , which i like but you should know it is there if it would bother you
i got this with the moko rotating case and i love them both this bag looks good , and is about as small as it can get and still be useful i carry my surface in its case , as well as my power brick and various odds and ends as well
this is a great little carry case it fits my surface pro well and i can take all my little adapters with me as well with some room to spare the shoulder strap takes a little adjusting to get everything just right
i love this bag it 's a small bag that holds a lot my surface pro with case slides in snug but easy has plenty of pockets for mouse , charger , etc . also has room with paper and stuff it is well made , very sturdy , and provides good protection i like it 's small
this was given as a gift , which had been selected by <unk> he loves it - it holds not only the ipad securely but there 's room for a portable dvd player as well
this is a great bag for the price i used it nearly every day to and from and around campus since i got it and it has held up great my only complaint is that the velcro has started to <unk> but that is to be expected with any component made of velcro so i do n't hold it against the bag the pockets are more than enough to carry my microsoft surface -lrb- with a protective case -rrb- , a -lrb- highly recommended -rrb- microsoft wedge mouse and pens , pencils , a small notebook , without too much <unk> all of the zippers , latches , straps and everything else is still holding up strong
this case is perfect for my surface pro and it holds it perfectly inside a case , i have the <unk> premium folio case with the type keyboard the power cords just fit inside the front and i can fit a travel mouse in the pockets as well anything more after that and the front flap starts to stick out a little bit
what a great bag for my surface pro i have a sleeve on my surface pro and it still fits in the bag it 's perfect for all of my accessories -lrb- charger , mouse -rrb- and a small notebook very durable , light and fits great on my shoulder
when this item got to me it was trash since it was so poorly and <unk> packaged i threw it in the trash it was cracked and pieces broken off the entire edge of the top part too cheap to return , plus , they would undoubtedly send the new one back packaged the same way what a joke
the top case is very very tight i spend a lot of time to put it on , and still ca n't get one of the five lock on then i find i ca n't tale it off it 's really too tight i should buy one case in the apple store god , i really really hate the case ! ! ! ! ! . it will be a forever
i was excited about this product because the price was right and i loved the colors first of all - the pink is a darker pink than what is displayed in the picture as a pale pink secondly , considering the price i should n't complain but the key pad cover was dirty on the outside and inside with food of some sort i tried cleaning with hot <unk> water to no avail as long as it is not putting particles of food into my keyboard i am ok so i am still using it as a cover i was just a bit disappointed , but still use the product because i do n't have the care or <unk> to complain or upgrade
screen protecter basically impossible to install bubbles are unavoidable and trying to put it on slowly and carefully only results in <unk> particles getting on the sticky side the case was a pain in neck to put on and after wrestling with it for a very long time , i realized it would n't snap because it doesnt fit the only thing i liked about this set was the keyboard cover it was simple to install and actually fit i have had to find replacements for everything else i 'm only grateful that i did n't have to spend a ridiculous amount on all three pieces so i 'm not overly <unk> by my disappointment in the
i 've had this case for less than a year and it is already starting to crack my laptop gets fairly light usage -lrb- i rarely take it out of the house , does n't get banged around , etc . -rrb- so this was a surprise i loved the color but a laptop case needs to last longer than a year in my book
while i love the way that everything looks on my macbook air , the bottom portion of my new case arrived with one of the locking tabs broken it 's a minor issue in the back left corner which does n't effect the cover staying on , but it is broken other than that the cover looks exactly as it 's pictured the screen protector is slightly smaller than the screen and i could n't seem to get it centered on the screen , so i did n't end up using it the keyboard cover is where my main issue lies it looks great on and stays in place when you type , however when i try to close my macbook , it wo n't close all the way this is a major flaw
it seems to be a good product but i have n't receive it yet i <unk> the item and it says it is in transit the order was places # weeks ago
delivery was great , quality was good overall i particularly did not like that the keyboard cover <unk> over the other keys as it makes it hard to type overall it servers its purpose
this cover works fine and is easy to install does the job of protecting my mac air , but the design does not allow you to open the the screen completely the angle is slightly decreased by the thickness of the cover opens most of the way , but not fully not a huge deal for me , but should be noted the rubberized keyboard cover was a nice bonus
the case is really great , but the cover is n't see through in the right parts and does n't line up exactly in the dark you do n't read the letters or buttons :
the color is great and the quality is n't bad however , i noticed that the protective keyboard cover does not match up with some of the letters on my # inch macbook it 's not a big deal , but it 's noticeable in terms of function , it 's fantastic and it keeps <unk> from going into my keyboard
when i received this package the hard laptop case was cracked at the corners where it connects to the bottom of my laptop and the keyboard cover has stains and holes in it i 've leaving the country soon and ca n't go through the process of returning it for a new one so that 's very inconvenient
it 's a snap on - looks super cute but the top pops off every once in a while it 's a pretty cover but i think that if i were to drop it the case would pop off or crack right away
the apple sign looks bad under the case , there should be whole for it the keyboard letters do n't match up with the ones on the actual keyboard so when the mac lights up you see two letters right next to each other / overlapping so it looks bad otherwise good : -
the hard case skin was quite satisfactory , however there were no instructions as to how to properly mount it it does not require the <unk> rocket <unk> , however it would have been appropriate to receive installation instructions likewise for the keyboard cover , which was a bit of a hassle and ended up not being quite straight most importantly : i did not receive the anti-glare screen protector and though i examined the packaging thoroughly several times and checked the area around where i opened it the anti-glare screen protector was not included in the package this missing item coupled with a lack of installation instructions is why my rating is only three stars it being that the anti-glare screen protector should have been included -lrb- and therefore i have paid for it -rrb- i would be grateful if amazon or smacktom would kindly send the screen protector to me thank you , `` the flying <unk>
the sale could n't have gone more smoothly - the price was low -lrb- fair -rrb- and the item arrived ahead of schedule my only complaint is that the cover itself was tricky to get on and has tended to shift out of place that , and the screen protector was equally tricky to get on and no matter how careful i was , some bubbles remain all in all , a good transaction for such a low price
i ca n't believe its so hard to find a case under $ # for the mba this fits my # model pretty good and i no longer have to worry about scratching the aluminum ... which scratches so easily
i live this case it 's looks awesome , the color is rich and bright was easy to put on and offers additional grip only thing is the keyboard cover letters and numbers do n't line up perfectly with the ones on my actual keyboard but it 's not off enough to bother me and i 'm only able to see it when my keyboard is lit up so no big deal
this is a good value it fits firmly and the aquamarine color is attractive on silver the cover prevents the screen from being pressed past a # degree angle , unfortunately , but that may not trouble you the keyboard rubber protector fits well , though it 's a bit too stiff for me personally -lrb- i type rapidly -rrb- i 'm not sure you could find better i have n't tried the screen protector
this is really cool i had read the two not so great reviews and decided to give it a shot anyway i thought i would have to return it but this product actually works very well the bottom of the case snapped on tightly and securely very easily th top was easy once i figured out how it was going to snap on the keyboard protector is awesome . it works like a charm , since is silicone it has n't budged , and i even flipped my computer almost upside down testing it out the screen closes and i have no problems opening it and closing the screen also , i have n't tried the screen protector yet , but it is the exact size it should be overall , this was a great purchase for only # $ , i love the way my air looks ! -lrb-
the cover was great , clipped on perfectly could n't get the screen protector to go on and it ended up collecting some dust and having bubbles so i <unk> it other than that , <unk> cover is great
i was told i would n't like this case by some people i knew they were wrong i really like it in fact , i bought a different case first and have been so glad i switched this case was far less expensive than the other one and in love it i have sent the product name and amazon <unk> to a friend who made the same mistake i did in buying another , more expensive , case first he 's going to get one too
the snap on is really hard to get off it cracked when i tried to snap it off its <unk> which i like easy to put on the keyboard cover doesnt fit perfectly but its ok
bought this for our brand new mackbook air bought it to protect the white , white , white keyboard keys on the detachable keyboard and to keep the laptop covers from being scratched the detached keyboard overlay took some getting used to but it works it does n't fit <unk> right with some of the top and bottom keys not getting total <unk> with the <unk> key covers
i like the idea of this small case to fit around my macbook air , just because i did n't want to lug around a huge case for such a small laptop it had a little problem fitting around my laptop and sometimes it pops out , but its not problematic the keyboard cover does not like to stay on the keyboard at all i do n't even use it anymore because it always falls off its nice if you can get it to stay on but it just does n't like to
i do love this case , but i find the keyboard cover completely useless i just threw it away the case itself is great i have n't found that it scratches or loses the translucent finish the color is a really gorgeous sea green my only problem is that the bottom part of the case will occasionally need to be <unk> when i open my macbook the screen will occasionally push the back part of the bottom case off and down not a frequent problem definitely my favorite mac case
this is my second case for my macbook air the first one was $ # and lasted # weeks before it cracked this one looks just like the picture , fits like a glove and cost a fraction of the price it came with the case , keyboard skin and screen protector i 'm thrilled with the color , fit and look of the set i 'd buy one again in a second and highly recommend it
product fits well , and looks good bought it for my niece , chose it for the color , product color matches image it was easy to put on the computer , snaps into place and does not come off easily the cover is translucent , my niece was able to put a decal on her computer which looks good under the cover
i just got this in the mail and it is quite impressive for the price first of all , shipping was very fast , just a few days i live in hawaii , so its a big deal the case fits perfectly , but i was most impressed with the keyboard cover i used to have the keyboard cover by moshi -lrb- about $ # -rrb- , which , required a little more pressure to be applied to the keys when typing in comparison to smacktom 's keyboard cover , it is much easier to type with , and it has an extremely smooth texture which is nice i highly recommend you get it , because you get the three items -lrb- case , keyboard cover , screen protector -rrb- for a really good price , and the quality is great as
it took about # days to arrive the screen protector did n't quite match up , but only i 'd know that i 'm satisfied with the price and quality of my purchase for protection on my macbook air
it came in the mail fast and i love it . the only thing bad is the color isnt exactly the same as the picture . . its more green than it is blue . but i love it
i purchased the smacktom case and keyboard cover for my ipad mini it shipped very quickly and i put it on my computer as soon as it arrived the case and keyboard cover are beautiful and of the highest quality i 'd recommend them to anyone with a macbook air
we ordered this after the clear hard plastic case broke from dropping the computer on its corner that case had been replaced twice due to breakage this case arrived quickly , fits perfectly , and has protected my air well
so cute love it all definitely worth it quick shipment as soon as i received it i put it on in less than a minute very simple and works amazing with my # `` macbook
i 've been using my case for several weeks now and i love it could n't beat the deal the only negatives are the letters on the keys do n't match up with my macbook exactly which is n't a big deal i can still see the glow of the letters
i did n't get my original purchase because of some <unk> with my address i contacted smacktom and they did n't hesitate to send me another one immediately i just got it and i 'm happy to say i love it the color , the material , how it fits my new macair i truly recommend this company and its products they are very professional and have excellent customer service thank you , smacktom
i was a little nervous ordering this item the item is true to color it came with the top and bottom cover , which attached very easily the silicon keyboard cover , and the screen protector definitely worth every penny if only it came in purple
as <unk> <unk> indicated , these are longer than necessary for padding shoulders unfortunately , they can slide around and bunch up on typical unpadded strap material while more padding does not seem necessary , i will probably add something <unk> will also presumably increase padding
i was not using them for a laptop/messenger bag , but to try to hold my shoulder bag on my coat shoulder i gave them # stars because they did help a little , but only # stars , because they did n't work as well as i hoped my smooth <unk> needs something that will grip my shoulder the cosmos black comfort shoulder strap pads , while they fit around my straps fine , just did n't get any grip on my <unk> i had such high hopes for them
velcro is nice and plentiful , but the padding is ` meh ' . padding is nearly <unk> cosmos should increase the quantity of the same padding , even if they have to raise the price
first , if you need a cushion for heavy items and you have a strap of # . # & # # ; to # . # & # # ; then you are going to get good performance i primarily have a strap that is # & # # ; and it is for a # pound camera which necessitated the flipping of the pad upside-down and putting the strap between the two velcro parts this allows the stiff velcro and the thin cushion center to make a properly performing pad so mostly , all is good in the cushioning department ... long term is the question when i opened the package i was hit with the smell of strong petroleum fumes ... sort of reminds me of certain gel <unk> from chemical <unk> i left it out in a high ventilation area for over a week and it still smells as strong or maybe stronger i am not sure what will happen over time when sweat and <unk> gets it , will over time it will <unk> anything or cause a <unk> or something maybe my items are the exception
bought this to reinforce some straps for my bag , and this is definitely a great add-on to any shoulder bag . live that it comes with two so far it 's doing its job , been using it daily for a couple weeks now
these fit the # inch straps on maxpedition bags , such as the <unk> messenger bag , ideally no slip , no movement , no fuss i much prefer these to the maxpedition velcro strap pad even if they were priced the same , but in fact , these are about half the price there are two of these in the bag
i am using this for my <unk> messenger bag to supplement the pad old pad velcro makes these pads very versatile the are comfortable and do just what they are intended for comfort glad i waited to pick these up as soon as they became available again
i ordered this bag really thinking it was gon na be great i am a huge fan of the swissgear stuff first day one of the pulls fell off . after a week i have one pull left for each one of the pockets where there was # idk who to contact in regards to getting a replacement but im very disappointed with this product
i have used this for the last # months for work and school at times i have really stuffed it , and it held up well i usually carry at least one laptop -lrb- and power cable -rrb- , an ipad , a notebook , and a textbook i also carry various smaller items -lrb- headphones , pens , etc . . from a comfort perspective , i have no complaints it 's nice and compact after the first # months , the zippers started to break -lrb- one by one -rrb- i 'm repairing them as they go , but it 's a pain , and unexpected for the money , the bag should have lasted much longer without these types of issues
i bought this as a replacement for my # year old swiss pack that the zipper broke the backpack seems smaller than the other one i had it does not have enough small compartments for me i use mine for international travel and keep business cards , hotel cards , memory sticks , money , and other little stuff that i want to keep seperate but accessable overall made well and may hold a # in laptop but it will not be great for a week or two of travel i like to keep extra stuff in case my luggage is lost overnight would be fine overall quality seems good but not what i was looking for size and compartment wise the smaller size might work good for someone else i bought # in sierra at costco for $ # -lrb- great deal and good quality -rrb- that is bigger and has better small compartments for me
thought i got a good deal , but it turns out to be any other backpack the material of the backpack is very very nice but the strap begin to show slight tear within a month of use and i do n't even put a lot of heavy material in it i 'm very disappointed besides the shoulder strap issue , the backpack is a beauty
after several hours of use , one of the side straps had ripped off -lrb- without <unk> damage -rrb- , true disappointment nevertheless -lrb- after the repair -rrb- i can say that the backpack is well designed , with lot of pockets sleeve for laptop is not very padded , but provides lot of space for laptop , ipad and cables together pocket on the back for wallet is very handy for travelling so , i am not sure whether to recommend or not
the product page <unk> that this backpack would fit most # & # # ; but it barely -lrb- like , it almost does n't close -rrb- fits my dell xps # other than that , it 's a great bag comfortable to carry , with a plethora of pockets ; i havent even found a use for all of them yet the extra containers on the shoulder straps are also appreciated - they 're great for sunglasses and a flash drive
well - i 've been buying wenger gear for years while more <unk> than most - the quality and workmanship was always better than you would find <unk> looks like wenger is going with the times though - while still more expensive than most - this bags material and hardware are not up to their previous <unk> zippers seem flimsy - material is much thinner - and - seems substantially cheaper than previous products the bag is ok - but - nothing better than you can pick up in <unk> a bit disappointed
just as i mentioned in the title , the quality does n't feel good although it will do the work for you it should have been far more better for the price i paid that 's the problem buying these stuff online you need to <unk> hand , on these kind of stuff before buying
the design for this bag is great ; good number of slots for storing different items ; fits my # & # # ; macbook pro however , the workmanship is bad straps with flaws , and certain sections of the bag is sewn out of alignment i love this bag , but if the workmanship is better it would be a perfect bag for me
i use it almost every day it is a good size , without being huge it could use some more organizer pockets , in the compartments however , it carries all of my gear , without too much trouble one star removed due to lack of organizational pockets
it 's light , has ample storage , and fits around your shoulders well my only gripe is that pocket with the vertical zippers at the front it 's just not very ergonomic not sure what it 's supposed to be for
you see them in airports , etc . the classic black swiss gear bag i travel a lot , and had sold my last backpack , and was in need of something new when amazon had a huge sale on the sa # , i jumped at the chance this bag has a ton of room for all my equipment , and protects my laptop nicely it seems to be holding up so far
this is a very well made backpack that i got on a goldbox deal for $ # however , the # # feature listed in the description above and on the tag attached to the backpack is an `` audio interface `` the card describes this as `` internal pocket to secure and hold most mp # players with an external headphone port `` . i 've been all over the backpack , but there is not an external headphone port i also went to the wenger site and it makes no mention of the `` audio interface `` in the description of this model took away a star due to the bad description but it 's not a deal-breaker still a very nice computer backpack
