i do n't have a mac but i do have a dell # in laptop this backpack 's laptop sleeve fit my laptop perfectly and provides good protection it is a little darker than what it is in the picture i would assume it is because of the light anyway , it has a lot of space in the one large pocket i 'm satisfied with this purchase i hope this backpack lasts me for quite a while
very nice to use and it fits well my # inch retina display macbook it does not look cheap i can put a lot of things with my mac i just wish the macbook container can be removed or detached if i want to
best bag ever for your laptop buy it now i do n't go anywhere without it there is a place in the middle to secure your laptop safely and two other sections for everything else i have a dell <unk> , a thick notebook , my planner , a <unk> calculator , a book , and my nook and it 's still super thin and sleek there is also a small pocket for pens and stuff
the bag was everything i wanted and more i think i will purchase a larger one just so i can put more stuff in it i got a mac book air # . # inch as a birthday gift i also have an ipad and they fit wonderfully inside my bag and still with room for a thin text book and a # subject notebook the inside pocket can house your keys or maybe your cords i hung up my purse because the bag is just so cute i get compliments on how soft the straps are i love my bag an will be buying a larger size
i love this bag it is cute , the handle is the perfect size to carry or fit over the shoulder it holds several file folders , my notebook and keeps my ipad safe in its ' own zipped area it is just what i was looking for
i love this bag , i have a # year old and it is so hard trying to find a bag that i can carry my computer around and not have to have # different bags on my arm it is functional and i get so many compliments on how cute it is i use it for everyday use and it doubles as a computer bag without being bulky buy it ! ! definately worth the money ! ! !
i was so excited to receive the item the day after i ordered it it is very cute and my # macbook air fits perfectly in the center zipper compartment and there is another zipper for my wallet and room to add notebooks and pens and looks very cute , more like a shoulder bag than a laptop
bag i already had , but it was stolen from me the reason for this was the first purchase , it is very practical and thanks to neoprene waterproof and still looks good a choice of design because i love polka dots
i use this bag whenever i have to carry my # . # inch hp laptop around it fits well in the centre pocket i can also slot in my mini ipad next to my laptop in the main compartment , i can store the laptop cable , a notepad for work , a small make-up pouch and a wristlet sometimes , i would even find space to slot in a packed sandwich for lunch also handy to have the smaller but deep pocket at the side to hold keys and <unk> , etc . this bag 's support is great as it feels lighter on my shoulders too this bag works for me
it keeps the laptop secure , and i can stick my laptop in it and put it in my backpack and take it wherever i go , and i do n't need to worry about ruining my laptop
this is a handsome , well-made padded bag that i bought for my macbook air # & # # ; i do n't believe however that it was made exclusively for that machine as it does n't fully conform to the -lrb- unusual -rrb- shape of the mba -lrb- more <unk> than one would expect . this means that there is some play at the top of the bag -- it can probably accommodate more <unk> laptops i bought this because i was tired of <unk> <unk> -- this one has a more textured look and feel and is very pleasing to the eye and touch
i wanted a sleeve for the macbook air that would protect it but not be too bulky and this is just what i hoped it would be the zippered compartment on the outside is excellent for any small papers that i have
nice fabric - a great change from neoprene my # `` macbook air fits well , with enough clearance that i do n't worry about scratching it when zipping the sleeve closed the lining is quilted , also a nice touch , and there 's a good bit of insulation at the bottom and edges of the main compartment the front pocket is attractively finished with an invisible zipper -lrb- a tailoring term for a type of zipper that 's hidden inside the seam with only its pull tab showing -rrb- the pocket lies flat when empty , but i 've confirmed that it will expand enough to hold both the power <unk> and the bigger extension power cord as well as my bluetooth mouse all those things together fill the pocket to capacity , and i usually do n't carry all of them there , but that capacity will be handy when packing up the mba for a trip this sleeve was well designed and seems well constructed , though it 's new and therefore its durability yet to be tested i 'm happy to use it to carry my mba around , usually inside a tote bag
i really like the look and comfort of this backpack , and the cell phone pocket is really convenient , but two immediate concerns upon unpacking # -rrb- the built-in laptop sleeve does n't seem to fit a # inch macbook pro its own padded sleeve case the backpack 's sleeve probably provides enough protection for the computer , but when inserted by itself into the backpack sleeve by itself , the macbook flops around against my back , which is really really annoying i 'm going to see if i can rig a <unk> solution to make it work and will report back # -rrb- the lining material seems pretty flimsy and i can imagine it ripping if any <unk> object is placed in the backpack in addition , there are already some minor signs of wear in the material near the top zipper and on the straps time will tell if these prove to be problems , and i 'll update with what i find out
if you get tired of you old nylon bag coming apart at the seams , buy a canvas bag & it will last you forever this one 's solid & the bottom has a patch of faux leather that great if you accidentally lay it on a damp surface i like the padded sleeve for the notebook best i take this bag on the plane with me & it can fit well under a seat even fully packed
i got this for college and it 's great-looking , sturdy , and suits my needs perfectly the laptop sleeve in the back is one of the best features because i know that my laptop is well protected back there i highly recommend this backpack
i bought this backpack for my high school daughter and she can easily fit her binders , books , pens , <unk> and more in this it has so far been the best backpack she has had for school and we usually have to replace it <unk> as others have not lasted but this will definitely carry her throughout the entire school year
i 'm a college student and needed a bag that could handle carrying a lot of books the bag has held up well , and i get a lot of compliments on it i was nervous the bottom part would look terrible after awhile because i 'm really rough on my backpacks , but the wearing actually makes it look better
i was looking for a simplistic design , because i wanted to do some of my own graphic art on the front the canvas material was great for this also i have been using my new backpack all semester and have n't had any issues what so ever i also have plenty of room for all my book and binders , and none of the <unk> are breaking -lrb- i read this before for this backpack -rrb- i feel that it will last many years to come
the <unk> board fabric looks great in the picture but in reality the black and white are very dull , also the stitching is sloppy the rating was # star so i mistakenly believed it would look as nice as the picture
i am happy w / the ` padding ' for my laptop , if i drop it i feel it will be protected the product looks exactly like what was shown in the photo on amazon.com the delivery time was accurate & i have no complaints about the
case is well made with & # # ; squishy & # # ; fabric gives my laptop great protection design is nice fit 's a little big , but i like that since i can fit my mini mouse in there with the laptop overall a great purchase would definitely recommend
i am soo happy with this laptop case ! it has been really durable and a great deal for the price it protects my laptop while in my backpack i would totally recommend this to other people
definitely was everything that i asked for it zippers all the way open so i dont have to pull out , i can leave as is and work on it has slots inside to hold the lap top <unk> like it
inexpensive , i bought this for a gateway # . # & # # ; screen , it fits snugly with room , the two straps inside keeps the laptop in place so there is minimum movement while traveling it does have a nice padding not thick to say you drop your lap top and it would survive , but for day to day in and outs , around campus it 's perfect
i absolutely love this case for my hp laptop it fits perfectly , and it came on time it 's squishy so if you ever drop your laptop or sling it around just a little to much it should be okay the case looks exactly like it does in the picture -lrb- but bigger of course -rrb-
for the price i paid , i got just what i hoped for a sleeve that protects my notebook while it it in my backpack the sleeve saved me the difference between a sleeve and the price of a backpack
i got this for my new computer and the case was the wrong size completely it was way too big i ignored the other ratings because i thought maybe they just measured their computer wrong but thats not the case it is not # & # # ; it was at least # & # # ; the keyboard cover was nice but it was all messed up i would suggest going a different route for computer covers plus the computer cover and keyboard cover were different colors of blue
the images are way too <unk> the apple symbol does not shine through like that ; it is covered completely i hate this product i would n't even give it one star and the colors are at least ten times more pale than as photographed
i ordered the & # # ; turquoise hot blue & # # ; cover and i am so totally disappointed the color is dull and it is a light tiffany blue and nothing like what i ordered i 'm so irritated it 's totally solid so you ca n't see the apple logo through it either the case keeps slipping too i never write bad reviews but this is ridiculous i 'd debating returning it and getting something that i actually want it does n't fit either
this item arrived , quickly and fit the computer well within a month one of the tabs broke off on the front of the case so it became a little loose on the computer about # months into it the bottom has cracked and the corners of the bottom section have cracked and fallen off at this point i need to replace it as it no longer provides any protection and looks poor
ive had this several months now , and it has become brittle and cracked from heat on the bottom also , the keyboard cover is great , but not a perfect fit and constantly has a <unk> of air underneath it has saved me from some spills though
i got what i was promised in a timely manner and it was in good shape the only thing i 'm unhappy about is the rubber keyboard cover has a flaw in it so it does n't fit perfect i still use it though and its fine
when i first got the set , i loved it the color is awesome however , i had it for a few months and it cracked in various places i do take my laptop everywhere though
i purchased this product a while ago to protect my computer i absolutely love the color and i felt that it was a decent price for a # piece set , especially since it was made for a macbook everywhere i go i get compliments on the color and am asked where i got the case from : -rrb- however , a couple problems i faced with this is that the bottom `` feet `` are n't applied very well and one or two have fallen off already i suppose that is easily fixed with super glue , but i was surprised that they were n't applied a little better i 'm also having issues with the outside bottom edges of the case cracking , but it could be that i 'm just too hard on it anyway , as a whole i 'm really happy with this case and would definitely recommend it
the macbook cover fit nicely , as well as the keyboard i am very satisfied for the price i paid for this product the rubberized keyboard does have a slight wave but it has n't been an issue for
product came on time the case was a birthday present for a friend as far as i 'm aware of they love it and claim it protects her mac just fine
i love this case the color is to die for , i get compliments all the time both the shell and the keyboard cover fit perfectly on my computer too one thing that is a downside is the outside of the case gets dirty really easily i 've only had my case for a few weeks , and between lugging my computer to class and ` using it at home it 's formed marks and smudges
nice smooth , rubberized case it is not the clear hard see thru plastic if you are worried about that its nice and smooth the color was a bit lighter than i was expecting i thought it would be a brighter tiffany color but its more a lighter color almost like a pastel rather than a bright tiffany color but i still like the case and it does the job
i actually really like this product about six months ago had bought the same package , but in blue and just bought this one for my girlfriend it fit just right and ads character to the mac the only thing i 'm not crazy about are the keys the keyboard cover i received for my blue one was already coming apart , and the purple had some purple keys scratched off it also makes it a little more difficult to type fast , but still looks cool one last thing would be that the key pad does n't keep out dirt and dust if thats what you wanted it is better than not having one though
love this case , did n't take too long to come in after <unk> the only thing i did n't like is the fact that it 's not as bright as shown in the picture , but it 's still a nice colour
i love the color of the case , and it is not only very protective of my computer , but also has a nice soft feeling to it the one thing that i was n't very happy about was the fact that you ca n't see the apple logo through the case also , the keyboard cover does not perfectly match up overall , i would purchase this product again
i got a macbook and immediately went to amazon to invest in a case to protect my investment i decided on this one because it is satin , which means it wo n't be harshly scratched like the plastic hardshell cases , and its super soft to the touch this is a combo package because you get a <unk> to go with the case overall , i 'm head over heels for the case , and the green if you love a bold green , then this is the case for you i would have given it <unk> accept for the keyboard cover the cover does n't line up with keys and the light <unk> from the keys does n't shine through , very disappointing , but this seems to be a very common issues with keyboard covers the keyboard cover fits like a glove and reduces the amount of noise while typing i must say though , the keys will be a bit harder to push but it helps keep food and crumbs out very fast shipping
the case is a great colour -lrb- orange -rrb- fits perfectly on my macbook pro has a nice feel to it , hard enough for protection and a bit of a grippy feel to it so it wo n't slip out of my hand easily the only reason i gave it # stars is because of the keyboard cover it stays on the keys fairly well but it has a gap around the outer edges allowing dust and debris to get in the outer keys other than that i am very happy with it
i was a little disappointed with not receiving that rich , tiffany blue colour but pastel shades of colour with a little tint of green instead the colour was not vibrant as displayed in the pictures , and the keyboard cover was a different shade of blue but it is still a gorgeous colour with a smooth , rubbery , hard surface i have received countless compliments the case , and i love it ! but wish that there was a case that was actually that exact shocking hot blue with a matching keyboard
i just got mine in the mail today the teal is so true to color ! that i love it fits my # inch macbook pro only two flaws my computer makes a sound when i open it because of the case # it 's going to take awhile to get used to the keyboard cover , i 'm not sure if i 'm going to be leaving it on overall good product & # # ;
this was both the perfect texture and color for my laptop it is durable , fashionable , and i love it it looks just like the picture it did not come with the keyboard cover , so it loses a star , but i did n't intend to use it so i 'm not too upset about it
i do love this product ... it fits perfectly on my macbook pro , it looks great and protects it is inexpensive , which is good ... one reason being it cracks on the edges , both of mine have cracked before owning it for a year the upside is for the price it does it 's job and when you get another one there are numerous colors to choose from sidenote : i have tried other brands and they crack as well kuzy lasts the longest
great shade of purple a bit more expensive than others , but i have to look at it all day , so it was worth the cost for a color i enjoy
the item was just as promised , of sturdy construction and i was extremely pleased when it arrived if you are looking for a cover for your pro ... this is the one you must get
love this case it costs less than most & looks exactly like the pictures the keyboard cover looks cheap but fits the keyboard fine only $ # so did n't expect anything exceptional regardless , i definitely recommend
this is a great purchase for computer lovers it is a safe way to keep your macbook pro from scratches the color was everything i hoped for and i especially love the keyboard cover
i just got a new mac book pro for my college graduation and really wanted a cover like this for it i have a few close friends that have similar covers by the brand incase and they paid over $ # for them this case is so cute i decided to purchase this product based on al of the good reviews that i read but i was still skeptical it was all true the color is just the picture and i love the feel of the case too it came way ahead of the <unk> delivery day and snapped very easily onto my lap top i have only had it a few days but am already so happy with the look , feel and fit of this case i am so glad that i did not pay for a more expensive case that is overpriced very happy with my purchase and would definitely recommend to a friend
i just received my kuzy aqua blue hard case and keyboard cover for my # `` macbook pro ! ! it came in great packaging i did n't know how light the aqua blue was going to be , but it 's the right shade and everything i did n't want it to be too light because i 'm a guy lol they keyboard case fits perfectly , it will take some getting use to , but i hardly notice that it 's on now and i just got it today i will eventually buy # or two more cases from this retailer because they are great quality and the shipping was fast and everything was how it was suppose to be :
i bought this in amazon.com because i was not able to find something like this in amazon . es or amazon . uk all items i had seen are low quality on sight i gave some credit to this case , and ordered when i received , touched and placed in macbook i <unk> that i 've done a good shopping . # % recommended
the added color to my computer is very <unk> the actual color is a little <unk> , a bit warmer than what my computer monitor shows -lrb- a cool <unk> turquoise -rrb- but i like both <unk>
better than i expected , this hard case fits my # & # # ; macbook pro perfectly it needed no adjustments and snapped on in seconds it was well packaged and protected and was exactly the color i was hoping for i would highly recommend getting this to protect your precious mac since they seem to scratch pretty easy
gives my computer <unk> protection and make it easy to find and identify it my computer get <unk> around every were and takes a lot of abuse this cover has helped keep it more protected i would defiantly recommend it
this product is amazing i got it sooner than i expected , which is awesome everything about it is really great ! the only thing i noticed is that my keyboard cover is kind of dirty i still love it :
i love this case for my mac book pro i have green , purple and blue - the green is by far the <unk> and coolest looking simple to use and the keyboard cover is awesome
i absolutely love this kuzy case for my macbook pro # inch it fits perfectly and the shade of blue is really cute it matches the color in the picture to a t. my estimated delivery was friday - wednesday and it arrived on friday perfect way to start my weekend ! i also love that the color is has a matt finish and feels soft love this product
this is just what i wanted ! great product . the color is a bit lighter but still , its beautiful . the texture is perfect . i highly recommend this case its the best
i has a speck case for my # model macbook laptop and after # years of constant use , it started to peel the rubber off of the case it lasted a long time and i was happy with it what i was not happy with is the price of a new speck case i searched , read many reviews and took a chance on the kuzy rubberized satin hard case and to be truthful , wonder why anyone would order from the competition it is a superior case , easy to apply , very protective and comfortable in the hand i would have no hesitation whatsoever to order again from kuzy great deal and great case
was looking for a simple , durable case for my new laptop this had the simplicity i value in any product i buy received in a flash and clipped right onto my computer clear is good for now excited to change colors later
first let me say i love my case ! however , after a few weeks it started cracking on the edges on both sides of the computer -lrb- i did not drop it -rrb- i sent pictures to the seller and told them the issue and they sent me another one out really quickly i am so impressed with the customer service i will be buying again when i decide to change the color one day soon i recommend this product to anyone thinking of buying
as long as you have made sure to order this specifically for your specific macbookpro , the fit is fantastic , the product snaps on easily though the bottom can be a bit loose at times , this is an excellent protective covering with air vents underneath to let the heat escape i recommend keeping it on a flat surface when using it for long periods of time so it is allowed to & # # ; breathe & # # ; the keyboard cover <unk> falls into place , and i found that typing was much easier with it on the looks is attractive , as you get the advantage of the <unk> , so the apple logo glows through the back , and they keyboard lights shine through the keyboard cover i would buy this product again the purple color is fun glad i decided to go with a color
fit my # & # # ; mac like a glove others love the color and comment on it all the time i love it nice texture too the keyboard cover is good too kind of hard to see the keyboard lights tho so you have to turn up the brightness up more if you want which runs down the battery more but i really like it
keeps my mac completely covered and keeps it looking nice . . see through enough to still see my decal and fits just right while letting it cool down as it needs . . no problems
# % satisfied came early in the mail , no complications , will buy from this seller again ! the case is a tiffany blue color and the keyboard cover fits super snug . im in love
its only been # months i have the macbook cover and keyboard cover and its been giving me a lot of problems since the first day the case has cracked and chipped from several spots , it is providing no protection to my macbook and the keyboard cover does n't sit correctly almost since the second week and it is <unk> it is very difficult and uncomfortable to type ! what a waste of money plus i have got no replacement or refund <unk> dont buy ! extremely disappointed with amazon and this
the color is supposed to be purple but is actually a hot pink i do n't really like the color i had wanted purple not pink it does not match the key board cover which is purple they need to fix this
it 's a decent case for the price i do n't think there 's anything wrong with it the only thing that made me a little confused was the color it 's more of a magenta purple than a purple purple at first i was a little mad but for a price this great , it 's definitely a catch
my keyboard cover is a lot lighter in color compared to the cover i love the color of the cover though also , the bottom part of the cover does n't stay on very well
i love the case , it really <unk> the computer it seems protective thus far and it was easy to put on the computer i like the keyboard cover , but it does take some getting used to and can be a bit hard to type on at first i think it 's a great product
i would recommend this product to anyone my macbook pro will look good as new forever the keyboard cover is a little hard to get use to , but is beneficial
this case is pretty , and the price is great , but if you put a case on the ipad , it is a tough , job to get it in and out of the case
the case is ok i think it 's too small for my tablet i really have too put in work to get the tablet in the case and it 's already starting to show that it 's not durable , on the side of the case it started ripping i had to take out the <unk> and thread and sew a little section of it i 'm not surprised though it was under $ #
nice case for # . # `` android tablet enclosed in an # `` folio case with usb keyboard there is still room left over the larger front pocket holds my # `` <unk> gps & the mini pocket is perfect for the tablet stylus , mini micro usb cord , pens , etc . all around a great little case/bag for tablets my only wish is if it had a handle for carrying for easier portability when your hands are full other than that no complaints
it 's a great case for my ipad i love the color pink it has two pockets for your cell phone , pens , etc . it appears in nice quality , nice zipper and nice fabric great price too
this case is great ! just as advertised , but i wish my keyboard would fit in it , that 's okay tho , i 'd recommend putting a cheap hard case on your ipad as well just for extra protection ! even though it did n't fit my keyboard as well i 'm still giving it a # star cuz it 's a very nice
perfect size , great color , padding is just right i also purchased a skin for my tablet and it 's a little tight fitting in the case , but it still does happy with the product
i love it . ! the color is great . ! ! its soft and stretchy the shipping didnt take long it looks a bit smaller than my other cases but im sure its for the snug fit
this case is exactly what is advertized i think it is for an ipad # st gen , so the ipad # has some room inside just enough to carry a keyboard , or whatever you may have need to carry it smells a bit at first , but that is the nature of neoprene a little air and it is good
it 's simply not constructed right -- the top panel of the case is too big so the elastic tabs on the corners ca n't hold onto the screen of the # . # & # # ; macbook pro the lower panel that comes up over the bottom does n't fit right either i bought this for my son and wanted to return it , but he 's keeping it because all he really wanted was something to protect the exterior , and he 's willing to put up with the floppy top i would n't if it were mine
i order this case because it looked very chic and functional a big disappointment it does not fit my macbook pro # inch the elastic corner holders do not work it seems like the case is too big and the computer does not stay secure in place
i read some of the reviews and was giving it the benefit of doubt i should have read where the back does n't stay on how can you give it a # star rating when you , the buyer says the strap wo n't stay on if you open the laptop like the photo shows , it 's ok but if you open it any wider it wo n't work the bottom fits good but the top will not stay on when you open the laptop i am sure there are a lot better products out there
i rate it # stars because if you open the lid of the macbook pro too much the little black elastic bands will slide off and the front cover of the leather case with fall down overall though it 's a really nice leather case and it most definitely helps keep it from getting scratches or dents
it fits my macbook pro # & # # ; nicely however , i noticed that it is kind of heavy when i hold the macbook pro in my hands after installing it it might not be so mobile after all
it looks much more expensive than it is , but the top always slips off because of the design , but that is a common problem with all of these types of cases
it is great and looks beautiful it fits my computer well only thing i can hold against it is that it does n't cover the corners besides that it is amazing , it is very classy as
i love this unique design of macbook pro case that i ever owned i got it because it looks very unique & sleek design made me get this it looks like protecting the macbook pro fairly good , soft leather cover scratch <unk> the brand new macbook pro however , since case is <unk> the <unk> into unibody , easy to get heat up on bottom of the case if you are planned to use it for heavy load of work , you should n't use this case because it 's going to heat up really easily however , if you plan to go starbucks or <unk> usage , than you must use it ! ! it is sexy case
i love this cover the color is perfect and it covers my macbook pro # & # # ; perfectly but the little problem is with the keyboard protector which is a little <unk> because anytime i type , it moves anyway , it 's a good price for laptop protector and it is great quality and very awesome pink color :
this sleeve is very nice with good fit and excellent details in manufacturing the leather is a nice touch i wanted to get one for my white macbook -lrb- not pro -rrb- but did not fit
i love this case , it fits my # inch laptop very well and so far , it stays shut with the magnetic clasp i looked for several days at several reviews <unk> to find a good leather case , and i am so glad that i made this purchase
this was a replacement cover for my wife 's macbook pro , i is very handsome and seems to be a very quality product especially for the price the package was good and the shipment was on time
i got tired of those macbook <unk> that were hard to remove and clean until i found this and gave it a try well , i 'm not disappointed at all it fits well on my macbook pro # , a good material , and it does the job well very easy to clean and remove plus , there 's the keyboard protector that comes with it i 'm happy with this purchase i just wish there were more colors to choose from
it 's a really good case , my <unk> loves it . ! ! the case is good quality , i wish i bought one for myself i just might just purchase another one for myself
i love this case it looks professional and class when i bring it into meetings it has a great fit and i have not had any issues initially i was worried about the computer getting too hot , however i have not experienced that so far the keyboard cover that is included is low quality , but that is n't the reason i bought this item so i still gave a # star rating i think that the case is a good value and is a bargain for the quality i highly recommend this item
this is a sleek case that makes my macbook get noticed so many people compliment me on it how awesome my computer looks i also love the leather on the top where my wrists rest while i type
shipping was really fast the case fits like a glove and looks really classy i thought where the leather hit the keyboard would be awkward , but it is far from it love , love , love it
