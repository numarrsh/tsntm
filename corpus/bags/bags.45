i just love this bag the compartments are wonderful my # & # # ; macbook pro and its protective shell case fits perfectly inside the laptop part the graphic design is very pretty and looks great
i loved the bag as soon as i took it out of the box the background color is a little off it 's more of a <unk> than white ... but truthfully with the pink it 's shows beautifully the inside is well padded for protection of your computer there are lots of little pockets for all the necessities that you might need to carry such as documents , extra hard drive or whatever the outside can be cleaned with a <unk> <unk> which is great all in all a great bag i give it a a +
this bag took awhile to get to me , but once i received it , it was the best laptop bag i have had to date the laptop compartment is padded on every side , including the bottom and you have enough room to carry multiple notebooks and small books in the other pocket in the main compartment the zipper pockets are n't deep enough to hold a graphing calculator , but they can hold things such as my wireless mouse and other computer necessities when you are on the go the bag has a corduroy interior for the flap which is very soft this bag is also very comfortable to carry with an adjustable strap indeed the bag is grey , but white gets dirty really fast and the grey on the bag is easy to keep clean i have a # . # `` laptop and it fits quite comfortably in the laptop compartment i would recommend this bag to anyone with a laptop that would fit it
this laptop bag was a gift to my niece as she headed off to college she loved it from the minute she got the package opened once at school she appreciated the many compartments and the protection of the padded laptop space the unique design of the graphic adds personality , and the color is so hip
this bag looks just like the picture and is well padded for my laptop the strap is soft and wide and makes it easy to carry over my shoulder when traveling
this messenger bag is absolutely perfect for my macbook i 'm super paranoid about my computer -lrb- it was quite expensive ! -rrb- , and i go to great lengths to keep it safe the messenger bag has so far proven to be a great buy it 's roomy enough for the computer and its cord , and it has enough pockets to slip in extra things like flash drives and my external hard drive the strap seems strong and the weight distributes pretty well usually i find messenger bags tough to carry , but this is the most comfortable messenger bag i 've ever had the only thing i could wish for would be a zipper , but i have the matching laptop sleeve , so it 's not a huge deal
i have to say my expectations for this product were not exceptionally high however , i was very pleasantly surprised by the quality of the bag and how well planned it is as a computer <unk> bag my friends comment on how lovely it is and it is very easy to tell my bag when i am traveling and need to grab my things to head for a flight i was so impressed by this product that i purchased the matching computer cover pouch i highly recommend this product
i adore this bag my # inches macbook air fits perfectly and has extra space it has plenty of pockets and room to fit all my school notebooks the image or flowers are really well placed on the bag , they are not a sticker or there is no worry that it might fade over all excellent shoulder bag
this is a great laptop bag there 's a extra padded section inside with a velcro strap to keep the laptop separate from the other items in the bag it 's not to heavy even with the laptop i 've gotten so many compliments on it
i accidentally got this bag and my computer was the # inch instead of the # inch but i still love it . it has a good amount of padding to protect my laptop the strap is comfortable . and since i accidentally got the size bigger , the bag holds all of my cables and if i want to carry any books or movies with me i can do that
i have been using this bag for over two school years and it still looks brand new i 've had to wash it once thanks to a coffee spill and it held up well i have space for a laptop , charger , couple binders and books the strap is wide and comfortable the colors are beautiful i get compliments on the bag all the time
this bag is so cute , but practical too it fits a # `` laptop well with extra pockets and openings i bought this for my # year old niece and she absolutely loves it
i bought the bag as a gift and i was n't sure how well it would fit a # `` laptop to my great surprise the bag was perfect and still even had extra room nice for traveling and taking to school it can even hold extra documents and supplies with the added pockets the design is very nice and the person i bought it for loved how it looked it has velcro at the bottom of the flap for keeping it closed so it is n't extra secure but still no issues with losing anything inside awesome buy and value
this is great - holds my computer and also all my school stuff pockets that are easy to access love the color , but with wear i am seeing some coloring issues in the pink part
very nice bag and holds my laptop in `` comfort `` with the padding around the sides lovely color too very pleased with it i used it when i was travelling this summer and it holds all of the cords , supplies etc . that you need highly <unk> it
i love this bag i was looking for one in the stores and they were all pretty ugly and plain this has plenty of room to hold my computer and more
lots of room for your books , pencils , calculator , etc , and different little pockets when you first open it that you can put in your cellphone , ipod , etc . great for school , college , wherever
my daughter takes everything to school and back home again this bag has held up much better than i thought , plus the quality of the bag is nicer that i had imagined the bag is easy to wipe off , both the front and strap i honestly thought this bag would rip on the sides , but it shows no signs of wear or strain like the other messenger bags my kid has used i would definately buy this again
i bought this for my macbook and it fits perfectly the colors are just as pictured , and it 's super cute the pouches and sleeves are perfect for cords , pens etc . it 's a bit bigger than i thought , but i love it
my laptop bag was falling apart , so i needed a new i picked this one mostly for the cool design on front -lrb- it reminded me of cherry <unk> -rrb- the bag fits my viao perfectly the main pouch for laptops is very well padded on the sides and on the bottom the flap -lrb- cool <unk> material inside -rrb- and drawstring combination work to make the laptop fit perfectly moreover , the shoulder strap has a suede-like feel which makes it much more <unk> than the simple nylon straps you find on most bags so all these things together make me feel like my laptop is well cared for in this bag there is an <unk> compartment for books inside and two smaller zippered pouches are good for pens , mouse , flash drive , etc . this laptop bag was one of the few times where style was also really <unk>
this bag is such a great fit for my wife 's new computer a little tight at first , but that 's fine - no room to jiggle about - we 've had it for several months now and it is as nice as the day we got it received as advertised
i purchased this bag for my daughter because this year at her school all the kids get `` their own `` laptop i was looking for something well padded , and roomy enough to fit both an average sized laptop and all the school books , binders etc . we have both been quite pleased with the quality , and the roominess of the compartments of this bag the shoulder strap adjusts quite easily and is wide enough that it does n't cut into the shoulder the only thing we 're not crazy about is the velcro closure for the outside flap , however , since the larger pockets zip shut , so far this has not caused any problems if we needed another messenger bag we would certainly purchase another one of these
in addition to it 's asian flare , which i love , it is light weight i <unk> purchasing a laptop case because i thought it would be too <unk> , but this one is sporty and complements my style on top of everything else , it was exceptionally reasonable great buy ; great accessory
the quality of the bag is much better than i expected it is well put together and carries not only my laptop , but a few heavy school books comfortably it fits my laptop perfectly and is really well padded i was only a little disappointed with the strap because it 's not as long as i like my messenger bags to be other than that , this bag is great
i really like the bag i love the pockets , the strap is comfortable -lrb- no hard plastic -rrb- , and the design is super cute the only thing that has confused me is that there is some velcro -lrb- the <unk> type -rrb- patches on the inside of the big flap , but there are no velcro patches for them to attach to not a big deal , but it is odd that they would have the hooking velcro with out the loop velcro either have both or none maybe mine 's defective
this bag is perfect for my daily needs it has nice , zippered pockets in the front for extras like my thumb drive and external mouse my macbook is nicely padded and stays safe and cozy i get lots of compliments on pattern as well my favorite part is the nice , wide strap to protect my aching shoulders
i bought this backpack for school , i am a <unk> student and carry # textbooks a day plus binders , notebooks , and my laptop all of my things fit easily and comfortably in this bag but it overwhelmed my small frame , particularly the straps the straps are <unk> padded , so much so that it looked like i was strapped into a roller <unk> when wearing the bag i am # ' # & # # ; and slender so it 's very possible that this would n't be an issue for larger people with broader frames
it 's ok i 've had a lot of backpacks including swiss gear . i would n't have bought this one if i noticed it did n't have a chest strap this makes it rest a bit uncomfortably on the back . the rest of the pack is solid . lots of room , straps , and pockets
i like this bag and it is a decent size but for my busy days when i have three <unk> and multiple <unk> to carry it gets crowded also the seam inside the middle pocket rip a little two weeks after using it , i may have overstuffed it a little but still that should happen two weeks after getting it the outside is pretty durable and the side pockets are great for keys or water bottles overall i like the bag i just expected a little bit more
i bought this bag for my wife it was good while it lasted : -lrb- i do admit she was abusive towards the bag ... but i thought it would last a little longer before the stitches started popping , fabric tearing apart . . etc . i really liked the padding at the bottom that helped the bag to stand upright i am not sure if it was my wife or the bag but it lasted about # months :
while this pack seems sturdy , extremely well-made , nice looking and fairly priced it is <unk> limited in storage space we were looking for something extra roomy for a busy high school student and had to send this back as it ca n't fit more than two average size binders and maybe a bagged lunch . :
i use this for college it is great for my computer and all but the middle compartment is pretty small i ca n't put much in it all in all it is a great bag it has lasted for an entire year with no rips , tears , scuff i would recommend
this is the # nd swissgear backpack that i 've purchased and i 'm very pleased with the quality of the materials and style this purchase was for an # year old so i did n't want a huge backpack ; the # `` is just right for his back however , i am disappointed by lack of space in the main compartment of the bag it 's a tight fit for two # `` binders and a couple of reading books -lrb- <unk> novels -rrb- if he carried a computer , the reading books would n't fit his previous backpack fit the binders and his lunch bag i rate this bag # / # stars -lrb- ca n't show # star -rrb- ... # stars for quality but only # stars for space
the swissgear # . # inch <unk> backpack is a nice looking backpack that does the job ... whether you 're packing a laptop , tablet or hiking supplies i found it comfortable to carry and versatile enough to carry all of my electronic equipment i recommend it to anyone needing a safe way to carry their school or overnight items comfortably and stylishly
it 's not a bad backpack i use it for air travel and it has n't ripped or torn , and all of the zippers work perfectly i just wish it had a bigger main pocket my previous <unk> bag was much bigger on the inside
this bag is very spacious and works great for my needs i looked everywhere before i bought it and could n't find anyone that had fit a laptop larger than # `` in hopes that i will save someone the hassle of searching , this bag will fit a # `` macbook pro -lrb- # nd <unk> -rrb- nicely , but there is n't much room to spare my laptop measures # `` h x # . # `` w x # . # `` d . if your laptop is any larger , you may have issues my only complaint is that the adjustment straps are unnecessarily long , but otherwise it 's a great backpack
i think that for the price , this is ok seems to be well constructed , but the placement of the little pockets inside and the excessive length of the shoulder straps detracts also , it would have been nice if the laptop <unk> accessible from one of the zipper sides i am sure that this will be useful , but i would n't buy another one like it
the backpack arrived very quickly service was very fast and the item was brand new great condition as specified by seller backpack was what i expected as shown in the picture very comfortable to wear like the padding on it , specially for my computer although i wish the side pocket would be a little more forgiving so i can place my plastic water bottle i actually love the backpack , and the price was great for the kind of bag it is
i love the look of this backpack and it has some really good features if you use it as a laptop bag i use mine as a backpack to carry my clothes to/from the gym and i just wish this backpack was a tad bit wider when open i can fit all my clothes in but i really have to pack it in , would be perfect if it was just a bit
fits very comfortably my # year old daughter uses this for school and she loves it and she is very picky , finally found something she likes and will use
i love this backpack it has a fully padded -lrb- including the bottom -rrb- space to slide your laptop in and enough room to carry about # average-sized text books the mid compartment is great for keeping writing utensils and smaller items and the outer part is perfect for calculators , a phone or whatever it is well constructed and looks great great product at an affordable price
if given the chance to do over , i would still buy this bag the largest compartment that holds the laptop can be <unk> by pulling up the foam piece that lines the bottom so that the bag is n't so gigantic if you do n't need the space and holy straps , <unk> they are so thick , and on a girl , they look slightly ridiculous i understand it was <unk> at the male consumer , though but for me , this bag is multi-purpose i can use it for college , to the <unk> with my kids , and take it camping and hiking the thick straps will come in handy when carrying camping gear , so i 'm not complaining and my husband can carry it without feeling stupid because it 's actually a dude bag anyway
the size of the backpack was bigger than i imagined it was easily fit a # inch laptop quality of the product is also very good i would definitely recommend this product
i love this backpack it fits my needs perfectly my biggest problem was to find a bag fits my lenova # with an extra battery with good quality for a good price finally i found one
this backpack is durable , and holds my # & # # ; retina macbook pro quite well , along with my ipad in the same pocket seems to be water-resistant too , as i 've been in <unk> rain and my stuff inside stayed dry
i love this backpack i have a <unk> laptop and it fits the padded just fine the straps are great , nice and padded i highly recommend this item as always , the amazon price was great and shipping was fast
bought this a while ago , and have been using it quite extensively over the period the fit is pretty good , one needs to get the right length in order to enjoy this bag
this bag was definately worth the money and more it 's clearly made out of very durable materials and feels as thought it will last a very long time my laptop feels very safe , its got plenty of space for other stuff and it looks good too i only wish i had to take my laptop more places so i could show it off more
purchased this bag to make it easier to get through airport security i totally lived up to my expectations my dell laptop measures # & # # ; x # . # & # # ; and easily slides in and out of the laptop pouch the bag has plenty of compartments and pockets for my purposes the extra luggage strap across the <unk> of the bag worked great to secure it to my # & # # ; roller luggage handle if you need more pockets like side zipper pockets and an additional front & # # ; open & expandable & # # ; pocket then i would recommend the swissgear the sherpa or the swiss gear maxxum my friends have these and they are great too but a little more expensive because of the extra pockets all # bags have the stability feature which is great for allowing your bag to stand upright without it tipping over
i have an hp mini # series netbook it is the standard # . # inches this case does not even come close to fitting i do n't know how it fits for the other reviewers but mine is most definately the wrong size other than that , it seems like it 'd be a nice case if it actually fit properly
i ordered the product and it is to big i saw where someone else got it and it did not fit theirs either but i took a chance after looking at my mini and it was a # . # so does me no good
this is a great fit on my compaq mini # model just got the clear / frosted clear case , and love how it 's protecting my netbook , and is n't intrusive when using the computer
love this thing , all of the people with laptops in class want one easy to put on and does what it 's supposed to i do like the fold out legs and it arrived in a timely manner
just got my mcover it is awesome - love the way it tilts my <unk> you so much ... mcover clear hard shell cover case for hp / compaq mini # series netbooks -lrb- # xxx models only
the zipper on my case is already malfunctioned it wo n't close i would n't recommend it not sure if i can return it but need to figure out if that 's possible
i received this product a couple days ago , i was really excited because i could protect my macbook better while it was in my backpack upon opening the plastic bag it came in i thought it was going to be awesome , until i slide my mac in the sleeve upon sliding it in i realized it was going to be snug which is not bad until the third day when the zipper broke ... . that is right the third day buy something else because i can not recommend this product to anyone conditions of use : afghanistan for protection in backpack on my drive to/from work and living quarters ... . . failed in three days ! !
far too tight of a fit for my # & # # ; macbook pro after less than a week of use , the edges of the case are fraying to the point that it is useless to try to zip and unzip what a waste of $ #
i ordered this item , received it quickly in good condition it was a big too big for my # inch mac book pro - but that did n't really bother me i had read other reviews that mentioned a & # # ; bad & # # ; smell well after i opened it - it took me # min to realize what was making my eyes water and my <unk> burn the smell is absolutely horrendous and i 'm guessing whatever they treated the product with is probably dangerous to breathe in i had to lock it in a container and sure enough when i opened the container to return it the same thing happened do n't order this ! ! ! ! !
read the reviews and ordered the sleeve putting the macbook in the sleeve , there is still about a . # inch gap that allows the computer to move around in the sleeve itself not what i was looking for the sleeve is also a bit thin and offers only <unk> protection does not fit well into my ll bean messenger bag either completely useless for macbook pro # & # # ; w/retina display user
when i purchased this item i needed it to protect my macbook pro i 'm overseas and i travel a lot so i thought this item would help me keep my computer safe from some dust and other small damages when i received it i quickly found out that it does not fit the macbook pro # like it says it does no need on shipping it back it would take to long and i do n't have the time find something else
# -rrb- major issue : zipper used to get often stuck and now it simply does not work -lrb- out of <unk> and <unk> -rrb- the case is useless given its bad quality zipper way too expensive for the given quality # -rrb- stuffing is insufficient in case of dropping , the <unk> is too thin for preventing damage
this case does not fit the macbook pro # inch retina display model there is about an inch of extra room at the top so the computer slides around in the case it should fit like a glove might fit other models , but i did not like how it fit my new macbook pro # inch retina display
i loved this sleeve : it fit my # -inch mid- # macbook pro perfectly and had a pocket for the power cable , and even a little pocket for a usb drive but the zipper broke within # month of use , so i can not recommend it to anyone
zipper failed after owning for less than two months and the seller wo n't take it back this would be a good product aside from the zipper however with the zipper having failed it is useless stay away from his one
a lot of room in macbook pro with retina display the case is very large for the new macbook pro other then that , it would of been a great case
i purchased this case for my late # & # # ; macbook pro i loved my old marware sportfolio sleeve , but it finally gave way under heavy use unfortunately marware appears to have <unk> itself as a phone and tablet case company now , so i had to find an alternative caselogic definitely is not it first , their sleeve does not fit my macbook pro that 's right , the & # # ; caselogic pas- # -inch macbook neoprene sleeve & # # ; does not fit a # -inch macbook if it only was made for particular mbp models , then this should have been noted in the description misleading advertising aside , the caselogic pas- # arrived with a defective zipper and generally <unk> shoddy workmanship it is a very cheaply made case and i expect it would have limited durability and duration perhaps i was lucky with the marware sleeve , but by comparison this was a piece of junk
product came in the mail opened and put my laptop in . . zipper immediately failed not sure why this case has such high reviews if something so simply breaks as soon as you get it
there is a <unk> flaw in the zipper design i tried to use it just once on my # & # # ; macbook pro and the metal part of the zip tore the cloth part of the zipper for some reason , the sharp metal edge scrapes the zipper cloth very easily the product looks cool but the zipper design makes it useless
well , this is for a # & # # ; or larger if you want a snug fit buy something else ! it would be fine if you were carrying other things in the sleeve
zipper frayed on the corner when i first placed my # inch mac pro inside of it like the covering for protection but the zipper sucks . needs to be a little larger ... the fit was way to
we ordered one of these and had to send it back because the zipper was not correctly built into the case where it turns the corner so we got a second one and after exactly # times of zipping it shut the zipper is already pulling apart and will soon be broken again the case itself is very nice in material and weight but the zipper totally <unk> they need to change their design around the corner of the sleeve
the zipper was defective on arrival very disappointing since the case looks nice after reading the reviews i noticed i was n't the only one that had this issue bought the incase deluxe case instead , really nice by the way
i bought this case for my # in macbook pro but it 's so big it seems like it is for a # in i really do n't understand what happened because even the label that was attached to the case said it was # in i 'm very disappointed i did n't return it because i needed it immediately but i wish i did and i wish i followed people 's advise on previous reviews
the case is great , very soft to provide good protection for the laptop it is a very snug fit on the # inch mbp unfortunately , after only # months , a snag formed along the fabric adjacent to the zipper and it wo n't close i can no longer use the case return period is past so i will have to buy another case wo n't buy this one again
i bought this product for a friend who recently purchased a macbookpro # & # # ; with retina display we liked the look and functionality of the side zipper and the soft case unfortunately , the zipper would not open or close properly when we zipped it over the corners this problem just got worse and we never even got to use it with his computer such a waste we are returning the item and buying a better product
i give this a # out of # stars because the case is wonderful at least before the zipper breaks it was poorly designed and the zipper catches on the case every time you use it so after around # uses , my zipper now refuses to slide past certain points along its path i would recommend looking elsewhere for a carrying case
i really like this case but the zipper broke with # weeks and now i cant close the large compartment at all . otherwise would be # star all the
the fit is a bit tight for the mbp # `` i 've had this sleeve for # months and the zipper is broken in a couple places , and the stitching is coming apart i 'll be looking at another product to protect my mbp as a replacement
when i ordered this sleeve for my ultrabook it was because everyday i go to class i take my laptop with me and i hated just putting my bare laptop in my backpack decided to get this sleeve to protect it from the <unk> that <unk> inside of my backpack after i received it i did enjoy it for about a week but after that the zipper started getting stuck in one section then another which made unzipping the sleeve to take out my laptop a much bigger hassle than it really should be i am disappointed as i really wanted to like it since it is something i must be using everyday
as everyone else said , the sleeve is slightly bigger than the mac book , with about # inch to spare both length and width-wise the zipper pull broke as soon as we got it without the zipper pull , it is a pain to zip and unzip i am disappointed with the quality
the inside of the case is a thin layer of sponge and the zipper kept getting caught when trying to zip and unzip the case for an additonal $ # . # i ended up purchasing a thick <unk> at the apple store with a nice inner lining that was much thicker and manufactured better
if you have an older # `` pro - this case will probably be just fine for you , so ignore my review if you have a # macbook pro # `` with retina - this case fits loosely i have been unable to find a sleeve that fits well i know this is n't the fault of caselogic , but for my needs it did n't work well i 'll probably return it i have seen many sleeves that even advertise they are for the macbook pro # `` with retina that have similar or larger dimensions to this case i wish it was easier to find one specifically made for the latest model i think the dimensions of the new macbook pro # `` retina are almost identical to the macbook air # `` except the pro does n't <unk> in thickness maybe i should just find a macbook air sleeve if anyone has found one that fits well , please respond in a comment
as others have written , this case is just too big for my # inch macbook pro because of all the other good reviews , i thought i would risk it , i hoped that the <unk> were wrong or too picky , but this case is just too big for a # inch macbook when i pick up the case with the computer in it , my computer slides around i would not feel comfortable carrying my computer around in this case i can tell it is a well-built case and it would be great for a larger computer -lrb- perhaps a # inch -rrb- , but not for a # inch macbook
i am a little disappointed in the fit of the product was expecting it to fit more snug around my macbook pro but it has an extra inch of product
this is a great sleeve while the zipper holds up the problem is , the zipper did n't last # months seems to be poorly engineered as it fits a little too tight around the edges of the macbook , leading to strain on the sleeve 's zipper and then pop , there goes the zipper , and you 're left with a <unk> case my recommendation - spend an extra couple bucks and invest in something more durable
i hate to bad mouth products and i do give good products good reviews the case is pretty flimsy and had a chemical smell the inside of the case was foam i expected a soft cloth , i believe the foam is what was giving off the chemical smell , of course it is made in china i have a mac pro retina and the case was to big and did not have edge protection the show <unk> was the zipper snagged on the neoprene and i had to <unk> around with it to close it i ended up returning it
i bought it expecting my mbp # & # # ; retina will fit snuggly . it does n't the pocket is nice to store the charger , but there is so much room in the case with my mbp in it , it 's frustrating thoroughly disappointed . i am thinking of returning it
i bought one of these almost two years ago , and it was perfect about a month ago , i dropped it somehow and bent the zipper , so it would n't work right my own <unk> but so i bought a new one of the `` same exact `` thing or it was supposed to be i do n't know what changed , but on the new one , there 's about # . # `` of extra space all around i am contemplating if i feel like sending it back or not . : / the packaging states that the max dimensions are that of my mbp # `` , so i do n't know what 's up the only thing i noticed different about it , fit aside , is that the new one was manufactured in vietnam , whereas the other -lsb- old one -rsb- was in china i do n't know if it matters , but maybe they just produce better products in china ... who knows but as it stands , this new case is awful
i got it today - first time i 'm rating something this case is not perfect # . # inch mac pro since it 's # inch wider + # inch longer & loose fitting with mac pro # inch quality is fine but size is really big for mac book # inch
i was very happy with this sleeve when i initially started using it nice , quality neoprene material and it feels sturdy and it fit the macbook pro perfectly however , after less than a week of use , the zipper began to snag around the corner over and over again to the point of it completely getting stuck and the material around that zipper corner began to pull away from the zipper additionally , the side pocket is n't really a practical place to put the electrical plug in it it 's a pretty shallow pocket at best , you can use it for an external drive or mouse
i bought this for my # inch macbook pro and it was harder to get my macbook it this than it was to get myself into leather pants ... not that i would wear leather pants also the zipper kept getting snagged on a tear amazon 's wonderful customer service took care of the return , but i would not recommend the item
my macbook pro # `` -lrb- purchased in # -rrb- fits nicely in this sleeve and also the pocket holds the power adaptor well my only issue is that the quality is not so good the sleeve is thin and the material used is cheap i wish they had a thicker material to provide cushioning to the laptop
i like caselogic cases and have purchased many with good success this case is well constructed but does not fit the macbook pro retina # & # # ; it was too large and the computer <unk> around in the case i returned it for another case that fit better
it might fit a # inch macbook , but it definitely does not fit a # . # inch toshiba laptop not case logic 's fault , nor the seller 's the one i purchased is already on its way back laptop would n't even slide into the sleeve , and there was no way it was going to stretch enough to zip up without scratching the computer the front compartment is excellent plenty of room to store the power cord , and protected too again , a product i would recommend , just not for large toshiba laptops
my # inch macbook air -lrb- august # -rrb- is a little too small for this sleeve there is about half an inch of space between the end of my laptop and the top of the sleeve however , i can still use it because i 'm planning on putting it in my backpack
very loose for macbook pro with retina display not tight enough even for a regular macbook pro i 'm looking forward to a new product from the manufacture specially designed for retina macbook pro
i got this as a replacement case for the apple one my cat <unk> on -lrb- i do n't like it as much as the apple one , it does n't seem as sturdy , but for the price it will be fine , i 'll just have to be a little more careful i do like the fact there is a pocket for the power cord , which helps me to not forget to pack that also , i think i prefer the zipper along the side -- my old case had a velcro overlap flap , and sometimes sliding my computer out of the case was awkward there were a few close calls
i have had to purchase another bag no handles . its a tight fit and your macbook could slip off your hand however the bag looks nicely made it probably would be better for the macbook air not the pro
good quality but i need to start searching for a new sleeve for my retina pro this is disappointing and please choose other product if you want your pro fit in the sleeve
i like the sleeve but the outside pocket would have been better if it zipped straight across allowing for a bit more storage it holds the smaller cord but not the larger
