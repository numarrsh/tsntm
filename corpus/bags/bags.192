it is definitely not a targus laptop case with extra padding and pockets for all kinds of storage - papers , disks , mouse , pens and pencils , books , cables and jacks i went cheap at half the cost and got what i paid for - less padding , but sufficient to protect the computer from normal bumps and alot less storage area
this is a decent case for the money , but if i had to do it over again i would purchase one of <unk> construction it works for what i need it for
i like case logic products i would have given this a higher rating if they had included more padding or velcro style <unk> to keep the laptop more protected it 's okay to protect it from the elements but do n't drop it
there are really two ways to go with a computer case some , unlike this case , are heavily padded with a large number of pockets and compartments this type of case you can throw on a baggage cart and handle roughly but they have lots of padding to protect your computer other cases , including this one , are minimalist they provide minimum protection , have just a few compartments for the computer and power supply , and are slimmer that is what this one is this is a pretty simple case with a sleek , <unk> profile , which is appropriate for hauling your laptop computer to a business meeting or whatnot this case is not designed to protect your computer from rough handling and it does * not * have a plethora of pockets for gear other than your computer , mouse , and power supply not a bad case for what it is but know what you are getting
my dell # . # & # # ; laptop fits well in the main compartment the outer pocket is generous enough for the power cord and mouse the bag material is very lightweight , the padding is not too substantial , and the shoulder strap & # # ; hardware & # # ; and & # # ; d & # # ; rings are plastic so for occasional casual use , this bag functions well , but it would not be well suited for true road warriors whose bag may need to stand up to some abuse
for the price its ok its too big for my # inch computer , and the material is not as good as i expected but for this price its ok if you want something cheap looking and usable , this is it
i like the case , but my laptop is pretty thin and there is a lot of play for my cpu to move the strap helps keep it still , but sometimes i am pretty lazy and my computer moves around a lot
i purchased a case logic bag for my laptop back in # so when i got a laptop for the wife i automatically went to amazon to purchase a case logic bag for hers but in the four years since my purchase they changed the design and it is n't quite the same as mine they sort of cut corners and <unk> up a bit it still looks the same on the outside but the inside has changed and it was more expensive oh well such is life i still will be buying stuff from amazon
this is a nicely padded , roomy case there is another one on amazon that is similar , but reviewers there say the padding is not up to the standard this one sets this one is also half the cost this is . . not . . a portable office with slots for everything you might even dream of carrying it does provide ample room for the laptop , the power supply -lrb- with all cables -rrb- and an outboard mouse and pad -lrb- which i prefer -rrb- there is also room in the main compartment for a loose leaf binder should you want to carry one construction is good , quality well above average i recommend this one to anyone with similar needs
the case logic # . # `` laptop case is well made , has several pockets which is great , and is light weight making it perfect for the occasional traveler for some reason , this case has only one strap to hold the laptop in place , which was disappointing -lrb- and mind <unk> -rrb- although i am pleased with the way the case is made over all , when i rubbed up against something with a sharp point -lrb- ? ? -rrb- it cut across the front pocket on the case the good news is that it was a `` clean cut , `` did n't go through to the case itself , so it was able to be repaired i add this side note because a cheaply made case would have been <unk> : <unk> i would not hesitate to recommend this case
i used this case for a year while going to nursing school the case is spacious enough to where is will hold of other small item and maybe even a thin book the case handled the punishment of # year at school very well i graduated after that one year
i was looking for a # . # & # # ; laptop case that was not bulky , yet could hold the power cable , mouse , etc , in addition to the laptop this case fit the bill perfectly most of the cases i looked at were actually a bulky briefcase with lots of pockets , etc . i just needed a single case to move the laptop between houses the sleeves i looked at did not have enough room for the charger and mouse the price on this is good too
this case fits my rog g # -lrb- # . # & # # ; -rrb- perfectly it has a fair amount of padding , but due to it 's sleek and slim design you sacrifice storage for simplicity not a fan of the provided shoulder strap -lrb- especially when transporting <unk> laptops like the g # -rrb- but the handle on the case itself is strong and secure
i travel exclusively with a business friendly , durable briggs and riley case , and i bought this bag for a second laptop for the kids to carry around it can carry a huge computer , and its a very light , nicely padded case i would not recommend this for a business case though due to the lack of pockets for cards , passports , chargers and the other necessities when traveling
this does the job that i needed , just to keep everything together the computer does not leave the house , but can not be left out this case is very thin and will not protect your laptop from very hard knocks
i can securely place my # inch laptop in this case for the price , there are enough large pockets for the power cord , for the portable mouse , and also for a mouse pad , as well as room for more
i purchased this case logic case for my laptop it seems sturdy enough have n't used it as yet , but my # . # laptop fits comfortably in it and there 's room for my charges n battery i would have liked an xtra strap inside , it only contains # strap to hold laptop . # would have made me feel more secure it 's padded in all the right places i like case logic cases as they seem sturdier than most should i have any problems with this case , i will be back
its a very good case and holds my # . # laptop and also can put a # . # tablet in it too , with the power cords nice lightweight material and for the price it is very good
i got this case to hold my dell # . # `` laptop the computer fits , but i have to tug the zipper very hard just to get the corners to fit in my computer does have a touch screen which most likely makes it a little thicker than the non touchscreen versions , therefore this makes for a tight fit i still like the bag because it will hold my computer , power cord , kindle fire hd # . # , cell phone and a few other items four stars instead of # due to the tight fit
everything it was <unk> to be time will tell if it lives up to it zippers seem good , i like the pockets love the strap that secures the computer seems like a good buy
the case is a very good buy for the price i am glad i bought the bigger one to get the accessories in without having to jam them in to fit
fits the # & # # ; laptop with room for extra replaced older worn out laptop bag and nothing more can be said to satisfy the <unk> review requirements of constantly demanding i add words
this has the protection i wanted but does n't add much weight we 're moving so we will be dependent on the laptop and to keep some supplies with us at all times
good for the price , but it 's definitely <unk> quality it does n't fit much else besides the laptop i managed to squeeze the following items into it -lrb- with a lot of planning and effort <unk> p # <unk> # . # -inch <unk> master <unk> <unk> m # wireless mousemouse pad # ' ethernet cable -lrb- without the <unk> , everything fits well the biggest flaw with this case , however , is the lack of padding i 'm not # % confident my laptop is safe while it is in this bag as long as you do n't drop it or bang it into something , it should be okay - but the risk is still there although , considering the price -lrb- bought it at $ # -rrb- , it is a good bag
nice bag , it fits my # . # inch hp laptop , the charger , a cooler master laptop cooling pad and my mouse i 've only had it for a couple weeks so i ca n't speak for it 's durability or protection but so far it feels good
i just purchased my second one for another laptop and it 's a great case there is plenty of storage and it will fit a # & # # ; wide laptop -lrb- not the diagonal listing , which makes so sense to me it 's not a television !
thought i would not receive in time for my trip to atlanta , but rec 'd with time to spare case is good buy and has compartments for just about anything you would need to carry along with your
this at first is a very solid case , stiff and slick fit 's perfectly with my large bulky g # vx gaming laptop has plenty of space in order to put the bulky battery charger in the side pocket enough space to storage as well two mouses , a phone , phone charger , headphones and pens in the inside of the case it has a small pocket you could also storage sheets of paper after months of continuous use the case lost it 's sturdiness , it 's still a great case just not as sturdy and makes it a bit more difficult to store the laptop at first once it 's zipped up all the way it 's just
in shopping on-line for an airport friendly laptop case for a recently purchased # inch laptop this item stood out as an excellent value inspection on receipt of the item showed that it was just what i was looking for , a quality product at a fair price that would perform its desired functions the item was shipped and received in a timely manner i can comfortably recommend this item and it 's supplier to others
this case is perfect for # & # # ; screen laptops with loads of room for storing cords , mouse , tablet or kindle reader . the strap is well made as is the handle and zippers had looked in big box stores at other cases that cost more and were not as nice
i was hoping it a few more compartments other then that it will do the job just great it will work just fine i very happy with it
case logic is a brand i have bought for years , and have always come to find it dependable , sturdy and long lasting i have many case logic items that i have owned for years , and they still look like brand new and i have never had any problems with any of them however , the item i purchased did not meet my needs it was not big enough to hold what i needed i loved the idea of having a case logic to store my laptop in , but it just did n't fit will buy from this reputable seller again if occasion arises
i have a # inch <unk> laptop and i could not find this in the stores around where i live , and they were about $ # . # im not using it for travel heavy duty , so i do n't need something with a lot of padding , i 'm happy with it & i would order it
this case does not have all the bells and whistles but will allow me to transport my computer when necessary it 's lightweight and streamlined , and although not fancy , will do the job it 's very well made and should last long after i 've replaced my current computer finding a case this size that did n't cost a fortune was impossible in the brick and mortar stores , so i was very glad to find this one the price was outstanding , and the delivery was quick
was just looking for a laptop case for my new oversize dell # & # # ; this basic case does the trick does n't have the bells and whistles but has a couple pockets and does the job just fine has a nice zipper it is n't real rigid and wo n't provide much drop protection , but works well as a travel case otherwise
i had read all the reviews before i bought this product and they were pretty much right on target the only thing i dislike about the case is the sides i wish the sides were a little more sturdy otherwise it is exactly what i expected
case was large enough to store my computer . bottom could use more padding . i love the light weight of the case and it , s not bulky i would recommend this case if you do n't want to spend a lot of money . i wo n't be traveling a lot with my laptop , so the case is used mostly for storage
my # & # # ; laptop fits well and seems to be well cushioned i would have maybe liked a specific pocket or two to keep the power <unk> and a mouse they will fit in the zipper pocket , but add to the bulk then and slide around in the pocket
i bought this for my daughter , and she uses it with all her traveling she loves it it is well made and sturdy , and if it survives her workout it can survive anything
i use this every day to haul my laptop to and from work if you are looking to not spend a pretty penny on a nice leather case then i would go for this case there is plenty of room in the two zips it offers for the laptop , chargers , mouse , and any other reasonable items a great professional look for a college student trying to save a buck <unk> -lrb- in price - well built and <unk> as far as i can
the padding in this case really is minimal , as many others have mentioned however , a laptop case is the last thing i want to spend $ # on , and one wonders if a laptop in a more expensive case would survive a # <unk> drop on a concrete floor anyway this case and straps are pretty sturdy otherwise , and still going strong after # + months the case protects my laptop from the elements and sometimes from my young children that 's all i ask of it at # bucks plus shipping this thing is a great value in my book
the size was well listed the padding seems equal to other cases i have owned it also has just enough room to stow the ac power adapter and a compact hard drive glad i bought it
i like this case , it has adequate room for storing cords and mouse as well as other books or documents it has a velcro strap that hold my laptop in place and the handle and shoulder strap are very adequate and appear to be sturdy and well made i am please with this purchase and would recommend this case to others
this is my second case logic # & # # ; case the first is over four years old and was carried by me daily this second is made similarly : it has one main pocket for the laptop which has a small divide for papers and such also , one exterior zip pocket with three small cell <unk> pockets on the interior surface i carry a # & # # ; asus rog which is about ten pounds and some papers/folders -lrb- half inch thick maximum -rrb- in the main part the exterior pocket holds my mouse and the power supply the strap is adequate , not as nice quality as the strap to my older one some metal components on my old one have been replaced with plastic the handle is spongy neoprene and very comfortable
this fit my # inch laptop perfectly it 's got a zippered compartment in the front which is very large and can hold a lot including my charger , mouse , and whatever else i needed to hold it makes it so much easier to carry my laptop around since i can no longer just slip it in my backpack and go inside it even has a velcro strap to go around the laptop for extra protection the only thing is sometimes the strap can hurt my shoulder , that could just be my laptop since it is rather heavy , but it is much better than carrying it around by hand i highly recommend it
simple bag , does what it is supposed to the pocket can hold quite a bit of cords without causing the bag to seem too bulky i can even fit my cooling pad with the laptop
user friendly , <unk> carrying case there are different <unk> for supplies and small things pleasant comfortable carry handle and shoulder strap good solid laptop carrying case i recommend to buy
it fits a msi gt # <unk> with no problem , even with the power brick and you still got space to spare , it is sturdy enough on the sides but not that sturdy on the bottom its more than great to take your laptop to a friends house or to the school but i wouldnt recommend it if you are planning to travel often with this
i got my son a laptop -lrb- his first one -rrb- and this is perfect for him - even as basic as it is he keeps his external mouse and mouse pad in it , and the cords for charging his <unk> folds flat so that should fit too any thing more than those basic things and you might consider something different it does have internal pockets but they 're too small for a samsung galaxy s # ... maybe a smaller phone would fit all in all , i 'm happy with it
i ordered this bag for my parents new # & # # ; laptop that i talked them into getting i had ordered the same brand / type bag for myself a few years back unfortunately the style has changed somewhat this one was n't quite as well padded & less zipper compartments but all in all , it is a very good bag that i have n't been able to find in stores around here great price too yes , i would recommend this one
my large screen toshiba lap top fits perfectly case is fairly well padded and has plenty of room for wireless mouse , papers , cables and others better than $ # . # + advertised at staples
i was looking for an affordable , simple case to allow me to transport my laptop the pockets are just ok but my needs were very basic so i am happy with the case the overall quality is fine
it 's just what i wanted for a computer carrying case it has pockets to keep papers in , and places for ink pens , and electric cords , plus a few extra things , if you need it
this case came on time exactly as advertised it perfectly fits my # . # & # # ; laptop it is not too heavy or light , and the padding is fairly good i would feel comfortable that dropping the bag out of my hand would not damage my laptop would definitely purchase again
i highly recommend this bag to all it protects the computer # inch and # inch computers very well with the # inch computer it sometimes slide around however , i find the extra good for wireless mouse and ac charger if i need more padding , i recommend using the solo computer sleeve for # inch computers nice and snug this is what i use
this bad boy has everything the average laptop user needs room for chargers , mouse , mouse pads and laptop its got places for pens and pencils if you take it to school
this is a very excellent case and i am very happy with it i wanted to protect the laptop and i bought the sleeve also -- the one made by case logic -- and the laptop fits inside the sleeve and then fits into the case perfectly
