when this case arrived i immediately opened the box and <unk> to install it on my new mac contrary to other reviews it was extremely easy to install and fit perfectly
the case is as described , works great , protects the mac and fits great my mac started to wear on the edges and it even protects that i do n't travel with it , its just in the house , but i still highly recommend it to protect your investment
i purchased the orange speck case for the # in macbook i love the color i love how it fits on the <unk> snaps on perfectly and stays snug other cases similar to this i have purchased and tried also and none have pleased me as this one has i know it is protected from outer damage it does not protect the inside face of course however , i will highly recommended this product !
the case looks really nice on my laptop and was super easy to just snap on it has n't cracked or anything so i 'm pretty happy with the purchase , it 's much better to scuff it up rather than my
i was concerned with keeping my new toy safe from the elements this product fits and performs perfectly i am impressed with the fact that it is thin and you really cant see it on your mac book i also like the fact that i can put stickers and other stuff on my new laptop another reason i bought this product was because i wanted some more structure for my screen i have had laptops before and have had one screen break from opening it up i thought this product would give the lcd more stiffness and so far nothing has broke this product is worth the investment
this item fits my macbook perfectly the red color makes it look great , and the polycarbonate material is very durable the cover is so thin that you do n't even notice the slight extra thickness everyone that sees my computer really likes it
i 've got a nice <unk> backpack for my # `` white macbook , but i usually leave the mac out on a table so it 's easy to access anyone who 's ever owned a mac or ipod knows how easily they can become scratched i saw an article in <unk> about the red speck case and i was <unk> by it having never seen a hard clip on case for a lap top before , not to mention one that was <unk> pleasing so i shopped around and bought a red case from amazon i noticed in the customer reviews that some folks complained that the speck case scratched their macbook however , since i own # ipods and a # `` imac i 've learned the importance of making sure that both the device and the inside of the case are completely clean and dust free before installation i 'm extremely happy with my speck case and the lighted apple logo on the macbook lid looks gorgeous in red i 'd recommend this case to anyone who wants to protect their investment with a minimum of fuss an added bonus is that the case <unk> your lap from some of the heat that the battery <unk> up , so now i 've got a real laptop
i bought this case to enhance the look of my white macbook and it fits perfect just make sure to snap the case securely to your macbook and you should have no problem
worked great for a long time protected the laptop from everyday scratching the fit was very snug and tight and the overall case did not add a lot of bulk
my daughter has an apple laptop which we purchased for her approximately # years ago apple no longer carries in their stores the covers for this model i was a little worried about <unk> we were going to get one but the <unk> at apple directed me to check the web and i found this on amazon the color is awesome and exactly what she wanted ; she was able to take it out of the package and snap it directly onto the laptop she loves it and the service received from this <unk> was awesome i received the <unk> in less than # days ! ! !
this cover fit perfectly and provided nice protection for my macbook # `` -lrb- old style -rrb- i would recommend this to anyone looking for a nice lightweight cover that does n't add much size to their mac
i purchased the speck cover for my macbook and love it it was easy to put on i get lots of comments about how nice it looks i would highly recommend this to anyone with a macbook ! !
this <unk> is really good , especially if you would like to keep scratches off of your mac , by this product i do n't know what other people were talking about but , it is not hard to take off and it is def . not hard to put on either
the case fits perfectly and looks great a lot of people comment about how difficult they are to get on/off the case goes on as easy as you can imagine about # weeks after putting it on i notice a hair under the case and had to remove it to get the hair out the case came off no problem and did not scratch or damage the macbook at all
first of all i love the aqua color it gives a new look to my white macbook the hard case is hard as it says and it good for protecting the bare macbook from scratches one has to take care while installation as its a bit difficult to remove it easily i use this in combination with <unk> keyboard skins for macbook these both are a good combination together
i own the # inch macbook pro and i wanted a cover to protect the body this cover fits perfectly it never falls off and it looks absolutely fantastic i highly recommend it
i waited so long to get a cover for my macbook because they were always around $ # but this one i found is affordable and looks great i even put a nice little cutout between my clear case and my computer to give it a custom look
this attractive case snapped on in seconds with ease protects from wear and tear sliding computer in and out of carrying case it is very light weight a great product , especially for the white macbook i have not tried to remove it yet , but ca n't think why i would want to connectors fit fine , does not <unk> fit great colors too
i love this case it 's durable , fits my mac like a glove , and looks great i 've already gotten compliments on it it makes carrying my computer a lot more convenient - i just slip my computer into my backpack and go the outside of the case gets scuffed up fairly easily , but that does n't bother me the case accommodates the use of the cd drive and all the plug-ins , so i just keep it on my computer all of the time i 'm very happy with this product
i 'm very happy with my case for my macbook i was very happy about the price , and delivery was very fast . the case was easy to put on and it 's very sturdy now my macbook is much safer while in my backpack when i 'm going around campus thanks for great service
i could n't be any more satisfied with this product it does a great job protecting my new macbook and looks extremely cute all at the same time it snaps on very easily and fits snugly to the computer i highly suggest this product - in any color

i love this case so easy to attach and very stylish i 've already had several compliments i just got it , so i do n't know how long it will last , but so far so good a great buy
this is my first pelican case and i love it it keeps my mac safe , and the depth allows a bottom layer for hard drive , iphone , new trent battery and cables , with my mac book on top , separated by a layer of foam it very professional and rugged very happy with this
my husband was so very <unk> he loves his case couldnt be happier i got it for his deployment so that his laptop would be safe and safe it is thank you so much now when it is time to buy a case for mine i know exactly where i am getting it from thank you so much shipping was right on time too
i was able to safely carry my xbox # with two controllers in this case the case is small enough to be carried on most airlines as a carry on tips for foam use an electric knife to cut the foam and a sharpie to outline it with an electric knife think of the same one you 'd use to cut <unk> at thanksgiving does an amazing job this case saw my xbox # safely through <unk> international airport to <unk>
bought this for a family member arrived quickly , was just as advertised sturdy and protective this is the case for protecting your laptop , it even has two holes for <unk> in case you need to keep little fingers out of your stuff
although it was a little bigger than i realized , it worked out perfect for me as i could also place other accessaries such as a camera and charger in the case i 'm in the military and when i go on a deployment i need a case that can be packed and tossed at a moments notice the pelican laptop case is nothing but proven durability
very high quality product you can put whatever you want in it has a combo lock under the handle to secure the case along with places to use your own pad locks
pretty much exactly what you would expect from a pelican product it 's tough as s *** , secure and does exactly what it say it does , protects your product i would recommend this to anyone that would like extra protection for your computer while traveling
as a us marine who goes out in the field , this case protected my toshiba qosmio laptop from the harsh elements of the <unk> desert i was running power from my light armored vehicle 's power inverted and storing my laptop in this case we did a ton of bumpy off road driving that would 've destroyed my laptop if it had been in perhaps a backpack
if you are at all familiar with these cases , pelican makes the standard by which all are measured against tough , durable , and water tight i keep my $ # . # laptop in them and i do n't worry if the case falls these cases are great and the price is excellent i tell all of my coworkers to use them and amazon has some great prices latches are sturdy , hinges are solid no bad points about this case at all great for a # & # # ; macbook pro , fits power supply and mini <unk> adapters easily
indestructible but classy i figured since i have a $ # . # mac , that protecting it while i travel was quite important to me this is everything i needed and then some , easy to shape and perfect fit for everything i need i recommend watching one on the many youtube videos that show you how to work with the foam definitely # stars
bought this and then shipped it to my husband who was deployed to iraq at the time it held up going there and coming back kept the computer safe as well
when i purchased the pelican # i was not sure if it would work out for my needs since it said # `` laptop case i recently purchased an alienware m # x r # -lrb- # `` laptop -rrb- and being deployed , i wanted something durable i would highly recommend this case for this environment or when protection of your <unk> is <unk> not to mention my $ # . # laptop is safe , snug and secure within this case keep in mind if you do use this case for an # `` laptop , there would be very little room left over and you would not be able to store the power brick within it
i use this case to store my collection of <unk> it is solid and protects them well the lock is of good quality the foam inside works well to keep my <unk> in place the military uses pelican cases for everything in some very harsh environments so obviously they can withstand the <unk> encountered here in the states i recommend to purchase
this is my # th pelican case i have the i # for my ipod , the # for my video camera and the # which has carried everything from clothes to medical <unk> to <unk> and <unk> all three protected their contents flawlessly for a year in iraq and even longer at home my most recent pelican case , the # is for my lenovo thinkpad t # and related items for future deployments to afghanistan etc . i am currently using it for transport while i 'm <unk> i 've had my stuff thrown off too many <unk> to take a chance with my pc pelican cases tend to be a bit bulky , heavy and expensive , but nothing can compare to their ruggedness and protection from all kinds of <unk> environments and the elements the pick and pluck foam inside makes for a custom , snug cushioned fit for any item no substitute for a pelican my first and last choice for protecting my valuables while traveling
bought this case for a macbook pro # `` it fits very snugly with no extra room for foam on the side it is a good size and light , but pretty weak if i stepped on the case it would damage the computer not what i expected from pelican hopefully they are n't using this flimsy plastic for all their
this pelican case is rugged , will take a lot of abuse and still protect its contents i am satisfied with its heft , but there is no way to attach a strap to it , making it uncomfortable to carry when you are traveling and carrying other items i am surprised nobody else has pointed this out in the reviews i also have the pelican # -lrb- a little smaller -rrb- , perfect to carry an ipad and an apple wireless keyboard ; that case came with a sturdy adjustable nylon strap that strap makes a huge difference when your hands are full
i bought this case for my new lenovo s # netbook and it fit like a glove it also has room for the battery charger i travel a lot so my requirements are pretty high this pelican case meets all my expectations if the case was not so hard to open it would have received five stars -lrb- update -rrb- i have just noticed what i believe to be some hairline fractures near the aluminum latch the case has never been dropped or abused in any way the case does not seem weakened the case has a lifetime guarantee so i 'm not too concerned i recommend this product for anyone who wants a bombproof home for their netbook
fantastic product but i had ordered the one without the foam but with the rubber lining unfortunatly the wrong one was delivered just before i had to leave for a # month trip now i have to use one that is not exactly what i needed but it is as described , indestructible the latch to open will be a challenge to open the first few times it remains quite hard on the fingers when
just so everyone is aware , this case will not fit the macbook pro # `` all the reviewers who said otherwise are incorrect and it is highly annoying , so if you do n't want to return this item do n't buy it
i have several pelican cases for <unk> and electronics i was looking for a bombproof case for my new asus ul # vt and this one seemed to fit the bill , but i was unsure on fit i went ahead and ordered and i got lucky , it fits perfectly i have the cc model with the plush foam , not the cube style foam interior width is perfect fit and depth leaves about # `` which is perfect for getting a grip on it the laptop to remove it from the case height is snug enough to keep laptop from sliding or moving when it is closed looks like it ws custom made for the asus
this case fits the # macbook unibody perfectly it was clearly made for it there is zero gap side to side , and about a # inch on the front and back inside the case the only downside is the case makes slim , lightweight features of the macbook diminish , but if you need protection in the field , this is the case to have
cheaply made for the price . plastic clips broke easily very small , but did contain a lot of pockets and compartments . you 're paying an extra $ # for the name and it is n't worth it
amazon images of this product are misleading the shoulder strap attachment system depicted in the image are much more sturdy and well made in the image than in the shipped item i am amazed at the obvious deception on the product a primary reason that i considered this item was the fact that the strap attachment would be secure , but the actual strap is a cheap , flimsy insecure clip there is no way i would consider carrying a computer in this case while riding my bike , which had been my plan
i loved everything about this bag , for about # weeks then the material started to fray from the edge binding , any area that i used to capacity first , was the water bottle holder i only used a small bottle then i noticed the fraying , so i stopped using that pouch a few weeks later , the fraying began on the main back panel around the corners ; and from there it just got worse , so i returned it to the store too bad , i loved the front pouch - perfect for mp # player this is a well designed , bag except for the quality of the construction
the bag itself is nice enough , lots of room and hidden compartments it does me no good if i ca n't carry it on my shoulder i am very easy on my laptop and case because my laptop is a very expensive one it should not have broken so easily i would not recommend this case to anyone
too heavy even when empty not for someone with weak neck and shoulders it 's a great bag for the money but very heavy once you put in a laptop and files
the bag feel cheap and i originally got this bag for my asus gaming laptop which is a lot thicker then normal computers and it will not fit the bag
this bag is okay , but it does n't carry well from the top handle the buckle that secures the outside flap has too much slack , so the top <unk> strangely when you lift it over a few uses , the lining that the buckle attaches to starts to sag and it gets worse if you carry it by the shoulder strap , everything lies flat and works fine the <unk> liner that adjusts to the size of the laptop is great i have a # . # & # # ; hp envy in mine , and it fits perfectly
the bag is good if you need all its utilities , but it is actually too big for me i can put my # . # inch laptop , a book , a tablet , a waterbottle and it still have space left also , the quality of the material is not as good as i expected it does n't look as good as it does in the pictures , but it is still acceptable i would recommend it to anyone that needs a bag to carry a lot of stuff , but i think most people dont need that much utilities
nice bag , well made tooo heavy . fold over and latch top would have preferred a top open zipper a bit to high to fit under airline seat at your feet guess i will live with it not the best bag to travel with
the title says it all i thought this was a fantastic bag when inspecting it it seems durable and well-crafted , with many convenient pockets and a generally pleasing look unfortunately , this was one of my failed <unk> in finding a bag large enough for my asus g # series laptop although it says it is for # . # `` bags , the extra bulk of the cooling vents on the g # make it barely fit in this bag when closed -lrb- which is a struggle -rrb- , it 's apparent that the bag will offer no impact or moisture protection i 'm sure this would be an ideal bag for a laptop with less girth for anyone looking for a bag for the g # series or other laptop of similar size , i ended up with <unk> # -inch <unk> case for laptop it 's a monster of a bag , but honestly ... if you 're buying laptops of this size , then i 'm assuming you 're not worried about it return and exchange through amazon was a breeze , as always
i was buying my boyfriend a bag for his new laptop and finally found this laptop bag which fits up to # ' laptop , i recommend highly for business use has great storage space
it 's a really nice bag , but online it said it was for a # . # inch screen i just bought a new toshiba # . # inch screen laptop and it does n't fit ! the tag on the bag says it fits `` most # inch screens `` , so i think online it was kind of deceiving then there 's another tag on the same bag that says the device should be # . # inches i do n't understand why this has become so confusing for the customer
i really love this bag it has a compartment for everything i need i like the orange interior , makes it easy to spot items quicker i have had it for a couple of months now and it has not torn feels very durable the strap and carry handle feel sturdy as well i am considering ordering another one for a co-worker
this is a good laptop bag it has a ton of pockets both inside and out i have n't even found a use for all of them yet but i 'm sure i will
i am an avid <unk> and tend to be in the school of knowing what i want before i even start looking as such i often get <unk> to <unk> things for an increasingly large group of people who do not care about learning what needs to learned in order to be happy with their purchases this laptop messenger bag is great for # inch laptop that simply need to be taken from point a to point b , with little concern about the ergonomics or any specific performance criteria a simple straightforward . construction quality seems to be on par with other microsoft branded items i have encountered over the years and is holding up well through the last several months of use there are better items if you need specific volume requirements or physically performance attributes
it has very beautiful design and too many places for laptop , documents and etc . it is easy to carry because of its design also i have experience of very good customer service with microsoft company in my previous bag
after reading previous reviews of this product , i was worried about buying it then i remembered how easy it is to return stuff on amazon so i bought it anyway i have # . # & # # ; hp probook # s and it fits just fine in the bag the adjuster inside allows for you to change the size when needed the material is sturdy i am really happy with the laptop bag
been using this bag for about a year with no serious complaints very functional bag , with padding that will protect your laptop when it falls because the shoulder strap fails ... and it will fail the plastic shoulder strap connection wont hold up to the weight of the laptop , so we just use the handle
this bag is so much more professional than my previous backpack and it contains all the pockets and storage i need if anything , i carry too much which makes the bag heavy and cumbersome i really like the bright orange interior - easy to find everything it does fit my # . # dell laptop snuggly i read comments about the strap connectors , and so far , mine are good it 's only been a week but i 'm pleased so far
it does hold the large computers , but very little else . the way that the flap closure is built it limits the amount of items that you can stuff into the pockets the flap closure does offer protection from weather would not be a good traveling bag
i like the fact that it is compact , and does not have too many compartments to make it bulky i just wanted it for the # & # # ; computer to fit and the price was about right compared to others
very happy with this purchase i had to rma another case logic bag that did n't fit my asus gaming laptop not the case here , great quality , lots of pouches for everything you need to pack
i mainly bought this laptop bag for the mp # pocket on it , cause i liked how you could put your mp # player in it with the pocket zipped and the cord going through the hole but the quality and storage in it was very good
i have had this messenger bag for over a month and i am not returning it it has everything i need it 's sturdy , i can carry a water bottle on one side , my laptop fits perfectly in there with good cushion the three zipper pockets in the front are very handy the shoulder pad is also very comfortable some people complained the strap plastic ends would break quickly , but i disagree i carry about # pounds of paperwork , folders and a laptop
this bag has multiple storage pockets and fits everything neatly and in order the laptop section is well-cushioned and held securely by the velcro strap the bag wears well and easily handles a lot of weight ; its strap is very comfortable and balances the contents well for transport
this bag is great if you have many electronic devices it is big i store a acer # `` laptop , ipad and a nook this bag can even store all the cables , and power adapters for these devices it also has a separate area for pen and pencils
this bag is the perfect blend of style and function it offers enough space for my laptop , files and gear it has great build quality and the orange interior and accents make for a great looking bag the outer texture of the bag is great and it offers plenty of storage including exterior pockets for my smart phone and i-pod -lrb- also has a hole for headphones -rrb- overall this is an excellent bag and could easily go for $ # or more
the microsoft edge messenger bag is very good quality , comfortable , with different useful compartments and pockets perfect protection for laptop with the protective re sizable sleeve for a custom fit depending the laptop size
had looked at office depot , staples , <unk> <unk> , <unk> and several big box stores for a versatile computer bag for the larger screen but also with some functionality had come across a previous version of this bag @ staples ` at twice the price ' it did n't have the ipod storage but was same manufacture and quality it was a terrific find on <unk> i was on vacation what a bonus to have it shipped in # business days to the resort in california and free shipping too ! ! ! ! happy new year to me ... ... ... great bag - excellent quality - terrific protection for my new laptop
this laptop bag ensures safe keeping fr you laptop i have a # & # # ; and it fits perfectly but the pocket for the laptop is adjustable so it would fit a smaller one or table it will not fit a laptop bigger than # & # # ;
i had been looking for a laptop bag for a new # . # laptop and was not happy with the items i found in staples and some local stores quality was not equal to the price i found this bag and although i usually shy away from the `` name brand `` items , this bag was the right price i am very pleased with the quality , my laptop fits perfectly and i can also carry my files in it the product also shipped quickly , i ordered # other products and this came within # days even with super saver shipping
the laptop bag is perfect it has a lot of storage space for <unk> and accessories the padding for the laptop slot is perfect i enjoy the water bottle holder on the side overall , the microsoft laptop bag is perfect for business , school or for travel i recommend this to everyone
i purchased this bag for my # `` dell notebook computer i am very pleased with the quality and utility of this item the laptop computer fits firmly and there is plenty of <unk> for easy access to my accessories -lrb- which include an external hard drive , and ipod , and power cord -rrb- i recommend this product without hesitation
my hubby needed a bag for his laptop and it was hard to find one for a large screen that was not very expensive i looked on amazon to see what others were available i read the reviews for the bag and decided to order one when it came we were very pleased with the bag it is everything the product description said we liked it so much that we purchased another one for my computer

well , my gift was for a <unk> fan so the orange inside was wonderful it really does make it easier to find things when it is bright inside the bag itself fit our dell # & # # ; laptop with room to spare many pockets to carry extra accessories and paperwork too it has been almost a year and the strap is still intact , no fraying , durable and easy to clean will definitely purchase again
i looked around for a while trying to find a bag that was aesthetically pleasing , had lots of extra storage and could also fit my large # . # `` laptop this is what i got and i could n't be happier there is storage to spare on this thing with <unk> compartments for everything you could have on your way to class or work the drink holder and orange accents put this <unk> for me
i searched thru all kinds of computer bags as i intended to purchase # & use it for a long time this bad is sturdy , has lots of compartments and slots for credit cards so i did n't need a purse i consider it a good purchase
i bought this for my husband for his lap top he 's had it over a year and uses it everyday back and forth to work it has held up great he uses the pockets every day and has no trouble with the zippers or the stitching it does fit the # . # & # # ; lap top fine would recommend it
this bag is great i love using a # in laptop but find it difficult to find a nice bag to carry it is the pockets are nice , the laptop and cord fits in the bag easily the bag was accidently knocked off the table with my laptop in it while i do n't recommend doing this , it was nice to see no damage to the laptop
i took this bag all the way from <unk> to california and it did wonderful with easy access but not so much that someone could sneak it out of my bag plenty of rooms for extra <unk> too
this messenger bag was precisely what i was looking for , modern , ; sleek ; yet functionable i 've actually been told `` nice bag `` by some people which before this i 've never heard anyone say in my life fits up to # `` laptops and i recieved earlier than <unk>
i recently bought a # . # inch laptop and was in need of bag i shopped everywhere , stores , online then i found this one , it is very stylish and highly practical i 've received compliments at work on the choice one of the better online buying experiences of late
when i first bought my computer , i purchased this bag . # years later , it fell apart -lrb- i 'm very rough on bags -rrb- and i immediately went to buy another bag that 's how much i love this bag plenty of space for all your stuff , and holds your computer very well
it held my # inch lap top wonderfully and had all the straps needed to secure the laptop in tightly i also like all the hidden pockets it had simply a great bag
the bag looks stylish and elegant the orange color is simply awesome its pretty sturdy and i take the bag daily to work and very much happy about this purchase
it was one of the only bags that would fit my massive laptop , but not only that , it also holds the power cord , wireless mouse , and all my files of papers for meetings it 's durable and well made
i 'm blown away by how little i paid -lrb- cyber monday -rrb- and how amazing the quality is this is an actual microsoft bag , with the genuine logo and everything this is a great bag with tons of compartments and you can customize the padding inside to fit different sizes if your laptop is smaller no factory smell problems , arrived quick , orange color inside is bold and gorgeous it came in the original packaging with <unk> from microsoft and everything it 's great for either a man or a woman and it 's super heavy duty i could spill on it and my laptop would be safe inside not that i would want to , though i love this bag it 's exactly what i wanted and more
this bag looks lot better that it really is the inside look and feel cheap hard to organise because the inside divisions are small it is very hard to handle when you <unk> to get something from the main divisions the key chain holder from the picture is missing i don ' t recommend it
the strap hook that grabs the briefcase is made of cheap plastic and comes off easily when you carry something heavy i have a hp elitebook workstation # inches that weighs # . # pounds and ended up on the ground because the strap hook broke off
this does seem to be a very nice bag but for the cheap plastic shoulder strap snap the snap will pop out of it 's swivel very easily , this happened to me causing me to drop my laptop on a concrete sidewalk fortunately it is a dell and survived the drop but i had to remove the shoulder strap after that for it can no longer be trusted
i bought this product specifically because the photo showed it had a key lanyard it does not it 's a perfectly fine bag if you do n't carry keys and need a lanyard for them i traded it to my wife for a bag with a lanyard she uses it for her computer suggest you change the misleading photo
it is difficult to find a laptop bag for a # . # inch laptop , so when i discovered this one , it seemed perfect for my needs there is ample storage space for the laptop ... well padded ; quite e few pockets , etc . , to store the brick , notebooks , pens , tablet the orange interior makes it quite easy to find things the downside : the shoulder strap and the & # # ; d & # # ; rings it attaches to ... plastic snaps and rings a disaster on the way to happen -lrb- made the mistake of buying a laptop bag for an older laptop back in the day ; the plastic snap broke , and the case fell onto a concrete floor . this bag will be fine once i replace the plastic & # # ; d & # # ; rings , and plastic snaps on the strap with metal parts hard to believe the manufacturer would design a laptop bag with cheap , plastic parts a lot of work , but without the modifications , i would not use the bag
i purchased this bag for my msi gs # laptop and this bag was too small the bag itself seems to be well made , but its better for smaller laptops its not for # inch laptops
i needed this in a hurry and liked the options and the all black outer was what i was looking for i had it shipped overnight and when i got it , the front pocket was grey , not black as the picture was showing i wanted to return it to get what i thought i was ordering -lrb- the all black outer -rrb- but had to deal with it as i did n't have time to return it before my trip
this is an excellent laptop bag as long as you do n't carry any bulky items except the laptop i tend to carry a lot of books also and the bag gets out of balance and very bulky does n't hold a lot of stuff for a bag this big has lot of small pockets , but is lacking dedicated slots for your pens and pencils , which seems odd
