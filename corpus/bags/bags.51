what 's the point of a sleeve if all it does it cover up your fragile laptop without providing any kind of real protection i bought this product thinking that it 'd be like my other laptop sleeve with a sturdier build , but boy was i wrong this `` protective `` case is thinner than i expected , but hey at least it looks nice if you buy this product , you too can cover your laptop with a stylish case for jealous eyes to see , but do n't let anyone know that the slightest bump can still damage your belongings on a final note , the sizing of this product was a little off i ordered this # `` case thinking it was actually going to fit my # `` laptop snugly , but it was pretty loose maybe i measured my laptop wrong , but i can store so many things inside along with my laptop , which is n't suppose to be the best use of a protective case
i just recently bought my laptop and have been needing a case for it it 's an alright case and does its job , but there is very little padding in it which is a big concern for me i do n't plan on dropping it , but it does n't feel safe in there there is a lot of room to store extra stuff such as power cords so that 's a plus if you decide to get this product i suggest getting a backpack for it as well
looks an feels as expected and i got this at a deal price only con is when you put a # inch laptop it is too tight it ; s a good fit for # and below screen size
i like the unit , it has room for my mouse and some disks , and my extra battery if i choose to put in the sleeve , it also protects my laptop .
i would really recommend this sleeve to anyone looking for something that serves its purpose i carry it around with me to lab everyday and it definitely is sturdy and well-designed i like the front zipper pocket since i can keep my <unk> / etc . in there for use also , there is a bit of free space on the inside after the laptop is placed , so its good if you want to carry around a notepad or some papers with you overall , its a good product
i love the pocket on this case and it fits my # <unk> laptop perfectly perhaps a little thin on the neoprene , but it does what it needs to do i recommend this , especially for the price
i just got a # . # inch hp laptop and wanted a new sleeve to keep it safe during transport this is a very attractive sleeve and the outer pocket holds quite alot , like my portable mouse however , it is n't a snug fit for my laptop nor does it have a handle for carrying it 's pretty good , but i usually put it another bag with this on if the fit had been snug and perfect , # stars , but as it is , it 's still pretty great
i like this case its a normal hp laptop case that fits my hp # . # & # # ; laptop well i do wish however it could be softer or thicker because it is pretty thin and i feel like my laptop is still vulnerable to scratches
i was looking for a sleeve to protect my laptop -lrb- # . # inch dell inspiron n # -rrb- when i carry it in my backpack i ordered it on # th nov , # and received on # th nov , # its very soft and looks attractive with a great combination of red and black my laptop fits nicely and the outer pocket is enough to hold charger and mouse i am happy with the purchase . :
i needed a sleeve that would be a perfect fit for my # . # in acer aspire laptop this sleeve fits perfectly with just a little room to spare for a few loose papers , but nothing bigger the outside pocket fits my wireless mouse , mouse pad , and laptop charger comfortably as well obviously it has a bulge but it 's no big deal to me as a college student , i needed something to protect my laptop from harm against scratches , unexpected falls , and etc . and i found what i needed in this product the only downside one may find in this sleeve is that it does n't have a handle but personally i could deal without it
i bought this inexpensive , <unk> sleeve as extra protection against bumps , dust and scratches for my new hp <unk> laptop it 's made of real light-weight , stretchy foam fabric that would not serve as a primary attache ' but is perfect for slipping into my briefcase the zippered <unk> pocket will hold the power supply , cords and a mouse this one does not have a handle , though other hp sleeves with the same part number do ... strange my laptop is equipped with the optional large battery which allows for a good grip , though best thing was price -- it was less than half the price of buying it from hp
i bought for my hp envy # . # inches ultrabook which is also red and black so they look great together plus it offers the perfect amount of protection for my laptop
i initially bought this because the price was right , but i was seriously impressed when i got it fits perfectly , durable , not to mention sleek looking great protection for my laptop
very strong sleeve zip is good ! . enjoying using it pretty <unk> i didnt want to my laptop to get scratchy , so i used the sleeve then put it in my hand
i bought this to replace a previous laptop sleeve purchased from costco , also an hp product the zipper pull tab broke shortly after the purchase , and it was returned to costco when i discovered this on amazon , i was somewhat skeptical because of my previous experience with a similar hp sleeve my expectations were <unk> the laptop fits perfectly , the zipper pull seems to be more heavy duty than the costco purchase , and the computer is well protected i carry the laptop in another shoulder bag when travelling and there is no worry it will be damaged i am very pleased with the purchase and recommend the sleeve without any reservations
i like the case i usually buy hp cases for my laptops and accessories i was expecting a handle just as i did in my old case however it does not have a handle , but it does not matter much the red and black color works really well it is an original hp case with tags and everything in place
i just love the material the size was perfect a little tight but eventually things get loose and it seems it has enough protection for my laptop and i love the black and red
i ordered this because my last laptop sleeve went <unk> . and i needed a new one i 'm glad i chose this one over the really cheap one i looked at because it fits my hp computer perfectly and the pocket is plenty big enough to fit both the cord and my wireless mouse i was skeptical when i ordered it because the last time i had a sleeve with a pocket , the pocket was useless and the sleeve was several inches too tall this is perfect for my # . # & # # ; laptop and i think part of that is because they 're the same brand
i do not have much to say about this sleeve , other than that it has held up well for two years i jam my work laptop into it every day , and it 's still quite protective
took a chance to order this laptop sleeve for my new sony vaio s series # -lrb- # . # & # # ; -rrb- and it fits great i decided to get this over the case logic because i want a side pocket for the power cord and the usb logitech nano mouse now , i can either place the sleeve in my backpack when i go to work/school or i can just carry the sleeve by itself and still have everything with me when i want to use my laptop it 's not too bulky but still has plenty of padding to protect the laptop seems like it makes out of a great material hope it would last as long as my new laptop
great cover to protect from scratches while transporting good value for your money fit my # . # `` hp laptop perfectly item arrived on time and as described i am happy with this cover
this was definitely the best bargain it does n't look cheap -- it 's actually very nice looking , with the red trim -- and i appreciate that both the main pocket and the front pocket are fully zippered , rather than <unk> or velcro and for $ # , this was ideal
i wanted a cover for my # inch hp pavilion g # so i bought this and i would buy it again it looks fine , is well made , is oem , what else can i spec ? and it has a little bag outside where you can carry usb 's dvd 's or accessories
i picked this out for a christmas gift for myself i needed something to protect my laptop this is perfect because it was only $ # . # and it zips up tightly it also has a pocket in the front for papers or whatever you need to carry i love it
recently i purchased this sleeve for my new # . # `` notebook i am very happy with this hp sleeve because its material has a high quality texture is very soft inside , so i do not worry about scratches on my computer
i already owned this cover , and happily had it protect my mac for # + years until recently when it finally cracked i wanted to replace it , and was happy to find it still for sale i ordered it a while back , and when it arrived it was light baby pink , not a magenta as pictured just awful color , and not at all appropriate for a grown woman and professor to put on her computer i sent it back stating it was the wrong color , and received a refund i recently broke down , and tried ordering it again hoping the last time was just a mistake , only to once again receive the light baby pink please sellers , list it as the right color ... it is not magenta but light pink or stop <unk> the color trying to sell your product
i must have received a defective product the bottom plate does not lock completely onto the front of the unit i would not suggest this item to anyone else ; poor craftsmanship and attention to detail
the top fits snugly , but when i was putting on the bottom , it cracked immediately on top of that , the bottom does n't even completely snap into place it feels like a good , sturdy material , but it just did n't do its job
this product is not everything i thought it would be it does not snap into place on my laptop like it should i had to return the first one because it broke while i was trying to put it on i now have miss placed the box it came it so i ca n't return it for money , talk about a waste of money
i was <unk> disappointed in this item the packaging looks like something heavy duty and well made i opened it only to find the thinnest cheapest plastic you might as well wrap your macbook in plastic wrap and call it good thankfully amazon is amazing and credited me back as i returned it
apple logo does n't shine through like it 's competitors the bottom wo n't even snap on all the way for me and one of the snaps is already sort of broken btw i 've only had it for like # seconds
i was disappointed upon receiving this item only because of the colour it is absolutely not ` magenta ' . it 's more of a ` barbie ' kind of pink other than that the quality is pretty good
i purchased this <unk> cover for my new macbook pro # `` and it fits perfect but the color is practically black , not blue at all the matte finish has a nice rubbery feel to it but the only problem is that you can not get fingerprints off it the edges have a shine to them now where i 've handled it and this is just with normal use i am very careful not to touch it right after i 've put hand cream on i 've tried glass cleaner , eye glass cleaner and other products but nothing will remove the fingerprints overall it 's fine and since i do n't take my lap top many places , i do n't care about the look of all the smudges if anyone has any ideas on how to clean it , i 'd love to hear them
i like the feel of the protector , but it is very slippery , so it tends to slip off if you place it in any angled surface the bottom fitment is not perfect , it does not grab on to the front of the laptop over all i fell it could be better
my personal thoughts about this casing is little expensive and have minor problem to it after while i realized that casing has empty spaces between the macbook pro and case it self also , bottom casing is little bit loose and when ever i open to use , some were in the casing hit each other and make noise that made me uncomfortable seems like it was n't made for mid # model -lrb- i know that mag safe do n't work right on this casing -rrb- it is very nice casing but few things bothers me and probably i will replace them later on with something else
as someone who performs on stage with my macbook pro , i 've been looking for a nice black shell that hides the glowing apple logo , but is also thin , light and protects the body of mac this shell seems to do the trick so far it 's very durable and has a nice easy to clean matte finish it completely hides the glowing mac apple so i can have my laptop on stage with me when performing and not draw any attention to myself if i 'm playing with <unk> or in a <unk> situation i will say the bottom part of the shell does n't fit # % snugly onto the body there 's a slight gap as the small indicator lights -lrb- for the battery level , the laptop being on , etc . -rrb- are n't totally visible unless you push the plastic shell a little to see the lights overall i think this shell is good aside from the not fitting like a glove the incase shell might be better for you if you do n't care about seeing the glowing mac logo , but i do like how light and durable the shell is around my mac
almost perfect fit , the only problem is that the case cant snap on the front part in the bottom of the macbook , specifically in the notch where you put the fingers for opening the laptop apart from that everything that is advertised is true , nice suit and very
i have an early # & # # ; macbook pro and this seems to work very well i love the fact its a matt black that does n't show the illuminated apple logo my only draw back that i see so far on the case is that since i have installed it on my computer i have noticed an increase in the speed my fans are working at i am not sure if this product <unk> my computer very well since there are no holes at the bottom to allow it to breath
i have had this case for # years and the only issue i have had is that the plastic cracks when you take it off quite easily in multiple places this case really take the scratches and bumps well i really wish it was built with more ridged plastic though
so far i 'm really enjoying the quality of this case i 've tried several others and never liked them as they were cheap and consistently cracked and chipped gmyle and kuzy are the worst covers you can get i went through quite a few of them and getting my money back each time this one so far is so much better if anything changes i will <unk>
i love this case , its amazing and i have few different colors the way it fits , it does n't make the laptop heavier nor bigger its a slam and awesome stylish case
i was worried about getting this online , without seeing the fit but , i 've loved my incipio iphone covers so i <unk> it the laptop cover is very slim and a perfect fit we 've had it for # months now and have never had any issues with it coming off or getting damaged i was also a little worried the computer might heat up too much with a cover like this , but have not noticed any heat out of the ordinary
love this thing - i 've had it for years with no issues the only problem is that while charging it tends to get really hot -lrb- the computer will by itself but it tends to <unk> with the case on -rrb-
it has been about # months now that i 've had the <unk> feather case on my macbook pro # `` easy as <unk> to pop on fits like a glove protected my mac even during a car crash where it went flying from the back seat to the front it does n't add any bulk whatsoever <unk> , i also use a zipper neoprene case in addition to it from time to time the case is n't slippery to hold onto , and though it gets some smudges , i just wipe it with a <unk> towel or my sleeve and its back to looking great very pleased with this purchase also , it arrived # days before my mac did , which was awesome
i ordered this case for my asus eee pad transformer i was excited by how quickly it arrived , until i discovered it does n't really fit sure , my tablet will fit inside it , but it 's too big in some dimensions and too small in others the fold-over flap wo n't lay down , and i 'm constantly worried my expensive tablet is going to fall out , or something else is going to slide in and scratch up the screen this case might be fine for other tablets , but i 'm only using it until i get one that actually fits edit : seller has excellent customer service and has changed the listing to no longer mention the asus transformer tablet since my order
works great with transformer and dock only issue is it 's starting to already tear at the seam and will probably need replacing in a few months have only used it for about a month so this is n't good
i know the <unk> was not specifically made for the xoom as a result , it has too much give and is bigger than my xoom so it slides around inside it the sleeve is very good for protecting the screen when i store the xoom i can take the xoom in and out of the sleeve very easily i felt , though , that i needed to purchase a carrying case with more padding for protection when i travel with the xoom the sleeve arrived in excellent condition before the due date the price was good
it 's fine for basic protection and fits the gtablet well the only disappointment is that it is a soft case i keep the tablet -lrb- in its case -rrb- in a desk drawer to keep it away from the cats ' <unk> it would be nice to have a good hard case for that kind of protection but it 's decent basic protection so at least i do n't have to keep the tablet in the box it fits the gtablet perfectly
it 's a good <unk> cover that fits the viewsonic g-tablet perfectly the only downside that i see to it is that it does n't really keep light touches from pressing the power button and turning on the tablet overall , a good buy for the cost
i purchased this for my viewsonic g-tablet , and i have <unk> it 's a great fit not too snug , and not too lose i just would 've <unk> something where i could pull it out of the side , rather than the top but that is , by far , my only real complaint i would recommend this item to both friends and family oh , and i also like the way that i do n't have to unsnap or unzip anything to get at the device this should work out rather nicely for future travels , of this travelling man
the case provides protection from scratches , and the thin padding might cushion a light blow but nothing more as long as this level of protection is all you need , it is a light <unk> nice looking case
bought this for my viewsonic g tablet and it works just fine not a perfect fit but knew that before buying well constructed and does what is expected ... will buy another for a acer a # that i just purchased
i received this case about # weeks ago tightly fits an acer a # tablet only concern was the odor but after # weeks it was no longer a concern , which i would have given # stars
purchased it for my husband and he loves his new toy he likes this case when he takes his acer with him when he travels fits snuggly and protects nicely
will be able to use while traveling on airplane , in the car and on my upcoming cruise this sleeve will protect my gtablet from any damages or the weather
nice little bag to stow my g-tablet in padded , easy to insert with a flap instead of zippers , snaps , etc . it is n't fancy and it is n't cute but it does a nice job of protecting my tablet in transit i recommend it
this is an excellent product it is well designed , well made and fits my viewsonic gtablet like a glove also included were a couple of surprise free gifts : dust brush and <unk> - ideal for my projector , and a nice bag the delivery was also excellent it was <unk> by usps the very next day it 's a shame other sellers can not also provide such excellent service
i am happy to report that my new viewsonic <unk> fits perfectly inside the holder it is very soft has a small outside pocket for use it has a nice hand strap on the rear side
this is a simple and functional case that does what it claims very well it has enough padding that i feel comfortable carrying my g tablet around in it without worrying it fits very well and i like that i can still have it plugged in with the top folding style it seems to be well made and i expect it will hold up well over time
for the price it 's ok , but there is no bottom padding what so ever and very little else where you most use extra care when you set the backpack down so not to damage your laptop as far as durability it seems a little on the lite side i have a # . # laptop the internal strap to hold it in place barely fits over it i am looking to upgrade to more suitable back pack as i travel a lot
got this backpack today from amazon -lrb- props for fast shipping ! -rrb- and just had the chance to check it out while the build quality seems to be equal to or greater than my previous swiss gear pack , it 's laptop sleeve is n't quite large enough to fit my asus g # jh inside while that is true , it will comfortably fit in the pocket that contains the sleeve the only problem is , once the laptop is in there , there 's barely any room for more stuff i managed to fit a thin book in , a # `` binder , and a # <unk> spiral notebook , along with some pencils and a calculator , before running out of space for college use , this just is n't going to work , as the books usually are n't think so , basically , good quality but too small will be returning it soon
i bought this backpack for the sole reason of it 's size -lrb- to fit a # . # `` -rrb- the backpack fits the laptop and has room to spare there is more than enough room to fit anything you need the shoulder straps are comfortable and are just the right size i highly recommend this product for any college student who has a large laptop , or anyone with that size laptop in general
so i bought this to fit my asus g # jw , which is a # . # inch laptop it does this perfectly , with plenty of room to spare however , i also use it to carry all my notebooks and papers and stuff to class , and it 's also awesome for that there 's a ton of places to put pencils and pens in the second pocket , and i keep gloves and my calculator in the front one to give you a sense of the volume it can fit , i regularly carry home # <unk> boxes of <unk> , as well as a quart of milk , and it can fit all of that quite well it 's also mildly waterproof , i would n't dump it in a <unk> but it holds up to rain pretty well lastly , the straps are great i did n't realize how crappy my old backpack 's straps were , but this backpack is much much easier to carry around than my older one overall , great backpack , i would recommend it
this bag is working perfectly for my needs fits my hp # . # inch with room to spare very durable and room for the rest of my travel items
i do a lot of city walking for my business , but i carry both a # & # # ; laptop and an ipad this backpack has been great giving me a pocket for each device plus room for files , accessories , and supplies it is well balanced and feels comfortable to wear it is conservative enough to look good even when i 'm wearing a suit , but casual enough to fit my weekend <unk> look much better price than in the stores and it arrived very quickly
this backpack fits my giant # . # & # # ; laptop ! ! the quality is very nice the backpack has tons of pockets and is overall a great thing to have for college i would definitely recommend this to anyone who wants a nice backpack for a good
this bag is just what the doctor ordered my old <unk> backpack was falling apart very sturdy ; nice wide , easy to adjust straps ; plenty of room for laptop and books
i was a little skeptical prior to ordering this backpack because i did n't think it would hold my # . # laptop , wacom pen tablet , external hard drive , all of their accessories and more it does with easy and i still have room for more the material does n't feel cheap and its rather comfortable
i got this for my son as a gift he had trouble finding one the right size for his lap top this is perfect and he really likes it he has n't even been using it for a month yet , but it should hold up it looks sturdy and the price was right
although this vacuum could work in a house situation with light cleaning this does not have the <unk> needed for a public areas in a busy operation does not pick up <unk> <unk> on floors from heavy <unk> and does not pull out of the crevices of <unk> <unk> weight is good , attachments good although it could benefit with wheels to set it down to roll does get cumbersome for long periods of use is being returned
not really necessary to appreciate vacuum it is for ; vacuum comes with its own carrying strap , which was not evident from the info i read about the vacuum before ordering this bag bag is too complex for the simple function it
five stars for this bag makes changing out the attachments so easy , as well as multiple ways to transport -lrb- carry by shoulder or strap around your waist -rrb- nothing wrong with this bag and well worth the investment
the <unk> is wonderful i just had a hard time convincing my wife to carry it with the <unk> we have two dogs -lrb- <unk> -rrb- , and burn wood , so there is always stuff to vacuum up this machine does it well without the loud noise of the <unk> and the all the ridiculous attachments of the floor model
the carrying bag was nicer than i had imagined love the pocket for the extra attachments the padded shoulder strap and the waist strap <unk> to hold the vacuum in place while using it - making it much more comfortable it 's still not as easy as having someone else vacuum , but it 's tolerable
with a cat , dog and a daughter with long hair , this lightweight vacuum is great for zipping around the house in no time to get the pet hair and dust puppies up from the wood floors much faster and easier than pushing around an upright or dragging a <unk> around and the reusable filter bag is great to empty outside so it is ready for the next time -lrb- just be sure to notice which way the wind is blowing when you shake it out !
this vacuum must be worn cross body to not cause shoulder pain it is very powerful , has nice attachments and overall would recommend to anyone wanting this type of vacuum both the vacuum and bag are well made
the bag is great i like that i can snap it around my waist while i am using it the only problem that i have is that if i bend over the shoulder strap turns off the machine i use it to dust the dog hairs off the furniture .
this bag is excellent for your cleaning up fast strong and durable ca n't ask for a better one i would recommend this bag to anyone who cleans for a living or just there own home
i was very pleased with this carrying bag it is comfortable and easy to use i just put it over my shoulder <unk> and i do n't need the extra strap to keep it in place i like that i can carry my attachments with me as well
it does not fit properly and one must constantly struggle to not loose it it also is cheap looking and too transparent to cover up an old , badly scratched laptop all in all , my laptop looks worse now than it did before i bought this case save your money
i ordered this case a day ago , and it came in the very next day the title of this product it totally misleading iit says macbook - white , which is what i have , the # inch # version when i received the case it says it 's a hard case for macbook air then why did n't it say macbook air on the title ? ? of course , it did n't fit my macbook at all , i am returning it
i ordered this case a week ago , and it came fairly quickly however it 's mislabeled online i have the newest edition of the # `` macbook and it does not fit i spent an hour trying to figure out how to snap it on and concluded it did n't fit also , had it fitted , the ability to open my laptop would have been seriously limited
my macbook had a habit of getting very hot when i used it on my lap - and the apple genius kept saying , `` this is n't really a < laptop > y ' know . i wondered where else i would be using this convenient <unk> computer after <unk> burns from my overheated mac , i decided i needed a case to cool down the situation purple ... no hot pink ... na white with a tactile frost looks great on the macbook , keeps the laptop cool , more grippy , and incase stands behind their products for a full year <unk> is an fantastic vendor at amazon , providing superb customer service , too all in all , i 'm delighted with my <unk> computer case
i have tried almost every type of screen protector on several types of smart phones these devices are beautiful and the end user should not have to choose blurry , <unk> screens or reduced touch accuracy as a <unk> , glass screen shields are top of the line tech armor had gone above and beyond i have used <unk> and spigen , this one is the most affordable , easiest to install -lrb- they even packaged a <unk> cup to ensure an accurate application ! -rrb- and after weeks , it still looks brand new i was a bit concerned that i saw nothing about it being oil resistant , but it <unk> the others that advertise it ! for this price , it is worth every penny
looks nice , great feel , and quite good padding however , it scratches the sides of your macbook and the small rubber bands <unk> n't fit my macbook , s the case <unk> stay on
the photos of this product , certainly were designed to <unk> , and that was achieved after using this case for my new mac book pro for # days , i began to <unk> , small dents and a slight scrape -lrb- revealing shining silver metal -rrb- on the corners of my computer it seems that after repeated placement into the case , it causes this and if i allowed this to continue , it would have become progressively worse in short this product will not protect your mac book pro it will eventually damage the computer if they had taken time to design it , and placed a barrier around the computer , preventing the metal of the zipper making contact with the computer , this case would have been brilliant so if you want to damage your mac book pro -lrb- minor as i caught it before it became major damage -rrb- i can not recommend this product ! ! !
very pricey for the quality zipper broke within the second month i like the idea , and i like the design , but for $ # bucks , i expect a heck of a lot better quality if your looking for something to hold up , day to day use , this product is n't for you good luck in your search
i thought that this leather macbook case would be a great addition to my laptop ... but unfortunately the quality is low and it has almost no padding i returned it immediately
the quality of the product is amazing except for one thing the zippers around the case is very tight and there ar n't any protection on the inside of the zippers in fact , it has actually scratched my macbook pro , which defeats the purpose of a # dollar macbook case overall , i am unsatisfied because the case have caused more damaged to my macbook pro than protecting it
i heard about book book from a friend who has the brown cover for his macbook the quality of the leather for his is much better i would have bought the same as his but wanted the red to differentiate between our laptops why do the two have entirely different leather qualities the leather on mine is paper thin and when scratched peels off this is in regards to e brown leather on mine i feel ripped off same price for completely different quality
i just received my bookbook cover for my macbook pro today and was excited to get it it seemed so cool online and i even watched a few youtube reviews on it upon taking it out of the mesh bag , i was disappointed from the first glance i guess from a distance it looks like a book but it feels like cardboard it feels nothing at all like real leather i have never seen or felt a real book that feels anything like this laptop cover the inside of the case looks cheap as well i put it back in its sleeve and slid the case back in the mesh bag , <unk> it and will be mailing it back to amazon i am not paying $ # for junk do not buy
this leather cover was poorly designed and <unk> the zipper broke after using it four times the stitching on the leather was not complete either quality control sure missed this
in general , it 's ok the most important part - zipper is attached wrong side up i could not figure out for a while why do i struggle to open and especially close the zipper i have manufacturing business with products with zippers so , i know what i am talking about - zipper bottom side is facing top and zipper pull is hardly running because it was made with manufacturing error every time i use it , have to swear lol when closing or
it works well as a novelty item and decoration , i did not find it extremely useful to practical purposes when i would open/close the & # # ; book & # # ; the bands that hold the computer to the case would work <unk> it looks nice on my <unk> now , i have since switched to a sleek case that covers and protects the computer rather than decorate it
looks good , feels good , came with so many official product label tags they <unk> out of the case when i opened it my disappointment is the zipper it worked once and never came right again
i love the look , but other than that its kind of a let down . there is two small stretchy pieces holding this very expensive piece of equipment in really i expected a more secure hold but thats ok the zippers are kind of tight and not the easiest to close i would not spend the # bucks again if i would have seen this in person before buying it i decided to keep my hard shell case on due to the zippers and a previous review about scratching the mac all in all looks great and thats about it
i 've seen these for ipads and they 're the perfect size but when you get it for the # inch computer , they 're gigantic it was a college grad present for a friend , he returned it
when i received the <unk> bookbook cover it looked really great , just like advertised the zipper however looked cheap and too weak to do the job when i went to fit my ipad , it fit snugly in the bookbook and looked like a real book pretty cool i thought until i went to zip-up the zipper the zipper on one end would zip-up , but as you <unk> the part that was supposed to be zipped would come <unk> i tried to <unk> it with a little lip <unk> -lrb- to <unk> -rrb- the teeth , but it did n't change anything i thought about keeping the bookbook because i really liked the way it looked , but made the intelligent decision to return it , remembering what my first impression was - the zipper looked too weak
i 've had my bookbook for two years and have loved it , except for the fact that the zippers are really cheap and break easily one of them broke less than a month after i had bought it i just used the other one until it recently broke i contacted <unk> to look into their warranty , and still have n't heard back three weeks later i may buy another one , but will have to think long and hard about spending that kind of money for cheap zippers and a company that does n't value customer service
i 've always wanted to get one of these and when i finally bought one , i was so excited to use with it my macbook unfortunately , it 's a little too snug and i always have to be careful not to scratch the sides of my laptop when zipping it close you can imagine how challenging that is when i 'm on the go using it while in bed is also a challenge as the elastic that 's supposed to be holding the laptop in place barely serves the purpose i have received several compliments about how it looks , though all in all , it 's aesthetically pleasing but if you want to use your macbook and enjoy the lightness that it boasts of , then this case is not for you
