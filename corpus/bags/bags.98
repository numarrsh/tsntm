my dad bought this for me as a gift and i love it . it protects my computer and it does n't overheat as it used to with other cases . it looks very sleek ! love it
i had a white leather cover , but it had those pesky little ink marks all over the place and was showing wear this cover fits perfectly and i was able to wipe off the first little ink mark i 'm trying to be more careful , because i 'm not sure i 'll be as lucky next time this looks great and i really do n't care if it is leather or not
just wanted to add that this case fits a regular macbook quite well i thought it 'd be too tight but with a little elbow grease it goes right in without compromising the stitching or material i could n't be happier
this case is light pink just like the picture it has a snug fit to the laptop the material looks leather but i do n't know for sure ... for the price i paid , it would n't bother me if it was n't there are no <unk> on the bottom of this case i have access to all ports with no <unk> i would recommend this product
this cover is sooo awesome ! it feels good and it is a good <unk> liked it cuz no body has it and everybody keep asking me where did i get it from
i do n't mind if people can see the apple logo or not i just know that everybody ask me for this cover it looks very delicate it is different and protect the expensive laptop there is a matching cover for the ipad with the cancer ribbon on a corner i have to add , this is one of the best <unk> i made at amazon until now , the cover keeps looking good and in excellent conditions
this ihome smart briefcase is truly smart and extremely well organized for all your gadgets the bag is made of sturdy nylon , has a strong strap and is n't bulky at all there is a pocket for almost everything from your ipad , iphone , chargers -lrb- all slots have labels to help you get used to your new bag -rrb- so you know exactly where everything is located it fits a laptop of up to # inch and my macbook pro fits perfectly in this the ipad , phone and laptop slots have a very soft material inside so as not to scratch the screens my only gripe and the reason i took off a star is that while it has a slot for your gadgets , it will not fit large documents or books it just is n't large enough for that and though i like that it is n't bulky , it should have been slightly larger in its width to accommodate a book or documents that said , it 's a great everyday office bag when you just need to have all your gadgets and laptop and is extremely smart and durable
do n't get me wrong , i really like the briefcase it 's made of high quality material and provide good protection for my laptops the briefcase is not too small nor too big for an # . # inch laptop it 's just the right size however , i feel like this briefcase is a little overpriced however , if you can afford a $ # macbook , then definitely get this it 's the best briefcase out there
i have a friend who owns a macbook pro , and he used this bag for a bit overall , he said it was a `` nice little bag . `` but , also , i am now using it for my pc laptop , because essentially , it is a laptop bag heavy duty construction , good for travel , just an all-around good laptop bag
this product fit the needs of my new larger macbook pro i was n't at all surprised because i had already been using the same one on my # & # # ; macbook pro i was delighted to find this one performed as well as my first purchase of the smaller one got a great deal on the second one by using amazon and the free delivery was timely enough for my needs
this briefcase is perfect it has so many pockets and <unk> that everything fits in perfectly and so organized i have a place for my kindle , my laptop , my mouse , and my all my charger cords it even has a zipper pocket for business cards , credit cards , money so i do n't have to carry a purse around ... that 's one less strap on my shoulder no kidding , this thing is by far worth the money it is sturdy , and the pockets for kindle -lrb- ipad -rrb- and laptop are lined with really soft fabric so no scratches i 'm so excited about this , i ca n't wait till my next meeting the only thing i 'd like better is if it were a different color than black , but then my laptop is black so that matches ... now , why should i complain
when i got my new macbook pro , i started researching and checking out carrying cases none of the major brands i looked at in the stores quite fit the features i was looking for , until i came across the ihome smart brief it has everything i need and more love that it has separate compartments for the laptop , charging cords , and even for my tablet only thing i would ask for is a more substantial , comfortable shoulder strap but i can replace that easily enough could not be happier with
i am a weekly traveler , so i was excited to try this computer bag the overall design -lrb- compartments -rrb- is great , though a bit snug and , i would have rated the bag # - or # -star , except for a major flaw in quality if you fill the bag , which is easy to do , the zippers will malfunction either they do not close or the zipper separates after you have zipped it closed i have owned many computer bags over the year -lrb- swiss gear , samsonite , etc . -rrb- and the zippers on this computer bag is the worst quality of them all
the name is true , it 's a smart , compact , sleek , and functional design , with room for your macbook pro , ipad , and iphone , plus more , all easily accessible looks great , simple black , standard laptop case taken to the next level for the apple <unk> in your life
the one thing that stands out the most from this compact bag is how many different pockets and compartments it has for the most part these are very well designed to allow for easy access although all the extra padding does effectively limit the amount of space available in particular , the handles are n't the best fit and less so when the bag is completely filled thankfully , the design , while <unk> for apple products , is usable for non-apple products -lrb- in particular the ipad pocket can fit the longer # inch android tablets overall , this is a great laptop and multiple device travel bag which offers plenty of space for gadgets as well as easy access to the same
this bag has so bells and <unk> it is padded every where your laptop will be protected for sure as long as it is inside this bag the shoulder strap is wide and padded , you wo n't feel much that it is tugging your shoulder it has pockets and nooks for everything from your keys , pens , ipads , cellphones , eyeglasses bag is bulky tsa approved really depends on the security <unk> if they will have you remove the laptop from the bag or not surely it is just one zip and your laptop is completely exposed except for a mesh of net for them inspect
i hate anything mac ! iphone , ipod , ipad , macbook , you name it i am not a fan but this item is just perfect for a traveler i have had it for several months now and i am so pleased with it
this is a very cheaply made laptop bag it smells strongly of petroleum type chemicals my laptop fits into the main compartment , but it 's a very tight squeeze padding is very minimal the cords bulge out of the extra pocket no place to safely store the wireless mouse it 's uncomfortable to carry with the shoulder strap i think the price is too high for this very minimally adequate bag
i loved this bag until started tearing around the straps i ended up having to get another laptop bag , which might not be as cute , but definitely worked better than this one and i get more use out of it than this
this bag is very colorful - more so than you realize from the picture it 's a decently made bag , but i think where the handles join the body of the sleeve , it could be more secure i like that it has handles and a shoulder strap
i just received it today and the design and colors are just what i thought it would be i have n't used it yet to say whether the quality is good , but i will let you know if it 's not
bought this bag for my # year old daughter for christmas it is very pretty and has lots of colors i feel this will be great for her first time computer bag
it is good the side pocket keeps the cord , and external hard drive away from my computer i wish the material was a little more like a protective case ... it is pretty thin
this bag is very handy we just love it it has enough space for all the cables , mouse , memory stick etc . get a lot of comments about the awesome colors from other people
i bought this item and i really do enjoy and love it i even told friends and family about my new laptop carrying case that i had bought , and they liked it
nice enough case , and very nice for the price but the ring on the case that attaches to the clip of the shoulder strap ripped out under normal use -lrb- pulled the fabric strap right out of its stitching -rrb- laptop and all , <unk> on the hard floor of the atlanta airport transportation mall of what value is a nice case <unk> , when the construction ca n't hold what one might normally put in it looks like a <unk> design - made to look like what it is supposed to be , not actually be it
send order back , was not what what i expected seemed cheaply made bought for traveling back and forth for business and did n't fit my needs thanks to amazon for the easy return
i bought this bag # months ago and was really pleased with the size and quality of it the zippers are nice and there is plenty of storage for my laptop , papers and other items today i threw it over my shoulder and the shoulder strap pulled out of the bag the stitching is very minimal at this important stress point consequently i can not recommend this bag
the bag looks great i have n't even had it for a year and the strap ring pulled from the briefcase and it the ground luckily my laptop was not in the back i only had some paper , my lab manual and a folder
i had two of these bags it is spacious , light , fairly well organized and inexpensive but ... with the first bag two of the zippers gave in after about a couple of years of use case logic was nice enough to replace the bag for free as they have , i believe , a # years warranty on computer bags with second bag , the swivels that attach the strap to the bag got worn out to the point that the one of the swivel just broke today and the bag fell to the ground this after just one year of use sorry case logic but this time i am not going to <unk> the warranty again and get a replacement too much trouble i 'll switch brand
it 's a good bag with plenty of storage i like the padding , and the smaller pockets all over for it i rate it a bit lower because of the shoulder strap loop on # side is ripping the case lining is ripping there too but the top carry handle is super sturdy i 'd recommend buying it , but just not carrying too much in it with the shoulder strap
this bag was relatively inexpensive yet has tons of storage space and is durable i travel every day for work this bag holds a full sized laptop , additional flat screen monitor , file folders , and all my pens , pencils , etc . its very lightweight , but durable its amazing that it can hold all this stuff while not being too bulky or too heavy
i bought this as a gift for my husband this case is light weight , sturdy and stylish it 's a big improvement over his old leather case there is a lot of room to hold extras , and ths price was great
excellent quality briefcase with plenty of storage price is right you wo n't be disappointed i found this briefcase to be of better quality than some of the more expensive briefcases this one recommend ! & # # ; two thumbs up & # #
its cool but safety # some its covered from up side down side but between of them nothing covered . . ! ! ! and very small . . i take time to get my mac inside it ...
i really like this case , it fits my # & # # ; macbook pro -lrb- a # -rrb- with its hard case on , and has a pocket for the charger cable the reason it does n't get # stars is that the zipper is a bit of a struggle , not like it 's straining or going to come apart , just not smooth in its movement the color is less of a mint blue , more of a -lrb- slightly brighter -rrb- tiffany blue , than pictured
the sleeve is really nice & the quality seems good the color is a little darker than the picture , but it 's still really pretty i only wish the front pocket were a little bigger
loved this sleeve it is a light and handy the little pocket can be used to hold the cord of course without the extension if you have a mac
this case is exactly what i wanted it 's rugged and well-padded , but still slim and compact , and it seems to be very well constructed i have n't put it to much use yet , so we 'll see how it holds up , but like i said , it appears to be very high quality the color is very slightly darker than what the picture shows , but just barely
i love this -- finally a carrying case with a pocket for the cords i can fit my computer cord and iphone <unk> in the zipped pocked <unk> my travel , and the sleeve is lightweight -lrb- part of the reason i bought the new computer , so i did n't want to bulk it up with accessories -rrb- this works great , it 's pretty -- i can find it in my briefcase -lrb- black on black sometimes <unk> me out thinking i 've lost something -rrb-
i ordered this case once i got my new macbook pro and for what i need , this case is perfect its not bulky at all but it protects my computer very well i usually just carry my computer in another bag with books and binders , and this case does a great job at keeping it protected however , the color is darker than the picture shows , im rather sad with this , but the color is still beautiful none the less
just got this case today the actual color is darker than the picture , but i still like it it 's well-padded and fits the macbook pro even with a hard case on which i like so far , i have no complaints . :
i want to buy a case to protect my computer , instead of adding more scratch on my mac air this product totally does n't feet your mac air save your money for your dinner ! !
the case cover its very bad quality and my computer gets really hot when i use it , ... also i wanted something like more clear the keyboard cover is pretty bad , it doesnt fit right so i dont like and im not going to use it
bought both the clear and the blue crystal ones , and both are not see through the clear is frosted and the blue is just not see through and not even frosted at all , you ca n't even see the color of the mac they should say it the description , and not only describe them all as see through want my money back ! ! !
i returned for a moshi keyboard cover and more expensive speck case and i am happy with both the quality of these items is pretty much what you pay for a friend of mine ordered a similar package for her macbook pro and was happy with it after comparing cases and keyboard covers , hers was great and mine was disappointing
the cases fits easily and snugly against the macbook visually it looks appealing and the <unk> color helps hide some scratches however , the plastic is weak and can chip or crack with little force also , while i stated that the color hides scratches , in the right light you can see how easily the plastic does scratch if you 're looking for an inexpensive protective case , then you 'll enjoy this product for me , i think it leaves a little too much on the table
the case came as described mine is a macbook air a # one of the latches on the bottom part did n't quite fit right until i bent it to fit the keyboard cover was not worth it , it did not stick on , it just lays on top of the keys and comes off i do n't even use it mine came with a free mouse pad i do n't even use it , but the quality of the mouse pad is cheaper than the ones they give out for free at <unk>
this case came in quickly and it is exactly what i expected not sure how long it will last but for what i 'm using it for -lrb- scratch protection -rrb- , it 's doing it 's job perfectly the keyboard cover is also doing well it 's got a nice build to it and fits perfectly i am satisfied
i am changing my review of this item from very nice to poor craftsmanship the warranty for this item expired on # / # of course , it is now # / # and the stitching that keeps the handle on the case has fallen apart , though i have not used it often to return it i 'd have to pay for the shipping i 'll put some duct tape on it instead and deal with it i 'm disappointed with belkin i 'd upload a photo but amazon does n't have that option
this was a cool case , however it was not large enough to hold my # inch laptop it would probably make a good ipad case , but wo n't fit anything much bigger
you can not easily fit a # . # & # # ; laptop in this case too bad this case does n't come in a # & # # ; or # & # # ; size because i love the simple style the zipper hits the corners of my computer also , where would you fit anything else ... like the laptop charger
i love this case it 's gorgeous and well-constructed and super slim while still providing nice padding unfortunately , it 's really tight -lrb- so tight i 'd worry about the zipper scratching the computer -rrb- for a # & # # ; macbook pro it would be ideal for a macbook air , i 'm sure
i bought this case to carry my ipad - in it 's own slimline case - when i travel through airports and for boarding the plane and getting off the plane with the ipad being much smaller than a computer , i can get quite a bit in it if i want it holds the ipad , a paperback , a wristlet , boarding pass , a snack , and several other things if i do n't have much more than meds and jewelry in my # & # # ; carry-on , it fits in there when i do n't want to carry it i am very pleased w/this case ; especially at $ # . # today i noticed it is $ # . # for some reason hopefully that 's temporary
i bought this bag almost a year ago to use as my daily commuter bag it fits the mac air # & # # ; , the base charger , my magic mouse , a few batteries , and my passport anything more and the front compartment will bulge out , looking rather ugly buy this bag if you 're a minimalist , someone who only needs their <unk> air + charger it 's been almost a year and i 've had no complaints there is wear & tear , but for a bag that 's currently under $ # , it deserves # stars for being functional and sleek
all these ratings are from people who just got it practically i 've had <unk> for two years and all the s *** is breaking on it when i asked about getting it repaired he wanted to charge me nearly the price of a new one get a real bag like <unk> or even the <unk> bag you do not want this garbage on set
i have always wanted to get a <unk> and let me tell you this bag is amazing and i pack it with tons of gear and still have pockets empty i also strap a monopod and <unk> hd # on the back and i get around no problem if you travel a lot or shoot a lot of outdoors and wan na keep your gear clean and protected this is the bag for you
yes , this bag is small enough to fit under any airline seat i 've flown , including the smaller <unk> rj 's i was able to carry a large <unk> # camera * and * my <unk> fluid head in the main compartment the side pockets and such are almost too small to be terribly useful , but what a great bag properly adjusted it hangs on your hips and shoulders nicely too as you 're walking down that # mile <unk> to your connecting flight built very well , i would definitely recommend this to anyone if i was another bag created for carrying film and video gear , i would <unk> this bag
this bag has been all over with me in the last year or so i love it it protects my camera , lenses , gear , and still has room for extras in a small package i shoot with a sony <unk> # , i have a century # . # x adapter , and a wide angle plus # large batteries , filters , cables , etc . i am amazed how much fits in this bag for how lightweight it actually seems when you wear it i used to have a tamrac and a lowepro , and this one just works with video equipment better i like that the zipper access is close to your back instead of on the outside , it feels safer having your gear closer to you without being able to be accessed from behind would highly recommend
got this as an xmas gift for my girlfriend who loves the <unk> fits her # `` macbook perfectly snug when the zipper is closed so the laptop does n't slide around inside padding is of a decent quality , graphics on the outside are wonderful she is extremely happy with it
this case is not only useful but yet very stylish and beautiful i love the lining inside , protects well my laptop i just wish the little pocket on the outside was a little bit bigger definitely recommend this product
this is a great sleeve the thickness offers great protection the inside is very <unk> graphics look great and there is even a small storage pocket on the <unk> side shipping time was quick considering i ordered it only # weeks before christmas : -rrb- thanks
this case is so cute it fits my macbook perfectly and it 's super soft inside the colors are even more vibrant in person - i get tons of compliments on it
the quality of the sleeve is high and looks just like the picture the only negative is the sleeve is too big for the macbook pro and slides around in it
so , i probably should n't have gotten this since it was so big , but i just loved it i have a # -inch and wish that they had it in a smaller size for it i was bummed because it is so big , but will make it work because i just love snoopy
i am happy with it fast shipping and delivery definitely recommend if you like snoopy i like the little pocket on top i also like the soft inside lining
love it ... this is a great laptop case for snoopy fans it has a very cute design on the front and back the case is of excellent quality it is very thick -lrb- but not bulky -rrb- and sturdy and the inside is lined with a soft , light blue furry padding that really protects your laptop this was an excellent purchase
i love this product it fits my full size laptop i was looking at others and for the same price i was able to get one near and dear to my heart
for the price this sleeve is thick , plush and with the faux fur inside , it is excellent protection for your laptop i use this with my macbook pro # & # # ; and it is fantastic it fits like a glove and the zipper is excellent quality i highly recommend
love this case bought the first one for my daughter 's laptop and liked her 's so much i decided to buy one for me like the fact that it is lined with a soft fabric i also like the extra pocket for accessories , like a mouse or earbuds or anything else you may wish to carry but most of all , it had snoopy and <unk> on the cover that <unk> it for me
my new macbook air fits perfectly just the right amount of snugness to fit like a skin the leather is smooth and high quality the inside is soft and will not scratch any surfaces perfect for protection when i slip it into a briefcase with my other work laptop
i was a little concerned about the fit for my ativ book # since it 's advertised as a sleeve for the mba however , after reading all the reviews and comparing the dimensions between the two laptops , i 've decided to give it a shot i 'm currently using the sleeve as a cushion between my laptop and the coffee shop table i have to say , it provides some nice padding and keeps the bottom of the laptop relatively clean in terms of the fit , it provides my laptop a fairly snug fit my concerns regarding the different dimensions between the ativ book # and the mba were <unk> it is a very soft case and does not have any rigidity so if you 're looking for something that can absorb the shock from a drop , this is probably not the case the leather is very soft , smooth , and nice i mainly use it to keep the laptop from scratching while in my bag
why did you choose this rating ? # stars -- & # # ; i love it what did you like uppercase genuine leather pouch / sleeve case for the macbook air # . # ... who would you recommend this product to ? all my
the case is sleek and protective it has a nice look to it , and kept the fresh leather smell for months gave it to my boyfriend for his birthday and he loved it
the reason for a low rating is because the description is not appropriate it says & # # ; leather & # # ; and yet the product is neoprene like material thus misleading the buyer it should be <unk> as & # # ; synthetic leather & # # ; at the very least
i bought this for my new samsung series # laptop thinking it would have more cushion but i 'm a little disappointed that it did n't it is very sleek looking and holds the laptop very well and snug which i like another downside is that the flap does n't have a clasp to lock it in place if you happen to hold the sleeve with the laptop inside , it just does n't stay closed and open to expose the laptop . i 'm not liking that too much the sleeve itself uses a very nice leather material but for some reason picks up oils from my fingers very easily i think there is room for improvement like they could have at least had some way to lock or close the flap so it does n't swing around so easily i do think that is for someone who wants a slick looking sleeve but do n't expect too much protection from this
i think this sleeve was really made for a # & # # ; ultrabook -lrb- there 's even a <unk> in the product description , which describes it as a ' # & # # ; sleeve ' -rrb- my # & # # ; samsung ultrabook does indeed fit in it , but it 's definitely snug , to the point that i suspect a # & # # ; would work a lot better i do n't pull my laptop out frequently enough for the snugness to be much of a bother , and it 's otherwise a very nice sleeve , but it 's just something to be aware of
it is a little expensive , but this sleeve ended up being nicer than i thought it would be it gives a little bit of padding it is just the right size which makes it super nice
this <unk> fits snugly and with some room left for you to keep your mouse 's wireless adapter plugged into your usb it is sleek and sharp looking to match your brand new samsung laptop i like it
this fits the samsung series # inch perfect leather is a little thin but seems fairly durable -lrb- only time will tell -rrb- i would use this sleeve in conjunction with a laptop bag for sure leather is smooth and matches laptop perfectly would definitely recommend for anyone with a samsung series # laptop
i expected a good quality , usable , bag for my net book and what i got was a really cheap , smelly , case that does n't even zip all the way with the handles out it is n't thick enough to protect the computer when i received it all of the packaging including postage was in chinese <unk> when i tried to return it the company , <unk> amazon , offered to give me # of what i paid i told them that was unacceptable and have not heard from them since the lesson learned is do not buy from a third party or make sure you do your homework ! ! ! !
its cute but in order to use the handle the zipper needs to stay opened the handles are on the inside no outside i wish i knew this before buying it
the bag fits my chrome book perfectly i am very pleased with my purchase the only thing i do n't like is that you can not zip up the bag and use the handles at the same time
this bag is ok not as good as i hoped i wanted one with handles but the handles are not usable unless you don ' t zip it all the way closed the handles are on the inside & the zipper is on the outside so you can you can only zip it up to the handles besides that it smells bad like a chemical smell from the material its made from or something its treated with i had to hang it outside to get some of the smell out otherwise it 's attractive & my computer fits in it good
i 'm a little disappointed because the picture is misleading the straps for this bag are on the inside of the bag so you can not carry the bag with out the bag being opened
it 's small light weight which makes it easy to carry it 's also durable so my netbook is protected the handles make it great i could carry it as i would carry a purse or a regular bag i would recommend this
i just received my computer cover today unbelievably gorgeous , and it has handles ! these are the best words to describe it i opened the package and my daughter came down to see what i had gotten in the mail , she was so excited and wanted to take it for her computer fortunately my computer is smaller than hers and i got to keep it everyone will be so jealous of me
we ordered the dog case and it is absolutely beautiful it is also good quality i will definitely order other designs the shipping takes a little bit longer but it is worth the wait
the case that i purchased was a perfect fit for my nine inch tablet love the butterfly 's and the color i liked it because it has a pocket in the front witch is nice for your charger or headphones i would recommend this to everyone
this is very pretty i love that it has a shoulder strap in addition to the hand strap i did n't realize that it has an outside pocket until it arrived - i love that feature - i will be able to store my charger in there when i travel
this bag is perfect it is just the right size and fits the ipad case and all just right i love it it also had a gripped side on the shoulder strap so it stays on while <unk> without <unk> off
i love this bag got one as a gift and loved it i then found out where to purchase and bought two of these as gifts for people i know this a great bag that fits ipad with an otterbox protective cover on it love the shoulder strap that does n't slip off shoulder because of gripper type fabric the only thing i was n't happy with was the length of time it takes to receive i knew this up front , not the sellers fault but , order early because it does take time
it is a really nice shoulder case , great price , it was delivered on time , i recommend this to anyone that is buying a carrying case for their kid 's tablet or laptop
my daughter loves this carry case we ordered it for her # inch netbook and it fits perfectly she carries it everywhere even when she leaves the netbook itself at home she likes the style and colors it came from china and it did not take long at all i believe it took about # weeks for it to arrive would do business with them again
it works great it holds my ipad and my phone and keys so i do n't have to carry a hand bag all of the time and i like <unk>
perfect fit for my ipad and purse and phone or the charger in the zipper compartment i also like the fact i can use it over my shoulder or with the arm straps the colors are also very vivid
received this quickly as expected . looked great . had a lot of snap in tabs as the usual shell cases do one by one i snapped the corners into place one corner did n't snap in . as a result , the shell did n't stay on the laptop . kept falling off order # of these all four of them had at least one random corner that did n't snap in good idea of having a shell case for this particular model , but the <unk> of the shell was poorly done
i was looking forward to this cover to protect my new ultrabook but it was not of the quality i have found in previous products i 've purchased like this the fit is ok , but edges seem rough and not fully finished the blue color is hard to see as blue and it looks <unk> on the dark gray of the toshiba also its kind of heavy putting even an # once cover on a # . # lb ultrabook changes it quite a bit i 've now taken it off and will return it i have not found any other cover for this machine , but do n't need something i will not be happy with and proud to have on my cool little toshiba try harder ipearl
i have bought # of these covers looks ok , although clearly a plastic look the small plastic tabs on the top cover that hold it onto the top broke on the first two after a few months even knowing this i bought two more -lrb- one to use , one a spare -rrb- basically , the top of the z # is paper thin and the repair center tells me they break often i carry my toshiba everywhere and do n't have the luxury of babying it this product is , as far as i know , only decent option to protect it properly , so i live with the issues
so mine has a horrible habit of coming unsnapped on the bottom left side of my key board it makes my ultrabook heavier , but i guess its worth the protection love the kickstand option and the color
