this bag is made well and offered at a fair price i am able to get my toshiba # & # # ; + laptop into the center of the bag into the side pocket there is room enough for a mouse , mouse pad , extension cord and power supply the bag handles and zippers look like they will last for some time in with the computer there is also room for a few papers or a thin folder i do n't plan on transporting my computer very often , but when i do it will be protected from minor <unk> well as the elements
i 've been looking everywhere for a laptop bag that was what i needed while being <unk> this bag is simple , has a pocket big enough for the power cord and some accessories , which is all i needed the price was more than reasonable for the durable quality
no bells or whistles but it is all i was looking for inexpensive and quality carrying bag for my # . # `` inspiron lap top the front zip pocket provides plenty of room for extra gadgets inland pro # . # `` notebook black
i got this for my # `` toshiba laptop as a protective cover the laptop fits perfectly in this bag there is enough padding while transporting a laptop this way the side pocket has room for a thin notepad and other accessories i recently took my laptop on a flight and was very satisfied with this my laptop now has a full-time cover while not in use there is no shoulder strap , though , so the carrier must be carried in the hand southwest airlines allowed me to carry this bag separately from my backpack , and both fit under the seat in front of me for the price this is well worth it just remember that this is a <unk> carrier and most likely will not protect a laptop from a serious fall
# -star quality bag for my lenovo # . # inch laptop saw these same bags without the handles or zippered side pockets made by case logic for # . # at best buy and decided to keep both and save # . # , too great choice - would buy again a + inland
the bag is great , but since i returned my laptop , i 've got nothing to put in it the feel of it <unk> and i think it will <unk> well i would recommend this as a good buy
what a great purchased , this item is n't bulky , it could have more padding in the bottom , but overall was one of the best purchased ive made note , it does n't have an arm strap , it is exactly as it looks in the picture
this is a very basic bag it does look nice and works very well for my purposes just <unk> <unk> my laptop and few papers occassionally not a lot of room for extra hardware in the bag
i ordered it to see if it would hold my # `` laptop snugly , as i did n't want a large or bulky carrier it 's perfect i rarely travel with my big laptop , but when i need to take it , this will work very well ! and , at this extremely reasonable price , it was even more attractive i am <unk>
i bought this bag for my hp pavilion g # after searching all over for one to fit , i ran into this one on amazon and decided to give it a try needless to say i am a happy customer i would recommend this bag to anyone who is looking for something cheap and well made
i received my bag is good order it works perfectly with my # . # inch laptop , plus i have gotten many compliments on it i have searched may local stores looking for a bag for my # . # laptop , but could not find any under $ # . # upon search amazon.com i came across this one and it is perfect
i think i got this bag for $ # -lrb- if that -rrb- from amazon bag is perfect for holding laptop and accessory cords nothing <unk> , just something to carry my laptop in
there 's nothing fancy about this bag but it works great i needed a bag big enough for my new # . # inch laptop and this fit the bill i was a little nervous waiting for it to come because i was afraid the quality would not be great for the price i paid but the quality is great for the price i 've been using it for the past few months and have no complaints
worked wonderfully could n't ask for a better bag especially for the price the bag has a front pocket for cords and mouse or whatever small extra storage you need no shoulder strap but that 's fine with me
superb product for $ $ . holds my g # `` ` puter and charger cords easily and securely in ample side pocket two handles are good padding is quite fine why pay $ # or more for no real difference in quality should outlast the life of the computer
after reading customer comments about this notebook bag , i decided to order it & i am pleased with my purchase this bag fits my # . # `` screen notebook/laptop with room to add needed supplies the side zipper storage section is large enough to add additional supplies including cords , etc . the bag does have some cushion to protect your notebook/laptop the price is a very good value for this
this bag is of good-quality material and a secure bag for carrying around your laptop it exceeded my prior expectations good sale , good value if you 're looking for standard and professional bag for a good price , buy with confidence
cases for my laptop size are becoming harder to find i did n't want to spend a lot of money , just something simple , but safe for when i travel with my laptop this is a great option as it 's bigger than just a sleeve and has room for my cord , a few movies , etc . but , it 's smaller and lighter than a much bulkier carrying case has just the right amount of padding to protect it and the handles are great i 've been very happy with this item
i like the way this bag gives you several options for how to carry it you can attach a shoulder strap ... or not you can carry it by a small handle ... but if you do n't want to do that , then the handle tucks in and does not get in the way you can carry it under your arm without any handle -lrb- which personally i do n't like to do , but seems to be the only option for most other bags -rrb- i like that flexibility the quality is good and the bag is colorful the only complaint is that it is a little roomy for the macbook pro the next smaller size bag would n't fit , but the size i got had a few inches to spare so that the computer is n't as secure as it could be if you have a lot of other things to carry with you , probably you fill up the space
the bag is good ! ! it is exactly as its described in the ad i just wish there was a little more room in the bag for extras i fit my # . # `` screen toshiba and the cables in the bag with no problem just wish you could put a few more things in there the bag is good overall
i love the look and the quality of this bag i has pockets to store cords or papers but it is not too bulky or heavy love the cool factor and the functionality it is also well-made
i looked for a sleeve that would provide some protection yet remain light enough to carry along with carry-on baggage or slide in a briefcase the option of a handle or shoulder strap makes this sleeve case bag practical for all situations the side zipper pocket allows room for a small mouse , charger , and some files this bag provided all that i was looking for and with the reinforced edging enough protection
this is a nice , very well made laptop case my daughter loves the style it is light weight so does not add alot more weight to the laptop when transporting it not a lot of storage space but just enough for the charger and required accessories
i bought this case to protect my daughter 's new macbook pro computer it fit the laptop fine but the rubber material is too thin to protect the laptop much we ended not using this and getting another case this might be ok if you are putting it into another case for protection
it 's a really , really thin sleeve not very different from having your laptop naked , except for the fact that it is n't , fine but if you want any real protection -lrb- as in leaving your backpack on the floor and not having to worry about your laptop inside -rrb- you probably should keep looking
had bought a # `` dell laptop computer i did n't realize that although you 've purchased a # `` computer , the dimensions are <unk> make sure that when you buy a sleeve , measure the dimensions of your computer and match them up to the dimensions on the product loved the design , but had a strong smell not sure if it 's because it was enclosed in plastic ended up buying a logistics sleeve
it 's fine it 's not very padded , and is more of a decorative case than anything else i would still be very concerned if anything bumped into my laptop while it was in this case , and i do n't feel extremely comfortable with my laptop in the case it 's cute though
i am not particularly in love with this case , but it does what it should - holds my laptop this case is super thin and if you drop your laptop , it probably will not survive the fall but <unk> , the case is `` cute `` and fits a # `` macbook pro with a hardshell case its snug , but fits
the product design is pretty the only issue i had was that it was a bit tight on my # `` macbook pro it zipped up fine but there 's no wiggle room , so the zipper was scraping against the side of my macbook the padding is thin , very thin i would overlook that but i still do n't like how i would have to take caution each time i zipped up the case so i 'm returning it and trying something else it would have been nice if it had some sort of lining underneath the zipper to prevent the scraping
i bought this laptop case to put my macbook pro in while traveling it was meant to go inside a hard-sided <unk> with the power cord separate the case is very lightly padded neoprene on the inside , but not too thick the design is pretty
my macbook pro fits perfectly in this case , which also fits nicely into my shoulder bag someone had written a review that the zipper scratches their computer not the case in mine
i purchased this for my macbookpro to carry in my backpack i not only like the design but also find it to be a perfect fit there is n't room for much else but i just wanted to use it as a protective cover i would recommend it
my hp computer fits perfectly in this case i love the color and the design of the case the zipper is high quality although there is no room for anything extraneous -lrb- except for maybe a small <unk> of papers -rrb- this suits my purposes well and i recommend this product
i love this case it has a neat design , is easy to open and close and keeps my laptop safe in my bag that 's all i wanted it does the job . :
i was hoping this would be larger it just fits my laptop i am unable to zip it up all the way was hoping it would stretch by now , but it has n't go with a larger one if your not sure
this item is cheap and you get what you pay for it is quite good looking but mind that it is not white and pink but grey -lrb- and quite old grey -rrb- and pink also you still have to protect the laptop with a laptop bag since it is not neoprene but closer to fabric so useless regarding small impacts a little too big for my # inch mac book pro but good value for the money though , and feminine but not girly
nice and soft cover , i bought the carrying case along with it and they go so perfectly together it 's not much protection alone but it is a nice way to carry around my macbook
this sleeve was one that my wife loved so i ordered it i 'm impressed with the quality of the item , and the fact that the zipper goes far enough down the side to allow me to pull the laptop out of the shoulder pouch without first pulling out the sleeve that is great when either of us is in a time <unk> otherwise , when we only have a short distance to walk we just use the sleeve , which is like showing off the sleeve . : -
i recently bought an apple macbook pro laptop to use while i ca n't sit at my desk because of hip problems i wanted something to protect it from dust , dog hair , and being dropped while i 'm working in our family room this sleeve does the job nicely the computer fits snugly , the padding will absorb any <unk> , and the zipper seals it to keep out <unk> it also fits into the matching carrying <unk> sparse floral # . # inch laptop padded compartment shoulder messenger bag for <unk> <unk> extra protection when i take it out with me both items seem well made and should be easy to wipe clean i 'm happy i invested in both of them and would recommend them to anyone who wants to protect their laptop
neat and unique pack holds my mac book pro # inch snugly i really like the material of the bag , it is rough and soft at the same time i actually never use the back pack version of this bag , i usually just sling it i use it in a business environment shows i am professional , yet i am still an outdoors person main downside is that the outside pockets can be hard to unzip due to the fact it can be hard to find the zipper
would have rated this a # but downgraded for the fact that the shoulder straps are one piece so they slip and become unbalanced more easily than i would have expected would n't be an issue except for the fact that i had foot surgery recently and i 'm still a little wobbly on my feet not sure this would be an issue for more sure <unk> users
i love it national <unk> <unk> a # small rucksack . great feel bought this rucksack for toting my laptop around description says it will fit a # & # # ; laptop , but it also fits my # & # # ; macbook pro -lrb- mid # model -rrb- perfectly
my son is a sophomore in high school , so it was n't easy to find a book bag he would carry we compromised with this messenger bag it has held up far better than previous bags
i love it it is exactly what i wanted , and also at a very nice price well made , long lasting and perfect for the hard core gamer such as myself
the bag looks and feels very nice has good sized pockets to hold all of my gear , has a nice adjustable strap and the <unk> on the inside and outside look very nice
bought for school needing a new one design is very nice with the inside looking just as sweet . very sturdy so far carrying around my books n such . lots of room inside def recommend for the <unk> it is also very comfortable with all the weight in it i hardly notice the strap
not sure how they can drop the price of this by nearly two thirds , but i 'm happy bag has a lot of pouches and places to put stuff , and it looks terrific also , the shoulder strap is big , not that you need it for a # inch computer , but blizzard 's sub did a good job designing this
this bag is a top notch blizzard merchandise the outside is basically weatherproof with tough and durable material inside you have plenty of pockets for organization and even a place that fits up to a # . # & # # ; laptop if your in the market for a laptop bag or to carry around a fair bit of stuff this is perfect for you
i have had this bag for over a year now and it has held up very nicely the embroidered <unk> logo does n't have so much as a stray thread coming off of it the photo on the outside is n't quite as bright as it was brand new but the fade really isnt ' that bad at all and that 's to be expected the bag has plenty of space for my mouse , power cable , laptop , earbuds , various usb devices and my wacom i can usually fit a thin book in this bag as well with everything else
i picked this bag up after finding it on another website by pure accident i had been in the market looking for a really good messenger bag , but i had been having trouble finding something similar to what i have now this bag is it you can tell how durable it is just by picking it up it has tons of pockets to put whatever you can possibly imagine in fact , it has so many pockets , i 've forgotten where i 've placed things in it do n't let the price scare you away , if you 're a fan of blizzard games who is looking for a really good messenger bag to carry things around , do not hesitate to pick this bag up
i have a problem the zipper on the side is so hard to open i ended up throwing on the garbage after # minutes of trying the day it arrived other than that . its one of the best except that zipper on the side that for some luck its jams
perfect for my needs , this case fits my laptop like a glove the case is substantial enough but not bulky or heavy it also has handles which many sleeves don ' t have i can carry my mouse and charger in the front pocket , however i do not zip the pocket , as the front pocket zipper is rather flimsy it is good value for the price
fits my lenovo yoga # . # perfectly as others have pointed out , the front pocket zipper looks a little small and fragile , so just do n't put anything too bulky in there
this case is really nice it fit my laptop very well and the handles are a nice touch the fabric is of good quality and does n't get dirty easily the hidden zipper is perfect for small things
the case is perfect for any laptop from # in to # inch i actually like carrying the smaller laptop in the case because i can also put a folder and small book in the case along with the laptop it 's very convenient for meetings and just moving around . love it it 's very sturdy , too
my white macbook # `` with <unk> shell fits snugly in this case logic sleeve the case is slim , yet has adequate padding to protect your laptop even while traveling material is lightweight yet very sturdy
i love this case and i never expected to truly love it at the price but it fits my lenovo carbon x # ultrabook together with my ipad # perfectly also , the handles fit over the handle on my tumi <unk> case so it can be securely carried on top of the case
i recently purchased this case logic laptop sleeve/case and i love it so much if you have a # . # `` laptop and need a case that does not take up much space , then this is for you the colours , design and texture of it is really attractive only problem is that it ca n't hold the laptop chargers without bulging out i 'd recommend it to
the case logic uns- # -inch laptop/mac book air sleeve is just what i was looking for to protect my new macbook pro # . # inch laptop i wanted something that was a little bigger so it could hold my mac while it was in the ipearl mcover hard shell case i had also purchased it looks very nice -lrb- i purchased the dark gray -rrb- and the price is terrific a great buy
i am very happy with this product it fits my # in toshiba laptop with a battery pack perfectly there is no pulling at the seam because of the battery pack that has happened with other types of sleeves there is padding on the sides and bottom which is nice i also like that the material is more durable than neoprene and is less likely to rip i also like the pocket on the front for small cords and a travel mouse the only draw back is the padding is a little think on the front and back which makes it a little bulking but it still fits in my backpack nicely with other books and things over all i am very happy with this product and would recommend it to a friend
the case works well for its intended use fits my # . # `` laptop perfectly with no annoying space along the sides of it would have preferred two zippers to make it easier to open , but it works fine , so its not a problem
this case has padding enough to protect your laptop but is still thin enough that it does n't take up a lot of room the front pocket is roomy enough for the power cord and a few extra small things i use it for my # & # # ; macbook and still have room to carry an extension cord in the bottom of the bag the handles make it easy to carry and are placed so that you can zipper the case completely shut , unlike some other cases liked it so much , got one for my daughter too when she <unk> for it for a birthday present
this is a great case for my laptop i even love the color - like a dark charcoal i just wish there was a way to make these cases just a bit bigger so that you can carry the power cord with them i end up having to carry a purse big enough to handle the cord it has just the right amount of padding to protect the laptop and looks great i would definitely recommend it and would butit again
i love my new laptop sleeve it provides good cushion for traveling , and i like the floral pattern which gives it a more feminine touch and makes it not so plain great price , too
when i got the bag , it looked just like what i ordered it has a nice pocket to fit notes , a pen , or usb it has a <unk> floral design on one side the handles makes it easy to carry , and its <unk> gray makes it look classy and modern all at the same time the <unk> zipper also works well
i fell in love with its beauty , the <unk> blue color and simple elegant design however it was very cheaply made and the stitching came apart after a couple of weeks
i want an ipad case , but do not want to spend so much on it i bought this one because its relatively cheap & reviews are good dont buy it ! ! it is made of cheap materials in china , and on a chinese website it is sold for only # <unk> , not even # dollars smell so strong i first decide to leave it for a few days , but it even give my ipad a bad chemical smell as well not worth to send it back because i probably ca n't get much money back because of the shipping fee but never buy it again
it did not meet my expectation it looks good but was too small for <unk> tablet i was very disappointed . and the rep i spoke to about it was <unk> i just wasted my money
the case is pretty but the material it is made of is cheap looking it does n't fit my ipad well as it is too large and i 'm not a fan of the flap at the top that closes it
the color and pattern were as shown on website i did not like how you had to lift the flap in front to insert i-pad and the case was too big , so my i-pad shifted around inside case . i returned item for
this is a nice thick sleeve and cute looking but it 's just too big for my ipad # it has at least an extra inch or more in length and my tablet slides all around inside the width is too big as well i could easily fit two ipads in here i wanted something snug and this is definitely not it
contrary to the product description , this was not meant for the new ipad # an ipad # will fit into it just fine but the sleeve is about an inch too <unk> if you do n't mind that it 's not a snug fit , then this will work fine it 's a really nice sleeve and the pink was super bright and colorful just not meant for the new ipad some other reviewers mentioned a strong odor and that is definitely true it 's a `` new car `` type of thing i assume that will dissipate over time
this works well with the kindle fire # . # hd , but , you will need a hardcover fire holder as well because this sleeve is not enough protection for the fire by itself it does also hold a stylus and <unk> very nicely i ca n't totally get used to the feel of the neoprene and it does feel kind of flimsy but it keeps dust , etc . from getting to the fire so i am happy with the overall purchase
this pouch serves its purpose well i purchased this for my ipad # that has the cover for the screen but i wanted something additional for protection from being knocked around when being carried in my bag the pouch is neoprene so it has the slightly padded effect it works for what i purchased it to do and i like
i have a smart cover on my ipad and bought this in hopes it would still all fit inside to protect it inside my purse it works great it is a couple inches too long for the ipad but that has n't caused me any problems it i a great price for a good quality
i bought this for my ipad mini and it works well it is a little larger so its not a secure fit but i am able to put the <unk> in the bag so that is a plus
i had originally bought this as a back up in case i did n't like the case i picked out for my dell tablet it is a nice neoprene case which i can still use with my tablet i may even be able to fit my kindle and tablet inside this when i travel a good buy for protection in my opinion
item looks as nice as the picture displayed and fits perfectly - fairly snug which is what i was looking for to protect my netbook while traveling great price , nice style
it is a good case for light wear and tear i bought it for my ipad # , but its a bit too loose i would n't recommend if using it as a primary case where the ipad might fall otherwise the pattern and colour looks like the picture
my ipad # is in a slimline <unk> cover combo and fits very nicely into this sleeve the sleeve still allows room for me to add a small notepad or headphone , charging cable , and stylus
i have an ipad in a <unk> case , and i wanted it protected in my backpack or when carrying it . fits really well and does n't have a cheap feel to
of course this will not protect your notebook computer while scuba diving silly ; -rrb- it does provide a cushiony slipcase for the acer aspire one notebooks i bought , even the wireless logitech m # mouse slips right in , too the stretchy top does n't secure with anything , but it does n't need too it 's big enough and <unk> enough to keep the notebook and in this case , the mouse , secured inside and reasonably protected from rain and small <unk> got a pink one for my daughter and a blue one for my wife it 's well crafted and appears as though it will out last the usefulness of the computer it was bought for all three of us like this case immensely
well sewed , quality construction and great green color i love that it 's easy to <unk> i use it for an hp touchpad and it has served me well and protected the tablet even in my huge duffel bag of a purse
i got this case to protect the back of my tablet while it is docked inside it 's keyboard case -lrb- as the keyboard case only protects the screen itself , not the back . it fits the tablet and keyboard case like a dream , and actually still has a bit of room to slide a stylus inside too it opens and closes <unk> , and i really like that there is no zipper to scratch at the metal casing of the keyboard case
i really like and it fits just right for your i pad # , or # it 's very nice to carry it to school if you are a student like me
word of warning to cat owners both my cats seem to think this case is really a scratching post one thing i like about it is that the top folds back and i can leave the case in my purse and still put the ipad in and out of it
this sleeve was a wonderful purchase i often take my netbook with me and wanted a sleeve that would fit in my <unk> it 's nice and thick to provide protection and the pattern looks better in person than it does online i 'd purchase this product again or in a different size for my other devices
i actually have an easel case for my kindle fire , but i use this also the extra size enables storage with easel case and provides more protection good quality and very attractive
i bought this case for the ipad # even though it said it was just for ipad it fits great with the ipad # i even have a shell around my ipad and it still fits great the smell the other person talks about is just the <unk> from being made it will go away very happy with my
i like the look and compactness of the bag , and i like the air mesh comfort of the back and straps one thing that i did n't realize in advance is that the # nd and # rd compartments do not have double zippers , so they only zip in one direction i might have not thought this was a big deal until i actually started using the bag from experience with my previous bag , the double zippers really do make it easier to get in and out of those compartments from the top with the single zipper , the compartment falls completely open , i feel like something is going to fall out , and i can not just get quick access from the top if the material was stiffer , it might not flop open so much this really has become an annoyance with heavy , daily use
i 've gone through a lot of backpacks as a student -lrb- finally graduating college soon -rrb- , and this is probably my favorite one i got this for extra protection for my laptop i feel like my laptop is really safe in that pocket , especially since i use an extra sleeve for it it fits quite a lot and the front pocket has a lot of extra compartments for organization it 's also well built and can withstand some minor liquid spills
i have had this backpack now for about # months it is an awesome backpack very comfortable to carry the notebook is well protected and there 's plenty of space for books , cable or any other stuff you need it also holds a big <unk> mug on the side the quality is great and it looks really nice i really love this thing
fits my # `` laptop fine , snugly i can fit enough textbooks for my daily college work as well as some laptop accessories but that 's about it the padding on the straps , back , and inside are all great and are enough for light shock protection
this bag is sturdy and has extra padding in the back , which makes its very comfortable it easily holds my # . # laptop it has lots of compartments to hold all my other belongings as well i would definitely recommend this bag to others
what a great buy the back pack is very ergonomically designed , barely has weight of its own , and is extremely sturdy i carried # lbs in the bag for a very long time this is one of the best buys ever
this is an excellent deal if you 're looking for a laptop bag i 'm a college student , and the bag holds my hp envy # securely , as well as a couple <unk> textbooks , notepads , my point and shoot camera , and my headphones there are plenty of compartments for additional belongings the look of the bag is very nice green is my favorite color , so i completely appreciate the green stitching and interior the usb mouse that comes with the bag works great , but even if it did not , i would still recommend this bag i 'm glad i made the purchase
this is a sweet deal i was looking to purchase both a backpack and a mouse , and found this perfect combo the price is unbeatable , $ # for both the backpack alone is worth much more than that the backpack is very well built , padding all over the place makes it really comfortable it was actually smaller than i expected , which for me is a good thing since i do n't really like over-sized bags lots of compartments , which is great i would n't have minded a little more green on the outside to make it more attractive overall , highly recommended
this backpack case for laptops with a mouse was actually more quality than i suspected it might be it was nicely packaged and my son-in-law was thrilled to receive it for christmas it can also be used for other purposes
i love this new bag and chose it for the sleek look and quality appearance i have not had any problems with zippers and think the bag is made of <unk> space because i am often surprised at how many things fit inside of it i also love the padding along the back and shoulders overall a great product
if you are looking for a backpack that will keep youre laptop protected and secure at a good price , this one is what to look for it does not has compartments for everything you do n't have but has all the room need without looking like a camping backpack besides is targus ! !
