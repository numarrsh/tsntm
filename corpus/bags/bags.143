i bought this case for the front pouch i wanted to be able to keep my power cord and mouse with my netbook it is more difficult than you think to find a net book case with such attributes while the case does hold my mouse and cord it is very tight , which make me slightly <unk> it could break when traveling the case appears well made and of good quality
i purchased this case for my toshiba thrive # inch tablet the straps inside the case absolutely fits my tablet perfectly i also love the outside zip pocket which is perfect for carrying around my flash drives and stylus i highly recommend other thrive users to purchase this item
i use this netbook case to store my dell mini # in it holds it securely in place perfectly currently , i use the small pouch for my charger , mouse and wireless internet card the pouch is very small , but it will hold those three items without any problems this case is very <unk> , and provides great protection for my netbook the other netbook cases i have seen have been really basic and unattractive , so i am pleased that i have found this one that is truly unique and it comes with a handle this was a great buy for me and i am pleased with my purchase the only downside is i thought i saw the <unk> tower on the case in the picture , but it 's not on the case i purchased
my # & # # ; macbook air barely fit inside with a great a deal of effort there is no way i could go through the trouble of wiggling my machine in and out of this on a regular basis
i was really excited when i ordered this item for my macbook air # when i received it today , i was a little disappointed with the color and overall appearance it 's more <unk> than the online photo suggests , and less <unk> envelope than i was expecting the stitching around the edges was n't clearly pictured , and kind of takes away from the overall effect in real life not sure if i will keep it or return it for a different option on the plus side , though , it fits the # inch macbook air like a glove , and seems pretty well made
the quality from this envelope for the macbook air is really good but i absolutely do not like the color it is more yellow than the picture looks like and it does not look real the <unk> works good enough to keep it close but i returned it back and bought the thule gauntlet <unk> # . # & # # ; macbook air and pro retina display sleeve -lrb- black
the top closes securely with a magnet , but it does leave a little bit of a gap on each side it holds onto my # `` macbook air well , so i do n't fear it would slide out easily if the top came open people constantly get a kick out of it , especially because i purchased a composition book <unk> for my air i just need a way to disguise my external hdd now
best sleeve ever and if you 're a mac nerd , you know the history behind the inter-office envelope i do n't usually go for mac hype but this was worth every penny tons of comments from everyone who sees it
the air mac , even with the see thru hard case on slips right in to this sleeve looks and feels like real animal print ca n't tell that there is a laptop inside , and oh so <unk>
this case fits the mac air perfect i have a safe place to store the computer , a little stand to put under the laptop while i use it , and it would also throw off a potential thief it is also a fun ice breaker
first off , it 's really well made i mean really , really well made secondly , it 's very cool looking and is a great conversation starter what i love is obviously the cool factor and it 's great that my laptop looks like a interoffice envelope , totally reduces the chance of someone stealing
the color is off from the picture what you get is more of a burgundy <unk> do not like it because it sees too boring and generic as you will notice on the picture , there is no handle on the top that would have been nice since the strap feels awkward when you carry the bag the bag closes with a clip on button you have to make sure to close it every time , otherwise the flap will lift and become bothersome when you walk i would have overlooked the fact that you cant fit too much into it if the color was as shown on the picture and the flap was not so annoying it looks really cute on the picture but would not recommend it
i like it and it looks just like the picture i wish it had a & # # ; hand & # # ; handle too & putting things inside s not as convenient s my & # # ; man looking & # # ; bag
this bag is <unk> what it said on the <unk> and more than i expected it 's ` unique ' and stylish it has the appearance of <unk> and durable too there 's room for my ipad , small mouse , and accessories one thing , i wish there 's a handle for me the shoulder strap is a bit too much for my # ' # hight however , i 'll buy another one for my husband , if there 's a different color for him oh , one other thing , it took # days to arrive at my door it might be worth paying for the shipping if want it sooner
this little bag is great the ability to expand and collapse makes it very versatile so it works when i 'm carrying only a few things or when i really need to fill up the bag there are plenty of pockets to keep things separated and organized the removable laptop sleeve is also a nice feature it provides extra cushion to protect my laptop when it 's in the bag and also allows me to carry just the laptop in something padded if i do n't feel like carrying the full bag however , be aware that this bag will only work with smaller laptops it is perfect for my smaller work laptop , but will not hold my larger laptop with a # & # # ; display this is not a complaint since the description says it is a # inch bag just something to be aware of if you do have a larger laptop
i just love this beautiful bag i carry camera , books , kindle & cords nice padded sleeve for my macbook pro # `` this is the # `` i like to get these bigger to handle all my extras nice padded strap i would say the fabric is a check not plaid i also bought the black <unk> bag for myself the only difference between the two is the red one has hidden snaps in front and the black has straps to put through a buckle clasp -lrb- # -rrb- . do not be afraid you will love it keep up the good work amazon ! ! ! ! ! !
i love this bag it is easy to organize and carry it looks like it wo n't hold much , but even without unzipping for <unk> , it holds everything i need to take to the classes i teach
pathetic piece of crap and complete junk the zipper broke the first time i tried using the product and trying to store my ipad before a trip the quality of the product was lousy with the threading coming out i would advice anybody against using this product i just wasted $ # on this crap
it fits the ipad was advertised as black but when i got it was pink i hated it did n't want to go through the hassle of returning it so i gave it away
this a sturdy cover that has nice padding for your electronics , but it is about # . # inches too big around for the ipad , preventing a snug fit instead , the ipad slides around inside the extra space does make it possible for you to store headphones , charger inside , but because there is no pocket to tuck them in , they ended up scratching the back of my ipad it is okay for the price , and does offer protection , but wish it fit more snugly
this case will not fit a dell mini that has the larger <unk> battery overall a nice case . would work fine if your netbook does not have the higher capacity -lrb- # <unk> -rrb- battery
i realize this was under $ # but the logo and stiching is terrible i doubt it will last very long very disappointed in case logic made in china on the plus side it fits my ipad and bluetooth keyboard very well
i just got the ipad # it is just awesome but this review is not to talk about the ipad , it is about this sleeve to be quite honest , i did not did my homework before getting this product it gives a really good protection but it is too big for the ipad # please carefully look for a sleeve that will allow your ipad to perfectly fit on it but this product should be great for notebooks and laptops , it is to big for this awesome apple
- reasonable price - fit well my netbook - very convenient and safe to put the netbook -lrb- with the case -rrb- in my backpack you have to be careful with the zipper because it can scratch the side of your netbook overall : that 's good item with reasonable price
my samsung galaxy tab # fits perfectly i just wanted a little extra protection for my tablet this worked out great i just wished it had a handle of some kind
i bought this for my boyfriend who wanted a sleeve for his ipad # it was cheap and had great reviews when we put his ipad in it , it was much too big for it but he liked it <unk> so we kept it
i purchased this case for my ipad air it 's a bit big , but that 's okay because i actually put my ipad air with the cover inside this sleeve for added protection i was very pleased with the case for the first month i used it then the zipper pull broke off i still use the case with a paper clip in the zipper -lrb- the zipper still works very well -rrb- , but this was a disappointing turn of events i would have given it five stars except for this problem nevertheless , i would recommend the case it 's served me quite well
the case is great : stiff enough to protect , nice grip materials on one end , and fine <unk> the color inside is light blue however the case makes my laptop look `` fat `` . still the product helps me reduce scratch and sometimes i use this case to carry paper and notebooks
the case is very simple great zipper that opens from one top corner to the opposite bottom corner i am going to use this traveling overseas in a very dusty <unk> this case looks to be capable of preventing dust and dirt on the the laptop when not in use the case does not have any material to protect the laptop from punctures or dents nor will it prevent crushing it is a very nice slip case to avoid dirt and scratches note there is no pocket or room for the power supply it is very good for packing into another bag my dell xps # fits perfect in to this case
i bought this case with my new laptop as one shipment i agree the case is great , and i can keep it in my messenger bag along with heavy textbooks and my laptop comes out completely unharmed one thing i realized i may have liked is if there was an outside pocket on it to store flash drives , papers , etc . other than that definitely a superior product for a good price and fits great i have recommended this one to friends and am happy i chose it
it has great padding , i feel safe sticking it in my purse or carrying it by itself the nylon is pretty water resistant , so fear not if you spill something on it , as long as you clean it quickly the case is bulky enough to ensure a snug fit , even if you 're unsure of you 're laptop 's dimensions
this was purchased to fit a slim-line asus # . # inch laptop and it fit very nicely in fact , there was a little extra room so i could keep my <unk> mouse adapter plugged in and still close the case high quality as always from case-logic only thing i would change is the suede grip patch should be on the zippered end , at least in my application
this is a good zipper case that will definitely help protect your laptop from scratches and small spills , but not much more my # `` toshiba fits nicely in this case -lrb- very snug -rrb- , even with the extended battery installed -- this creates quite a bulge , but it still zips closed the patch of suede-like fabric for grip is a nice feature , but i would have traded that any day for a zipper pocket in the front for small accessories -lrb- usb drives , maybe -rrb-
any cover specifically made for the ipad <unk> expensive as to <unk> <unk> <unk> this cover is generic , but fits the ipad well padding is generous , so the device is well protected the quality of the case is lovely perhaps it 's best feature is the price it costs about a third of what the cheapest made for ipad case goes for recommended without hesitation
i was looking for simple sleeve for my ipad to be able to carry in my purse i am very happy with the quality of the sleeve , but it is not made for the ipad as other reviewers have noted its about # . # `` taller and a bit wider as well on the up side , the apple wireless keyboard does fit in the sleeve with the ipad -lrb- my ipad also has a hard shell on the back . i 'll keep this as a much cheaper alternative <unk> travel kit plus for ipad - <unk> for the keyboard and ipad but , i will look for a tighter fitting sleeve for just my ipad to take up minimal space in my purse
my ipad is in an apple ipad case but i need a little more protection when it is in my backpack for traveling most so called ipad sleeves are expensive so i bought this thing , it fits well and it is cheap quite happy with this
good construction , smooth zipper fits our new acer timelinex # t just right the padding on the front and back seems firm enough to protect it against minor bumps , but it does n't add too much bulk much <unk> than the flimsy neoprene sleeves what i would improve is the padding around the edges in fact , only the `` bottom `` edge -lrb- that is , the one where the tag is -rrb- has any protective padding -lrb- actually , the closed end of the sleeve is slightly padded by where the main pads <unk> , plus a small faux leather patch on the outside . we intend to use this as extra protection inside a laptop backpack and for encasing the laptop when not in use at home
it is a good sleeve case for a small netbook/tablet computer i have an acer iconia and the length is perfect , width is kind of big for the tablet there is a lot of space left over i put the tablet and the charger in there together and it still fits good quality , thick padding and airport security friendly over all a decent buy , especially for the price
it 's the perfect fit for my laptop the only thing is that it does n't have space for the plug in cord so if you plan on taking that , it wo n't fit it . otherwise it has great cushioning -- love it
i bought this for my ipad # that is in a case i wanted to be able to store the ipad # in its case in a sleeve for added protection it works well in that regard it is a bit oversized for an ipad or ipad # but unless you want a really snug fit , its fine for under $ # the only thing i did n't realize i would want in a sleeve -lrb- until after this one arrived -rrb- is that i really need a zippered side pocket basically something to store the charging cable , camera adapters , stylus and wifi card this was so cheap i 'll keep it -lrb- it also holds my netbook very well -rrb- but i 'll be looking for an inexpensive sleeve with pockets for daily use
product arrived late but is just as pictured fits my # . # `` compaq with room to spare i am very pleased with the laptop case it seems to be well made and has dense protective filler built into the side walls of the case
it was inexpensive but still quality my only issue is the size for an ipad i would have liked it to fit more snugly but the padding is sufficient and the zipper is good
this works great for me i already had a <unk> to carry back and forth to <unk> and my laptop fits in the cover case then slides in my bag i do n't have to carry two things on my shoulder and the laptop stays protected
i use this for my mini drawing pad and its a great fit i believe its water proof -lrb- i.e . rain not <unk> -rrb- which is a wonderful thing for me .
this is a quality piece of protection for my samsung netbook n # it fits like a glove quality workmanship , strong zipper well designed basic case nothing less and nothing more than what i need it for not too bulky , but still a good protector the price can not be beat i am very satisfied with this deal
my almost a daughter in law suggested this case when i told her i wanted something to protect my ipad from the elements if i want to take it outside with me she could n't have chosen a more perfect product the cushioned inside keeps the screen picture perfect and it truly is a raincoat when i needed it amazon sent it so fast i could n't believe it
i was looking for a protective sleeve for <unk> gtablet with # `` <unk> lcd screen , android os # . # -lrb- w / custom <unk> rom loaded -rrb- it fits my g tablet -lrb- ~ # `` x ~ # . # `` -rrb- exactly as i wanted with some room to spare it does not fit snug , but that is a good thing so you do n't have to fight with getting it in and out of the sleeve the inside its very smooth and does not seem to scratch the touchscreen surface of the tablet the zipper opens about # % of the sleeve 's edge at an angle that is perfect for sliding it in and out the protective sleeve looks and feels like it will hold up for a long time overall i felt like i got just what i wanted
i do n't typically take the time to write product reviews but for this item i could n't resist it took me several days of researching and reading reviews before i pick this protective sleeve for my first generation ipad i have my ipad in the apple ipad case and wanted a sleeve to put it in for double protection i loved that this one zipped closed so that i could put it in my purse without worrying about anything getting into it -lrb- since the apple case does n't completely close -rrb- most of the sleeves i came across were only big enough for the ipad without the apple case this one , not only , fits my ipad w / apple case wonderfully ... but its well padded for protection there is still a little room to spare around the sides of the ipad -lrb- so you do n't feel like you are forcing it to fit -rrb- yet still seems `` slim `` and not bulky plus , its an unbeatable price for the quality you are getting ! i am more than # % happy i went with this product and would recommend it to anyone ! !
perfect for my asus transformer infinity pad tf # t enough room to fit the pad alone or the pad and the keyboard dock case is well made and durable i love case logic for their quality products
i have asus transformer tablet this sleeve is a good quality material , it seems to last -lrb- i am using it daily in public transit for the last # months -rrb- and as someone else mentioned it has padding on edges as well i highly recommend this product
great sleeve for my # inch tablet the asus <unk> tf # fits nicely , even with the <unk> keyboard the case is a bit larger than expected , but all the padding keeps my tablet protected functionally it 's great - good price for a good product , aesthetically nothing special no additional pockets or handles are on the sleeve , but the material allows for a good grip
wanted a case to keep my asus n # <unk> # laptop in the case is made from good quality materials , is strong and fits my laptop very well the case has some padding within the sleeve which is a nice touch
<unk> product and a great brand , this fits my laptop -lrb- # . # & # # ; -rrb- perfectly , when i had it now i have a # . # laptop that it <unk> in there with the power adapter , my mouse and my portable hdd and it even has room to spare it 's very well made so you <unk> the laptop is very well protected
i bought this to hold my g-tablet the case fits the length of the tablet perfectly and there is just enough room in the width to fit both the tablet & my <unk> folding stand the stand <unk> perfectly along side the tablet & everything fits snug , with no jostling or sliding the padding protects the tablet and the nylon shell is very durable i recommend the hat trick purchase g-tablet , <unk> adjustable stand and this case after that , you are good to go
for little over $ # shipped , you ca n't go wrong with the case logic <unk> # i purchased it for my viewsonic g-tablet , and it fits well the # `` tablet has a little to room to spare too there is no room or storage for accessories though , but i expected that protection will only be minimal , because the case is very lightweight and only has thin padding this is fine with me , as i wanted a very light case to store and carry my tablet the case is also supposed to be airport `` security friendly `` my experience though is that security will ask you to remove the computer from it anyway as long as you 're not looking for heavy protection and extra <unk> space , the case logic <unk> # is a great , lightweight , cheap case
this was purchased for storing and protecting a toshiba satellite # . # laptop computer the expected `` case logic `` quality was evident and the case was a perfect fit in all respects the top and bottom padding is adequate , along with one edge and one side the zipper covers the other end and side , so is less padded in these two areas the exterior is attractive and the large suede-like area on one end provides a good non slip area to hold on to the smooth lining also makes inserting and removing the laptop a breeze another good buy for the price <unk> <unk> w
i just got a dell studio with one of those # cell batteries that sticks out about half an inch or so this case fits it like it was made for it ... perfect and its supposed to be good for security check points -lrb- i 'm taking it to <unk> -rrb- also , its one of the most inexpensive ones i found the design is simple and stylish and i really feel happy about this purchase
bought it for my # `` laptop fits perfectly and provides great padding also fits inside my backpack for extra safety if you want a really compact no extra pockets nice padding case look no further this is it
i love this case it fits the ipad # well but is best used as a travel case , on top of a snug form fitting , everyday case that shields the screen this case is padded and perfect to throw into a backpack while traveling the inside is not cloth or felt , which i prefer , so the ipad does not get <unk> i like how the zipper does not go down the entire side , reducing the <unk> of your tablet falling out for these reasons , combined with the price point , i highly recommend this
i want the same design just with long straps and ventilation then i could jam around with my laptop anywhere i want and the design is just so perfect and simple
fits my viewsonic g tablet not a perfect fit but it was not made just for the <unk> i wished it had a side pocket for some accessories , but i knew that prior to buying it not really much else to say the price was right overall a good
i have to say , i was hesitant on getting this sleeve , for that some said it would fit the # . # inch laptops , and some # 's i ordered this one , got in the mail just recently , tried it out , and it fits my dell studio xps # -lrb- w / the # inch screen -rrb- like a glove ! ! i love the fact that on one side of it is lined with suede , so removing it makes it very easy ! ! i feel confident now that i do n't have to worry about leaving my computer somewhere , or have it collect dust , since i 'm deployed out in afghanistan at the moment the zipper felt good , was n't flimsy or anything , it should last as long as i keep the computer also , i had ordered <unk> <unk> <unk> recently , and was n't sure if the sleeve with my laptop inside of it would fit , but sure enough it did ! ! not only am i happy with the purchase , but at the fact that sleeve fits perfectly within the ogio <unk> backpack ! so if it fits my # inch xps without any issues , any # . # inch laptop should fit in here as well
this case protects my viewsonic g-tablet very well black nylon covered neoprene <unk> that the bumps and dings of everyday life are n't a worry plus , the majority of it is water-resistant nice job , guys
very pleased with this product it is big enough for my # . # in toshiba without being too tight or hard to zip up as others have said , the material on the end makes it easy to grab and pick up nicely padded for protection , i definitely recommend this especially for the price !
nice outer cover into which one can place perhaps more than once device -- say an ipad mini and an ipod or , just use for weather protection over a larger case like a # `` kindle or nook sturdy construction and zipper protect your devices from the winter weather
i also have a faux leather case on my ipad # with that case , it fits perfectly into this sleeve the sleeve is padded so it definitely would protect and the zipper prevents dust from getting in for under $ # , this product is awesome it also fits my wife 's ipad #
this case is the perfect size for my ipad which is in a `` leather `` cover and there is also room for a logitech keyboard only downside is i have to keep the accessories -lrb- cord and charger etc . -rrb- in a separate case
i really was looking for something to offer a little more added protection for my ipad i like to carry my ipad in a timbuk # bag , but without this case logic sleeve it moved around a little too much the ipad fits perfectly in its apple case and then i slide that case into the sleeve it fits perfectly and my in my mind it 's much safer there
this case will fit the apple <unk> # or the viewsonic gtablet its inside dimensions are # / # by # / # inches it is very light and the padding will protect your tablet against bumps and scrapes i do not think the tablet inside will survive if you drop it from a height of three feet though the case is designed to be held in the hand or be put inside a larger case or luggage the case is well-designed in that it opens only two sides in an l-shaped fashion , and there is a suede-like , anti-slip patch on the case that allows your hand to hold on the case with less effort this makes taking out and putting in a tablet very easy and secure and it is such a good value that it is less than ten dollars for a quality , <unk> case i recommend it highly
this computer laptop sleeve has made traveling extremely easy i did not need to remove my computer from the case when going through airport <unk> saved time and energy the case is durable and professional looking this is a great deal for the price
i ordered this for my husband , who has an # `` tablet he was unable to find <unk> reasonably priced at local retail stores it arrived on saturday , and needless to say , `` he loves it ``
this was perfect for my macbook pro my laptop fits in it perfectly now i do n't have to worry about my expensive computer getting dinged up and damaged as much as i used to
this is a great sleeve , fits my laptop -lrb- toshiba satellite a # <unk> # led <unk> # . # -inch laptop -lrb- black -rrb- -rrb- perfectly it is a tight fit , but not in a bad way the zipper still closes and it is not difficult to get the laptop in or out the sleeve with the computer is kind of big so you may not be able to get it into some backpacks i will be on the lookout for a messenger bag because of this the amount of padding provides ample protection without getting too thick and <unk> overall this is a great sleeve just be sure to check the dimensions of your laptop before you buy
despite the disclaimer , this arrived at my <unk> address fairly quickly it fits my toshiba perfectly and i no longer have to worry about going around without proper protection it provides padding not just for protecting my laptop but it keeps it from bouncing on my back inside my thin backpack i travel a lot and not every airport security makes you take the laptop out of the sleeve , so i feel more comfortable when it goes through screening i highly recommend this product it is well constructed and feels like it will last a long time
this has been something i 've needed to store my ipad in it 's perfect with enough wiggle room the price and quality is perfect i just needed something to add extra protection for when i have it in my messenger bag some people complain about the blue color inside the case i think its cool , it adds character to it a great deal
my only regret is that i did n't read that part that said , & # # ; ... to # -inch & # # ; on the title my # & # # ; ipad mini slides around inside this sleeve however , that 's my fault , not the sleeve 's
use this to carry my acer netbook keeps it slim and well protected love the looks as well highly recommend if you need little room for extras such as power cord , etc .
make sure you dont do not have the newest macbook pro -lrb- the uni body one w / the black keyboard -rrb- , as it will not fit the power cable does n't fit , the top does not clip on properly , and its hard to open
i used this case for about # years and love it as a college student , it protected my laptop from getting scratches and the case itself did not get scratched either however , recently the heat built up from lack of ventilation in this case caused my laptop some problems that cost me $ # now , i am afraid to use a case i might get a protective skin in the near future
cover looks great , feels great and provides protection for the brushed aluminum outer surface the cover 's soft lining adds additional scratch protection from dirt and sand that inevitably works its way into the underside of the leather biggest problem with the cover is it does n't fit as good as it ought to on my new # -inch macbook pro it interferes with the magnetic contacts , preventing them from meeting firmly enough when the laptop is closed i like the leather cover , but i 'd like it a lot more if it were made to more precisely fit the new macbook pros it 's a bit of a letdown
the `` leather `` fits pretty well on my # inch mbp late # model although one problem that i am having is that whenever i close my laptop and open it back up , it seems like the body and the screen make contact and makes this sound however , it 's not a big deal i like this case it 's simple
this macally product so far has been durable i stick it in my bookbag with other books and binders and have not noticed a scratch it is a great fit for my macbook pro laptop i do recommend it for its # . durability # it covers the apple icon so everyone does n't know you are carry a $ # + laptop around it looks pretty decent once its on
this fits my # inch macbook pro great i was looking for a case that looked great and covered the whole laptop this does that job you will not see the lit apple on the front cover and the bottom covers the whole thing without having any holes or vents this is what i wanted i <unk> no heat issues with the cover
nice looking cover for your mac book pro has a <unk> look , but feels like soft plastic it 's ok , but not to be mistaken for leather the apple logo does not show through this cover like some covers that are translucent -lrb- it would be nice to show other people what type of laptop i am working on , but that 's just <unk> . small lips snap the cover to the unit because of this the lid will not stay magnetically shut when held up vertically it 's a little <unk> at first i think that will be a problem with most covers though shopped around online and amazon had the best deal
i liked the ease of installation for this notebook cover i also like the durability it has a nice , sleek , professional look to it that i am confident that i can take my laptop into any professional setting and feel comfortable
this is my third purchase of this case from this vendor i have two # & # # ; and one # & # # ; . i have had no issues with the two # & # # ; and its been almost # years the # & # # ; had an issue with the right corner slipping off when i pick it up however , i contacted vendor they did rma and sent me a new one it does n't have a tight a fit as the # & # # ; but i really love the case has a suede lining to protect your device and i like be <unk> not everyone needs to know you have a mac that can lead to other issues everyone that sees the case wants one i have several friends that have purchased
i initially purchased a skin after reading some reviews then , i decided to go for it after realizing that the skin would not work for me i love this item try it out for <unk> it 's easy to use and is stylish no , it 's not real leather , but at this price , we already knew that i highly recommend this one
i had one of these for my old lap top & loved it it lasted a long time resisting scratches , smudges , dents & <unk> i was concerned about this new cover because it had more of a smooth surface compared to my original one , but it 's been lasting the test of time perfectly fine i love it
nice sleeve no complaints , fits my # & # # ; # macbook pro non retina perfectly and i feel like its somewhat protected not sure how it would protect if it fell hard but hopefully wo n't ever find out also the material gives you a better grip for carrying it
cheap and was torn when i received the unit the corners have the fake leather all bunched up and looks bad just buy a laptop sleeve and not this bulky cheaply made cover
this is the second one i bought from them and am really disappointed in the new material they are now using the first one i bought was of much better quality , this was advertised as leather and it is most definitely not and if it is , it is the <unk> coating of leather ever hope they go back to making the quality product i bought before
it fits my macbook pro quite well my only gripe is because of that silly power connection plug that is so quirky because of the fit of the bottom case , you have to twist the plug around to plug it in , making it quite
this cover looks great , fits great and gives my computer great protection the only complaint i have is that it does not allow the magnetic connection to completely connect if you sit the computer up sideways , it can fall open as this position would rarely occur , i 'm not too worried inside a bag it seems to stay closed ok have not yet found it to be open otherwise , this cover is superb !
this is a great little cover ; nice colour , easy to put on , great protection i love the suede inside so that it doesnt scratch my mac would definately recommend this product
i love this cover so much , i buy one every year i typically have to replace it each year because the leather tends to rip off from wear and tear after too much <unk> i 'm currently on my fourth case from macally in # years and i have nothing but good things to say
definitely worth the price , i would have even paid more color is great , fits perfectly on my macbook pro it does add a bit of weight but it does n't bother me any dose n't over heat because of gap in back , leaves room air to run through the fan
this is the second case i bought for my # inch eeepc -lrb- first one was way too tight . this one has more than adequate storage for the netbook , its power cord and the wireless mouse accessory it is not cramped and has a colored inside which makes it easier to see the contents of the storage pouches it also has a sturdy shoulder strap for carrying the only drawback to this case is that there is only one handle - it should have # for ease in carrying by the handle really the only way to carry this case is on the shoulder , which is ok for my purposes best part is the large areas for storage of accessories
other reviews have mentioned the odd color of the lining and the fact that there is only # handle ... while this is true , it 's a great little case that goes everywhere with me i have my acer aspire one in there , as well as my ipod , my charging cords , some small items , an extra pair of glasses , a notebook , and my checkbook really like it for work stuff and its ' light , waterproof , and durable really liking it , and would recommend to anyone
got this for my wife who has a # . # inch pink samsung netbook she loves this bag it stores all the accessories and protects very well plus it 's stylish you wo n't be disappointed
i took the case with me on a <unk> from florida to spain the size is perfect i was able to also carry the cords to the computer as well as the cords for my camera and book reader ther construction is great and the zippers work smoothly the size made it easy to carry and store it fit in the cabin safe
