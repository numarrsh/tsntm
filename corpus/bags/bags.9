this is a great case for me because i can work out of my home or in the office it has lots of compartments to store things i can even hang hanging files if i need too it has a separate grey case for my laptop it 's roomy and is great quality
i bought this for my # th grader it does the job so many books , folders , etc . to access she is loving it even more once she started <unk> it i 'll purchase another one for next school year when my son <unk> the # th grade easy to organize and access items ; great space for our needs
i shopped in local stores for a nice , rolling computer case and found this exact case in a local store , cost was much higher even after shipping the company responded quickly and i love it
purchased this rolling case to make it easier to transport my laptop , files , folders , large checkbook , etc . that i carry as <unk> of an organization took it with me on a recent trip and it worked great held everything i needed rolled in and out of the hotel nicely up and down curbs does not tip over when left standing up handle extends nicely exactly what i was looking for
made of cheap material , latches look flimsy and are already buckling it arrived scuffed and scratched and yet the box it came in appeared <unk> makes me think it shipped that way save your money and buy something more substantial
this is a good quality briefcase which i bought for carrying a laptop and books i quickly found out it makes poor use of space only one or the other will fit : a small laptop or a few books i was very disappointed on the lack of space or the poor use of it while the quality of the case is good i would recommend something else for carrying books or a laptop it is a high price for such little utility
the attach & eacute ; is nice , but it is a gift for christmas and i truly wish it had come in a box other than just an amazon box finding a suitable box is going to be a challenge i appreciate how quickly i did receive it though
a very serviceable case , plenty of room inside even when <unk> by a laptop and tablet only slight <unk> is the very left hand number wheel on the locks will only go in one direction , other than that ideal
this leather attache works out really good i purchased it to secure all of my <unk> <unk> items in it it 's sturdy , durable so far and just the right size ... ... i would strongly suggest it
i got this for my dad as a present and he really enjoys it he needed a sturdy new briefcase once his old one fell apart over the years so i know he will get a lot of use out of this one
i am a highschool student and wanted to wear my suit to school more often and you ca n't have a backpack with a suit , so i bought this do not regret the purchase at all just know , you can have either the laptop or a lot of space , not both myself , i took out the laptop bag and put all my school stuff in there i have n't had any problems with quality although it does feel a bit cheap overall , good starting briefcase
sturdy enough , not flashy , does what it 's intended to do at a low price a great buy for sure the only warning i have to anyone new buying a case , is do n't mess up setting the combination lock
<unk> bag is very cheaply made after very little use , both zippers broke off the teeth i am not talking came off the teeth , i mean the zippers broke apart the bag is useless with out zippers spend a little extra money and purchase a <unk> laptop bag
did like the bag saw that it had good reviews bought the bag and it was very cheaply made and didnt last . zipper came apart and zipper track is faulty . will never buy this item brand
i liked how it looks and that my pc fits well . but it looks <unk> and after i used it the first time it began to break for the corner i consider it was a waste of money is not what it
overall the bag is exactly what i was looking for it is lightweight , <unk> and of durable fabric however , the zippers have both broken on it , the actual metal of the zipper on both cheap metal i suppose anyway , i can not use it at all if i ca n't even zip it closed wish they worked , otherwise it was perfectly fitting my needs .
this tote is okay but the listed description is a bit miss leading it has the compartment divider but does not say it ca n't be used on # . # & # # ; laptops the whole reason i selected this tote was so i can put the power supply to the side instead of it bulging out in the
this laptop case definitely does the job as far as carrying a laptop around goes if you 're looking fora car to just carry around a laptop go for it with that being said , if style or high quality are your thing i would pass on this it does n't look cool by any means , and it 's definitely pretty cheap looking it worked for me since i have a cheap laptop but if you want top of the line protection and style you may want to look elsewhere
this is solid and actually provides protection for your laptop it 's reinforced unlike laptop sleeves so you feel like you 're actually protecting your investment somewhat it 's not # % protection but much better than a simple sleeve
product was as described i will say by the time i got laptop , charger and cooling pad into it the fit was snug not products fault just mine for not getting something a tad bigger
my laptop fits perfectly unfortunately , they should have told me to buy a bag bigger than my laptop so i could use the divider to store my charger good <unk> just make sure you do n't buy one that is bigger than your laptop
i purchased this bag for my new laptop to protect it when i was n't using it around the house i did have some of the lining where a velcro strap attaches across the top of the laptop inside the bag detach so there is a section where the cloth lining has come out otherwise the bag is great and for the price i am happy
this is a great laptop bag it 's slim & the adjustable strap is comfortable i have a # . # & # # ; ultrabook & while it fits the entire width of the case , there 's still room for an additional notebook or two on top the pocket is large enough for a power cord , mouse and pencil bag there 's plenty of cushioning to keep your laptop secure & the interior velcro strap provides added stability and you really ca n't beat the price
i wanted a travel bag for my new computer , and searched for quite a while looking for one i purchased this one , which is just the right length and width for the ultrabook , but is a bit deeper than the ultrabook i 'm placing into it but in the end , this is excellent because it allows me to place other work or personal materials into the bag as well it 's well built , has a handy side pouch where i can put even more things , and i especially like the carry strap that came with it
there was nothing in the description of this product that said it used magnets to hold the top closed on such a tiny but expensive computer , right next to the monitor and the hard disk drive what were they thinking i never put my ux in it and promptly sent it back
nice case that fits well , even with the extra capacity battery the only issue that i have with it is that the clasp is a magnet why sony would place a magnet on a computer case is beyond me i have been keeping the screen facing opposite of the magnet clasp which seems to work fine
i <unk> leather i would n't even consider buying this if it was n't leather the way leather ages is beautiful , and i would never trust putting my expensive ux in a crappy canvas case the magnetic closure is lame -lrb- wonder if it 'll have a negative effect on the computer -rrb- , but other than that it works great
soft leather feel , unit carring case that provides light surface protection this case fits perfectly over your sony vaio ux personal computer case has no padding on the inside to protect unit from external hits or should you drop it however it does protect your unit from scratches or light dings from daily use while traveling the case has a magnetic cover to easily open and close quietly the case is stretchable with small openings on both sides of case to allow the ux nylon handle to be used the case is a snug fit around the unit and does not allow enough room for any other accessory strictly a ux personal computer protection case only . -lsb- ... -rsb- provided smooth transaction and fast delivery with no hassles
i paid more for these than regular sleeves because it comes with blank labels that you can then insert in this tiny little slot the problem is the slot is so tiny and the cardboard is so flimsy that you ca n't get the paper in the slot without it disintegrating to bits in your hands no amount of force gets the slips of paper into the designated slots so i paid more <unk> because of this feature which you 're not able to use
i <unk> buying this as soon as received it despite all the positive reviews , this product does not cut it with me it is too <unk> that the plastic is left come out towards you , not as the picture where it is contoured with the disc do not buy unless you want to be dissappointed
i have a caselogic case , so i needed more sleeves and ordered these the sleeves work well , however , the <unk> holes are not at all the same locations as our case , of the same brand i used a single punch and just made my own
very well made , but you only get # % that you get of the generic types the best part of this order was the plastic stick that helps put the paper in the title window
i was hoping these were the original <unk> that had the cd slot on the back and the cd booklet slot on the front ... these are slotted on both sides which does n't work well with the booklet in any event , these are better than jewel cases that take up too much room and often break at the hinge
costs too much for what you get these are protective & all that , but office depot has a very nice sleeve for far less , that is every bit as protective , and all the rest check it out you 'll be surprised
these sleeves are nice but overpriced i ended up buying # sleeves that are a bit cheaper in quality because they were priced better i would have preferred using these but it was going to be far too expensive considering i was <unk> over # cd 's
i purchased these cd sleeves as extras to go in the innovera storage boxes i bought they are good quality , but not as roomy as the sleeves that came with the innovera boxes i was doing some <unk> and wanted to put at least part of the cd 's cover insert in each sleeve with the disc , so i appreciated the extra space of the innovera sleeves some users <unk> the snugger fit of the case logic ones , though
i had all my cds in a sony # <unk> <unk> most of them are now ripped to mp # , and need to be put away in storage i got rid of all the jewel cases years ago , but kept the liners , etc . these sleeves are just , barely , wide enough to put the booklets in one pocket with the cd in the other and the booklets have to go in one direction ; turn them # and they wo n't fit even at that , having the booklets in one pocket makes the soft paper in the center wrinkle or <unk> up just a bit not enough to fold and bind against the cd , but enough to notice i have a lot of my booklets in targus <unk> double plastic sleeves that i got a decade ago , but they seem to have stopped making them they fit the booklets nicely now i will try to find something wide enough for the booklets , and , when i do , i will give these away
there is n't a whole lot a person can say about some cd/dvd sleeves i got a lot for a good price i put my dvds and cds inside the sleeves , then put the sleeves in some storage containers i purchased from target that 's kind of the end of my story i hope you enjoyed it
material feels durable really like the <unk> double pockets my only issue is insertion of the label is a little difficult , the cardboard label tends to bend and make insertion into tight slot harder -- i would prefer <unk> <unk> labels
have used these sleeves for years to <unk> my # + cds they work well and although could be wider to hold the cover pictures of the cd 's , are adequate for the
i usually use these sleeves when i need to give a disc to a friend or family member of course they are not hard cased so one still needs to be a little careful with the discs when they 're inside but they get the job done they provide decent scratch protection and are also easily mailed i only wish they had the binder holes <unk> but there may be another version of this product that has that -lrb- for slightly more money -rrb-
perfect size to protect your cds/dvds from getting scratched fits nicely in the <unk> box , although make sure you notice that you only get # sleeves as they are double-sided i had to go back and buy some more after the fact
i had all my cd 's in various book style cases the pages were full and hard to keep organized now all my cd 's are in individual sleeves with the cd insert in it and i 've <unk> them in narrow boxes that fit on a shelf nicely
the description of this product is somewhat misleading there are really only # double-sided -lrb- hence # -rrb- <unk> in the box i used these to <unk> my dvd collection -lrb- throwing away two giant trash bags of dvd cases -rrb- i purchased these with vaultz <unk> # a to z cd/dvd storage file <unk> - # per box -lrb- black -rrb- and <unk> <unk> # double wide cd storage box -lrb- black -rrb- four shelves of dvds were consolidated into # of half of the box with about # leftover sleeve pages -lrb- or # sleeves -rrb- you can clearly see through the sleeves to identify your dvds if you have dvds that are nearly completely silver , i suggest grabbing the movie description paper out of the case before you throw it away , cut out the title , and slip that in front of the dvd enjoy spring cleaning
absolutely the best and i have tried others your cd/dvd is protected with a soft micro fiber panel which lets you store # in one packet i can store # cd/dvds in a # & # # ; drawer they come with label paper perforated in this strips to print the cd/dvd name on and insert in the
i paid a couple dollars less for # sleeves from china on ebay . # seconds after i opened the package they were in the trash the <unk> of toilet paper these sleeves , however , are very thick and durable yet still reasonably priced i 'll definitely order more when needed
i love these , i am actually ordering more now , going to catalog our <unk> ' entire music collection with these such a space saver , what used to take up a ton of space now takes up one single drawer
i have been using these for years they work great they are really not meant for two dvds or cds , too tight but they are sturdy and work great for my collection
great product , thick sleeves not flimsy at all will last a long time only problem is that you have to purchase something else too good thing i had other things to order
i love these things and i need some more case logic is a great brand and anything i can find with that name on it , i buy it thanks for being a great
silly me , i just lived with cd/dvd case all over my work area that is now all <unk> down to a box which fits under my desk and out of the way now i do n't have to move all those cases when i 'm looking for something all the discs are nicely organized by category and easy to find
i bought these sleeves to store all my dvd 's and blu-ray 's i have over # movies and keeping them in their original cases on shelves takes up a lot of space i put all the discs into these sleeves and then store them <unk> in a couple <unk> boxes i found on amazon and they fit nicely under my television then i put all the original cases in totes and put them away in the basement the sleeves are durable and have cloth liners so the discs do n't get scratched also they are double sided so i get twice as much storage with half as many sleeves
i used these with a vaultz locking cd file cabinet they work really well though i wish i had gotten the ones with hanging tabs i use them to transport <unk> discs sometimes if i 'm in a hurry i 've never had a problem with a scratched disc with them
i wanted to condense my cd collection from their originals cases into one cd box these were perfect they can hold # cd 's with protection in between , but i used the second side to hold the cd jacket seem to be well made ... none ripped when i shoved the larger jackets in them
i gave this five stars because of the product itself but be warned , you will not receive # cases , you will get # cases that are double sided that is useless to me because i am always buying new discs and when i am looking for one i do not want to have to look on the opposite side i would not have ordered them if i knew these were <unk> sided other case logic products listed on amazon are labeled as double sided the difference in price between the single sided i bought earlier this year and these double sided ones is # . # cents -lrb- # . # cents for single sided vs # cents double sided -rrb- that is not a lot until you figure that that is $ # more for every # you buy i would have returned them except i would have to pay shipping both ways and then would end up spending the same amount of money to return them as it would be to just keep them
i purchased this item based on its several positive reviews i did n't like it at all the `` strategically placed stitching `` for gripping or whatever it 's for looked really sloppy to me i found the texture of the neoprene to be very <unk> to the touch i returned mine i 'm glad it 's working for some people it seems like it probably protects the computer pretty well
i originally purchased a different case for my # `` macbook pro and found that the fit was inferior to my expectations i went in search of another product that would be better enter the microfiber sleeve between the soft feel , slick appearance , <unk> shield , and the <unk> protecting sheet that doubles as a screen wipe , i could n't be happier i use it everyday and feel that it provides needed protection for my laptop investment
i love how well this product is designed it has the double layer around the zipper so that it would n't scratch your precious laptop and it comes with a fantastic keyboard <unk> cleaner i got it a few years back and i remember getting it cheaper than what is listed here , though maybe there are other vendors that still sell it i would hate to see this product <unk> out
the bag is nice but it is impossible to have it role behind you without it tipping over and dragging i took the bag to africa and central america but i would never buy another one
i love this bag as a rolling bag that will handle both my # mm cameras with lens attached , plus plenty of room for other lens and flash units with all my equipment loaded into it , i could not see using it as a backpack it would be too heavy for me to carry for any lenght of time so , i cut out the straps that were used for backpack , and that gives me more room for books and brackets , and etc . i own many bags and i 'd say this is the best one i 've got i get more in it than other larger bags , and the rollers make it nice
yes it 's not the lightest bag but hey you are hauling around multiple pieces of very expensive camera bodies and lenses so what 's a pound or two quality is good zippers are a little stiff but again they are water resistant type zippers with a seal
# . # laptops fit , but very snug if it were # to # . # it would be perfect overall i like it , but its a struggle getting it in and out of the case if you have a # & # # ; wide laptop , i 'd look for one a little bigger than this
i 've had this laptop case for a while now and it has been great i keep my # . # inch laptop in it and it fits perfectly my charger fits in it too , but there is very little room for anything else , like a mouse it 's a simple carrying case ; it looks nice , it 's a pretty good price , and it performs well
found this at a local <unk> a few months ago for # bucks exactly the case i was looking for - something that can fit a decent sized laptop , charger , phone charger cables , and more that is incredibly light stretchy material so can squeeze in even more extra stuff too , although the point of this bag is for people who like to pack light and stay lean
: -rrb- it is a good bag , scope in improving build quality flexible , great storage , looks very sleek and nice plenty of space at one point i had it filled with two laptops , their chargers and some college textbook
i purchased this bag almost a year and a half ago and use it on a daily basis to transport my work and laptop to school fits my decently sized # inch hp laptop perfect and the shoulder strap is easy to adjust and can be expanded to a decent length the material used for the majority of the bag is sturdy , i have thrown this bag many times -lrb- not with the laptop in it : p . . -rrb- however , the material does let moisture in if rained on so i would be careful and try to keep it dry the only other problem i have had with this bag is tha , one of the clips that connects the shoulder strap to the bag broke it was only the spring that actually keeps the clip closed so a little tape fixed it easy all in all , if the clip had n't broke this bag would be an easy # of #
this is one crazy good bag i bought it back in # when i started college i 've switched laptops since , but the bag has stayed with me for most # x # aspect ratio screens in the <unk> of # inches or so , this bag is perfect there 's sufficient padding so that the computer is protected , but the bag does n't get heavy the other pockets inside could easily fit the charger , a mouse , a hard mouse pad , plus two or three single subject notebooks for class for traveling , this is great the back side has two zippers that opens so you can slide this bag right on top of your carry-on luggage handle that strip of leather on the outside flap actually is a pocket too -lrb- pretty clever -rrb- all in all , i am very pleased the bag has held up all these years and is still going strong
lightweight and a perfect place for everything if your laptop is smaller , there 's a section that velcros in to hold it in place mine is big and fits in perfectly
this bag is perfect for securely carrying a # -inch hp laptop there are pockets galore to hold computer accessories , other necessary files or papers , or office supplies strong straps , easy to clean , lightweight , comfortable to carry i am very pleased with this bag
i love the bag , but the space to hold my # inch laptop is too small i keep folders in that space and just keep my laptop in the main compartment , instead
nice bag but did n't realize only big enough for microsoft brand i have a toshiba and my laptop was too big for the padded safety portion of the bag otherwise , nice bag , roomy
everything about this is good , price , workmanship , etc . however , i did not care for the color inside online its looks like soft pale orange , in person it is loud and intense very bold orange which did not appeal to me
this bag was purchased to carry around my # . # inch toshiba laptop , but the padded pocket was too small by more than an inch since i knew i was going to be getting a new , smaller laptop soon , i decided to keep the bag because it is roomy with plenty of pockets when i got my samsung nc # , the bag turned out to be perfect i put my # inch computer in the padded pocket longways with the slightly padded bag i use to carry the power cords and they fit perfectly , leaving me even more room because i carry my laptop nearly everywhere i go , i use this bag as my primary bag it has room for my blackberry , my zune , my wallet , pens , small notepad , and other incidentals without being crowded the outside pocket is great for my keys if you have a smaller laptop , then i would recommend this bag to you without hesitation the only reason i gave it four stars instead of five was because it 's promoted as a bag for the average sized laptop and it really is n't
nice product for the <unk> sturdy the only complaint i have is that my # in . laptop does not fit in the sleeve but in the main section of the bag other than that , i like it
i was looking for a while for a bag like this one , has a lot space , its classy but at the <unk> time is made from a very resistent material ideal for traveling
i am a network administrator who tends to carry a lot of things in my bag i have room here for my portable hard drive , camera , <unk> with cables in it and those essential articles i am always trying to read besides of course my laptop my favorite thing is how the handles are just the right length and fit over even my heavy winter coat for easy carrying i am a geek but this bag keeps me from looking like one
i 'm a teacher and i really needed something stylish and sleek like this to lug my laptop around but once i got it ... the tote is so great that i 'm using it as my <unk> handbag
at the firm i work with , no laptop bag stands out more than mine <unk> aside , this is a very <unk> bag considering its function it is designed well to fit my # `` screen laptop , and other bells and whistles that go with a <unk> office lan cable , mouse , power adapter , pens , pads , mobile phone , etc . i tend to fill my bags to maximum capacity as well and this retains its shape no problem very sturdy , nice orange lining for easier visibility , i love all the pockets to help keep my stuff organized and not all falling to the bottom of the bag it even stays right side up without falling over great purchase , wonderful deal for such quality and functionality i highly recommend it
the backpack quickly worn out within weeks though using the hp laptop it is made for after refund period is passed with amazon.com , i contacted hp hp 's # number was a joke for their laptop , <unk> did n't know what they are doing , and transferred me more then # times and more , i got disconnected # times they are saying , its under limited warranty for # month , but their is no <unk> for doing so , so what 's the point i 'd really appreciated if hp or amazon.com can quickly contact me and solve this problem with me asap hp <unk> # aa backpack case for # . # -inch
this looks like it would be good when you see it online , but when i received it , there was no padding or protection and for the price i found a cheaper one that i liked better sent this one back
i have had two of these -lrb- the first was replaced for free -rrb- in both cases the shoulder-strap materials frayed and separated it is too bad because otherwise it is a nice backpack
this bag looks just fine on the ad but when it arrives , it 's depth is too much it 's a backpack with a laptop holder also , i have since seen better bags at target for $ #
i purchased this backpack case to house my son 's # inch laptop i <unk> the item quickly , but then when we tried to put the # inch laptop in the backpack it would n't fit it was about an inch to small i had a # . # inch laptop which fit nicely the low <unk> is due to the backpack 's inability to hold a # inch laptop as advertised
i bought this backpack for the specific purpose of toting around my # `` laptop it specifically states that a # `` dell laptop will fit well , it does n't if you want to fight and squeeze and push it in then maybe you can get it in there certainly not something i want to deal with in an airport remember , when you check the dimensions on a backpack , consider that the top sides of the pack are usually rounded smaller than the total depth measurement laptops are square or rectangular , backpacks are n't
looks great , convenient compartments , but the one attribute where it is <unk> inadequate is durability i bought this thinking i would have it for at least a year or two & the darn thing started coming apart after a few months of use the shoulder strap began to unravel , foam cushion spilling out the side i sometimes carry a lot of paper for work in addition to my laptop , & i do often carry it using only one strap but come on i would expect it to hold together for at least a year i am now shopping for a new laptop backpack & i am willing to spend a little more this time for durability - i hate buying cheap crap that does n't last under normal use conditions
i purchased this item as a gift for a family member when it first came we loved it it was the perfect size for a # inch laptop and had plenty of room for papers and a book or two without being too bulky there are a bunch of pockets for storing mp # players , etc . however , after less then # months of normal every-day use the shoulder strap is completely frayed and falling apart it is still usable but it looks terrible - you can see the foam padding inside the strap i 'm really shocked that hp would put its name on a product of such poor quality
if you are a college student looking for a backpack to endure the <unk> weight of classes , then this is not the one for you regardless of how careful you take care of this bag , it would just start falling apart it does not support shoulders or back with heavy loads and tend to hurt if you are consistently doing so it claim to be able fit a # `` laptop unless you feel like forcing your laptop in every time , please choose another or buy a smaller laptop it was not worth the money
the backpack seems to be adequately made but , i have to stretch the edges around the hp # `` laptop i have to get it in the elastic retaining strap on the laptop compartment does n't even stretch over computer i think hp should at least make the backpack fit their own laptop computers they say the backpack was made to fit
i just returned the second one of this exact model the first i had to replace after about # months as both of the shoulder straps were severely frayed and the partition between two of the sections was coming unstitched from the outer shell the second i return after just one month as one of the shoulder straps was faulty and tended to <unk> when worn perhaps i should n't have purchased this a second time , but i has such a difficult time finding a pack that fit my computer i went with this because i knew it would fit
it 's not a bad backpack for the money somewhat light , but <unk> stitched together i 'm not so fond of the mold green color , but that 's no big deal what is a big deal is that this backpack is supposed to fit a # `` laptop i bought this especially for the new hp dv # `` laptop that i just got , and it just barely fits you have to turn the notebook lid facing inwards and then really pull tight on the sides while you zip up the pack hopefully , the backpack will stretch with time technically , the laptop is a # . # `` model -lrb- as are most ' # `` ' laptops -rrb- , so i have to cut hp a little slack
nice bag except for the handles in less then # months both handles have frayed so much that the foam padding is coming out too bad because the bag is nice but overall it s ****
a good product , but only for # inch or maybe even # inch or smaller laptops it would n't fit my # inch laptop or even come close so i sent it back
the quality , size and convenience of all the storage compartments met my expectations however , the nylon straps that hold the shoulder straps unraveled and almost disintegrated before i managed to hold them together with duct tape pretty strange how quickly they unraveled
pros : it 's a big backpack great for carrying my large laptop around cons : the divider between the laptop compartment and the main compartment tore after the # nd week of use so while it still works as a backpack , i 'm hesitant to actually carry my laptop in it <unk> something else break or tear causing my laptop to be damaged
i bought this for my son 's # inch hp laptop and it does n't fit we were able to stretch the fabric over the laptop to make it zip but it was just too tight he would not have been able to put anything else in the backpack because any additional space taken would not have allowed it to zip
i did n't love this backpack pros : it was a great price , aesthetically pleasing , came very quickly cons : there at some design flaws that are a little irritating the zipper for the textbook pocket is hard to get to and is hidden behind a rather useless flap it is a very tall backpack so things fall to the bottom it does n't stand up on it 's own which i did n't think i would mind but it is an extra consideration everytime i set it down when i pick it up by the shoulder strap , the strap pulls out to it 's full length and i have to readjust it the <unk> of the shoulder strap back into the bottom of the backpack is very flimsy and does n't appear made to last it also squeaks a bit when i walk i would probably spend a little more for a backpack made by a company that <unk> on backpacks
i have this backpack and use it to carry two laptops everyday to work and back after # years the zippers started to pull away from the fabric and the shoulder straps started to fray apart great for one machine and not much added weight
i bought this backpack for a # in laptop and it would not work i 'm sure it is a great backpack but i ca n't imagine there is much of a difference between an hp and dell # in laptop my dell would not fit in the backpack
a good backpack for the price just looks like its going to fall apart the arm straps are very flimsy and appear to be similar to backpack available at walmart for fifteen dollars
i bought this bag with the intention of taking it to afghanistan while it is n't the greatest bag , it has endured a beating there are about # stitches on the front of the bag that have come undone , but it has no effect on the usefulness of the bag i was able to fit my # . # inch hp dv # laptop into it however , it does n't provide much padding around the corners of the laptop i would n't recommend letting somebody toss the bag around with your laptop in it i have gone home from afghanistan and back twice now , and i took this bag as my only luggage i packed it so full that it was a little tough to fit in the overhead compartments , but it worked i was able to pack about # days worth of clothes , along with my laptop , tablet and a few other computer accessories going forward i would like a bag that is taller , but for the money this bag has done a good job for me
