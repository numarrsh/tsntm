the case fit perfectly i liked the quality of the product and will shop from ipearl again the package came to me in a very reasonable amount of time and i 'm very happy i do n't have to send it back also , the price was perfect
i love this cover it is exactly as described and pictured it has a good quality finish unlike the previous one that i bought from another brand and/or seller i hope this one will be durable ! i love it so far ! !
i have n't dropped my laptop -lrb- and hope i never will -rrb- but i really love the feel of the keyboard cover and the protection it gives -lrb- as well as avoiding wear -rrb- at first i was surprised that it was a plastic snap-on cover as i 've never had one before , but the idea of my computer not getting dirty and looking different while avoiding scratches is pretty cool
i used to have the incase brand one this mcover hard shell case is lighter than it and retractable feet feature is just great i am so glad i found the perfect case for my macbookpro
does exactly what i wanted it to do . very sturdy and durable the placement is exact and damn it looks good it truly looks like i had apple personally customize this for me it does n't look like the mac has a cover at all
this case looks great it is very bright dont be mistaken . if you are expecting something that isnt very bright dont get this . it id very sturdy and will keep your laptop from denting
very sturdy , clips on in seconds and protects in all the right spots , fits really good and looks amazing . i like the stands on the bottom . very good for the price
absolutely love it . . highly recommended and just as advertised i like he addition of the kick stand in the back for easier typing and the way the apple logo glows threw the case
i had an older , pricier clear version that finally cracked and broke i got this less expensive solution with not high expectations , but it is performing great great fit , cool look , and <unk> ventilation
this item was so easy to put on and begin using it looks great and offers good protection so that the macbook pro 's metal case does n't get scratched i love the color
we have a macbook pro and bought the orange mcover to keep the aluminum from getting messed up after looking at a number of options , we landed on this one our daughter has a polycarbonate -lrb- white plastic -rrb- macbook and she bought the speck cover for about twice as much both covers do the job , but we -lrb- my wife , if you must know -rrb- really appreciate the mcover hard shell case it fits well it 's tough and offers great protection it is very affordable . ipearl-inc . delivered the cover quickly and followed up with me after the sale you ca n't ask for better service if i buy another macbook , i will also buy another mcover
very nice and inexpensive i like that the apple logo shines thru and has fold out stands for letting the laptop breathe and avoid heating up easy to use stays on and easily clips on also bought her the orange kuzy keyboard cover but too bad they forgot to align the letters and allow <unk> lights to shine
product is of good quality it does what it should at a cheaper price i wholeheartedly recommended it there is no need to buy the <unk> apple version , which in my view is too expensive
i ordered this case for my new macbook and it works and looks great . the color is a very bright orange , almost neon , which is very eye catching and fun the case also comes with a key board protector , which i did not know about until i opened the package and was a nice bonus the only drawback is that the top half of the case was a little difficult to install , i had to try putting it on a few different ways before it fit overall i am very pleased with this purchase
this mcover case is perfect ! ! there is no point in spending $ # - $ # on a plastic shell the case pops right on , and can be removed easily i received my order in three business days and i have no complaints about it if you are looking for a case , mcover is the way to go
had to return do to wrong <unk> , they say the new imac but its not . and the material was very cheap not what i thought it was going to
i liked this but when one of the legs broke off shortly after using this , i wrote to the company and never heard back customer service is king for me so hence , the one star otherwise , the rest of the cover has held up for a few years now -- but the foot feature is useless
this case ended up scratching my laptop little pieces of dirt & dust get into the cracks and scratches my laptop i do n't plan on buying something like this ever again
i 've been trying to find the grips online to replace but i cant seem to find any all my other friends bought this too and all their grips fell off as well
it did n't fit my macbook pro # & # # ; retina display which is totally not the sellers fault it 's definetly mine i put a two because other people like me with the new macbook retina display searching reviews will hopefully see this first and know to not get it because of the sizing otherwise it came in good timing and the product looks as good as the one a bought from the mac store for # <unk> dollars i wish i would have read a little better but oh well
this case was cracked when i recieved it it wasnt very big until a few days later now it is huge across the top and i 'm disappointed this is not as durable as i was hoping , but it keeps my macbook from getting scratched up so i guess that 's all that matters
this was n't my first mcover i had purchased i honestly bought # before but this was the first to disappoint plastic felt cheap and case kept snapping off i am only left wondering , `` what happen ?
this product was cheap but decent with regards to the outside cover the interior keyboard protector is like a piece of <unk> wrap , it peels off every time you open the lid decent by , for the outer cover
this plastic cover fits great on macbook pro i expected the color to be darker , it 's more like a pastel pink i have been using the cover for about two weeks and notice a couple of scratch marks on the plastic overall , it protects laptop and looks cute
protection wise this has been a great cover so far my two problems are # there must beg a flaw with the & # # ; legs & # # ; to this case because my macbook is slightly lopsided when i extend the case legs . # i 'm not sure if this is supposed to be this way , but on the bottom half in the back t does n't snap on the laptop so it seems as if it would be easy to come off since the keyboard cover is & # # ; free & # # ; i 'm not taking off stars for it , but it sucks so buy a separate one if you intend on using it i just did n't bother buying one because i never had intentions on purchasing a cover it makes typing hard and i 've used friends laptops before that had keyboard covers and i did n't experience the same issue
i wo n't <unk> the product because it has done exactly what it was supposed to do considering what i payed for it that being said , i really would n't recommend it i bought this as soon as i bought my mac and when i took it off months later my computer had scratches from it while computer was protected overall i definitely would have gone with a softer cover in hindsight
the case is wonderful , the keyboard cover is cheap and it gets dirty fast from dust i can not type as fast as i want to so i do not even use the case anymore
the color was n't the right shade of pink as i expected ... the bottom rubber part that sets it in place already came off , but other than that , i guess it does the
the top cover fits fine , however it interferes with opening and closing the laptop the bottom pops off on the back side when you shut the computer i 've tried numerous times to get it to fit right , but it wo n't stay in place maybe i 'm doing it wrong , but either way , it should n't be so difficult right now i 'm just using the top cover
i broke one of the legs off of it but it was easily put back on i just love the color and thats what i bought it for definitely better than not having a cover for my macbook pro i like that there are legs i do not remember that being in the product description so it was a nice surprise does not cover any component i might need as well as being nicely fitting it never had slid off at all
i loved my case for my macbook but there was just one little problem it came with a scratch on the hard cover which is right on top other then that it is a great product to keep your macbook
the free keyboard cover is very cheap it ruins the look because the black keyboard is shown through the pink cover it is extremely <unk> to <unk> the correct keys . so i bought a new and different brand keyboard cover the hard shell color is not the same as the pic
this case has been keeping my laptop safe , but the case does take the scratches instead while my laptop has remained unscathed the case looks like it has been through battle ok if you only want something to keep the things inside
not what i expect but i still like it do n't get me wrong is cool love the stand at the bottom of the case fits well and easy to use kinda makes my laptop <unk> but it 's
the product was just what i was looking for it was the pink i wanted and the right type i had in mind i love how i can set my mac at a angle due to the cover
i just recieved this case today it was in perfect condition , was packaged very nicely , and is exactly what is described in the product description it lived up to my expectations perfectly i love the color , and the case fits my mac perfectly
this inexpensive hard shell case fits my macbook pro like a glove it protects the outside of my mac from scratches and is pretty too the only thing that would be nicer is if the apple was clear so the light would show through better
like that the case is durable and the kickstands on the <unk> i think it would be a little nicer in a <unk> , do n't like that you ca n't get a good grip on the case
it 's a nice product , it 's functional i 've dropped my laptop since i purchased the cover and it protected it i 've had another cover similar to this product and i would say it was nicer my old cover had the attachment prongs in the front of the laptop so it was painful to type at times this one has the prongs on the side so it 's far more comfortable
the case fits my computer perfectly i just got it today and i am very pleased with it the keyboard cover does n't match the color of the case it was more baby pink but i like it will update within # months or so to see the durability of the case
it 's a great pink cover and i love that there are little & # # ; kickstand & # # ; legs that pop up it makes typing feel nicer the keyboard cover makes it a little more difficult to move your fingers on the keyboard but it collects all the dust and dirt for sure
this item fit my mac pro # ' # and looks great however , the picture has a softer pink look to it then the one i got the only thing i was concerned about was the shipment , i waited too long for paying $ # i thought because i paid so much it would have been in a couple of days and not almost a week
although a school girl , i do n't think this pink one will be a good choice for color as shown in the pic , looks weird and stupid a little anyway <unk> fits my macbook pro well and is making a good protection
great case , i love the extendable legs on the bottom and the bottom part is well ventilated i also really like that the feet on the bottom are made of actual rubber , opposed to foam which i 've seen in other cases within the same price range it fits well and is easy to put on and take off my only issue is that the pink is a little darker than in the picture , and is more of a deep pink -lrb- i 'm more of a pastel girl , myself -rrb- but that 's alright the keyboard cover is also pretty useless , it does n't really fit around the keys so much as just lays over them if that 's important to you , spent the extra # . # $ on a separate cover
i love this cover and would still buy it again with the few problems i have with it it protects my computer great but he open parts on the bottom leave it open for damage and scrapes also the plastic material scratches extremely easy and the rubber traction pads are n't really in very well and fall out within the first few weeks other than that it is awesome and the color is striking and it works very well
i did a lot of research before purchasing this case two-day shipping was only about $ # more , so i went with that was packaged great ; case was in a bag , in a box , filled with air filled bags for protection snaps on easily - does n't scrape anything up or fit too snug-ly the legs are pretty cool too the color is great - vibrant pink the bottom is vented very well , which is important access to all ports ; overall , great product if i 'm in the market for another case , i will definitely order from this seller again
i love this case fits my mac just as it says it would the only reason i ca n't give # stars is the keyboard case does not fit , other than that i really like it and would purchase in another color too
this product is pretty good i love pink so i really liked the color my macbook is # . # inches and the cover fit well i also bought the silicon keyboard cover and that works well my macbook is protected
# yr or so already with this n its still working wonders for me . many love the color . the pads on te bottom have fallen out bu its been a yr i <unk>
this is a great protective cover with feet that provide enough angle so that my <unk> <unk> does n't act up when i type i order pink because the other colors were not available , and i actually like it very much
my son bought the black one first i decided to get one as well since it looks great on his computer and fit real good the pink color turned out to be a bit more bright than i would like it , but other than that it 's fine
the color was a tad bit different than i had <unk> , but i like it it 's super easy to put on my desk can be very <unk> so it does a great job in protecting my macbook pro from getting scratches the stand is a little flimsy , but if you do n't use it ... it does n't really matter
fits well and provides good handling and protection product is cost effective and works as expected it is attractive and <unk> easy use of all ports and controls would purchase another if needed
bought this to replace a # yr old cover that was getting <unk> arrived on time and installed perfectly in a minute or so has nice rubber supports on the front that keep the laptop from slipping around on the desk the free keyboard cover that came with this cover did n't fit well at all it is clear all over and looks like a piece of plastic has been placed over the keys but the wife likes it , so there you go
this case is a great buy for the money - definitely cheaper than the products you would get at the store it is not the highest quality plastic but serves the purpose does it get dirt under it yes , over time does occasional cleaning solve this problem i put this on my laptop after it already had some wear and tear and wanted it to look shiny and new i have n't noticed any new scratches , but i 'm not sure i would notice any minor scratches in the grand scheme of things i did n't use the keyboard cover so i can speak to that
this case came exactly when it was supposed to come it did n't have am scratches and it was packed pretty well i got a matching key board cover to go with it the color is about what it looks like on the computer my only complaint it that it is a little bit lose fitting i open my computer and the top kind of comes off if you want a tight fitting computer case , then do n't get this case
this case is great it looks amazing and it fits great the only thing that could be fixed would be the little rubber circles on the bottom one of them came off so when it sits flat its a little lopsided but its not a big deal the color is very nice and the seller shipped it fast and the packaging was great
was looking for a great present for a lady and this cover did it it looks nice and is easy to put on protects well and has solid feel to it
i like the color a lot . the only reason i do n't give # stars it 's because the foldable fee make it a little unstable when they are closed and i use it on my lap desk
the quality of this product is really amazing i 've dropped my macbook like # ` xs with no damages yet i strongly suggest buying a hard-case for any macbook especially one that is as fashionable as mine . : -
this case is very , very pink almost <unk> sometimes it 's nice when you go to a school full of macs that was the main reason i got it the little feet on the bottom are pretty nifty the rubber pads , however , came off pretty quickly the bottom has a ton of open slots that allow dirt and crumbs into the case and they sit there and make the laptop look kinda gross even if you clean it often , they find their way in that being said , i 'm still really glad that i have it it 's saved my computer from being scratched further on the bottom and has even endured a few minor <unk>
i really enjoyed this case because it does protect , you can hear all the sides click when you put it on , i also like the pink color since i cant find any pink color cases for a mac its plastic and not leather but its really nice to have : -rrb- it was also fast shipment
i had a speck cover on my macbook and wanted to change the color without spending much money this is a great alternative at a great price !
they were and looks great , excellent price , fit in well in the apple , package came complete as per required , was perfect for my purpose , i recommend them to all customers
i like everything about this product with one exception the & # # ; feet & # # ; that allow air to circulate around the computer are a little too tall my laptop sits on the keyboard pull out part of my computer table i ca n't slide the pull out keyboard area back into the table without first closing the feet
this was purchased by my daughter using a gift card when asked for her feedback , she emailed back : `` i like it -lrb- : `` from a # -year-old , that is about as good as it gets
this is a really great cover you ca n't beat the price either it 's pretty simple , snaps on and off , and protected my computer from the elements -lrb- <unk> this thing through a <unk> site for # months -rrb- really well there 's a ton of ventilation on the bottom and while i thought the little legs on the bottom were flimsy , they turned out to be really sturdy
i recently bought a macbook pro and really needed a case to protect it from scratches and such this is the perfect case within # days of my purchase , it was waiting for me at my front door thanks for the speedy shipping and for the quality
i ca n't believe i did this , but maybe my mistake will help someone else i ordered this product , which is for a macbook pro , but i have a unibody macbook i guess i thought they 'd be interchangeable but as usual , amazon is a great company for customer service they helped me return it and get the correct product this came in two days as promised , packaged perfectly i have another mcover , and it is a great protector for your mac
the case fits perfectly it is see thru so you can see the apple logo the feet that prop it up are good but could be sturdier since they feel a bit flimsy
i have been using this keyboard for almost one year and it is still in excellent condition the quality is very good and the color is pretty i recommend this product to anybody :

i purchased a new macbook pro and did n't want the machine to get all scratched up so i purchased this cover to protect it other covers were twice as much as this cover but i really like this one because it is frosted and wo n't show scratches with normal use the color is more of a hot pink color than a traditional deep pink but i love it it has flip out feet on the back if you want to place it on a hard surface to use does not interfere with the cooling of the machine like my previous laptop cover did that i paid more than twice the price i did for this one i love the matching silicone key cover that came with the cover as well it fits the keys perfectly and has the letters , numbers , and symbols and is like typing directly on the keys themselves without wearing out your keys
