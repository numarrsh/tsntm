i hesitate in <unk> this bag up it just does n't feel durable that being said , the laptop and ipad slots are great the limited width of the bag forces me to keep things neat and organized no more extraneous zipped up pouches where important post its go to die
i have been using a jansport bag for the last # years it has been working ok , but since now i 'm doing my <unk> , i need to carry my macbook pro with me all the time i had one of those sleeves for my laptop , but with a notebook and some other stuff the jansport bag would get heavy i am not sure why but with this bag , i 'm carrying the same stuff + a big book and i do n't feel that it 's heavy if you want a bag like a jansport that you can put a whole lot of things , this is not the bag for you it has a very limited space , and very inflexible for that matter but if you want to carry your laptop , and a couple of books then definitely go for this bag i gave # stars because the color looks much lighter in the pictures the actual color is dark gray , and the inside is blue .
i love this bag , but it was a bit slimmer than i expected very comfortable but not much to the padding on the shoulders fits my mac perfectly , also protects from the element great
was looking for a backpack that could fit my computer , ipad , work materials and a lunch without being overly bulky this fits the bill great the pockets on this are well thought out & useful and the padded areas seems to do a good job of protecting the computer i can also fit gym clothes and running shoes if i need to , but that 's about the max if you are looking for a slim backpack for the essentials that wo n't break the bank , this is a good one to consider
i purchased this backpack for my niece who just had a new macbook pro she has been using it for a couple of months now and is extremely happy with it it has a lot of space so she fits more school stuff not only her mac product is as described and seems to be very durable excellent purchase so far
literally # days after the return period ended , two of the pulls fell off the straps constantly slip when on my back this is the worst product i have ever bought from amazon and now i am stuck with this garbage i am incredibly disappointed in the quality
i bought this backpack after my zipper came off my old one i decided to go incase since previous backpack did n't have a laptop compartment and this one was designed for the macbook so i decided to give this backpack a try even after reading the mixed reviews and thought , & # # ; hey , it might not happen to me . & # # ; sadly , it did i had the backpack for a month and the left strap stitching is coming apart you would think an # dollar backpack would last longer than my old # dollar jansport backpack although it does have a nice laptop compartment cushioned all the way around , the down side is the pocket you put your pens , pencils and eraser in stuff tends to get thrown around inside my backpack and does n't want to stay put if you are considering buying this backpack i would tell you to look else where think twice , act wise
this backpack was great at first small , compact , lightweight however there were not too many compartments , but for me that was okay unfortunately this backpack eventually began to rip i used this for school , although i rarely carried any textbooks , just my laptop and/or tablet , a portable charger , an external hard drive and some chargers after about # months or so this backpack began tearing apart around the shoulder straps . # months after that i became too afraid to use it thinking it would fall apart and drop my laptop to the ground besides poor build quality this backpack was decent , but if you want something that will last longer than # months i suggest looking elsewhere
carry mb air , with ipad and a surface real roomy for a compact backpack use it when traveling through the airport and i need something that will fit comfortably under the seat
i was looking for a thin backpack for my macbook and ipad there are sections for both of those , plus room for my papers and other things i need to carry for me , this is ideal
i usually base my purchases on the number of positive reviews , but this item did not have any reviews at the time from the pictures it looked great and suitable for my tastes in style , so i decided to take a chance and purchase it after receiving the bag and looking it over i was extremely pleased with the product it has a nice clean and simple design my # `` macbook pro is nice and protected while inside it and it has compartments and pockets for all kinds of other things when wearing it , it feels comfortable and not bulky i usually prefer simplicity in the styles and things i buy , so this bag was perfect for me
# & # # ; mac book pro , ipad with keyboard case , phone , wallet , charger , all accessory cords , pens , glasses , paperwork , and other this item carries them all perfectly i use it everyday in construction and its holding up well so if your on the fence do n't be this is very nice
the price and the design is fine , however it is really not for my macbook pro like it suggested it is too large , my macbook pro with its hard cover just swims around inside ... that is why i gave it a # star , otherwise , it is
this is a pretty laptop sleeve my # . # ' dell can sit in it comfortably there 's a chemical smell if you put it close to your nose , but generally , it 's tolerable i only gave # stars because there is no clean cloth with it , that 's bad advertising however , the sleeve is good
i tried to order this for my samsung # , # & # # ; it has almost exact measurements as a macbook pro so it 's was difficult to find a sleeve that would fit this one turned out to be too generous on the width and i opted to return it liked the design , -lrb- pattern -rrb- but i think a different flap for closing it would be more convenient as this one bulged and my laptop was still sliding around inside
works and it is beautiful i just need a simple sleeve to put my laptop in while i 'm on the go it 's simple and elegant and it works fine with my lenovo laptop
this fits my dell inspiron ultrabook # . # well not too tight , not too loose the fold-over top is easy to operate , overall easy to get on/off inside is not cushion-y soft , but is smooth and good enough that it wo n't let your laptop get scratched this would be good for inside backpacks , etc . the design is not obnoxious either it was smelly when it arrived , needed to air out in garage for a day it did not come with a cleaning cloth
it fits good i like the look i only use it when i travel because of the material , it gets a little slippery when i try to get the laptop in and out overall , it 's a fine product
i like this sleeve it 's very pretty and i get compliments on it all the time it does n't look like a lot of notebook sleeves and cases out there it 's feminine without being pink and <unk> i did not notice a smell like others have commented on in the reviews it smelt fine to me
girlfriend uses this for her # & # # ; laptop all of the time it fits perfectly and it gives it adequate protection this protector is made of quality materials and looks nice also i would recommend this if you just leave your laptop laying around
i love this case it fits my dell perfectly and looks really cute i , personally , like the <unk> better than the zipper because i can get my laptop out quickly and from inside my backpack although it does not come with the cleaning cloth by mygift , it is <unk> an excellent sleeve for a pretty good price ... and it 's not ugly that 's a big plus
love the bag , planned on using it as a thin light briefcase when was n't carrying laptop the smell of neoprene is overpowering aired it out for a week and the smell was as bad as the day i took it out of the packaging if strong chemical smells do n't bother you , you will love this bag not only does it have side zippers to put mouse or charger but also a velcro opening below the handle to access the pouch that way as well
this had the exact specifications i needed for my laptop - extra pockets for chargers and pens , etc . and a carrying handle , aesthetically pleasing it just broke way too quickly the handle on one side lasted about a month ; now i have to stick it to the velcro part and rely on the opposite handle to carry it efficiently definitely not a sturdily made product but works okay for toting around the house
this bag has a nice comforting feel to it but does n't really offer any protection for your laptop do not buy this if you know you have <unk> i wish the front pocket had a little bit more room i used this to put my dell xps and it kept it safe from dust most of the time
i wanted something small , with handles and a pocket for my cord this matches the bill perfectly it does have a strong neoprene smell but it does n't bother me and i 'm sure with time it will fade it fits my # `` macbook pro , power cord and digital camera perfectly
cute bag , just what i wanted for my mac gave it # stars just because like it says in the other reviews it has a strong <unk> smell , airing it out so hopefully will go away soon
i noticed on a lot of reviews that some people were complaining about the smell of this case however , i do n't find it to be that strong at all and it does n't bother me this is a great case for the money better than i expected
i really like this case it 's cute , super soft on the inside , and the fact that you can charge your computer while it 's in the case is a nice touch my macbook pro # inch has a hard shell cover on it and it still fits nice and snuggly in this the pocket on the outside is too small to hold anything other than like an ipod charger or something really thin but overall i 'm happy with this purchase
this is a great high-quality case , with a nice leather exterior and plush interior the only bad thing about it is that the outside pocket is n't of much use due to how small it is but the case is great and fits my # inch macbook pro with retina perfectly
it does n't fit as snuggly as i thought but it looks better than i expected and the pocket is really small so all i put in there is my earphones
as a college student , i 've seen more laptop cases than i can count , but i 'm never been jealous toting around this case i ca n't tell you how many times my friends have complemented it it looks super professional , the inside is super soft i never had an issue if scratching of any kind the # -in pro fits in the case extremely snugly , but not too tight i would recommend this case to anybody , especially at this price
i used this for my lenovo yoga # it fits snugly in the case on the first use and then after a while is easier to put in it has a ventilation zipper which i like and it also has a pocket for storing small things such as cell phones , small cables , etc . it in fact also did hold my power brick and cable , but it was a bit tight i like the faux fur inside , and i know my laptop is protected in this case somehow , this case actually makes my laptop feel lighter ? it is some kind of mental illusion but holding it feels like holding a light textbook
this sleeve is exactly what i wanted it 's sturdy and protects my laptop well , and i love the faux leather material on it the zip on the side for charging the battery is very practical , and also the pocket is just right it feels that it will last a long time
love this case i bought it for my new macbook pro i 've had it now for almost a year it 's secure and offers the right amount of protection plus ... it 's cheaper than i was able to find in a store
bought this cause because i wanted something that had a side pocket to fit the charger and sync cables as a plus it also has a side opening to charger while in the sleeve the sleeve looks expensive but bought for a bargain
i got this for the late # macbookpro # & # # ; retina it fits great and the inside is super soft white furry material the outside is <unk> looking black leather , and has a great look and feel
love love love the inside is so nice and soft really protects my macbook love the outside pocket big enough to fit my charger , a pen , or even a small book the side zip for the charger is such a genius idea now i do n't ever have to take my mac out of my sleeve anymore at night just to charge it and on amazon the price is almost # % cheaper than on the incase store , or the apple store
i bought this book bag and recieved it on march # rd . the # -day warranty expired on april # rd its april # th and the strap has completely come off of the bookbag , and the shoulder strap is slowly ripping at the top seam amazon is not even letting me exchange it for a new one f *** this bookbag ... honestly find another one
this bag tore within the first # months of use yes , it fit the large laptop but it should carry the weight of the laptop and not tear , in one trip , beyond the point of using it again
love this bag after trying # others that claimed to hold a # `` laptop -lrb- all # stuck out of the top and had to pull the zippers up and over to close -rrb- this one actually does with room to spare <unk> using this bag for about # months , the shoulder strap pulled loose from the bag and this also caused the inside pockets to pull loose very disappointing as i liked this bag at first would not recommend anyone purchase this bag as it is very cheaply made and does not stand up to any kind of use
when i received this back pack i was super happy with it since the # . # inch laptop fits perfectly however , the backpack ripped off in the upper part now i am very dissapointed since , i just lost all my money
i have to say i bought this backpack almost a year and a half ago it fit the need i bought it for , had plenty of space for my toshiba qosmio x # only problem is that this backpack is the worst back pack i have ever bought it started falling apart from day one ripping near the top pocket inside the padding is cheap styrofoam i have been a student all my life so i can tell whether a backpack is good or not by experience as for this backpack you would do well to stay away from it
i liked this back pack and how large it was the issue i had was how it kept coming apart i had to get a replacement backpack and the replacement started falling about just # months after i got it
the backpack was ok wish it was bigger had a hard time storing all my gear my laptop was # . # so of your laptop is that big you will need a different backpack
the backpack design was exactly what i wanted it was well padded ; the main pocket had a lot of room the laptop and various accessories fit well after only about a month , the seam at the top split and ripped so much that the pack was not usable i am not sure if this is simply a problem with the individual pack that i had or if it is a general flaw in the design and manufacture of the pack
i love the pack 's large capacity for my # `` toshiba satellite laptop , but i this backpack is falling apart the stitching has come un-sewn in two places near the top of the pack i have sewn up one big hole already , but the backpack now looks unprofessional in business meetings
i purchased this for my granddaughter i think she likes it but no comment yet from her that 's typical happy with the product , although the shipping box was damaged the content was fine
husband got this for a christmas present to carry his toshiba # . # laptop he is very happy and uses it all the time now the laptop fits perfectly <unk> looking at this product on the toshiba website and you will be able see additional photos to show how the laptop fits as well as additional storage areas
i got this to carry my new toshiba laptop and i 'm so glad i did it 's not only comfortable , but something about they way it sits on my <unk> makes the weight of the computer almost <unk>
so this backpack does as they said it would fits the large asus laptops other # . # bags i have purchased do not maybe a slim line one but not the big gaming systems i recomend this backpack for all gamers
i chose this backpack because i own a toshiba qosmio x # laptop i could n't find a backpack big enough for the laptop which is a # . # ' laptop plus i am a student so i was also looking for something with enough room to haul my school stuff this backpack is loaded with pockets i have plenty of room for all my stuff , and do n't have to worry about anything getting damaged becuase the backpack is very well padded
first of all , the bag seemed ... dingy i was excited to buy this bag but i did not enjoy the experience the carrying case that i use is about the experience and getting excited about work this did nothing for that experience also - since there was partial circles on the other side of the fabric , it made the bag look dirty in some areas in fairness this is just a laptop sleeve ; however , my experience was not a good one
it is great my only issue is the inside handles u can not close it all the way when using the handles to carry it they need to put those on the outside
i was looking for a computer sleeve with handles that does not look boring this certainly fit the bill it 's nice , colorful & distinctive it is exactly as pictured fitted my new # . # `` macpro perfectly i am happy with my purchase
i bought this case for my wife to carry her new apple laptop in she loved it great case for the price delivery speed was incredible had it for about a year now and it seems to to holding up quite well
the case is both fun and functional i love the built in handles which can be used or tucked inside and zipped around as a bonus i get many compliments on the case !
very nice product i had my daughter pick it out as she was receiving the gift she chose the cover because of the bright colors and great for <unk> school kids to relate to
it was very cute , well done and in very good condition but it was not what was shown because it was not the proper size for a mac book pro neither a dell # & # # ; , it was wider
yes this product was as described with a hidden handle and that you can not zip when the handles are out but the the gap is only of # inches at the most came as expected good fit to my laptop of # . # inch
i actually really this case and had no use for the handles , but i have to speak up about it the handles are on the inside of the zipper so to carry the case you have to zip each side zipper up to either side of the handles i have no idea how they got both zipper things on one side and the handles showing in the picture at the same time it seems this comes with a reference guide before you order it though this is the first time i 'm noticing it i may just cut the handles out otherwise , i like the sleeve
like many of the other reviewers i loved the design and <unk> of this backpack , but was not impressed by the quality that would be fine except that i also had the same experience as other reviewers in that one of the straps separated from the base of the pack there is no way to fix this and so the entire pack is now useless
purchased backpack from j & r ; middle of may for college it has great looks , surprising capacity -lrb- due to its height -rrb- , and an <unk> high quality feel i would suggest this backpack to everyone except for the fact that one of my shoulder straps has begun to disconnect from the base of the bag after only two months of use the stitching has popped out and the interior foam is visible the strap is still connected , but barely the shoulder area of the strap is still intact it wo n't be long until the base <unk> and the strap becomes non-functional , however i am looking to get a replacement bag from either j & r ; or incase
i bought this bag to replace a previous incase bag that i had for a few years and used heavily i really liked my old one so sought out the same brand the design changed a bit from the old one : a few less zippers but , the big problem is that is simply feels cheaper lighter fabric , thinner padding , cheaper zipper pulls this is not a cheap bag , but it feels cheap ! i feel guilty about returning it since i have used it for # weeks , but i for sure will not buy this brand again premium price but not premium product
first of all , i purchased the stone gray colored bag it should be noted that the color is not actually grey , but an odd green color keep this in mind as you choose a color second , after four months of regular use this backpack was packed back up and shipped back to the manufacturer -lrb- at my own expense -rrb- the right strap pulled right out of the stitching i am hoping incase can solve this issue , and that the pack i received was a fluke third , this newer redesign of the incase backpack seems to be a step down in terms of craftsmanship the straps do n't have the same level of comfort and the pack itself does n't hold its shape as well
i 've had mine for almost # years and it 's falling apart at the seams do n't over stuff it the design on the backpack is awesome , but the overall quality is so so for the price
nice to look at the fleece lined laptop sleeve and top pocket are nice -lrb- i keep my sunglasses in the top pocket -rrb- . # comfortable to carry poorly made , the stitching came apart at the seams in one section not a lot of space - it fills up very quickly very few interior pockets everything just ends up in a big <unk> in sum , i would look elsewhere if you 're looking for a backpack to carry your electronics with
what i really liked about this product was that it was the design , i was light and slim -lrb- for a laptop backpack -rrb- , and had good padding unfortunately i had to return it , mainly because it did n't house and have enough room for my work computer i did fit my macbook though love the incase brand , but i really did wish that they offered backpacks for bulkier computers rather than just slim laptops like macbooks overall , if you are just using this to pack your laptop and a few books or notebooks , then i would highly recommend this if not then i would not recommend buying this
i use it mainly to carry my macbook air and a few other accessories and it fits well my needs it 's lightweight -lrb- # lbs -rrb- compared to my <unk> & <unk> flat backpack -lrb- # lbs -rrb- and has many pockets it maintains its shape if you take care of it it 's overall good , except that the shoulder straps get loose so easily that you have to adjust them often
bought this bag to replace a more colorful timbuk # , which was also oversized i wanted something slimmer , which this is , though i wish it was a little slimmer still still on the hunt for a simple , stylish , men 's backpack that is just slightly larger than a laptop
i bought this backpack as a gift for my nephew at first i was shocked at the price of a quality backpack but this is what he wanted once i realized the amazon price was # % cheaper than retail i jumped on it when the bag arrived i was amazed at the features and quality nice for laptop and all accessories
people knock this bag for a lack of quality and such , but i do n't know what they 're talking about i have n't had an issue with either the straps <unk> from the bag or the bag not holding its shape most likely , the people who are having issues with the straps <unk> from the bag probably are wearing it with only one strap over the shoulder at a time some say that the straps loosen , but this only happens while putting the bag on it 's hardly a big deal at all put it on , tighten it up , and you 're good to go no doubt , the bag is classier than anyone else 's pack that i see around campus the only problem is that there is not that much internal space , so if you 're the type to lug a bunch of books around , i suggest something a little bigger
this backpack is the first one to fit my # & # # ; laptop although it is a snug for for my laptop , it has plenty of room for everything else that i carry plus it is slender unlike many others that seem to be wide that you can snag on something as you brush by it
the backpack is a good size and the laptop sleeve fits well with the # `` macbook pro there are a lot of pockets in the second compartment , thing only i would say about them is all of there are pretty small and similar size so there is no where to put a power cord overall the backpack is good if you want to carry your laptop and a couple notebooks , i would advise against trying to use it for multiple textbooks or binders
just returned from a # day international business trip with my new incase backpack met my needs while going from country to country and throughout the day at meetings fully functional laptop pocket and front accessory area for glasses , phones , wallets , passports , etc . nice from and back small zip areas for quick access comfortably carried at different weights and for short and long periods delivered what was expected and i highly recommend
nice looking but quality is horrible ; especially , for such an expensive backpack the stitching along the straps , upper handle , and closure piece have all unraveled do n't waste your money on this pack
beautiful bag - not capable of holding # inch laptop looks fantastic and is everything i expected from the pictures i saw it however falls extremely short on being able to hold a # `` laptop i sadly will have to test the return route
excellent bag and i love it , but , it needs holes <unk> into hand strap i am yet to have it done and i can not find a place to do it however the bag is clean , nice leather finish and elegant
this bag is a really nice . it looks more expensive than what it cost but it is also very heavy that is why we did not give it a
this bag is very well made it is a bit large for a backpack as it does not fit under an airplane seat , but the quality over rides the issue of size
i originally purchased this for myself , and after <unk> it , found that it was too heavy for me i was going to return it , and my husband caught a <unk> of it , so guess who has the <unk> now he loves it and it is total class now i need to find one thats right for <unk>
received this full - leather back-pack beautiful full leather bag exceeded my expectations the cafe color is a very deep and beautiful color there are plenty of interior pocket 's , as well as one zippered compartment on the outside front flap a full size lap-top computer can fit within the interior of the backpack the interior is padded specifically for a full-size lap-top computer i was looking for a <unk> replacement bag for <unk> trips , as well as everyday use for shopping , and carrying full day trip items this full leather bag far exceeded my expectations <unk> a beautifully designed and functional leather back-pack
this backpack is has fulfilled my expectations since i am somewhat of a perfectionist that says a lot it fits everything . it 's huge it is heavy because of the size and the thickness of the leather after some weeks of everyday use it does not show any scratches it is beautiful but it is is heavy
have ordered this bag twice , one as a gift and one for me i was jealous of the one i gave away , so why should n't i have one for myself love it , quality leather , lotsa pockets only thing i wish it had d-rings so you could carry it on your shoulder would recommend it to anyone <unk> <unk> ,
this computer bag is so rugged ! ! i am so hard on my bags this one takes quite a beating and keeps everything safe inside ! the latch works so well and there is enough space and pockets so that i do not need my purse ! !
what i received was only one pack of # not five as shown they were not even close to being # mil , more like # . # or # i had also ordered the # inch bags and they are exactly described very <unk> in amazon on this one
this is supposed to be for # bags -- five packs of # they ship you one # x # `` bag with # of the # . # x # `` bags inside a label on the outside of the # x # `` <unk> bag say `` # packs of # `` , but only # bags are inside -lrb- by physical count -rrb- amazon customer service said i must return the one bag and reorder if i want to try and receive the correct -lrb- # packs of # -rrb- order customer service was nice and polite , but hard to understand due to a thick foreign accent amazon is sending a <unk> shipping label for the return it would have been cheaper -lrb- for amazon -rrb- and more convenient for me if they would have just shipped me the other # packs of # to make the order complete
received one package of # , not five moreover , there is no way these bags are even close to # mil i do n't think that they are even as thick as some # mil bags that i have on top of that , amazon was somewhat of a pain about returning and getting refund probably would not have bothered for the money , but it 's the <unk> of the thing
we bought these because we needed something to organize <unk> for a trip the product barely resembled the picture & description we left on our trip and i do n't know what even happened to them would not recommend i do n't believe they are # mil , and there were not # packs of #
these bags are decent quality considering the price but you get what you pay for i use them to put together my daily <unk> packs i was totally surprised when i found a very long black hair in one of the bags that the small bags are packaged in there was also some kind of sticky <unk> on one of the ziplock bags considering what i use them for , i probably wo n't be purchasing them again
i use bags like this for packaging wax <unk> they are slightly larger and much thicker than the ones i have purchased previously note the mil satisfied and will buy again
these bags are nice and thick but still reasonably priced i use them to store small parts or extra screw , bolts , nuts in the garage junk drawer not as thick as some industrial grade bags i 've collected over the years -lrb- which are thick enough to hang on a <unk> pin through a <unk> hole on the top edge with heavy parts in them -rrb- but these are quite thicker than ziploc <unk> bags are good quality and good price
i received the advertised # pcs and a <unk> indicates that they are indeed made from # mil poly the # . # & # # ; x # & # # ; size indicates the sealed area , not including the flaps outside the seal the seals seem to work well and easily i recommend these bags
these are of excellent quality , value , and price these come is different sizes and <unk> so you can find the size you want i found the # . # `` x # `` in the # <unk> variety to be just right for pills or other small items i had been purchasing the <unk> dose disposable pill pouches , which recently are being made of very poor quality i am thrilled with # . # `` x # `` # mil clear zip lock bags , # packs of # from the vendor collecting warehouse through amazon
i bought these for <unk> backpacking and organization of <unk> and junk drawer it 's just the thing for throwing a bunch of screws , or coins , or . # <unk> or butt connectors or <unk> together
it 's a plastic bag not much to describe here lots of little plastic bags not really sure what you would use these for , i want to put batteries and such and velcro it to where i want to have batteries
the <unk> zip lock bags i purchased from amazon are # mil in thickness and a quality product the zip lock feature functions perfectly and is durable i am satisfied with this purchase
nice heavy weight bags @ a good price i have used a few hundred of these and to problems the do not tear like lighter weight bags do and i really like them i have opened and closed some of them a few times and they seal really well i prefer spending more for these better bags these come as stated in # packs of # so they are easy to manage
these bags work great for storing individual pieces of jewelry , especially earrings and small <unk> the bags are strong enough for this and it makes them easy to find , eliminating tangled pieces if they are n't stored separately in ways such as this
these are really sturdy bags that zip up well i have n't had any problems with them except they are a little difficult to get open that 's not a deal breaker for me they 're also a very good deal since you get # bags for less than $ #
these bag are exactly what i needed to organized my electronic components <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , etc . fit well i have them all labelled and neatly in boxes for easy <unk> this was a fantastic buy
