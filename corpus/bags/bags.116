i just got this backpack shipped to me a couple of days ago and absolutely love it and considering the price , it 's the best deal i could find now all i need is to come up with the funds to fill it with goodies
i think it is really useful but definitely could have been better you can not keep everything tight in this bag , need to be careful before you open the bag yeah , i know i can adjust the dividers but an inside cover on top would have been helpful
the adjustable dividers means my # lens will fit , either on or off the camera room for additional lenses or other accessories separate pocket holds extra sd cards or other items as well external compression ` pocket ' can hold a water bottle , a jacket , or as usual the amazon price and shipping were outstanding
very good bag for the money i fit all my lenses meter and camera body in this bag with pleanty of room , tough it is n't a huge bag there is a slightly misleading pic on here that shows a laptop in the bag i can fit my powerbook g # in the outside pocket but this is not design specific < no padding > but it works :
this bag is well constructed and holds my various lenses and camera body i use it mainly when i am shooting surf pix with my # mm sigma i had to black out the canon name on the back because it just screams out `` steal me !
for its compact size , it has a lot of room feels well built and quality looks i just wish it had a rain cover if you have a dslr with # lenses , this should work very well for you and you just can not beat the price
i like the bag pleanty of pockets and pouches for all my little small accessories just wish it were a little better suited for # cameras like i have but , everything fits ... comfortable to haul around all day nice pads and straps to secure it to my back well padded for the equipment i 'd highly recommend it to anybody
great way to haul around a lot of equipment , even a tripod i am satisfied with it so far it could use a bit more padding on the top where my slr is stored
great quality , designed well , nifty <unk> but , you may <unk> this bag with almost any amount of pro gear full size body 's , # . # glass , large flashes ... time to step it up a few <unk> if you 're <unk> ' a rebel and smaller lenses it 's perfect
i researched every bag on the market before i bought this one what i loved about it , both before i bought it and now that i own it : it holds everything and you can reconfigure the space to fit whatever you carry second , there is plenty of room in the secondary pockets - to the point where i can take hiking gear and my camera -lrb- with lenses -rrb- and feel like i have everything i need on my back where it came up short for me -lrb- pun intended -rrb- is the fit i 'm a # ' # woman and the straps are n't particularly comfortable they do n't move easily and i feel like i have to <unk> my body to climb into the pack frame i recommend the bag - it beats everything else i saw on the market , but just be aware - if you are a very tall man or woman , it is a little less comfortable
i bought this for all my gear and it fits i was able to put in my : sony camcorder , canon sd # , canon g # , <unk> housing for the two cameras , and # lenses for the g # i thought the bag was comfortable , but my husband thought it was too small for him i 'm # ' # `` / average and he 's # ' # / # lbs , with broad shoulders i would suggest taking off the canon logo on the bag just to deter theft
i love this bag and , for the price , you ca n't beat it i have the # d , # lenses and other accessories with space to spare many extra pockets to keep smaller accessories separate
i was able to place both of my camera bodies along with several <unk> and my flash my problem is i have a weak back and the bag became too heavy for me to support the weight
the backpack is nice and functional my only complaint was the shipping took a bit longer than expected ... no shipping info or tracking number . i did n't know if it was coming from usps , fedex or ups . . or when it was coming for that matter i missed the ups guy # times
i purchased this bag because i had more gear than my old one could carry i have a dslr body with battery grip , two medium size zoom lenses , a long # mm f/ # . # , a <unk> , a flash , and some miscellaneous cords , filters , and stuff this bag has plenty of room for all of it and some space to spare it feels comfortable when i wear it with all my stuff in it and hike around it has some exterior pockets for getting at some extra things quickly i also use the <unk> on the <unk> to hold my jacket all in all its very nice
lots of useful space with <unk> dividers got two cameras with chargers , books , lenses , etc . in this back pack seems well built but not as heavy of fabric as more expensive models
this is a great backpack i switched to a backpack for my camera gear , because i usually carried one in addition to my camera bag anyway i have had to be a little more economical with the personal items that i carry , but all in all , this backpack has more than enough room i carry # camera bodies , # lenses , # x converter , and an extra flash inside the pack it also has room for my camera manuals , several rolls of film , notebook , and pen on the outside i usually strap my tripod or monopod with the provided straps for the money , you will not find a better backpack anything that compares is at least one hundred dollars
this backpack is a really nice organizer and protector on the inside easy to locate items once you are inside the bag the zippers to the front lid and main lid are a bit deceiving but , i will get pass that by <unk> . : -- rrb- -lrb- deceiving because they both appear to open the main compartment .
- sturdy - can hold many lenses - <unk> - compartments are not suitable for all items - not the best if you need just # <unk> carry snacks , <unk> , candy etc in the compartments but its difficult to carry a nice big book
i am currently traveling around europe and have found that this is a must need for all travelers i was in a crowded london <unk> tube stop and felt someone tug at my camera bag thankfully the strap on bag held that night i went home and bought this bag since then i have traveled around quite a bit and have felt confident in the strength of the bag the pockets inside are adjustable and can easily hold a bottle of water if needed the only reason why i did n't rate this bag with # stars is because i feel the bag needs a lock call it <unk> , but in europe some people will steel anything you have on you , it does n't matter if it 's in your pocket or not i am using a tsa -lrb- airport luggage lock -rrb- lock and it has been working great i hope this helps your <unk>
its great everything as described the green accents are a little bit darker than they seem in the picture slightly disappointed there , but the compartments and everything is perfect fits camera , lens , wires , and laptop and much less bulky than the previous bag
this is a great backpack if you are starting out and do n't have a lot of accessories i have my camera body -lrb- rebel xsi -rrb- and # lenses all of which fit in this backpack with ease i also carry a battery grip , extra battery , off camera flash and macro extender in the backpack the tripod holder along the bottom is not very comfortable if you will be walking alot if i am going walking with the bag , i hang the tripod in one of the side holders and it is great i carry paperwork , cheat sheets , etc in the front compartment everything fits easily into this bag i am glad that i purchased it
this canon bag goes very well with my canon rebel xti camera with the other # lenses i have for it the zippered pockets are great and can hold a lot of things even though they are just one big pocket and does not have any compartments to sort things out to get your camera out you have to lay the bag flat on its back , -lrb- so the backpack straps are touching the ground -rrb- in order to <unk> something bag into the bag this gets very annoying especially when you are taking sport pictures of someone running by you and you need to grab another lens
bag has lots of storage heavy duty zippers the only reason i did n't give it five stars is it 's not super comfortable for me because i 'm # ' # my wife loves it she is # '
this bag is great it holds my canon rebel , # lenses and also my little point and shoot digital i have all of my booklets for each camera in the zip compartments along with an extra battery and memory the only drawback to date is the length ; it is a little long on me as i am a short female i have to keep the straps as short as possible
the bag is great the quality is very nice the bag has good storage i fit my canon xs a # mm lens , a canon point and hd camcorder and all the chargers tapes batteries i still have storage space the bag is a little to big just to carry around for everyday stuff i think it is a great vacation camera bag
i got it a couple years back and the bag served very well for its purpose i just changed because i could n't fit my # . # inch screen laptop in it it is also not well padded as compared to the expensive ones , specially the shoulder straps but it comes with organizing panels to <unk> any need i used to carry # flashes , # d with # mm lens on it . # mm f # l my sony <unk> # hdd camera with video light attached to it and accessories and chargers
i 've taken this along for everything from wedding shoots to family functions and am able to carry everything i need it 's super roomy for a fairly small backpack i can fit two bodies , three lenses , a flash , flash <unk> and accessories , and all of the batteries and card needed to get me through a day long shoot the outer pockets have plenty of space for maps , instructions , car keys , etc . , so there 's no need to carry an extra bag or purse , which is a huge bonus the only downside that i 've come across is that the zipper pull tabs come off easily i 've had to take pliers to them to keep them from falling off
good bag for the price my # d with batter grip was a bit of a tight fit , but swapped the direction of the inside camera compartments , which worked better has a decent amount of external storage space
the <unk> thing that i liked about this bag at first was the fact that it was canon branded and that it was priced very well after a week of average use one of the <unk> broke , i got a rma and returned it , a week later i had a brand new bag after that i have had no issues the bag has areas for all my lens and a pocket for my charger and usb cable that prevents the camera from getting damaged <unk> transport i am very happy
the pictures on the site make this bag seem slightly larger than it actually is all compartments within can be taken apart and re assembled to you specifications as needed it seems like it will take a beating and the material does not seem cheap compared to the amazon basics bag i feel as if i will be using this bag for the next year and eventually upgrading but is still a good buy
the backpack was a little smaller than i had thought probably # the size of a typical <unk> type backpack the small size fit nicely under the airline seat in front of me but that said it was plenty roomy for all of my gear it is comfortable to wear while i like that it has a tie down to attach my tripod it is n't secured to the `` frame `` of the pack itself so it swings a bit which will be annoying on a long hike overall a fantastic bag for the money
so happy i bought this bag i was keeping my eos slr in a laptop bag it is perfect for carrying not only camera equipment but all the extra <unk> / etc . . i use it basically as the bag to carry all of my electronics on trips now -lrb- even the kids ' ds in the front pocket -rrb- ca n't go wrong
this bag is well made but is geared for light equipment use only do n't expect to put any eos camera larger than the rebel with some heavy lenses such as ef # mm f/ # . # is usm lens
this is a fantastic bag i love the way my camera slips so easily into the top - just ready to grab out at any time easily adjusts to fit all of my equipment including my # lil point and clicks as was mentioned before , it could be improved with some interior straps but i do n't open my bag too <unk> anyway this bag was so worth the expense and has made my shoots so much easier -lrb- i also like the fact that it just looks like an ordinary backpack - reducing its attraction to thieves -rrb-
the backpack has a lot of space inside to keep all your accessories organized i was able to hold # small soda bottles in one of the pockets i like the fact that it has a strap to hold a tripod overall i 'm pleased with the product
as simple as they come , but it does the job i 've been using this bag for over a year now it fits my filters , # lenses , a a <unk> burning drive and two flash units still room for several <unk> , etc . the only minor complaint is ther is no great way to strap a small tripod to the backpack i used the small straps on the side , but the straps broke through the plastic fasteners that were holding them on i 'm now getting creative with the <unk> laces on the back of the bag that said , i really did n't expect a backpack at this price point to be as good as it is so # . # stars
i had gotten the new # is lens and it would n't fit in my old bag with my flash , film , other lenses , etc . i ordered this the price was right compared to others i looked at i am very pleased i only wish there was a strap to strap my tripod to the side but could n't beat it for the money
excellent for the price i used this pack for a photo class and was able to get all my gear -- <unk> camera , three lenses , batteries , and lots of other stuff -- in the pack and it was comfortable to carry seems to be good quality construction and just a good deal would recommend to those using for short trips and light <unk> .
this is a great looking backpack and love that it 's by canon fits my # d with ef # mm zoom lens attached and no worries about protection i actually wish they had one slightly smaller as it has a little too much room than i need very well made and definitely worth the money
this is a very nice bag to carry your camera 's in i have my # d mark ii and my eos # cameras in this bag along with # canon flashes in this bag i also have # lenses of various size and room for more this is a very good carrier and <unk> for the money
i read alot of the reviews before buying the backpack and thought `` how could i go wrong `` the bag is everything that the reviews say it is a lot of room and great <unk> with the movable compartments every thing is held in place while you travel <unk> my only problem with it is my canon # d with the <unk> # battery grip does n't fit it <unk> the zipper too much i 've never taken the two apart since i 've owned them now i have to in order to get the camera , lens and grip packed away i do n't know how the larger body cameras fit , but i thought canon would think of <unk> like this when designing the # eg other that that , it is well worth the amazon price for the quality you get
i am `` professional amateur `` and to help <unk> my <unk> into photography , i bought this bag to store and organize my photo equipment its got alot of pockets and removable walls to allow for different sizes and configuration its lightweight , sleek , and very durable the only drawback is if you open it the wrong way do n't open the backpack while its standing up your equipment will fall out and make you cry make sure you open it flat on its back each time other than that , great bag for the
i looked at the same item in the canon site and it was way more expansive than at amazon this will protect your gear and take a lot of it in one trip the only thing you have to keep in mind it that you will not have space in this <unk> for a laptop or anything like that i actually carry my tablet in the outer pocket and works
i like this backpack i 've had it about # months now the straps that were supposed to hold the tripod do n't really work easily , and that is my only real complaint
plenty of room in the bag for whatever you got plenty of outside straps to carry whatever else you got material is n't great quality , but very sturdy best camera backpack for the price
the backpack has space for all my equipment and seems to be built well the shoulder straps seem to fit a little funny , but other than that it works for what i use it for
this is a great backpack for your camera , extra lenses , and other gadgets i have a dslr and # lenses , an extra battery , and there is still plenty of room to spare however , i am only giving it # stars because it is so big that i hate to take it out of the house i am looking to buy a smaller bag that will only hold # extra lens so that maybe i will be willing to take my camera with me great for storage at home though or maybe if you are going somewhere that you need multiple lenses , but i usually only need # at any given time
weigh your needs i do n't mean put it on a scale , i mean see what you have and how you will use it before you press the `` buy `` button it 's a big bag ! ... if you are the casual photographer who will only have # lenses and the few accessories it 's a small bag ! ... if you have a mess of telephoto <unk> and a tripod to carry with you wherever you go one small strange complaint i have -lrb- <unk> -rrb- is the `` canon `` <unk> on the bag if you 're traveling in a country with say a slight theft problem , you may not want to advertise that you have $ # 's worth of material on your back for them to mug you over so you may want to pry it off before traveling or place a sticker over it it would also be nice for it to have individual pouches for <unk> , and <unk> lenses but perhaps that would make it too specialized and not so generic for a wider audience it 's a good bag - soft inside and sturdy outside and for the price - you really ca n't build one as decent with a hot glue gun and foam buy it - but only if you need it
the canon # eg backpack for their eos cameras is an exceptional value if you have different lenses you want to carry and want them available yet have your arms free from carrying a camera bag , i readily recommend this product it easily handles many different sizes of lenses for your money , you can not beat this product if you want to carry your camera and lenses and feel confortable about your investment being well protected the only drawback i found is i feel it does not come with enough elastic straps to keep everything in place , but this is easily corrected with a visit to a nearby fabric store
overall , i am pleased with the backpack being able to adjust the compartments to the exact size needed was an extra added bonus it fell a little short on space , the pictures made it `` look `` bigger and roomier , so i had to really <unk> on packing everything in still , it was a great deal on a great product
i 've had this backpack for a month and i can say that it 's a really good choice compared to other similar models the price is lower and the quality is quite good the only drawback is that i can not put my laptop inside there is simply no space for it overall i 'd recommend this to anyone who is looking for a backpack to carry a dslr body , # mid size lenses and a flash
plenty of room for camera and # lenses that came in kit , plus one large # mm manual focus lens , plus all the extras ; batteries , sd cards , lens filters , etc . plus has a place to attach tripod i was hoping it would be waterproof enough to give protection when <unk> probably will , unless the boat turns over , which is always a possibility when <unk> appears to be well made and well designed
i ordered this bag in january # and have used it on several trips it is a great bag because it holds my # lenses , xti camera body , speedlite and other accessories with room to spare the padding on the straps make them very comfortable , and if you really need the <unk> , there is a small chest strap ... nothing like a backpacking strap , but it does its job the only complaint i had was the `` tripod strap `` on the bottom of the pack the straps were not quick release snaps , but rather the kind you have to pull to loosen or tighten i had a quick fix for this by going to walmart and getting the same width straps and some quick release buckles about $ # and # minutes later , i had a pack that i was very happy with
this is a great product have used it with many different lenses and with my camera body the only part of it that i think should be different and better is the zipper , which could be more heavy duty i have enjoyed using this when traveling and when going on hikes you can fit a lot of equipment in it
it 's roomy and light enough for long hauling with few <unk> lenses with three separate compartments and plenty of velco dividers , they are good to store several short and long lenses i used the longest , middle compartment to keep a very big canon tele lens with camera attached only negative feature i 'd complain about is the <unk> that 're too many and long , creating a untidy look
seems to be a very well made pack it has held up for a year . still going strong , very well made in my opinion perfect for the hobbyist or professional use
backpack is pretty well designed and wears nicely only problem i have with it is the area in which we carry the canon mark ii and canon # is lens the camera area could be a little deeper and better padded plenty of room for extra lenses , filters <unk> , etc . overall , worth the money
this bag will easily hold your camera , lenses , flash meters i recently took it on a trip to yosemite national park , it was great having all of my lenses and filters at my finger tips the bag is well padded and roomy the only problem is there is no easy way to carry a full size tripod or monopod i would recommend this bag to anyone who wants to carry more than just the camera and one lens
this has a huge amount of storage space , looks awesome , and is decently comfortable the backpack by itself is very heavy when walking long distances , and honestly wish we would have gone with a <unk> style case no <unk> though , because the price was great anyway would love to know if anyone has <unk> for other styles of carrying cases that are light and comfortable to carry also wondering about more comfortable straps than the oem canon strap its a little rough on the
after buying this product i was happy good amount of space in it the canon label on top of the bag went off but apart from that all was fine though i have not ever taken it in the rain but <unk> are fine for this bag
bought this bag and loved the features for the price tried to put my canon # d <unk> # in it with battery grip attached and it was able an inch or so too short i really wanted be able to use this bag but i will , most of the time , have the grip attached took back to store and starting over i do n't really want to put $ # - $ # into a bag so if you can use it , great bag for a great price . $ # in my neck of the woods
this backpack has a lot of usable protected space for the money i 'm finding that i can pack what i need for a particular outing and still have plenty of room left for those extras i never seem to be able to leave at home the price is very fair and my equipment feels very secure even when not packed to the gills
i bought this to house camera and video equipment it serves the purpose perfectly as long as you are <unk> this bag to one set-up , you will love it however , if you have an idea that this bag could be used to carry several different camera <unk> based on the day , you will be a bit disappointed the inside compartments can be moved around , but the velcro is cumbersome , and too much changing about leaves things looking ragged so , if you have one camera and a set number of lenses that you always use , this is for you if you want to use this one bag and change out your cameras and lenses for the particular shoot , it will disappoint
this bag , although not perfect , is really a bargain it is avery large , well built bag i have been wanting a good camera bag for a couple of years , but did not want to pay $ # + for one of those lowepro bags it goes without saying that the lowepro bags are more sturdy , and i believe they are the better bags however , i highly recommend this bag for those , like me , on a budget i love mine
while this bag has a ton of room to fit most of my gear , it is still small for my body frame and i look a dorky wearing this thing the straps are n't long enough and it looks <unk> to my body but not everyone is as big as me if you 're a smaller person , this bag will be perfect for you if you can fill a door you walk though , have been employed as a <unk> , are a <unk> on the weekends , big <unk> , or just plain fat , consider something a bit larger
you ca n't get much better bags for a price like this really a great bag for someone with a lot of lenses or gear plenty of pockets all around and you can move the felt walls around to accommodate your gear nice and soft inside for your <unk> also nice that your camera does n't have to rest on the bottom where you put it down everywhere
i love this bag ... makes it easy for me to carry around my camera where i go its well made lots of pockets and the flexibility of the inside walls makes it easy to put just about any variety of cameras and lenses the only thing i would change about it is the side and under straps they should be clips and not slide straps makes it hard to quickly attach and <unk> a tripod
this backpack style camera bag is roomy enough for all your camera gear , plus a <unk> and lunch the adjustable interior padded dividers allow great <unk> no matter what the shapes of all your gear the exterior is good-looking and rugged
yes this holds our dslr and lenses with room for wallets , etc . there 's also enough room to hold diapers for # kids , <unk> , snacks , toys , etc without spilling anything wish i had thought of this years ago would recommend for any parent zippers and buckles do appear a little cheap , had to use pliers to keep the zipper pulls attached after a couple months but , for $ # it 's certainly no worse than any other backpack i 've used in that price range if you had several camera bodies and more than # lenses , i might consider something more specialized all said , a great bag that i 'd happily recommend
all in all , this is a great backpack it is not too big , but you can carry your slr plus various lenses the camera is really protected inside this backpack
this bag is an all around great bag perfect size and more than enough room for equipment as a beginning photographer i am very pleased with this purchase
the bag arrived before i anticipated , was in great condition it had more than enough compartments , very durable i have another shoot coming up , & i 'll be taking it out again
inexpensive and very useful my three most commonly used lenses , my camera body and lots of accessories fit with room to spare the bag is comfortable for long hikes and urban shooting too
i 'm not going to say much , because there are hundreds of reviews for this backpack read one of those reviews for details the backpack is nicely built , good looking , does its job , and holds alot of stuff it 's great for anybody sure there may be a few cheaper , but this is canon name brand , and top of the line i give it # stars
well constructed bag , easily customizable i find the shoulder straps to be a little uncomfortable it holds quite a bit but is smaller than i expected in the default configuration my canon # d with battery grip does not fit it is too tall to close the zipper if you flip around the whole set of inserts it fits but the dividers stick up its a great bag for traveling when you arent taking all your gear , but doesnt work as a place to store all your stuff when not using it if you have quite a bit overall i would recommend this bag for a small travel backpack
i own two of these my first bag is # years old and is still perfectly functional i got a second bag because the first bag worked so well and i needed more space for extra gear the build quality is very good and comparable to more expensive models from other bag manufacturers i regularly carry a bag full of glass and these have not failed on me after so many years of travel the inner compartment is fully customizable easily fits a canon # d <unk> with # . # lens
for the price this is a great item , i paid a lot more for a smaller bag from some other camera company i use this quite often and it can take a beating while protecting my equipment you will not be let down with this one
it 's the best bag i 've seen for under $ # bucks let alone under # it 's a perfect bag for a camera , two or three lenses , and a flashes it 's got plenty of pockets and storage spots for things like batteries , memory cards , filters , etc . when my wife and i decided to get a second camera the only thing we did n't have to think about what what bag do we want
why did i every carry around a camera bag this holds not only my canon # d , but my <unk> camcorder , and power supply and chargers , and extra lenses , etc . , etc . only thing that will not fit is my # zoom telephoto
this backpack was excellent for my canon rebel xti i have plenty of room to hold my xti and plenty of lenses and accessories too it is also way easier to carry and keep up with than the ordinary carrying cases i give this product a # -star rating
i really just needed a travel bag to keep everything i ordered this because it was cheap , $ # , and looked like it had enough space i was n't expecting much , but was surprised when it arrived the material was a lot nicer that i expected it feels pretty rugged , not flimsy at all i do n't expect to go hiking or anything with it for a cheap carry-all it fit the bill perfectly
i love this backpack it was perfect for our recent # <unk> trip to italy i held all our camera equipment , as well as other necessary items i needed to carry with kids in tow would definitely recommend if you have a lot of camera equipment you need to transport
this bag is durable and the right size for us with only a few lenses a back pack is very convenient with the little ones we are trying to photograph
i love this backpack it has sooo much room inside we can fit our camcorder , canon rebel xti and all of the accessories inside neatly it also holds our tripod along the bottom
was much cheaper on line than in store like the pack so far and seems well built used on a couple of trips with all the stuff and have not one complaint will see how it holds up over a years time however canon items usually are top stuff , i love camera stuff , so this should be no different lots of <unk> for storage and all the extras
i read the other reviews and was a bit skeptical of it i bought it because of the price but also because i 'm new to photography and had nothing else to compare it with if fits both of my lenses and camera and i have a lot of room for other things
how did i ever do without it i had a very cramped bag and now i have a bag that has more room than i know what to do with of course now i 'm doing my best to fill it !
this is by far one of the best pieces of equipment i have bought for my camera setup to date i am really glad to have a quality pack ot carry my camera around in i recommend this for anyone who will be carrying there equipment and doesnt want to get it damaged in the process
pros -- configurable compartments - tons of pockets and straps - looks good - good price , cheaper than stores i went to cons -- no `` obvious `` place to hook on a tripod , but this is very minor - i accidentally ordered `` rush `` shipping which <unk> up my price a bit
i use this to keep all my gear in one place , its a pain if you need to get to it fast because you have to lay it down and pull the zipper open to get to it if you hike or travel alot with it its a pain because of the gear that it holds and it becomes heavy , no room for a laptop or storage for other
nicely done , worth the money i have paid i have inside k # d with grip on , # kit lenses , # . # , # <unk> <unk> other accessories needed zippers glide , shoulder straps ok there is still place for # lenses one <unk> though , waist belt too thin
as my collection of photo gear has continued to grow -lrb- multiple bodies , lenses , flashes and accessories -rrb- , the capacity of my carrying cases has grown increasingly inadequate the canon photo backpack came along just in time and was a great value i read the reviews and decided to take my chances , in spite of a few who claimed it was n't very sturdy i have found it entirely satisfactory for my purposes , which includes carrying two dslr bodies , five lenses , flash , a tripod or monopod on the outside , and lots of additional small accessories the zippers and <unk> are all sturdy and sound i have easy access to the inside , and the compartment dividers are easily positioned to cradle lenses , bodies , etc . in all , this is a fine product at a great price
canon deluxe photo backpack # eg for canon eos slr cameras -lrb- black with green accent i am happy with the backpack it <unk> my camera bag and i use it all the time it 's big enough for my # d and four lenses , plus a point and shoot backup camera and all the <unk>
i bought this canon camera bag for a second camera i was buying i also have a lowepro that cost nearly three times as much and there is little difference , except the lowepro is <unk> excellent compartment layout and all changeable to suit your needs and products not a bad camera bag at all there is only one downside and that is you are advertising what you have in the bag it is marked canon in their logo you 'll need to keep an eye on it in airports etc .
i use this weekly it 's my go-to camera bag , and i carry all of my daily kit it 's great for a medium or large slr and several lenses i also carry charging cables , a shooting clamp , spare batteries , etc .
first of all , i did n't keep this pack i eventually got a tamrac # the canon pack is very well made and holds lots of gear that was the problem , it held too much you had to zip the entire front cover open to get at your gear and to be frank i wanted something for # body , # or # lens and that was it the tamrac also has a large area on top for a jacket , <unk> & j sandwich , etc . on the plus side for the canon , it holds everything , is a great price , and can hold a tripod -lrb- no provision on the tamrac -rrb- for those that want to carry everything this is a great pack it seems <unk> to wear , is well made , and as usual , amazon ships immediately
i usually carry a back with me with my newly purchased camera and lenses , it was hard to carry both the backpack and the camera bag with this canon deluxe <unk> backpack , i 'm now able to combine everything into one backpack i 'm planning on <unk> this with me on my upcoming international trip
i just received the canon backpack camera bag and i am really happy with it i am not a professional photographer ... just have a canon rebel eos camera with a couple of lenses and a small camcorder everything fits great with plenty of room to tuck in whatever else our family may need for a sporting event , school concert , etc . very comfortable to wear - would be great for moms or <unk> who need their hands free to manage little ones love it ! ! !
just purchased this backpack and it was exactly what i was looking for i just purchased a # mm that would n't fit in my shoulder bag with everything else , and this backpack does that plus more now i can fit all three of my cameras in it along with lenses , flashes , <unk> , cleaning supplies , filters , laptop , tripod , and some magazines although with all that stuff , it can get somewhat heavy , it 's still comfortable with thick padding strongly recommended , great price for size
