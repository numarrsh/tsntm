the case is good does the job with protecting and i like the grip it does show fingerprints but it is n't hard to clean at all i bought it in black so that might be one of the reasons why it shows the marks overall , satisfied with the purchase especially for the price
i bought a more expensive version of this from the apple store a while back it cracked in many places within two months despite being transported and stored in a cushioned macbook air carrier so , i decided to try this less expensive version and am glad i did the feet on the bottom look a bit cheap -lrb- are just white foam pads -rrb- but for $ # + shipping i am perfectly happy the yellow color is great and the fit is perfect
it came sooner then i was expecting , the color is <unk> and it has absolutely no imperfections it just came a little dirty , but i cleaned it so its all ok i recommend it
the clips are a little finicky , but for the price i do n't mind having to <unk> them over the edge of my laptop every so often very good color and size is perfect
i just purchased a new # & # # ; and wanted to keep it protected i am pleased with the material and design i am even more please with the company i bought it from in amazon i initially received an older version and they immediately took care if the mistake and replaced i would buy from them again
it works no problem with taking it on and off matter fact the top has came off a <unk> of time it works for now oh yeah there is access to all the ports
fits perfectly , they resolved the issue of it being a pain to remove rubber leg fell off . . that sucks at least they are n't the cheap <unk> ones other people described if it had n't fallen off i 'd have given it all # stars
the color is absolutely gorgeous my only complaint is that there were no instructions so i put the top cover on backwards the first time and did n't realize it for a while
i just bought my macbook # & # # ; and this case fits it , except for the left side , it does n't quite snap on all the way otherwise i have n't had any problems with it and it looks great
i love the color of this case , a sort of translucent tiffany blue , but when it arrived , there were some <unk> light spots on the top part of the case otherwise , it 's easy to snap on to my macbook air
it 's kind of heavy , it adds noticeable weight to my macbook air also , even though i love the material it is made out of , almost everything sticks to it and this case is really hard to take off but those are my only complaints , it is a very solid case -lrb- and it 's stylish , too !
received it very quickly , it 's soft and i love the color does n't look like cheap plastic , it 's actually very similar to the speck one they sell at apple and for the price , it 's great very pleased : -rrb- -- have n't tried taking it out yet so idk how difficult it will be that 's why i did n't give # stars , but so far it 's just what i was looking for
i had the moshi <unk> which cost $ # and lasted about # months before the corners cracked and the feet fell off i have n't had this case as long , but i love it so far i would happily give it # starts , but the clear case shows oil from your hands and has to be cleaned i really do n't mind it , but it is noticeable enough that i ca n't ignore it either the texture is better than the moshi and allows for a more confident grip on my mba # the fit is fantastic i would recommend that topcase leave out the cheap mouse pad it cheapens the experience of an otherwise solid product not to mention , it 's an environmental waste as nobody that has a mba needs a mouse pad
i <unk> i purchase it i would have purchased it when i brought my <unk> was six time more price but on <unk> affordable price and laptop is safe very pretty and fully protected my
i really like this case the color is great and it fits the laptop very well i like the ventilation slats on the bottom as it keeps the laptop from getting too hot best part is it 's so much cheaper than those speck case the only part i think could be better are the foam feet on the bottom wish they were rubber and a little sturdier i feel like they will rip over time other than that i 'm very happy with purchase
case was delivered on time and as expected it snapped on easily the bottom of the case has slipped off a few times , but easily snaps back on the case definitely gets the job done lots of fun colors
pros : the plastic is of high qualify feels good and looks not cheap . cons : it is very easy to put the case on after a while , i finally was able to put it on
i got another case for my macbook before , but the quality of that case was n't good so i bought the rubberized case this time it works perfectly and its quality is really good even though it is hard to take it off , but generally it is better than i have expected
easy to put on my mac air it does n't seem heavy but i was surprised at the difference in the weight to my mac after adding it i still plan on using it
although it served well for its purpose , this tends to have some marks on the macbook all in all it is good to have it , but multiple times removal might cause problems
no instructions come with this case the top piece has two tabs on one side and three on the other be sure to hook the two tab side over the top edge of the screen -lrb- top when open -rrb- first , then snap the three tabs onto the lower back the price is right but be careful or you will mar your new air i snapped the lower side on first and could not get the top to catch on one side and it was very difficult to pry the tabs up again without scratching the case or the computer would have given it # stars if not for this aggravation
i like that this product is easy easy to put on the laptop the grey color is a bit bland ; but it is true to the picture i just thought i 'd be happier with a muted , practical color no fault of the maker though - as i said the color is true to the picture i like the slimness and that it 's lightweight
it arrived on time and it 's beautiful fits perfectly to the macbook air # `` it arrived with some minor scratches on it , but in general it 's a good product in good price i do recommend it -lrb- if there were an option , i would 've added pictures of it i do n't know why some say it does n't fit , it did fit perfectly immediately , and it 's still on
well when i first got the case , i was a little disappointed , it was plastic instead of a hard rubber i tried to put the bottom part on , but the back tabs did not snap on it finally fit after hours of struggling , but then a week later i started to see cracks on the corners of he bottom piece yes , i had to put my laptop in my bag for school , but i did not put it there carelessly , nor did i throw my backpack around carelessly so i kept <unk> why i received cracks in the corners two days ago , the corners on the bottom set of the case started to chip slightly , and it has n't even been two or three weeks since i have had this case just a few minutes ago , a very visible piece of my right corner chipped off it was n't very big to make me remove my case completely and buy a new one , but it was a fairly large portion of the case compared to the small chips the large chip being the cause of this review i guess i could expect this much from a case that was n't even $ # , but i do not recommend this case to anyone who was looking for something sturdier or shatter proof
this case was great i loved the texture and everything but one thing is that it can get dirty really easily , and the oil stains are really obvious on this case
great little case no problems getting it on or off seems sturdy and at least makes the mb air a little less delicate great price , nothing else close to it on the market
it does the job but does n't fit perfectly even more annoying than the fit is the fact that it absorbs any lotion i might have on my hands and no matter what cleaner i try , the hand prints are permanent but for the cost , it does what i need as far as protection so for the most part i 'm satisfied with the
i have a similar case so i bought this one for my mother when i was snapping it on to the macbook , it was very difficult it was like i had to stretch it , like rubber , as ironic as that sounds i had to unsnap to <unk> at a different starting point , so if it would n't go completely on from starting at the top , i <unk> from the bottom , but stretching was a must it fits the new macbook air bought in march # that 's all that matters
i really liked this case in the beginning it helps protect the edges and surfaces from dings and scratches however , the bottom piece slowly began chipping and breaking and is now at the point where it does n't clasp onto the bottom of my computer anymore the top piece i still use but both pieces developed a little discoloration towards the edges i think for the price though they are a great deal and they come in so many colors , why not i would recommend this item just know that eventually they will need replacing
i <unk> this case if removal was easier though , it would get five stars the four white corners at the bottom get <unk> in somewhat easily if they 're on a rugged surface
fit my new macbook air perfectly -lrb- # -rrb- it has an awesome , vibrant blue color -lrb- i got the aqua -rrb- and it seems very well made took a star off because the white feet on the bottom do seem a bit cheap but hey its the bottom so no one looks there and it does n't bother me that much overall , a well made case it looks like it 'll definitely protect it from scratches and stuff , but i 've only had it for about half an hour so we 'll see love it so far though
looks great and easy to install to my macbook air i had a red one , which is great too it 's a bit a challenge to removed - i used one of my hotel key card -lrb- you can use grocery <unk> card or <unk> card -rrb- , slide to side to the <unk> and pop it out i would definitely recommend this to my friends
this case was just what i needed to keep my macbook air clean and protect it from any scratches it stays put and so far has n't caused any issues the only downside is that it stains easily and you can see fingerprints or smudges however i 'm using this case for protection purposes and not decorative purposes so i would rather see the case be smudged and not my air it makes my laptop a little heavier but that is to expected good purchase and recommend it
i bought this thinking that it would be a transparent cover - the image seems to show the apple logo shining through the case was well packaged and well made but completely opaque since you ca n't see any of the stickers on my air i 'm returning the item
i love it great color , looks better in person sharpie does not last very long on it , but i 'm sure not everyone would be using it to write on it haha
i was worried about this case based on the mixed reviews regarding the fit and quality of the case , but i did n't have any issues i have a new macbook air and i wanted something to protect it from scratches and day to day wear i also wanted something that would make my mac look a little different than everyone else i chose the grey case and it provides just enough <unk> to make my mac different from the standard without making me feel # with a bubble gum pink case the grey is much better in person - in the pic it looks almost brown all in all i 'm satisfied and would purchase from topcase in the future . * this case will not protect your computer if dropped
product is as advertised and a great cover for the macbook air i 've been using it for a couple of months now and it 's holding along pretty well it fits nicely and the tabs holding it to the laptop are <unk> , unlike other brands where your wrists would touch the plastic tabs , resulting in a poor and annoying experience i 'd definitely recommend this
over all i am happy with the item , for the price its very fair , i still have to see if it will cause the system to overheat , sine no real
bought this for my girlfriend 's macbook air and it looks great had a difficult time getting both pieces on the bottom to clip onto either side but it is definitely not coming off now so no complaints
great case ! it slides off once in a while but it is a nice silicone material . easy for carry and allows my computer to not slip out of my hands
i really like this case i got it in hot pink , and it looks awesome the price was great , however , the case is somewhat lose it also came with come spots on it that wo n't come off , but nothing very noticeable would definitely buy again . :
the top piece could fit a little better it does n't slip off or anything though - just could be a bit better i just got tired of it and took it off it was just too think for the mac air i will be looking for something slimmer
it snapped on easily the first time and does n't impact usability of my # macbook air at all i kinda wish i did n't order black only because it looks <unk> like a pc when closed , but it protects the computer and it is easier to grab i would definitely order this kind again and would recommend it
i have a decal on my mac and i need a case because this is a school computer the last case i got did n't show my decal at all i really wanted the purple color but i do n't know if i will be able to see my decal through it if there are any other colors that are semi transparent that would help if someone could identify them for me
i really like this case the only drawback with the black is that becasue it 's rubberized it leaves finger smudges and are hard to wipe off i 'm thinking of getting one of the bright colors
it 's lighter than the speck rubberized casing and this is one definitely has less of a grip to it but it 's a great price in a great color only downside is that the bottom casing slides forwards when you open your macbook the feet protect it from scratching the bottom , but it still counts as a design flaw overall an excellent bargin
i purchased the cover for my macbook air and it is perfect for what i need the tiffany blue color is beautiful and the fit is great ... so good , that i have a hard time taking the case off top case provides superb customer service the corner of the top part of the case cracked off during shipping and top case sent out a new case immediately unfortunately , the second case came with a smaller piece cracked off again i did n't bother asking for another replacement because the piece that came off was not big enough to make a difference in the protection of my computer and is barely noticeable perhaps better shipping wrap may help with the cracking of the case the cover has a smooth silicon feel to it and compared to the other covers that my colleagues have purchased from other amazon companies , i feel like i made a good choice there are no elevated feet to the bottom like other covers but it does n't seem like my computer overly heats up despite the fact
overall , it 's a really great case ; it fits on nicely and it 's secure my only problem is that it covers the microphone on the side of my macbook air -lrb- # `` -rrb- , so when i record , i have to take off the bottom case it 's not a problem with video chatting or otherwise , the sound is just muffled when i record
this case is awesome it looks way more red in the picture than in person , but overall it does its job ... the silicone covering gives it a good grip when handling
i bought this for my wife 's new macbook air it fit well and looks great in orange it has a nice feel and is matte in finish i hope it holds up for awhile
very good case for my air # `` . i thought it was the transparent one and got little surprise when i open the bag . but it works fine and make my computer more
i bought this case at first , then i found the bottom case can not really fit in then i contact seller , they are really nice they did n't ask me mail the old one back but mailed me a new bottom case , and this time , really fits well
i got the green case -lrb- it 's more mint <unk> than anything -rrb- was pretty nice it took a bit of work to get all the clips in right but it 's a great product for it 's price it looks nice with the matching keyboard cover the clips did not break or snap like some other customers have complained about , i 'd advise you just use some <unk>
fits my # & # # ; macbook air perfectly color is as displayed online probably would n't hold up under rough wear-and-tear , so i also use the topcase sleeve bag case when carrying my laptop around <unk> rubber picks up dirt pretty easily and it hard to wipe completely clean
beautiful color and slim fits well for the <unk> and very happy with this case docked # star because one of the back corner tabs did not fit properly over the computer and after a while broke off as a result does not impede functionality because there are enough tabs holding it in place regardless
at first when i pulled it out of the box was very skeptical - it looked very cheap but after i put it on & used it for a few days i am very satisfied i would recommend
although the cover is fairly cheap , it still looks nice on my mac book air . it gives it a fun look and it fits completely around it i will probably buy another color soon and it can easily come off
this is the first case i 've bought for my macbook air # and it was pretty easy to assemble the only thing was that the top of the case does n't indicate which side goes towards the front and which side goes to the front , so i just guessed i 'm pretty sure i have it on right and it looks nice the purple is pretty with the <unk> contrast of the body of the laptop
this cover fits my # & # # ; macbook air well it was easy to put on and the color is true to the product images i only use the top half since i was worried the bottom half may result in overheating one con i 've discovered is that since it 's rubberized , it easily shows fingerprints and <unk> marks , making the case look dirty fairly quickly
i 've had this case for about a month and i 'm very satisfied with it i have not tried to take it off yet , but will probably use the credit card method it protects from scratches and i use a neoprene sleeve when i put it in my backpack does what i need it to i 'm happy
as others have mentioned , this covers the microphone ports on the left side of the unit i ended up taking a drill and drilling a small hole to <unk> it the plastic is not smooth and the plastic mold used to shape the case in its manufacturing process shows some distracting lines on the underside that detract from the overall look with that said , the finish is opaque and has a nice satin feel to it for the price , it covers my macbook whom i dont plan to stare at the lid for too long drilling a hole took about # minute to locate my tools and drill once done , it is perfectly usable and does its job decently
a little bit of fitting problem but not enough to create a problem very functional and seems to do the job i would prefer a little more texture to make it less likely to slip out of my hand was hoping for a more rubberized type grip
at first , when i got the case in the mail i was dissappointed by how fragile it seemed and how non see thru it was however when i put it on the mac book air ... it was great i really like it now it is super cute and when the computer is on you can definitely see the apple logo shining
does its job and looks good while doing it the only thing is that sometimes i have to push the little tabs on the sides back onto my lap top but it 's hardly an issue
very handsome hope it last longer than the cheep paint on corners take note the top cover goes on one way and one way only listen for the clicks would
the cover is great for the price and the tiffany blue color is really cute i do n't really think it is going to provide enough protection should i drop my computer , but it will protect it from daily wear and tear and scratches the product did not come with the rubberized keyboard cover as shown in its pictures
case fits fine on my macbook air # it has a nice matte look and feels great i just wished the white rubbers at the bottom came in the same color as the case other than that this is a great case for a wonderful price
my order actually arrived early and was describe in detail of sell purchase i love my case it 's really pretty and yellow the only problem is that the bottom case falls off , but otherwise it 's good
i was so excited about this , because the beautiful color reminds me of the ocean it 's a bit lighter than pictured but absolutely beautiful , it also got here a day sooner than expected which was nice the only problem was the the bottom casing was just a bit to small every part of it click on but the middle right ledge not a big deal , since it is still secure and may be able to get snapped on with a little more force it 'd be getting a perfect rating if it were n't for the small clipping issue if you have any doubts , just ignore them because this is adorable and worth the # bucks
this case is n't great quality , but it has already protected my beloved laptop from many chips and breaks it was hard to put on , though . do n't be afraid to press to hard when applying
i bought the pink case and the color is true to the picture another reviewer said it was a hot pink but mine looks like a soft pastel pink it looks so cute against the silver of my macbook air delivery was prompt installation was easy i took away a star because the inside of the top half was a little dirty considering the price , i 'm not too upset about it the case makes my macbook air look so chic and the rubberized texture feels cool
the price was right and i like the color of green <unk> for my macbook air it compared <unk> with the covers offered at the apple store for $ # to $ #
i have had this case now for a few weeks it came very quickly , but it came in an padded sleeve fortunately , it was not harmed upon delivery i was easy to put on , and looks very cute so far no issues with how it durable it is
the color was listed as hot blue and it is a deep turquoise i wanted it to protect the case from finger prints and scratches and it is fine for that i do n't plan to carry it around a lot so it 's perfect for what i want
i was n't expecting this case to be # % compatible with the # model of the macbook air , but it is as it has a hole for where the secondary microphone is located i love the bright yellow color of the case and how it has a nice surface the case itself does look very cheap looking , especially the feet , as it 's a foam however this case does it 's job at protecting my macbook
i love the case , the color , and the way it fits but my bottom piece broke after only one day the tabs that keep it on are n't very heavy duty
the case looks even better in real life than it does in the picture my wife has gotten several <unk> on the case the only complaint is that it can be hard to take off and that is probably not a bad thing
i use a viper booq case to carry my macbook air , and i thought this would just add a little additional protection as well as some stylish personalization it did , except the air wo n't fit in my viper case with this on it looks great though , and i 'm having difficulty choosing between keeping it and returning it
i love the tiffany blue color fit my mac well , easy to attach thought it would be more cushioned but for the price it 's perfectly fine wanted it for the color and to prevent scratches and i got what i wanted
i like the color and the rubbery feel of the cover i hope it protects the computer well the only problem is that not all the handles snap over the case but it still holds well
pretty good case love the frosted look and i love the fact that i can still see the decal that i added to my mac only dislike is that it holds a lot of fingerprint smudges besides that i 'm pretty <unk> of this case
only issue , the clips that hold the case onto the body could be a little bigger since they seems to pop off somewhat regularly , but there are enough of them it doesnt really matter would buy again and recommend
i just put this on my laptop and it took me about # seconds tops to put on i was worried based on other reviews with people fighting with the case just to get it on i had absolutely no issues i got the red case and i really like the color the apple icon shines nicely through which i like i also really like the grips on the bottom of the bottom case my only wish is that these cases came in patterns instead of just solid colors i would highly recommend this product
at first when i got it i thought it was too slim to hold on to the computer , but it turned out to be awesome love the feel of
i love the green color -lrb- sort of mint green -rrb- and it looks very sleek it does n't fit # % perfectly , but it stays on the & # # ; feet & # # ; on the laptop are two cheap white foam circles , so i 'm sure those will fall out soon it 's a good buy , but probably not a long-term solution
the case fits well and looks really good my only concern is the top seems to weigh down the top of my laptop screen however , everything else about the case was fine it snaps on and off easily , and i love that there are small styrofoam supports on the bottom for the laptop
love the color seems really clean only complaint is that i set a book with a leather binding on top of it and it marked into the case not sure why that happened there was no liquid involved i get lots of compliments on my case though it 's more cloudy then plastic looking so it has a softer appeal
maybe neon is your thing it 's not unattractive , but it 's pretty bright i just received it and it was easy to install i 'll add to my review if i ever & # # ; use & # # ; it
the rubberized hard case fit perfectly on my macbook air i think that it 's almost necessary to have one to protect your computer it does show smudges from , but they easily wipe off
my daughter asked for this and she loves it it looks nice on her computer i noticed the fit around a corner was n't ` perfect ' - but it is close enough great deal for the price was expecting it to arrive after christmas - it arrived the day before christmas - just in time ! !
i bought this case for my daughters new # & # # ; macbook air and it snapped on perfectly one downside is the visible fingerprints but she put a really cool decal on the front and you can barely notice them it protects her laptop nicely
this product covers the macbook air # but not the lid securely if you are planning to be mobile with your macbook & using this product the lid cover may fall off fortunately , my macbook does not leave the house so it works fine for me i purchased this to protect my macbook from scratches as i slide it across my desk etc . and it is perfect for that purpose the apple logo does shine through the cover when the unit is on
this case is great for the price only complaint is that sometimes the top piece starts to pop off when you unfold the top too quickly ultimately a great
rubberized case is nice looking and does protect my laptop from any scratches -lrb- drops i do n't know because i never dropped my laptop -rrb- the only thing that <unk> me was that the picture they show during <unk> the posting makes the case seem like it 's slightly see through and that the apple logo clearly shows up through the case when i did get the case i noticed that it was as pictured it was roughly the same color but the look of the case was more of a solid color and you can only see the apple logo when the laptop is on would of loved it more if it was made to be of a transparent case other than that i 'm happy with it
was looking for a case to protect my macbook from scratches after looking on apple 's website , i saw them , and thought that they were way overpriced i got this one for a quarter of the other price i have to say , it was much nicer than i thought it was going to be the color is beautiful , and it fits my laptop well however , it does make it about a pound heavier , and if you have a laptop sleeve then it 's a little harder to get in and out of this is a must-buy for anyone in the market for a laptop shell i highly recommend
i first bought this when i first got my macbook air over a year ago in purple it comes true to color and fits well it protects the computer and lasts a long time others cases may last # months tops and this one served about # months before the edges began to crack it does get dirty on the inside after a while in the corners so be sure to clean it overall , a good case i 'm buying myself another clear one i liked it so much
it 's good , from far away it looks like there is n't even a case on the laptop , which was the effect i was going for it feels cool too the only thing is that it 's almost impossible to take off
i loved the color it offers good protection without adding a lot of bulk this is a good cover if you like to carry your laptop but do n't want to add a lot of weight or bulk
the original case that was sent by seller did n't quite fit properly so i emailed seller with my issue they quickly sent in a replacement which fit like a glove i love the tiffany blue color and the soft feel of the case i am always getting compliments on it i would definitely order this product in other colors
this is a wonderful laptop case for the macbook air # . # & # # ; model a # the bottom was a bit difficult to attach to the bottom and i thought it would n't fit , but it snapped on eventually the top was easy to snap on the color is exactly like the picture -lrb- i got the & # # ; green , & # # ; but it 's more of a sea <unk> color , just like it looks in the photo really great laptop case to protect my macbook air
