the pink mcover is a perfect fit for my daughter 's new # -inch mac air she loves the color and style and i can be in better rest for the light weight protection , which to me is the most important for such a <unk> computer the delivery is fantastic : ordered monday and received today it fits the computer very well with no efforts and the snap feels strong and secure i am also very impressed with the speed that mcover for this new model of mac air came to the market thumb up for mcover
i 've been looking for a colorful macbook air case for a while now looking everywhere all i could find were $ # + cases that were so plain in color finally , i landed upon the ipearl cases ordered myself a pink case : -rrb- two days later i received my package , anticipation while opening , <unk> ~ was so happy about , great fit , good protection thank you again ipearl will be ordering again soon when needed !
i was sort of on the cutting edge by buying my macbook air before there were adequate accessories available for it there were plenty for the # `` but not for the # `` i waited a while and sure enough this product hit the market and its great i got the purple and just ordered another for my macbook pro # `` it was a little difficult to snap on , but maybe that 's because i also have a <unk> on it it looks great and protects my computer what 's not to love
i love this case and am very pleased with the purchase the case fits my macbook air absolutely perfect it is very secure and has not come off once i had no problems putting it on as some of the other reviewers had it 's sturdy and is not bulky at all so far it seems to be scratch resistant and i put my macbook in my purse so that 's saying something
this cover did exactly what it was supposed to do my laptop does n't get as warm so quickly either because of the way the bottom cover lifts it slightly off the desk and helps airflow worth the purchase
i chose this rating because in # i got my husband the red cover for his # inch macbook pro and he still has it on his computer so i ordered one for myself in pink this year -lrb- # -rrb- for my # . # inch macbook air and it is as expected , perfect
i love this case for my new macbook air first , i looked everywhere for a hard case and could not find one for the new # `` when i found this one , i could n't believe it was only $ # this is exactly what i was looking for it fits perfectly and is <unk> i love it whoever gave this product a bad review must just not like pink <unk> 's high heel
my goal for ordering this product was <unk> i wanted to protect my investment and personalize my macbook i want to say i do believe i 've met both of my goals with this product not only does the color and fit make my macbook look great , it has a good feel and fit that will protect it from scratches as well
this case is perfect for my # `` macbook air the color is vibrant , the fit is fantastic , and i absolutely love the fact that it has legs that fold out to allow for extra air flow and heat dissipation to keep my macbook cool and functioning well it 's the best case on the market for the tiniest of macbook airs
fits the macbook air like a glove matte finish to the plastic and apple logo shines through no issues with getting the case on , like others have described it doesnt add bulk to the computer no creaking when screen is adjusted highly recommend it i have purchases a second one in a different color
i got the case today and was able to pop it on in just a matter of seconds i love the feet at the bottom as it does help when i have my mac on the table removing can be done with a little more effort , i suggest using something to help pry off the bottom as it is kind of hard to take off but it is an excellent protector of my computer it is very light and doesnt add much size to the computer either still fits in my case
this case was everything i expected it 's thin and lightweight , yet i still fee like it provides great protection i had no trouble with the fit -lrb- as other reviewers have said -rrb- ; it <unk> on with no problem and provides a snug fit i love it and would recommend it to anyone another great buy from amazon
the lid piece snaps on and fits inside the rim , but the bottom is about # mm too short to get the rim of the bottom section to wrap up around the front there are two molded clips that grab the case by the <unk> area that seem to keep it from snapping fully in the front to the seller 's credit , i reported the issue and they sent me another bottom case , but it was exactly as the first one i broke off the tabs that seemed to be keeping it from sliding far enough forward and it helped slightly , but it still does n't fully seat you can squeeze the case and the edge of the laptop together and it snaps down , and you let go and it pops back up it will do for now , but i would not repurchase when the time comes
definitely a good case but not the best there is it 's a little flimsy but it fits pretty good im probably gon na go invest in a better one it did n't come with directions so i had to figure it out myself . . that sucked ! !
after using this for # months , i noticed the clips that hold the case onto the computer becoming loose now i need to check occasionally that the case does not come lose from the computer
this cover comes in great covers and protects your mac book air well i have had issue that after some use , the case slips off not to worry though , ipearl provides great customer service and sent me a free replacement quickly
while i see others have had some <unk> , i experienced none of those ... both pieces fit securely and it provides great protection for my macbook air # `` i did have one of the rubber `` feet `` come off shortly after purchase but as soon as i notified the vendor they sent replacement parts right away it took a while for anyone to come out with a cover for the macair # `` and this is a great , reasonable solution
the mac book air is so thin and this does not add much weight or size which is awesome such a pretty blue color and you can see the apple thru it it is a bit difficult to put on but it fits great overall it is great and i love it
i have had this product for about # weeks and it came package and sealed , the only compliant i had was that there was a long scratch on it when it arrived
although i absolutely love the color of this item , i found it incredibly hard to install on the macbook air the main reason i had so many problems is because the case came without a single word of instruction other than that , to date , i have n't had any issues
i purchased the aqua case and i love the color it fits very well and gave it a # rather than a # only because it was a bit difficult to put it on once it is on though , it 's perfect
i have to admit that the hard shell cover has been helpful i am less worried when i have to take my computer along with me i feel you want to beware of trauma more than anything but another thing that <unk> me and keeps me up nights -lrb- just kidding -rrb- is damage from water or rain the whole kit comes with a grid for the keyboard -lrb- useless -rrb- , and also a little plastic case with a handle i was very happy with the case but it began to fall apart eventually and i had to keep taping it up now it is falling apart along the edges of the buttons too , so will have to toss it eventually i give the shell a # % though and suggest that you buy another product to protect your computer from rain or water
this is the best case you are going to find its pretty durable and slim i think its a must to keep from scratching you macbook air only one complaint like other people mentioned : there are some rubber type tabs on the bottom that were not glued on very well they fell off after a month of use but they are n't very important at least in my opinion
this hard shell is attractive and protective it snapped on and has stayed on with no problem item arrived quickly and included a keypad cover which turned out to be very useful , also
light and sturdy protection for the # nd generation # `` macbook air it fits snugly and the little <unk> are more convenient than i thought they 'd be the front feet are rubber buttons that hold to the work surface much better than without the shell excellent ` insurance ' for the price
fits my # inch mac air perfectly . snaps in place easily not difficult to remove , but also stays on securely when computer is in use , or when being stored in a computer bag does not add bulk that would prevent the computer from easily zipping up in a snug fitting computer bag the aqua color is a pleasant shade i consider it very good quality of the price am happy to recommend this hard shell cover to most any one owning a # inch macbook air computer it was especially nice to also have the option of different colors that could be purchased of this hard sell case
i was looking for a good case that was not too expensive - and i am loving this ipearl hard shell i think i am getting the most bang for my buck with this case - solid , easy to put on , and stylish a girl could n't ask for anything more
product is somewhat of a challenge to properly attach , but one in place fits perfectly the seller contacted me requesting feedback my only complaint was that after about # week of use , one of the folding feet had lost some of the tension to keep it in the <unk> position this was more of an annoyance than a functional problem in my reply , i advised them about the foot , and they sent not , but two new feet which are easily replace great <unk> customer service
i love the color , and though i did n't think i would like the texture , the brick design has grown on me it is easy to snap on my macbook and seems to protect the case fairly well , despite the holes on the bottom for air flow the rubber stoppers have n't even fallen off yet , <unk>
the color looks great on my wife 's new # `` macbook air it fits perfectly , and does n't add much weight or thickness to the laptop time will tell how long the rubber feet will stay glued on , but for now all is good
love the color ... the cover fits perfectly and protects the laptop from getting all scratched up it 's light weight so it does n't affect the portability of the laptop of course ... it 's a great way to personalize the laptop too
i would recommend this product not only for the color selection but on the low price it was ordered and ship in under a weeks time this case help make my daughters lap top special since it was in her favorite color i like the fact that it helps protect my investment
goes on easy , protects my favorite electronic device , and it 's so attractive highly recommend for anyone who not only wants to protect their investment , but also wants to dress it up a little
i was concerned with some of the reviews that said the case was difficult to snap into place , but i had no troubles with it at all the cover is light enough that the screen stays in whatever position i choose the rear fold-out feet tend to catch on the slim <unk> <unk> i also use , but that 's not a fault of the case itself i 'm not sure i like the keyboard cover - it fits fine , though , and does n't move around , so perhaps i just need to get used to it it 's also already saved me from one coffee <unk> , so i think i 'll be willing to trade a bit of tactile feel for <unk>
the cover fits perfectly and is slim , yet protective just like i wanted it to be i got the aqua one , but had hard time choosing colors not many people have the new macbook air # `` around me and i love having one and sporting a cool cover at the same time
light-weight but protective i do n't really use the little stands on the bottom , but its still a great laptop case that makes me feel safer about bringing my computer places
i just received my case -lrb- ordering and arriving took place in less than a week ! -rrb- and the ipearl could n't have been easier to put on and it looks fantastic this is my first cover ever purchased so i do n't have anything to compare it to , but for the price this is excellent my only hope is that it has some shelf life i 'll keep you posted ps - the free keyboard cover is n't so great , but since it was free , i do n't mind i ca n't get it to fit properly so i 'm going to have a friend take a crack at it in case it 's my inability to apply it properly all in all , worth every penny
very nice bag and i mean thick you 'll have to soften the leather up but once you do , you 'll be good to go the bag looks great and feels like it is pretty rugged like i said , though , put some <unk> oil or something for greasy coated leather , especially on the straps where the buckles are only down side is it is much smaller than you think if all you need it for is hauling papers to and from the office , then you have found your bag you could probably fit a laptop in there too , but i would n't bet on getting much else in there i do highly recommend this bag manly and rugged
i shopped around for a durable , quality leather bag to carry my # inch <unk> this is the ideal bag it is one of the favorite things i own and it 's perfect for school and business meetings i highly recommend it
i purchased this to protect my ipad to and from work i also carry files and other items all my other bags had room for lots of gadgets -lrb- pockets , etc . -rrb- i found myself carrying the same stuff back and forth to the office every day , but using little of it this bag has a place for your ipad or netbook computer along with room for # pens and some business cards other than than , nothing it is simple , lightweight , and nice looking i had one problem with the strap , but the vendor responded immediately and took care of it
received this rolling laptop case and was pleased with how much room it had i tote # laptops daily along with textbooks and an ipad and this bag had enough room to handle all of my gadgets and materials only thing is the handle is a little shaky as i pull the case but so far so good i had to add an <unk> to this review it is now march # th # and both wheels have begun to fall apart on this case the wheels are not durable enough to withstand daily usage i am now shopping around to purchase another case for <unk> of my materials and gadgets . #
the bag is nice , the zippers flow easily , the only thing i dislike about the item is that the handle is very weak and could be improved greatly but so far the handle has n't broke off which is a good thing for me the bag is spacious , it can fit three of my textbooks and a notebook , but after placing that inside of the bag there 's no room for my laptop at all
the bag has several full width and full height pockets but , none are over a couple of inches deep i 'd prefer a smaller number of pockets and one deeper pocket for clothes and/or a toilet kit
it does work for what i needed it for , however , the seams seem to be unravelling i 'm only putting # lbs of stuff in it i was expecting it to be better quality , but ... in today 's world , i guess i can expect to be ripped off more and
although the bag itself worked well , the fact that only two month or so after having the bag the wheels literally began to tare apart so if you purchase would recommend limiting the surfaces you take your bag on -lrb- which slightly defeats the purpose of getting a rolling bag -rrb-
bought this for my <unk> works great for him this was a good deal and delivery was prompt he is enjoying the use of this rolling bag there is a pocket for all his things
the same thing happened to me as to the earlier review just got the order # / # bag has cardboard flap that says lunar , but it is not the lunar bag its a much cheaper , lower quality bag
after i searched and searched for a bag to fit my new mega size laptop -lrb- # . # `` -rrb- , i finally settled on everki for quality and features i ordered the bag from amazon in june shortly after the arrival of my new laptop ... i had to wait , but , was willing to do so to have the right bag i wanted something that was not too heavy , and built well everki seemed to fit the bill after i finally received my bag a month later i have been carrying it only for # months and the small handles over the laptop compartment are pulling out of the bag i guess the weight of the mega size laptop is more than the bag can handle we 'll see what everki 's customer service has to say , and hope to resolve this after spending $ # for a bag ! ! everki lunar laptop bag - briefcase , fits up to # . # -inch -lrb- <unk> # bk #
love this bag slim but holds so much with smart sized pockets inside love the orange interior which makes all those black cords & attachments easy to find exterior slots provide good space for files with a snug fit so they stay secure
i love these bags , i say these because i have two of them now one purchased last march and now this one on march # st they fit my two asus g # laptops great with the very soft inner laptop compartment and plenty of other pockets for the rest of your stuff yes they are a little expensive for what they are but i found being well made plenty of room and lifetime warranty it 's worth it especially if you have a # . # & # # ; or larger laptop
great laptop case love the orange pockets and the fabric lining is very soft for your electronics - not water resistant -lrb- it 's water repellent - could have more padding for the computer -lrb- i cut foam padding and lined the computer pouch for added protection - great build quality and very nice material - straps are black seat belts very strong and reliable - perfect for large <unk> pocket colors and felt <unk> <unk> this is a great laptop bag for very large laptops i have an asus g # <unk> , it 's has # inch screen but the laptop is about a foot wide and # . # feet long huge only problem , it 's a little too expensive for a computer bag , but you will not find another laptop bag that will fit a huge laptop
great bag , i am using it for my alienware m # <unk> # and so far so good i have had it almost a year with almost daily usage and have not had any problems with the seams on the bag it is holding up well with no signs of it suffering ill effects from having to carry such a heavy laptop it has plenty of storage for my accessories , charger , a few notebooks , etc . it 's one purchase i have made that i have had no regrets in making
i bought this bag because i get opportunities to travel often , therefore go a lot through security checks with my laptop i wanted to avoid having to remove it when i travel in most airports in us the bag looks great an stylish , especially with the orange color <unk> it from the front and on the strips it has many pockets and features that can be very useful however after using it only # times , one of the strips came off , and i must say that i was quite dissapointed i could not return it since it was over # days , so i went to a tailor and had it fixed i 've used it once since but i 'm still a little concerned on how effective the other <unk> is bottom line , nice and good looking bag , but does n't seem to be durable
i 'm very happy with this purchase it has enough pockets to place all the gadgets and cables ; plus , the fact that it has a special place for the ipad is outstanding my only con is that i wish it would have been a little bigger , so i could also use it as a weekender when i travel ; it 's not big enough for that also , the utility pockets are n't that big other than that , is a great laptop backpack
i recently bought a # . # & # # ; asus g # laptop , this bag said it would fit up to # . # but my laptop would not fit in this bag at all returning it for a # & # # ; bag and hopefully that fits my laptop good quality though
i bought this pricey backpack for one reason : to house myasus republic of gamers g # <unk> # . # -inch gaming laptop -lrb- black -rrb- at first , while it did fit , i could not zip it up all the way i still need to have the backpack completely empty and make the laptop the first thing i put in recently , it 's been somewhat `` broken in `` and there are times when i can fully zip up the laptop i tried two other backpacks case logic vnb- # value # -inch laptop backpack -lrb- black -rrb- and <unk> travel gear scansmart <unk> neither could fit the behemoth -lrb- the swissgear one was an extremely tight fit , and i felt really uncomfortable carrying my laptop in it . hope this helps
i like this pack it holds all my travel stuff i got it because it is tsa-friendly i wish the pockets in the center section were arranged a bit differently as i sometimes have to take stuff out to get to the bottom ones i 'd also like a thin zippered pocket on the outside front for easy access to travel documents i like the little pocket for <unk> player
i am happy with this product the only thing i wished is that it was # % water proof or came with a rain bag but all in all it is wonderful , affordable , light weight , and perfect for travel or work well i came back to let you know the strap broke it 's only been a few months i am disappointed
she says it fits her needs ... and the overhead bins ... perfectly the features she was particularly keen on were the capability of getting through security checkpoints at the airport faster without having a lot of zipping , <unk> , etc . involved hopefully , it will last her a long time
i 've had this for only # months , but so far it 's been great i bought it because i travel through airports with computer gear i love the glasses compartment on the top the bag does feel a bit heavy after a while though -lrb- not much you can do about that i guess -rrb- the fast <unk> thing is a huge plus it really does works i just unzip and lay the bag back and it goes right through
bought this for my husband and he loves it it opens up and lies flat through airport security scanners so you do n't have to haul out your laptop weight is well distributed and it looks great
i have owned my share of laptop bags and none of them compare to this from the moment you take it out of the wrapping , you can tell it is a quality bag everything fits perfectly in it each pouch in the bag is useful unlike many other bags i have had spend the extra money and never have to buy another bag
my # . # & # # ; ultrabook laptop snugly fits in the backpack has room for all accessories , some magazines and misc while traveling side pocket for mouse & one for drink -lrb- with holder to keep it in place -rrb- fits well under airplane seat love the smooth texture of the fabric and multiple inner storage options
a minor improvement would be to include a clip for keys other than that , i 'm quite happy with this it has different pockets for my laptop and my ipad ; which is good
i could not believe how efficient this backpack was it was so easy to get through airport security with it it is so roomy i had more than enough room for all my <unk> as well as my laptop -lrb- of course ! -rrb- i would highly recommend this to anyone who not only travels for business , but for use everyday to and from work
when i say top quality i mean it as i 've been threw so many bags to find one that holds , my surface pro , surface rt and nexus # along with every accessory that is needed of them great build and feels awesome on back
the minute i got my new bag i filled it with all my & # # ; stuff & # # ; and took off felt like nothing on my back ... and i 'm old ... so this is good i 'm going to be taking a trip to washington dc this next fall and was looking for a bag that would be attractive and easy on my old bones ... this is it highly recommend for anyone who needs to carry stuff they will never need :
all the various parts actually worked i went through security without taking out the laptop nor the tablet the water bottle thingy works great very comfortable once you take off the chest buckle straps
i have made several flights with this item already it is made very nicely , the zippers work easily no issues going through security now i do n't have to unload the laptop and place in a bin i have not had any side line inspections since using this i would recommend to anyone who flies also has ample storage pockets i do n't use them all
i have now had this for almost a year , product wears well and very comfortable lots of good pockets , the only one thing i wish it had was a latch to hold my car keys i travel quite a bit for work so it fits well up on top of the plane and very durable protects your product very well would recommend to buy this product
this is one of the best backpacks i have ever owned i am a college student and it has held up well for the last month that i 've been using it there 's plenty of room for my # & # # ; laptop , chargers , # textbooks and a notebook , as well as my planner , pens and pencils and a few other random things this backpack was obviously designed with very high quality materials and will surely last for many years it is fairly expensive , but with a lifetime warranty , i believe that it 's worth the price
perfect size , weight and balance for my electronics and personal items for a business trip and everyday use lighter than swiss and check point friendly , lifetime warranty - best buy on the market
first thing , it has a great assortment of pockets to store and divide up everything you need to travel with great for long and short trips secondly , it 's a good looking bag it does not look like a <unk> cumbersome travel bag the splash of orange inside is great as well exactly what i was looking for
i noticed that the bottom part was not packaged in a sealed plastic bag , so i suspect it was not in brand new condition not surprisingly , its upper left edge does not fit perfectly and there is a small gap i 'm returning this piece of crap for a full refund why they would ship something they probably knew is not in good working condition is beyond me
the top and bottom cover do not fit well one of the bottom lifting feet broke off in the first hour of use theres rubber feet in the front , but not in the the rear , its hard plastic , and causes the macbook air to slip ! ! do n't be fooled by the video showing how easy it is to install it does not just snap on into place ! because the fit is bad you may have to take a <unk> wheel to finish molding the plastic case to make it fit right forgot to mention , the keyboard cover that comes with the case does not line up with all the keys most keys do , but not all , so you will have a blurry effect sadly i can not leave zero stars ! !
the case , while stylish , did n't fit as snuggly as advertised when i contacted the company about a replacement i never heard back the case spent about a day on my machine and now sits in the closet
the cover is very attractive , but one side or the other started falling off within a week of my purchase it was far too much trouble to deal with , so i stopped using it i would not recommend it
do not <unk> came in a plastic cover that had been opened i guess it was second hand also the keyboard cover was teal and the laptop cover was dark blue i am still waiting for the seller to send me a complete new order which is also the same
the kickstand clip -lrb- s -rrb- may come off i was unable to find it so i ca n't tell you if snapping it back on will be the quick fix item <unk> easily , but does it 's job case does interfere with power cord when trying to use left hand usb port
this computer case is ok , i was n't expecting it to be such cheap quality the top piece that fits over the apple is one sheet of plastic and pops off frequently also , the free keyboard cover is worthless looks terrible and makes it where typing is a little difficult
this cover makes the macbook air a lovely shade of blue it has no instructions , so be very very <unk> when applying the covers if you put something on backwards , make sure to use a tool to pry the clips up -- preferably something like a hard plastic screwdriver -- to remove the cover trying to do so by hand is likely to put an <unk> pressure on the casing , and it cracks like <unk>
i purchased the cover because it stated it would fit my model of macbookair mid # -lrb- a # -rrb- the rear bottom portion of the cover did not <unk> it was not quite deep enough it felt loose not sure why the description said it would fit ? ? ? ? returning item ... maybe defective though i could not see anything broke
i really liked this cover when i first started using it however very soon , the back began to pop off or slide off at the least movement i would not recommend this cover for this reason
i had trouble snapping the product on and even more trouble when i tried to take it off i felt like it was damaging my laptop everytime i did that however , it is good quality and very & # # ; fashionable & # # ;
i bought this because apple cases are so expensive and i did n't want to spend $ # on one it fits and protects my laptop from scratches i bought the blue one and i love the color
okay for the price , does not fit snugly in the corners , will break if dropped , expecting it to crack after some time of use got # of these to replace if one breaks , ca n't complain much at this price
i had to cut off small parts of each side to allow the laptop to open past # degrees now the bottom is a * bit * insecure in the <unk> from the top of the keyboard to the bottom of the trackpad , but otherwise okay
it 's ok lots of scratches on it already and i 'm pretty careful about it it looks ugly but protects my laptop the screen also & # # ; weighs more & # # ; and it closes faster than it should
i got this for my wife 's macbookair because she wanted some add ' l protection so she could carry the macbook in her book bag installation was very easy as advertized the case was a little smoother than i though which means you need to be careful when sliding the unit in/out of a book bag so it does not slip overall a very nice product for the price we are <unk>
i bought it because i thought the little feet would be handy for typing , giving a better angle for the keys , but now that i have it i never use the feet but i like the stylish blue color and feel like my precious mac is more protected now as for the keyboard cover , it makes it harder to type , but i 've gotten used to it , and when i 'm writing a longer email or a document , i take it off but again , i like feeling like the machine is more protected -- in this case from dust and <unk> , etc .
fits well but not very tight i am happy to have a shell for the computer but i do not get the impression that it would save the computer if it were dropped
its a good cover does show more finger prints and other smudges more than i would like but that no big deal does have a problem with the top shell getting caught on the bottom when opening my laptop but other than that it does its job just fine
i thought it was going to be more of a rubber feel but it is easy to install and looks great i like the stand , makes it easy to type would recommend this seller
the bottom cover interferes a little with charging -lrb- it 's easier for the plug to slip out or not attach properly -rrb- , which is why i rated it four out of five stars no biggie , but i would have liked to known that before i ordered
i love this case in every way except one it adds significant weight to my macbook air i bought the macbook air especially for the light weight and easy mobility it is still incredibly easy to carry class to class , but it is a lot heavier the clips on the back sides that raise it up are amazing i use them all the time
the shell fits perfectly and i love the foldable feet in the back however , the keyboard skin that they provide does n't fit well and there are far better ones out there like the one from topcase
this case fit my # inch macbook air well , and it looks really nice on my computer the only issue i have had is that a couple of the tabs , which are what hold the case to the computer , have broken off , and the case is consequently less secure for now though , it still works
this case is very lightweight and low profile there were no issues installing it and it looks really nice on my mba the only complaint i could make is that it tends to show fingerprint smudges worse even than another macbook i have without a case but that is a minor quibble
i am very happy about my new mcover the color is exactly what i like , it fits very well and it 's a really great protection for my mba its functionality is exactly what i had in my mind i was very surprised about the additional -lrb- free -rrb- keyboard cover this is a perfect <unk> ! ! i would like to see this cover for my macbook pro # `` , too ; -
this fit my new mac book air perfectly well worth the money apple wanted like <unk> dollars for a cover i am glad that i found one through this site
