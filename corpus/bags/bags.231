i like this bag pretty well , but it does n't have a lot of extra space for things like laptop speakers the fold pouch on the front ca n't even hold a couple of dvds without poking out and the slot on the back is open on the bottom , so if you papers in it , they can fall out i rarely use it anymore i ended up buying a laptop back pack which works a lot better for my needs this bag would be better if you were n't planning on carry anything but your laptop and cord , pens , cellphone , ipod , etc with you it 's not great if you plan on carrying anything bigger
i went to -lsb- ... -rsb- and used their `` laptop bag <unk> `` tool to assist me i found it was pretty cool that this tool guarantees that you will find a case that fits your laptop 's specific model anyway , i scoured the net for this case and found amazon had the best price so i pulled the trigger and am happy i did so the case appears to be well made and fits my laptop snugly i did n't want to spend a lot of money on a case that will be rarely used so it was perfect for me for the price , it 's not a bad case at all
if you are looking for a lightweight case for a large monitor , this is a good one it has a little extra space -lrb- side pocket -rrb- for documents or a small power supply unfortunately made in china or would be a five star
i bought this caselogic laptop -lrb- notebook ? -rrb- case in the summer of # and i 'll say that it still looks great my backpacks usually get pretty beat up , but this case has withstood my beating i love that in the laptop compartment , there are many slots for cds , papers , and space for the battery on the outside -lrb- with a velco lock cover -rrb- , underneath are more slots for putting memory cards , small papers , etc . this case is quite sturdy for the price about about $ # however , it 's very annoying when you have to go navigate through tight spaces it 's almost impossible to make myself small when i 'm standing in a bus nobody can get through my rear end but yes , all in all , a good buy
the bag is almost perfect it does the job i am not one to complain so i wont start now the laptop becomes heavy after walking a few miles that is to be expected this bag carries my usb speakers my wireless mouse and my disks its a tight fit but i make it work for the price its not bad . i recommend this laptop bag to anyone buy this bag with confidence i give it # stars
i have a # inch toshiba laptop and had a hard time finding a carrying case i found this one is not too bulky and has enough cushioning to protect the computer
it is very light weight , fits the laptop perfect has extra space for the battery and mouse i just wish it did n't attract dust , dirt and materials so easily it 's a magnet to dirt and dust otherwise i love everything about it , and i really had to look hard i <unk> # other cases this one i will keep and be happy with
was looking for a lightweight bag at a reasonable price , this one filled the bill on both counts i have a # `` hp that fits perfectly into the case , and has room for other items all in all it 's a winner
even though it 's slim -lrb- which it really is -rrb- , it manages to hold all of our electronics & cables it fits our # `` hp nicely , and secures the notebook there is an included piece that will adapt it to fit a # `` notebook the stitching around the case you can tell is high quality this is a nice case for the money
got this case logic brand <unk> the rave reviews and they were right if you are looking for a case for your # `` laptop with a little more room for cords this is the one to get i love its minimalist approach meaning its not going to hold all of your documents its primarily for the laptop and a few pens , keys , mouse , business cards , usb drive , etc . it has a great feature that allows you to slip it through a <unk> handle for easy toting in an airport
i recently purchased a dell # inch widescreen laptop , and was unable to find a case for it in local stores amazon had a good selection , but i am happy i chose this one it easily holds my laptop , and was convenient when traveling it has enough pockets to hold the accessories i have -lrb- mouse , ac adapter , camera -rrb- with slots for cd/dvds , and it was easy to access i highly recommend this case case logic # `` classic laptop <unk> logic # -inch slimline laptop case -lrb- <unk> #
this is an excellent product , exactly as described and the # `` size is a little larger than my # `` laptop so there is plenty of room for the electrical cord and mouse
this is a great case that is lightweight , slim , still has lots of storage space and easily handles my # . # `` dell vostro # i needed <unk> room for my laptop but also wanted easy access to accessories and a slot on the back side for a quick place to carry a few papers , maybe a thin file folder , etc . i use it every day of the week when traveling to my office in my own vehicle and so having a velcro secured storage compartment for accessories as opposed to a zippered one is not big deal i 've had the case for about # months and am very satisfied it
i am very happy with my purchase of this case i 'm retired , so i do n't need one that can carry a lot of paper work in i just wanted something to protect my dell studio , and this does the job if you need something for work and you hand out a bunch of presentations , this might not be for you if not then this is it ! !
the case is good in that it fits my laptop . . but there is zero room for the mouse , charger , or even a piece of paper for that matter well , maybe for a piece of paper , but that 's it the price was fair -lrb- on sale in the gold box -rrb- for what i got , though , or else it would be going back
very simple case for laptops up to # `` i have a dell inspiron # it fits in this case but it would be better if it had a bit more room for the power cord and mouse . the material is durable and looks nice i like the plain style of this case and the fact that it is so slim
i wanted a case that i can use alone or in a <unk> the <unk> strap <unk> in the first use and the case is thin enough for the # nd it 's definitely not for someone who throws their stuff around , though the case pads well , but it ca n't take a beating
i bought this attache more as a laptop sleeve than anything , it fits well in my big school bag but also is very nice to use to just carry around the laptop the shoulder strap is comfortable and easily adjusted it fits my power supply with cords okay , along with some other small cables for my ipod , graphing calculator , and handheld gps , but not too much else , which is fine by me the interior is nice and sturdy with some useless pockets i would n't want to put anything in them in fear that it would put <unk> pressure on the screen the neoprene is nice , i have n't needed to see how water repellent it actually is better safe than sorry if you do purchase this , the shoulder strap is in an inside pocket when i first received it , i <unk> a little when i did n't see the shoulder strap at first this bag was worth the money to me
i bought this for my wife for her # `` dell laptop its a perfect fit for a slim case it has good padding and can easily be slipped into a suitcase for trips the shoulder strap is removable this is a sharp case that would be an excellent choice for the office or at home highly recommend - <unk> up !
i took this on an extended trip this summer it is not big enough for a laptop charger although packed , it held my ipod cables , cell phone charger , pda cables , and <unk> digital camera cables -lrb- with small dock -rrb- i am glad that i had it ; it kept all of my things in one place , without <unk>
the pockets are not quite right ... too deep and skinny . # slightly larger pockets would have been better i clipped some of the stitching to work better with my chargers , ipod and nintendo ds strangely , there are just pockets inside , no opening in the middle like a pocketbook the middle section is filled with the inside `` wall `` of the pockets not a very logical design , but i assume cheap and easy to stitch up the zippered bag does fit nicely into my carry-on shoulder bag , which is really all i wanted no excessive odor ... just basic neoprene
i like the concept of this organizer but thought the individual pockets would hold a bit more than they do still like the bag and would buy it again i had to wash it half a dozen times to remove the smell of petroleum i let it air out for weeks -lrb- outside -rrb- before using it because the smell was so <unk>
i bought this organizer for my daughter who is off to college , i did n't think she needed it , but after much <unk> -lrb- begging -rrb- i gave in when it arrived and was loaded with all her chargers , adapters , etc . , i realized how many electronic devices she had i found it to be very useful at keeping all these devices in one place and organized it 's small , lightweight , fits more than expected and very portable
great bag , but not very flexible i tried to add my gps -lrb- it 's kinda small -rrb- in the bag , but the bag did n't really stretch to accommodate like having everything consolidated though
this bag is small and cute , it fits all of the things i thought it would : usb cables , headphones , camera , apple charger , batteries , cell chargers and my <unk> . i love it
i bought this bag to use on a car trip to colorado it held all of my cords and chargers for the trip it is well made the bright color makes it easy to see when packing or unpacking the trunk it was great to have all of my cords in one place i would recommend this case to anyone who needs to organize their cords
it 's just too small to hold anything bigger than a cell phone charger laptop charger was too big didnt realize how much it resembles a <unk> purse lol if you 're a man do not purchase !
i purchased this with the idea that my laptop power cord would fit snugly into the bag with room to zip up this is more for cell phones , ipods , and other compact devices the dimensions of the openings would be about # -inches deep by # / # - inches wide so , if your items do n't fit into that small of a space , this would n't be the charger bag for you sadly , i will be using this solely for travel
this was a great bargain there are # pockets inside , which i keep my plug , travel surge protector , light , earbuds , and phone sync cord the # inner pockets are a little larger than the outer , so this is where i have to put plugs i do n't use a mouse , but that is most likely where you would have to put that too it zips securly , and weighs practically nothing i love this thing
the purse appears well made and the laptop pocket is big enough to hold my # . # & # # ; laptop however , getting the laptop in and out of the case is extremely difficult and would be impossible if trying to remove the computer for airline security and then putting it back inside i sent it back for that reason
this is a fine bag ... for a laptop i use it for my ipad and like the padded pocket but would like a smaller version specific for ipads the front pockets are tight and a bit difficult to use i would suggest a <unk> lining so items could be found more easily the black lining makes it difficult to find things
i like the look of this bag , but getting the notebook in and out at the airport is a huge hassle it needs to be about # & # # ; wider i 'm going to use it , but would n't buy it again
this is the best bag i 've ever owned it fits my # . # `` laptop ! ! for reference , my laptop measures # . # x # . # x # . # most bags for this size laptops are too bulky but this one is just perfect also , there are many pockets inside and it is pretty light
i got this for my girlfriend as a `` going back to school `` gift she loves it first of all its pink , -lrb- but not too pink -rrb- secondly , it can fit her # `` laptop easily - even though she has an over-sized battery , and most bags could not hold it its very functional , has room for the laptop and all the other million stuff she carries in her bag -lrb- seriously ladies , you have to do something about that -rrb-
i bought this bag a few months ago after weeks of searching for the right bag loved it ... and one day i made a huge mistake and placed it on my <unk> <unk> the bag literally caught fire ... only the extra padding saved my laptop i ordered another less than # minutes after the fire was out -lrb- no damage to my house -rrb- , and it arrived less than # hours later fits everything that i need and more
the bag itself seems pretty durable , and it has tons of space inside the main downside is the weird latch system that it uses the flap has a hole in it , which goes around this metal piece that sticks out you have to thread the strap though that , but it 's nearly impossible unless the bag is empty , or you have your hand inside the bag to hold it steady
this bag is <unk> , i mean it i think i 'll fit in my laptop , cooling fan , adapters , a notebook or two , a cellphone , an ipod , and it would n't be full i still have to see how much weight and stressful usage it can handle but so far so good
be it you will use it for your laptop , or maybe your books to study , or perhaps your clothes to spend a weekend at the pool , this bag fits for all of these inside it has two separate spaces , one with a protective couch for your laptop and the other perhaps for the magazines or disks also it has a zip in side where there is another space just about the same size of the two mentioned before , perhaps for your personal documents or a folder has three flat pouch on front -lrb- two maybe for cards or little notepads and a third one where you can put your pen , <unk> , etc . . has two pouch on the sides -lrb- one on the right and one in the left -rrb- perhaps for your cellphone , mp # <unk> # player , <unk> , swiss knife , etc . it also in it 's back another space , with a small velcro where you can put some more stuff without having to open the bag closing properly the bag could be troublesome if you are in a hurry -lrb- it 's very hard trying to insert the black belt in the metal hole if you 're standing and walking the only con is that is a little heavy -lrb- about # pounds -rrb- , but it 's lighter than other laptop bags but the weight it 's worth for the quality and material
i am very happy with my bag it is stylish and very useful i was able to fit my # . # dell in the computer slot then another mac computer just in the messenger slot many zippers and slots to put things the only complaint is how the bag closes , i wish it was just velcro or a snap
when it is too good to be true it really is ... this bag was on sale for # . # and advertised as full grain leather but it is not leather at all but plastic it smells disgusting and has a cancer warning on it -lrb- california <unk> # -rrb- completely dissatisfied with this bag going to return it
really nice bag , but unless you have a thin mac and # & # # ; thick binder it wo n't work for you i have a <unk> laptop and a standard # & # # ; binder i carry with me and it 's a real task in itself to cram it in and still be able to fasten bag forget about stuffing a laptop charger in ... ... not going to
this is a nice bag the shape , color and size is perfect unfortunately , it arrived with a <unk> flap the stitching also did n't look like it was done with care it was going to be a present so it was returned and i decided to spend a little more on a better quality bag
began looking great and working great unfortunately after a few months of use , it is starting to wear ... bad while walking through one quick storm , it left some really bad <unk> marks for the price , not sure if it is worth it would like to know whether or not this is real leather ... does n't feel like it
three stars because the locks are not great the reviews about the locks are right it is a good briefcase for the price the dust made it look old and scratched i almost return it , since it was not obvious that it was just dust after i cleaned it , it looked fine
so , this product was a gift for a high school teacher and grad student while he does n't keep his laptop in it , the divider allows him the ability organize & keep his <unk> stuff from his <unk> stuff the only thing is that it is n't quite as wide as he would like it to be -lrb- makes sticking things like sandwiches for lunch in there not very <unk> -rrb-
i really like the feel of the briefcase and the way it is built -lrb- the pockets , etc . -rrb- i have two minor quibbles : not quite as roomy as it looks at first the leather was considerably darker than i thought it was going to be it 's darker than the picture however , i do really like it and i would recommend it
although the <unk> model was n't my first choice , the case is well made , and does exactly what i wanted the material seems of very good quality , as does the workmanship it meets my needs just fine i have a # . # & # # ; laptop and it 's good snug
this was a gift for my son and seems to be all that was advertised the leather is not <unk> , but it seems strong enough build quality seems good ultimately this was a <unk> item , and for that it exceeds expectations
held up well over several years the pouches do not zip shut , though i never lost any items from it the closures on the front are solid , though the leather becomes bent with repeated use the magnetic closures on the back are strong , though they need to be placed in the right location to close on their own comfortable handle and carrying strap
it 's a nice color i wish there was a zippered or more secure flap somewhere with the main flaps for putting more valuable stuff , but that 's all i would change fits my # & # # ; mbp laptop , by the way
i bought this case for my husband 's christmas present he is very pleased with it and loves the look and its ease of access for documents , chargers etc . he has received lots of admiring comments from his work colleagues an excellent purchase
it is well made and hold a lot of things . it is rather masculine for i am female i am able to carry more than ever and it looks like it is of high quality i have the dark brown i recommend this bag for any professional
my son , the newly <unk> lawyer , was very happy with this the leather is nice , the buckles , which i worried about , actually hide an easier closure i personally think it 's a little heavy my husband was jealous , wants one also
i bought this for my husband 's birthday he loves it it easily fits his # & # # ; macbook pro the front two pockets are the perfect size to hold his ipad mini he also stores utensils , an external hard drive , etc . he can also carry multiple notebooks and folders he absolutely loves it it has held up well so far and looks great
i purchased this for my husband and he loves it the leather is very good quality , the bag is durable and the compartments make it very useful for holding everything necessary for work
i bought a new lap top and wanted a rugged looking bag that both my husband and myself could use this one fits the bill perfectly and has a ton of pockets that we both can use to fill with our work stuff
excellent briefcase , big quality without a big price this <unk> leather case looks the same as other brands with much bigger price tag it has space for the laptop plus accesories and a big documents pocket
product very nice very sturdy construction <unk> , understated no need for any type of customer service this was a gift and as a doctor , he found it to be quite appropriate for his needs
i bought this for my husband for christmas and it arrived on time and exactly as the picture presented this is a very nice briefcase per the price and better quality than i thought it might be the only con was it does n't really have a zipper pocket or place to put some of your smaller items i would recomment though as you can buy a little zipper case to put inside , and it 's definately worth the buy if you are looking for an awesome leather bag
the quality of this portfolio exceeded my expectations its a thicker leather than i assumed it would be in this price range everything seems well stitched and well put together from the picture you ca n't tell , but it does come with a matching shoulder strap its big enough to fit everything and more that you would be able to fit into a brief case the dark finish is really consistent and does n't blemish easily the inner lining of the portfolio is really nice its a type of material almost like canvass but much higher quality i ca n't see this bag wearing out for years to come i 'm completely satisfied with it so far
saw this at office depot for about # x the price and liked it a lot after buying at and using it for a few months , it 's wonderful the back pocket since it 's leather does stretch a little bit , but that 's to be expected just do n't pack it too full
good quality , great look , very sturdy i 've even been able to get it to hold my # & # # ; laptop in it i use it for carting around my media stuff -lrb- books , flyers , handouts -rrb- , but i also have room for other business stuff -lrb- notebooks , etc -rrb- i would recommend this highly
great bag , the leather looks and feels nice plenty of room for my lenovo yoga and all the accessories , and a back compartment for a couple of folders or notebooks
i purchased this portfolio for my husband for christmas we were impressed with the <unk> of the case the leather is beautiful and the actual case holds much more than his laptop the closure mechanisms work easily and adds better security than the usual velcro closures the case is very professional looking he is very happy with this gift
i bought this as a gift for my brother who 's a med student he absolutely loves it and says that it works perfectly for carrying around all of his necessities he has a wide screen laptop which fits very nicely into the protective sleeve lots of pockets to keep track of the little things and roomy enough for files , paperwork , books , etc . the leather is a dark chocolate brown ... a little more rugged than the standard black laptop bag/briefcase -- perfect for my brother
this bag is exactly what i was looking for after hours of research and shopping i found that this was the best of all available options i typically do not buy items that have logos on them , but because this was the best option , i decided to bite the bullet it fits my dell # & # # ; laptop and the back fits my legal sized file folders nicely the back flap is magnetic which makes it easy to open and close , but keeps it securely closed all other times it 's easy to carry by the handle and the shoulder strap is comfortable enough for the # minutes a day i carry the bag bag arrived in perfect condition
the quality of this product was amazing bought it for a graduate going to college oh , was he pleased i have many portfolios , and seeing this one made me want to order one for myself
i purchased this for my husband as a gift he needed a more executive style bag than what he was carrying he loved it it smells great , feels great and has <unk> for several items he did have to cut back on all the it things he carried before this bag is not for the it engineer , no room for extra <unk> it is perfect for the guy who just needs the basic business items he has had several compliments on the bag overall we are very satisfied with this purchase
after many years of lugging around a backpack , i decided to update my pack to the portfolio i wanted something elegant and classy , without being pretentious the bag is functional and only took a small amount of adjustment from the backpack 's storage capacity
i was in the market for a large bag seems like everyone wants a messenger bag that just has their laptop but i have a <unk> of things to take with me this has the front pocket , but where this really <unk> is the back pocket this is gigantic i was able to throw all sorts of things in there any it look good
solo # . # - inch leather laptop <unk> price for a solid quality leather bag fits laptop and <unk> in protective sleeve lot 's of pockets for stuff i 'd been looking for the perfect bag for a long time and this one was as close as i could find with a fair price
i got this bag as a <unk> for my husband he loves it there 's more than enough room for a lap top , <unk> and it has little compartments for things like cell phone , calculator , pens etc . the quality of the leather is very nice too we thought that the shoulder strap was long enough and adjustable before i bought the bag i was worried about that because i read a review saying that the shoulder strap was not adjustable , wich is absolutely not true
i have a standard hp # `` laptop it does not fit in this bag , in the side zipper part where it should go i read the tag attached to the bag and it clearly states `` fits most # `` laptops `` <unk> that would have been very helpful to have in the review and specs portion online i e-mailed <unk> to see about returning it and i will update their seller feedback page once i have completed the return
this is a nice bag if you have a # `` laptop , but mine is bigger and this bag did n't come close to fitting i ca n't imagine that it fits `` most `` # `` laptops in fact , i ca n't imagine that it fits any # `` laptops even `` slim `` ones the laptop enclosure is accessed via a side zipper and there 's no room for error
the description of the backpack is misleading the backpack is supposed to fit most # `` laptops but it does n't . it is a backpack for # . # `` laptops i have to say , since i 've read the reviews before buying , that i saw it coming i bought this hoping it would fit my # . # `` asus republic of gamers and it does , maybe a bit too tightly should i say the quality is great though
it fits my macbook pro # `` just fine it 's funny - it 's got an interior compartment which does n't really fit the macbook really well but then it 's got another , really well padded zipper that runs right up the side this compartment is not in the main area , but rather , right against your back that part fits the macbook really well , and you do n't even know it 's there it 's like a little secret compartment this leaves the rest of the bag free to put other things if i had a complaint , it would be that the bag could be bigger i 'm # ' # `` and this bag feels a bit small to me i would n't mind if it was about # % bigger
the product is spacious and has ample space i can fit my college notebooks , calculator , pencils and pens , and many other things my laptop is # . # `` the product is advertised as : `` fits most # `` laptops `` , but when i received the product the label reads `` fits most # . # `` laptops . maybe they shipped the wrong size , but the laptop still fits i 'll just keep this one
after a couple of weeks of use , the lowepro transit backpack seems like a fine product however , it arrived smelling like old tennis shoes a few hours in bright <unk> helped a lot , but i still get an unpleasant <unk> when i open the <unk> compartments i probably will not buy products again from this distributor because i do not like the stink attention , manufacturers and <unk> : if the product smells bad in your warehouse , it is going to smell bad to the customer clean up your operation -lrb- literally -rrb- to avoid losing repeat business
bought this bag for college and it is the best backpack i have used great quality for the price and very comfortable on the back fits my # `` dell with some prying and i still have room for a couple binders and # or # textbooks inside i use the front pocket for snacks , the middle pocket for pens and supplies , and i carry a water bottle in side pocket this is the perfect backpack ... so i am purchasing another just to have as a backup
i bought this bag because the title says fits most # `` laptops i read the reviews before buying and some said their # `` laptop fit and some said it did n't well this bag is top quality - but it will never hold a standard # `` laptop my acer was two inches too long to go in the laptop pouch and an inch too wide to go in the generic pouch the kicker is that the maker tags on the bag clearly state `` will fit most # . # `` laptops `` i never would have selected this one if those tags had appeared in the photos if i had been searching for a bag for a smaller notebook , this would have been an excellent find but since this purchase was supposed to be for my new acer # . # inch , # pound monster laptop , it <unk> fails the acer wo n't go into the dedicated , well padded laptop pouch and it wo n't go into the generic pouch designed to hold the various accessories like mice , power bricks and media so my daughter gets a great laptop backpack , and i go back to looking
just wish it could be a little lighter the size is just right -lrb- i 'm # ' # -rrb- for my carry on stuff i can fit a # `` laptop in the laptop compartment , also a ipad and a netbook in the main compartment i get a backpack for air travel with # young children , and it has worked well for me so far the price at amazon for this bag is great , shipment is fast
great bag and lives up to the lowepro name , but is smaller than i had expected i do n't know that that 's really a bad thing i was just expecting bigger
my compaq presario cq # fits in here fine just a <unk> of trouble getting it in and out , but once it 's in there are a few inches of space around the edges , so i imagine an even larger laptop could be made to fit also comfortable with smaller laptops nice padding on the shoulders and the back
it seems lowepro has <unk> this bag since some comments it now comes appropriately stated as fitting a # `` laptop , not # ' as before -lrb- now if the amazon listing could only do the same -rrb- the bag looks really good fyi , it 's black and <unk> thought it looked like an olive green on amazon 's pictures i really like the fact that the laptop comes out a side pocket while the <unk> area still zips on top overall , it 's spacey i could fit my wallet , one of the checkbook length wallets , in the smallest front pocket
exceptional quality , believe me great fabric , very roomy , lots of pockets , covered zippers for <unk> protection lowepro quality at it 's best and for the # buck including shipment - you got ta be kidding me ! all in all i 'm happy with this backpack
great backpack , bought it for my hp hdx # ' laptop , wich fits just perfect in the designated laptop pocket it has an extra one where you can fit all the accesories you 'll need , power cable , mouse and books it also has a padded side pocket for digital cameras , and another one for water bottles both of them are zipped and <unk> , so when you dont need them , they wont be a bother forgot about two extra pocket , one for the pencils , wallet , etc . and a pretty hidden one for whatever you may need quality of the backpack is outstanding , it feels will last forever , at least many years only thing about it is that when empty , it can feel a little heavy , but it really doesnt make much difference while actually carrying a laptop another point , it fits my # inch laptop perfect , but , <unk> i have n't tested it , it doesnt seem it will hold a # <unk> just fine but that is just an <unk>
this is a good-looking , well-designed bag at a great price but ... my laptop does n't quite fit -lrb- # `` gateway fx , battery removed -rrb- it fits snuggly <unk> , you need to push to get it in and out , but that 's okay the real problem is the top -- it goes right to the top with effort , it can be zipped but you would n't want to do it often in case the zipper wo n't hold still , it is a `` transit `` bag , and even with the tight fit is still useful to transport places -- much easier to carry than my other bag -lrb- belkin , nice but big -rrb- there is n't a lot of padding , which keeps it light and portable there is enough storage space with the outside pockets for everything that i need to bring -lrb- battery , cords , etc -rrb- all in all , even with the tight fit , at this price for this quality , i 'm very , very pleased with it
description states it fits up to # . # `` notebooks but it fits a # `` macbook pro perfectly there is about # `` of spare room around the mbp when it 's in the sleeve i 've compared other # `` notebooks to the mbp and they are significantly larger seems the screen size is the same but the casing on other computers are larger the quality is par for lowepro which is excellent i would recommend this briefcase to a friend . # % padding of your notebook when the zipper is zipped it 's a slim case so room for notebook , power cord and a few office staples
i own several lowepro camera bags as i was looking for a notebook case for my laptop , i scanned across the name lowepro i could n't believe that they make other bags i immediately read the reviews , checked the measurements and ordered i am very happy it is just as rugged , cushioned in the right places and well made as their camera bags
fits my # `` <unk> and all cords , mouse , and documents like a charm light weight , solid handles and strap , and looks great i 'd highly recommend for the business guy or student looking for something practical and stylish
i bought this thinking it 'd be sleek and decently useful and , i bought this for my # `` macbook pro but i regret my decision , to have bought this , without checking out at the local store problem is while the inner sides of the bag has <unk> like cushion , the bottom of the bag just does n't have anything its just one thin layer of neoprene when the laptop is placed hard , it takes full beating
i was looking for a lightweight case to lug my laptop back & forth to work everyday and this definitely fits the bill ... it 's very light and fits my laptop perfectly my laptop requires a battery pack for use when i 'm out of the office and there 's enough room to squeeze that in there as well the only feature i wish it had was a removable shoulder strap it 's a great case for the money sturdy , attractive , protective and lightweight it was everything i was looking for
# of # my wife bought this for me at the microsoft store in <unk> and i initially thought it was a great case then one day the case slipped from my hand -lrb- yes , i was carrying too much stuff to my car -rrb- the edge offered no protection - in fact the laptop cut a tear in the corner upon impact with the asphalt the laptop corner was dinged up and the case separated a little , plus the fan got dislodged and it 's had cooling issues since i know that no soft-sided laptop sleeve will leave a machine unscathed after a three foot drop , but the physical damage to the exterior might have been <unk> if ms had used the same dots along the edge several months later it got knocked off of a chair in a classroom and sure enough , it landed on the same corner i still use the case because it does offer good protection from the elements and light impacts to the top and bottom sides - but i 'm thinking about ways to add corner protection without significant extra bulk
i like it - it fits my # . # `` hp dv # perfectly it 's strong and sturdy and i do n't see this thing falling apart anytime soon no frills , good carrying case
this is a great laptop carrying case if you do n't need anything else to accompany your laptop -lrb- such as a power cord -rrb- there is room for the laptop , but almost nothing else will fit in the case one great feature is the carrying straps these make the case almost like a little bag -lrb- but not gender specific -rrb- that you can carry with you
i was having a hard time finding a neoprene sleeve that could fit my new dell inspiron # . # `` laptop i tried the fellowes body glove # `` neoprene sleeve , but it was n't tall enough -lrb- the laptop comes with a thick , black plastic piece that protrudes from the top . this microsoft sleeve is a very snug yet perfect fit it also has very good padding and helpful carrying handles i 'm glad that i finally found a sleeve that fits the laptop , protrusion and all
the only reason this gets # instead of # stars is because is does not have a pocket to carry the cord it is well padded & a great size for the # & # # ; laptop i purchased
this is the perfect sleeve for a # `` laptop it easily fits the power cord and a mouse it has enough padding that you are n't afraid that your computer will be damaged
this is the second microsoft case i purchased the construction is like no other , i have not seen a sleeve that is as strong or durable as this one flying with a computer in the case is easy and your computer is always secure my only problem was that the case was a little big for my # . # inch computer , but that is not the sleeve 's fault
i got this sleeve for occasional travel with my toshiba laptop i passed through security in several airports without having to remove the laptop from the sleeve -lrb- which is a real bonus -rrb- there is not a lot of padding , so you definitely need to have it in another bag for full protection it is a snug fit for my toshiba satellite # . # `` laptop definitely no extra room for anything besides the laptop
