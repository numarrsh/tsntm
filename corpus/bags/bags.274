we love it it was big enough for our asus # . # laptop with extra space i also like the side pockets for files or books when traveling in the car the one pocket is slightly larger than the other so the charger and other extras wont fall out easily the handle is a great feature and it is padded so it does keep it protected when you bump into something
the case itself was ok , but the color was a horrid dark <unk> not purple there as also a very bad odor to it the price was good , but i returned it anyhow
i got a new laptop in november and had been on the hunt for a carry bag that was not so ... stuffy i thought this would be great and the info said it would fit a # . # inch laptop i asked for it for christmas and it most definitely does not fit my computer my laptop has about an inch to # inches hanging out the zipper - i guess i should have measured , but i just thought # . # was # . # too bad to , because otherwise it looks great make sure you measure before you buy mine is going back
seriously , i loved the color and the size fir my computer to a t. but , it also fit my niece 's computer , and you ended up with it we both think it is fine it is n't easy finding an affordable case for a large laptop , that is n't black
i just want everyone else to know that this product is not exactly the same color as it appears to have here on amazon however , there is also a pocket on the back , and although it is smaller than the front pocket , it 's perfect for my battery adapter i have n't really used this bag besides making sure my laptop fits in it -lrb- i just received the package this afternoon -rrb- , but it seems to be worth the money i recommend this case , just know that it 's more of a warmer purple than pictured , and is very <unk> with a rubbery smell
the best case ever i love my case and take it with me when i travel feels nice on the outside and even smoother on the inside would recommend to anyone with a # inch computer
i have an hp dv # . # inch laptop no place locally had anything that came close to fitting my new `` tank `` of a pc i was a little hesitant based on another review as to the quality of this item , but when i got it , i was impressed this bad boy holds my laptop , wireless mouse , power cable , external hard drive , and that 's just in the front pocket the back pocket has room for a folder or two to boot if you need a carry sleeve for your big # `` or larger laptop , this is the one to get the cushioning is great , the zippers seem well made as well as the handles , and it holds everything i need it to hold plus , being bright purple , it is definitely easy to spot
it comes in a very small but content package it is in a very tight plastic that is great for avoiding damages , bending , and ripping looks just like the pictures and fits the dell # . # inch laptop -lrb- newest version -rrb- in case you are wondering it has tons of zippers which are great for storing chargers , cords , etc . and will protect your
i needed a case to house my # . # laptop and not take up a lot of room in my car for a <unk> long trip i had one that had a lot of pockets and space on the inside but really wanted a more compact case and this one fit the bill it is well made and still has room for cords and a mouse which is really all i wanted it is lightweight and does not add to the weight of the laptop which i did not need i highly recommend this case if you are not needing to carry the kitchen sink with you wherever you go
bag arrived quickly so far it looks great and has plenty of storage room with it 's # zippered pockets my only concern is that my computer is heavy , i hope the handles will hold up
i love his product first off the purple color is way better in person ; it 's a little darker and slightly more on the <unk> side of purple it 's beautiful second , i have a huge computer , its a hp envy dv # notebook pc . # . # `` and the <unk> pro fits my computer perfectly not too snug , but not loss at all i think the hp envy might be on the slimmer side of the # `` world ; but i 'm not well <unk> in computer <unk> also the interior is decently padded the material seems to be high quality the handle feels nice and looks like it will last with there being plenty of extra room in the two side pockets for anything else needed : a folder , power cord , mouse , etc .
beautiful , strong case the color is fabulous my # inch computer <unk> perfectly and in the side pockets i can place the cables and my notebook or documents i absolutely recommend it
i like that this sleeve is lightweight and not bulky it fits my macbook air # . # perfectly i really like that it has no zippers to worry about and that i will be able to charge my little mac air without removing it from the sleeve the only reason that i did not give it # stars is that i would have liked a bit more coverage for the flap - another half inch there i think making the flap # & # # ; would have been perfect
hi everyone , i got this case hoping it would fit my new samsung chromebook # . # with the arm processor the device fit in , but the gap for the flap was big and didnt protect a significant area of the chromebook the case itself is great it was constructed well , had no smell and the felt was ultra plush it had much more protection than the case i had to buy to replace it by protection , i mean extra <unk> if you have a macbook , i would not hesitate to buy this case
this case is amazingly snug on the macbook air the speck pixelsleeve has a great look , no zippers which means no scratches , soft velvety feel on the inside , and has nice texture for grip on the outside it pretty much is the perfect case but smells like burning rubber this may fade in the next few weeks but for now it 's a bit bothersome when having it nearby if you have a sensitive nose just beware edit : burning rubber smell is gone after #
i wanted a sleeve that i could leave in my messenger bag and easily slip my # `` air into & out of this is n't exactly what i had in mind , but it worked out fine the flap is very tight , which means that you have to take the entire sleeve out of the bag to get the air in/out this means that it 's a pretty secure sleeve most of the time , i slip the air into the sleeve and do n't take the time to pull the flap over this way the air is mostly protected and i do n't have to pull the sleeve out of my bag the padding is memory foam and it protects really well , but weighs a bit more than i wanted my scale says it 's # grams , or about # ounces a little heavier than i was expecting but not too bad the sleeve is really well made and i would buy from this company again
i was pretty excited to get this sleeve but found it to be just ok it is snug , but i felt that it was not as svelte as i wanted it to be once in this pixel sleeve , the whole thing with the macbook air just felt bulkier than i like it to be definitely the sleeve will protect from bumps and scratches with all that padding , but i guess i was expecting something slimmer
i bought this item for my # -inch macbook air as other customers mention , it is a very snug fit i like the lack of zippers and therefore zero chance of scratching my computer casing i feel very good about putting my computer in any bag with this case on , and it does n't add much bulk at all highly recommended case for traveling light and safe
i am really enjoying this sleeve this is the second speck accessory that i own , i have a speck case for my iphone # gs what i like about this sleeve is that there is no zipper to scratch the macbook air this was a main reason for buying the speck product it also looks very nice and i can sit the sleeve under the air to protect the bottom of the notebook from getting scratched overall a very good product that is well made and does exactly what it 's suppose to
i am very happy with this cover / sleeve i use it for my # & # # ; mac air and it works great it is a secure fit , but not difficult to get on or off and it <unk> through airport security overall it works great to protect my air , fits well , and looks sharp
not sure why some are commenting on the snug fit that 's what it 's all about for me once you learn how to slip the computer in , it 's a cinch - - fold back the cover flap flat to the back , slip in the computer , fold the flap back snug
performed exactly like i wanted the good reviews are true to form no issues with stitching or size if you are looking for something that keeps the mac air small to travel in a backpack this is the cover you 'll
very light , flexible and offers the protection i expected from this sleeve i own another # & # # ; sleeve -lrb- other vendor -rrb- which is faux-leather i like minimalistic looks for these types of items and immediately remove any logos since they stray from the simplicity the logo was easy to remove the interior of the sleeve is a soft & # # ; <unk> & # # ; it is a little tight to fold the flap over the top , but that 's better than being too loose
this is exactly what i was looking for : a sleeve that would keep my macbook safe , without adding any bulk , and without requiring me to take it out of the sleeve at airport security if you 're looking for high quality protection for your # -inch macbook air while you 're traveling , and do n't want anything with bulky straps or fancy <unk> , i think you 'll love this product
this messenger bag looks nice , but the strap is very painful if you have a normal sized textbook in it a bag with a padded strap is definitely better if you are a student
this bag is cute yet i used it for only one month and the threading came apart and the following day the zipper came off it is n't a good bag for a college student i carried only # books in it at a time and it could n't hold up i would just spend the extra money and get something worth buying
i received this bag for christmas from my <unk> , it had been on my wishlist for a while the only reason i had not purchased this bag was the wide <unk> of customer satisfaction it 's an attractive bag the photo accurately represents the style and color unfortunately within # weeks of use the snap on the front pocket tore out and within a week of that the main zipper pulled off i did n't over pack the bag , though normal college use can be considered hard use the other problem is the fabric started fraying away from the zipper with in the first few days of use nice looking bag , but not worth purchasing
we bought this for my daughter to use as a school bag and expected that being a canvas bag it would be durable enough for school use after a couple weeks one of the buckles stitching came undone and the stitching around the zipper had broken it is <unk> not nearly as well built as we expected for the price she has not overloaded it , just school book weight in the bag i do not expect it to last the school year
meant to write this ages ago i still use this bag , but it sucks that the zipper had a super long thread pulled from the day i got it i hate sending things back so i clipped it and watched as it pulled more by the weeks end if the stitching were better i 'd say this is a great bag
bought this for my # . # laptop and it only fits if i put it in just the right way without a lot of other stuff in the main compartment still it is cool looking and holds alot
it was a good looking bag , but it came with a messed up zipper i complained about it & was told that i would receive a new item , & i never did
as i said in the title , i like this messenger bag ; nice pockets and nice material however ... there is a tear in the seams in the front of the bag near the top zipper this is going to be a bit of a pain to get fixed since it is on a corner and -- of course -- means three seams <unk> at one spot i 'm not a fan of having to pay my own return costs , so i guess you could add this review to the seller review as well i should not have to pay to return a defective product
i absolutely love the look of this bag and the canvas material itself if really durable that being said , the color comes off onto my hands i had to wash the bag # times before i could carry it without the color leaking and it still took another couple of washes to stop the color coming off whenever i would reach my hands into the bag the shoulder strap does n't stay in the position i put it , so as i walk , the bag <unk> further and further down the inner divider is n't sturdy but that 's not a concern for me so much however , after only # months of `` light use `` -lrb- carrying a jacket , a kindle , a small umbrella and maybe some snacks -rrb- , both of the clips broke and the zipper is having issues it 's really too bad because i do love the look and the different storage compartments
i bought this bag for school and i 've been using it for # weeks now i can fit # , # `` binders , # medium text books , a # subject note book , and my # `` macbook air there 's # pockets besides the big main one the clips are cheap and the snap on the front pocket is cheap as well but the material and zippers are sturdy the strap is not a comfort strap so when the bag has binders , text books , and laptop it dose cut into you my classes are close together or i would have more of an issue in all i got to say i like my school bag , it 's very unique
this is my first messenger style bag and i really like it i keep a couple of technical books for work , my lunch , gloves , phone , water bottle , etc . and there 's still plenty of room left for many other things -lrb- like a laptop -rrb- i do n't know how well it would work for school toting around # plus full sized text books , but it works perfectly for my commute to work and back my only complaint would be that i find myself having to adjust the strap once a day or so because the strap adjuster slides around a bit to freely edit : -lrb- # / # -rrb- last week , my bags main seatbelt style snap broke off i would n't say i snapped it off roughly , but i was n't paying attention and i guess it got away from me <unk> the breaks i guess i feel like this bag was a little young for me anyway i 'm gon na look for something a little more grown up this time
as with everything i 've ordered through amazon , this arrived in wonderful condition and much sooner than expected i do n't mind the bag to be honest , it 's just that online it appears much lighter in colour and has that `` vintage `` look that drew me to it i have a <unk> for the unusual , things with character this was just too `` new `` looking for me i will likely be returning it , but for no other reason than that
this bag is adorable i ordered it for my daughter as a school bag , however , she struggles to cram her things in it every morning before school she still has to carry her lunch and water bottle <unk> but like i said , it 's very cute maybe just not for a student with lots of homework
i 'm using it for school and i love it , it fit a laptop and # regular sized textbooks in it plus pockets for pens , calculator , planner , and other supplies has a pocket on the backside -lrb- do n't know what it 's really for -rrb- that i put in some firm backing to give it a stiffness , helps protect your laptop and makes it better in my opinion
book bag for a middle schooler the bag has a lot of space , and does not get wet in the rain with a # -inch binder and three <unk> hardcover books , as well as some novels for reading classes , all fitting in , this bag is not doing badly it exceeded our expectations in terms of space my son loves it we 're just waiting to see if it holds up i 'll be back in # months to <unk> it
well made , sturdy backpack that can can carry so much more than a laptop it is checkpoint friendly which was a big consideration because airport security requirement can be a pain
i got a great deal for this bag it fits all of my books , laptop and more i had to wait for more than # days , but it was worth it for this price
i bought this from another reputable vendor when on sale i 've had it for a few weeks and it is very good for what i paid for it the straps are well contoured as well and the back , the weight is distributed well and the zippers are large and strong so lots of pros the only con is the fact that there are no inner zipping pockets , or not more small pockets since it 's a laptop bag , lots of us have dongles and usb drives and small cords that are needed , and there are very few inner pockets to accommodate this need so not a major problem but one that could have easily been addressed all in all , a worthy buy and one i would make again at the current price -lrb- $ # -rrb- or less
this was ordered as a gift for an it person that is on the road a lot between many locations he was <unk> with the areas where he could put tools and not only the laptop but there was room for a surface or ipad and any other connectivity items nice and solid product it cam quickly and it was well packaged
i 'm a fan of swissgear products , this backpack does not <unk> . i use it for the gym , to travel , and of course to hold my laptop and it comes with pretty good protection for it i recommend it #
the case fits fine , but i was disappointed because i also received one with the circle around the apple instead of a complete cut out the pictures are deceiving because they show both kinds the seller definitely should make that more clear because they only reason i chose this case was because the pictures showed the apple cut out also , there is scratches all over i guess the purpose of a case is to get roughed up , but i did not expect it to look like it had a battle with a set of keys this seller seems to have provided false advertisement and i do not recommend this case to anyone
the case i received was not the case in the photos the case i got is not `` see through black `` and has a circle cut out on the top instead of the apple logo the bottom does n't even fit on my macbook , it is n't even close to fitting the case is too square to fit the newer macbooks i do not recommend this case to anyone unfortunately this seller does not allow returns so basically if you buy this case you are wasting your money my case has scratches all over it , and is made out of cheap plastic attempting to put this case on might even scratch up the sides of your macbook do not buy this product
this product is flimsy and cheap and not even the right fit no packing slip included and -- considering other reviews -- not much hope for getting my money back if i did decide to spring for return shipping i gambled on this one and lost
the top part of the case fits but not the bottom there are two parts that seem like they should click in somewhere but do n't will avoid this seller in the future
it cracked within a week of purchasing literally , cracked in multiple places and in pieces little by little each day i do n't know how that happened being that i am very gentle with my laptop , it 's lasted me this long for a reason wish i could get a refund ! ! wo n't be purchasing again
it sucks , they promise to send the case with the apple shape but not ` true -lrb- see all # customer images -rrb- not ' true arrives with round hole do not buy it sucks
i bought a macbook from my friend and wanted to cover the scratches on the top cover so i ordered this one to keep things simple and protect it from any further damage unfortunately , when the cover came in , it was covered in scratches , i guess due to the shipment the only thing that was protecting the plastic cover from damages was a thin layer of plastic i was very unhappy about this
not really what i was expecting but other than that it was okay i liked the fact that i got it really quick i just do n't like that circle thing in the front
i ordered this case assuming that it would fit my # & # # ; macbook i was wrong the top part of the case does not match up . it fits but the apple logo does not fit inside the circle the bottom does not even snap on i should of never ordered this case would not recommend getting . . it looks as if it is not even designed for the macbook # & # #
i bought my case about # months ago , it is the first case i have ever needed for my macbook -lrb- bought in early ' # -rrb- because i a very careful with my computer this case is literally falling apart the edges of the bottom piece are cracking and falling off the top piece is cracked and chipping away at every corner as well as cracks all through the many body of it very poor quality
the case did n't securely fit onto my macbook one little drop and it cracked being put in and out of my bag , deep scratches were made the case added a lot of bulk but little protection
this is not what i expected to receive the case is bulky and doesnt fit the # model well at all my kids ordered a nicer one for less money from a different company not pleased at all i have been very pleased with amazon until this order the apple is offset through the hole that they have in the case
when i initially received this cover , i loved however , after it was installed , it cracked easily i returned it and the seller did not refund my money stating that he did non receive it i was not happy but learned the importance of keeping the tracking number from the shipment .
the item took weeks to receive they said it was lost the first time but sent me a replace my without any questions making me think it was never shipped and they wanted me to forget a out it it was packaged poorly and a corner was broken the window that shows the apple logo through it was n't even centered it is a very thick plastic and it adds a lot of bulk to the laptop overall , poor design
not what you should get reading the other product reviews they said the cases they got were made to fit the mac and had the apple cut out so i thought that would be the case here and it was not it is a case for a dell computer that they are saying also fits the macbook , but it looks crappy and does not fit , the apple does not even line up in the center of the circle i also had to contact the seller about receiving the wrong case to start , and now its not worth the shipping to return the item
it has a circle cut out in the top cover dirt gets into that area also , there are # cracks around the circle , and on the corners of the left side of both the top and bottom covers my friend ordered one two years ago and it is in perfect condition i surely got one of inferior quality i wish i could get my money back i was so excited about ordering it and now i am disappointed
i bought this case mainly as protection for my laptop for that it is fine , but it 's much <unk> and cheaper looking than the picture suggests also , this case is not the same color as depicted - do n't buy it thinking that the case will match the keyboard , because it does n't
there is a cutout in the back of the lcd lid that 's suppose to allow the apple logo be seen but it 's not centered it really comes off as cheesy and ca n't be corrected no matter what you do
was excited to receive it just to find out the case does n't fit the keypad cover is fine though which is the only reason im not going to bother with trying to get a refund
this case is bulky and does n't snap on to my macbook i have the required model , however it was designed poorly it does not come with the keyboard cover and it 's does n't even come with the promotional mousepad i would recommend buying a different product if possible however , it has protected my computer from things here and there but i 'm just not sure it 's worth it
the product came in quickly however i was disappointed that the keyboard cover was not included the picture and only review made me believe that it came with the keyboard cover , however once i received the package without it i looked at the description and realized it did not explicitly say it was included besides that the product looks pretty good the feet at the bottom are made out of a foam type material
be careful when buying it has very let me repeat very sharp edges recommend sanding the edges or something i accidentally brushed my hand over the palm part of the laptop and next thing i knew i was bleeding from the sharp edges so just be
i would love it if only it fitted my laptop since my macbook was discontinued it is hard to find a case that fits it pay attention to the measurements
this case is meant for the # model but it does n't seem to fit correctly , it feel like the case will fall right off for the price that i got this case for it 's okay and it does the job made my old laptop pink , which i wanted so it works okay there is n't many places that make these older cases so there was n't many options
it is an okay case it is bulky and does n't fit that well , but it works like it should it 's almost impossible to find cases for the old white macbooks now , so i will take what i can get
i like that the case protects the machine from scratches it fits on the a # just right except that the circle does not go exactly around the apple it is off quite a bit but i 'd rather it protects the machine so i do n't care that much and for $ # i ca n't really complain also ordered the matching <unk> cover i like that but it collects so much dust underneath it drives me crazy it does fit right but the & # # ; f & # # ; key markings are incorrect , luckily i already know what they do and do n't require the cover to tell me
my macbook with the case look like more big and weight a lot : / when i go out with the lap i have to take the case . the case is fine
it 's alright it does n't fit perfectly and is alittle bulky but i dont know i didnt expect much either so i guess you defiantly get your moneys worth also a couple corners and <unk> and cracks have happened to it i think im going to order a new one soon one that fits better i have macbook
i got my product very fast its durable , but the only thing i do n't like is that the case has an open circle for the apple logo if i would have known that i would n't of bought it other then that the case is durable , not cheaply made
very stiff plastic with a hole cut sort of where the apple logo is but off center on the heavy side i do n't like it much , but it will do the job until i can find something nicer
edges are sharp and i keep scraping my <unk> however it protects the computer i do have a newer computer and newer version of the cover too , and that one is
this case is hard no <unk> whatsoever what makes it below my standards though is that the tabs that catch the front of the computer sit above the arm rest and scratch your arms that said , covers for the old mac are hard to find , which brings this up to # stars from the two i 'd otherwise give it
i got this product about # weeks ago and it has been working pretty well but it has cracked in two places on the corners and it doesnt seem to fit very well it was also hard to put on but it does do its job of protecting the laptop with style for a low cost compared to others
functional and just how it was pictured the hole in the top of the case is a bit <unk> with my laptop but it serves its purpose arrived earlier than expected which was very nice
top and bottom pieces fit fine and i think improve the flat black finish small blemishes disappear of course scratches in the clear plastic will start even with careful handling still a worthwhile addition
the color is great on this and it 's a durable plastic however the edges around the plastic are kinda sharp the plastic rubs right under the wrists where your wrists lay on the keyboard it 's okay , for a short while but wouldnt recomend if you have to write a long paper and spend a couple hours on the computer
fits perfect , i wish the back where the apple is located was not a cut out . it could look better there but i 'm glad it fits it does however crack easily since it is a plastic case
i read a few review , and i still went ahead and bought the products the product is definitely better than what the reviewers mentioned for a macbook # nd generation i would recommend this product
it 's really hard to find a case for my # year old laptop i bought one of these a year ago and am finally having to replace it be careful putting it on because you do n't want to have to take it off prematurely , as it might scratch overall , it 's really durable and pretty i only gave it # stars because it can kinda ruin your laptop if you are n't careful and i expected it to last longer i had my old case for # years i get lots of
the hard shell case was a perfect fit for my older white a # model macbook . just took a few mins to install it brought back new life to a very old
i ordered this cover on thursday and had it by saturday it may have even been delivered on friday but i did n't check the mail that day the color is very cool - kind of iridescent installation took all of # seconds -lrb- it took longer to remove the protective wrap it came in .
the case is made out of a hard plastic , which works well for me , but if you have small children that like to get there hands on your laptop you may want something a little bit more sturdy if you were to drop the laptop it would definitely break the case the case just snaps on over your laptop so there is no scratching , which it does protect it from that works well for me no problems so far
took me a second to realize i put it on wrong and when you get it on the sucker is there to stay took forever to take it off and put it on right
fits my white macbook a # perfectly anyone who said it does n't fit theirs does n't know how to check the model number of their computer decent quality but great for the price
i was hesitant to order this envelope for my ipad # because i was concerned about it being too bulky , and it really is the zippered interior pocket is pretty small , even to store the charger , and adds additional material also the envelope style closure adds a lot of bulk around the top there 's not anything actually wrong with it but if you are looking for something slim and flat this is not it
this is a great little envelope which i 'm sure fits ipads well i bought it going off the measurements for my new surface although the measurements indicated that it should fit and provide protection , i found it to be very slightly too <unk> to make it useful for the surface i wo n't be returning it because the amount i would get back would only cover the cost to return it i 'll keep it and if i meet someone who needs and ipad cover , i 'll simply gift it to them
the item worked flawlessly the item had excellent quality and workmanship the price was much lower than other similar units with the same features description and <unk> was accurate and acceptable i would buy again from this vendor
bought for my ipad # , works perfectly i agree it does n't fit much -lrb- like the charger -rrb- however i 'd rather it be smaller and not fit more items just wanted it to protect my ipad when it 's in my bag going to and from places and it does exactly that ! would definately recommend
got this as a case for my mac mini , for the longest time i had been searching for a pocket case for my device and only this item made me happy
i sent this one back mainly because of its size however , the bag seemed <unk> and really no match for its competitors it 's a bag , it holds stuff , but there 's not a lot of protection
i have a macbook pro # `` laptop and while it is a laptop , it does n't leave my home very often however , for those few time that i take it out with me , i needed a well-designed and protective bag to carry it in the built messenger bag fit the purpose beautifully it looks great , is minimalistic and formfitting in design , and the neoprene material provides adequate padding but after having owned this for about # months and light use , i just discovered a small wear spot that had gone through the material of the bag where one of the corners of my macbook is this area felt thinner than the rest of the bag and that might have been caused by the material having to stretch a bit around the macbooks corners i feel that built could have reinforced this area of the neoprene somehow to ensure that the bag lasts longer i mean , it is pretty disappointing to find such a hole in my bag after just # months of very little use
i have a built lunch tote that i love , so i decided to order a messenger bag , too it 's just ok it fits my # & # # ; <unk> , as well as books and a notepad , without any problems , but the shoulder strap is a bit stiff i suspect this will soften with time , but for not it is uncomfortable to carry
good looking and light , i like it i do n't know why do i need to type so many words the words i said here are all true , it 's just good for this sales price
this is a good small laptop bag the only flaw is that it has velcro to hold the flap closed and when you put too much things in it the flap will not stay closed other than that the bag is great i think this bag is worth $ # i paid a little more but i am still happy with my purchase
this is a really nice bag , the shoulder strap does n't move so it 's continually comfortable i have n't used it for my laptop yet but i 'm sure my # & # # ; would fit fine , lots of great dividers and pretty rugged
it is one of the best messenger bags i ever had . so neat and modern ! i liked the materials that it made from . now i can be sure that my apple macbook pro is well
