it is as nice as it looks but so heavy i ordered it after reading other reviews about it 's weight thinking how bad could it be they were right had to return it looks great , could n't imagine carrying it around everyday
i searched the net for days to find a tote large enough for a # `` widescreen notebook that had some style to it my laptop definitely fits but there is hardly room in the pockets for my charger , much less a wallet of any size i love the style and the design , but wish it were thicker and the pockets deeper
i bought a laptop that is quite large and then had difficulty finding a bag to transport i wanted something stylish and functional did n't want to look like my teenage son with a backpack ... this fits and looks wonderful only complaint is , it is heavy on it 's own , not to mention when i put my laptop and any paperwork in the case
i ca n't tell you how frustrating it has been trying to find a nice bag for my # inch laptop this is just what i was looking for plenty of room for the computer and few extra supplies
i needed a bigger bag to fit my new # `` laptop , and it fits perfectly in this bag the bag has three compartments on the outside , covered by a flap , for plane tickets , etc . inside are more compartments , loops to hold pens , and even a small detachable <unk> bag the laptop section is padded and has a velcro strap on top to <unk> you computer in place the only downside is that the bag is heavy add your notebook and it is really heavy not so you ca n't carry it . . but if you have to use this on a very regular basis , i would get something with wheels i only occasionally have to carry my notebook , so this is not a problem
this bag is huge with room for my peripherals , tablet and any other thing i may want to carry with my # . # inch laptop it 's great that i could find a stylish bag that does not look like a laptop bag the one negative i have to say is that it 's a little heavy
this bag is really big i got it and used it for about a week , but found that it 's just too big for what i needed it 's sitting under my desk collecting dust it does have great pockets and is a great design ... just too big for me
this was exactly as i had expected it is the perfect fit for my # `` laptop i love all the separate compartments and it looks sharp too i would highly recommend this bag to anyone
the only downside to this is that when you have your # `` macbook pro inside ; it can get a tad bit heavy also when flying , the case takes up most if not all the leg room under the seat in front of you it feels pro , quality made very happy with this
i just love it i will only be using this every once in a while , but i am more than thrilled with how it looks it was not easy to find a feminine looking bag for such a big laptop
i 'd prefer that this case fit my hp laptop a little more snugly it 's way too loose for my hp pavilion a handle would also be nice well constructed and the zipper accessory compartment is great
well it is a very good sleeve to keep your laptop in if you 're going to be <unk> it around in a briefcase or a backpack -lrb- which i do -rrb- but it is a little bit to large for a # . # `` laptop i have my dell studio xps # in it and it still has a good inch and half of play in the top the sipper pocket on the fron is great to store things in and it seems to keep everything nice and safe i wish it had some sort of handle on it though , but then i guess it would n't be called a sleeve
ordered it for the extra storage area -lrb- with it 's own zipper -rrb- and i love that part about it could basically use it as a daily laptop case if you stick the power adapter in there it 's not as <unk> as maybe some other sleeves , but in my case this is just for rare use or to cover my laptop if i need to throw it in a <unk> it is a lot bigger than i thought , though i saw the measurements and figured my # . # `` t # p with the # cell battery would pretty much fill it up , but there is almost # . # `` of room in there length wise it 's not such a bad thing because it allows more stuff to fit in there , but if you want a <unk> sleeve , make sure you take a close look at the measurements
this offers great protection for my laptop and the zipper pocket is very nice it is a bit too big for my dell latitude d # , so i did not give it # stars i had a hard time researching how big it would be otherwise it was great
i do n't travel much and i already had a messenger bad that i usually carry my books and stuff i just wanted something with a little bit of protection for my laptop this products serves this purpose its not heavily padded and the fit on my # . # vaio of not perfect its a little bit bigger than it should be but its still fits in my bag
this fits my computer perfectly i can not use the side pockets to put anything more than a usb drive in though , it gets too stretched out and distorted however i have only had it now for one semester of law school and it is already ripping along the edge
i purchased it seeing the # `` size in the description and was not sure if this was meant for a # . # `` but , when you receive the package and pull the sleeve out of the box the packaging surrounding the sleeve says # . # `` i almost turned to a friend and gave it to him thinking it just might not fit my new toshiba i had an old sleeve that fit like a glove on my old # . # , but would n't fit my new # `` this new sleeve fits the sides snugly , but i have about a one inch gap at the top when the zipper is closed i use this gap space for just cords and cables the pocket on the side -lrb- on the top if laying flat -rrb- are pass-through you open both sides of the pocket -lrb- zippered -rrb- and you can put your whole arm through the opening the pocket has enough room for my power cord , external hdd , and ext wireless mouse hope this review helps
i bought the # `` case logic student laptop shuttle for my # . # `` apple macbook pro and it was definitely too big , not in length , but in the shorter of the two dimensions the computer slides around too much at first , i thought the size difference would not matter , but it is too big by about # . # `` , somewhat defeating the purpose of protecting my computer the zippered pockets on the outside are a great feature so if you have a <unk> laptop , this probably is a great choice
this fits my # inch toshiba laptop perfectly the first time i used it it seemed a little snug , but as i have used it more it has stretched out just a bit as a previous reviewer noted , it has about an inch or so space at the top , as to `` pinch `` it to help pick it up what is not shown in the picture is that the additional side pocket has two -lrb- # -rrb- zippers - one on each side i had originally thought it was just a pass-through pocket , which made me hesitate in buying it but it is great storage area for the power source , wireless mouse and other small stuff for # bucks , you ca n't beat it i would absolutely recommend this product
this is a well made quality case it wo n't provide the full protection you would get from a laptop bag , obviously , but it does protect your laptop from scratches and it keeps all your computer bits together , while traveling it fit my toshiba satellite perfectly
i bought this for a toshiba satellite # . # `` screen laptop it has a tiny bit of extra space around the edges , but that 's fine since it was n't <unk> for that computer the outside pocket is great for all the cords -lrb- plus my cellphone and ipod charging cords -rrb- great accessory for someone who wants to slip the notebook into a traditional briefcase my son has the same thing for his macbook -lrb- which was <unk> for the computer -rrb- and he is also very happy
i bought this product a couple of months ago while looking for a solution to carry my # -inch laptop on my own back , along with books and things i use on college it 's great , protects from scratches and the pocket is nice for carrying my wireless mouse , usb flash drives or blank cds
it 's a bit thick overall , but it has a ton of pockets for some of my gear , the pockets are a bit tight , but perhaps i 'm asking too much i want a thin case with thick storage i need something bigger on the inside than it is on the outside like a <unk> , but i suspect i 'm unlikely to find that in the real world but , it 's pretty thin , holds lots of stuff and provides good protection for my laptop i suspect that 's all i could ask for
great for mac but some of the pockets are <unk> i am happy for what i use it for , but its only for a computer not really to carry paperwork or much of anything
well , i had just bought a dell xps m # , and it did n't come with a case ... and i figured i needed one for when i wanted to travel i <unk> online and read a review saying how `` so and so `` bought this case for his xps so i decided to give it a try this case is well worth the money i go to college and i put my class books in along with the computer itself it has a lot of compartments for my things , keys , mouse , pens , calculator , phone and other things the strap is comfortable and i like the fact that it can stand up on it 's own overall this case is an excellent buy
i got this bag for my # . # inch toshiba u # it has a very comfortable handle and strap i would guess that it could accommodate # inch laptops as well it could be # inches smaller in all dimensions to still hold the # . # inch laptop the size of the bag will not let you easily store papers or notebooks i am pleased with the purchase and have recommended it to friends looking for a bag
i love my case logic # inch laptop case my # . # `` hp laptop fits perfectly and it is lightweight and well made i strongly recommend it and i 'm even thinking about buying another for my wife 's # `` macbook
i could n't ask for a better laptop bag it fits my laptop perfectly with battery and still has room left for a book the other compartment holds your ipod , cd 's , and other accessories it has metal hooks for the strap so you feel comfortable that its not gon na break like those cheap plastic hooks
this product did not fit my laptop -lrb- # . # `` mac -rrb- snuggly enough it moves around a lot , thus <unk> its purpose to protect my laptop i just kept it because i did not want to go through the trouble of shipping it back and researching for another # hours on a good laptop case the only pro about this is that it can fit a lot of stuff in its pocket be careful though , b/c since you 're putting stuff in the pocket -lrb- top -rrb- , the top of your laptop faces the bottom of the case ... thus reducing the protection of the laptop case yet again i suggest for customers to just buy one in-store
some people said this `` fits like a glove `` on the macbook i have to disagree i was disappointed when i found loose space and that it slides around a little there is n't too much padding , so do n't expect that , but i purchased this so that my computer would n't get scratched , and this case serves nicely for that purpose
fits new aluminum # . # `` mb not perfect but pretty close i like the outer sleeve to hold the magsafe adapter , a small pair of <unk> headphones , and the cloth that comes with the computer i feel more secure when i have my computer in my backpack
this laptop sleeve has a pocket for the adapter , which was an absolutely necessity for me the sleeve itself just barely fits my <unk> hp pavilion tx # , which is # `` but has a protruding battery , and i also managed to cram in my targus cool mat it cushions everything admirably , and i see no reason to not review it <unk>
this is a great way to prevent scratches , etc . on the mac air if you prefer to keep it in a backpack , etc . easy zipper opening and i like the outside pocket to hold the adapter , etc . it does not fit snug but serves the purpose of protecting your investment
had this product since # now and its great i have no problems with it my laptop is protected with it and the pouch in the front holds the charger no problems with the seller either
i 've used this sleeve for my old white macbook and now my new aluminum macbook pro for # years now i 've used it everyday since the beginning of my college life it fits in my backpack with ease and it holds my pencils and my headphones in the pockets highly recommend it it has a red finish on the inside which is my favorite color
i transport my laptop back and forth between home and work laptop bags tend to protect and hold laptops well , but not much else with the case logic # `` black student shuttle , i can use my ergonomic backpack and rest assured that my laptop and its accessories are safe i highly recommend this product
i recently purchased the new <unk> macbook and it fits perfectly inside this case this case is very soft and the outside pocket is very convenient for a wiping cloth and magsafe charger worth the purchase
i was worried about my new macbook pro # . # `` not fitting because all the other reviews talked about # `` macbook i was n't sure if the old generation # `` macbook had the same dimensions as the new <unk> # . # `` macbook pro well , if you 're wondering the same thing as i did , worry not ; it fits
i 've used this for two laptops now it fits fairly well , the zippers are sturdy , and the fabric is good it 's not super thick so it 's not going to protect it really well but it 's great for if you just want to carry the laptop and a charger without a case i wish it had a handle and i know they make them that way but just purchased this one at the time i actually still use it for my lenovo x # and just use the extra slack to carry it around as a handle the pocket is fantastic and has a zipper on both sides perfect for a charger and some thumb drives
i owned the # . # `` version of this with my previous notebook so when i got my new tablet pc i immediately looked for a smaller version of my previous one and found this it works great at protecting my tablet from scratches and fits like a glove on my hp tx # z tablet
pros : for me , the added pocket was the main reason i chose this model i was amazed just how many other components i 'm able to carry with me beside the power adapters one of the other things i was quite impress by , was the level of quality construction case logic put into this sleeve for twenty dollars , this item cant be beat a handle or shoulder strap would be nice , and i could do without the case logic logo tags all over
my # `` g # powerbook fits inside snugly ; perfectly there is a handy utility pocket that zips up & holds a few incidentals - cables , battery etc . this was priced a bit high but it fits and performs as advertised
pro : strong , good-looking , convenient zippered shuttle , gives good protection to the laptop , and suitable space for adapter or mouse . con : too small for ibook -lrb- mine is ibook # `` g # -rrb- , but suitable for my girl 's ibm x # , although a little bit tight b/c she uses # -cell battery
i know some gave poor reviews for this product fitting the ibook i own a powerbook # `` g # so i got it because the positive reviews said it would fit well with it and true enough , it fits very well very good quality for such a cheap price i like how there 's also a little pocket with a zipper too to store an adapter or other things
such a great case , my dell laptop slides into this case very snuggly -- and then fits into any other bag far superior to having one of those outrageously large laptop bags
when i purchased this for my ibook # inch g # i was a bit nervous based on some of the reviews saying it did not fit , i can clear up some of that it fits like a <unk> glove and not a <unk> the fit is snug and will undoubtedly stretch over time , which is exactly what i wanted if you want a sloppy , just throw it into the bag kind of fit , do n't buy a neoprene case this was exactly what i wanted , though a slightly thicker neoprene would be better
only one handle keeps from carrying this bag briefcase like the bag always tips forward , so you will always need to use the shoulder strap if they had sewn in another handle to offset the balance , this would have been the perfect bag otherwise , it fits the ipad and other items in it like it promised
it was a great bag , perfect size for # tablets and accessories i barely put my stuff in it and the outside zipper fell off tried to get <unk> , no luck i do not know if it was just a fluke or bad design very disappointed as targus is usually very good would like another one , but am apprehensive
i like everything about this case except the one handle it throws the balance of the case off when carrying it it would have been so easy to make it with two handles otherwise , it 's fine
this is a good looking case it would be good to see some more zippered pockets in it and for the zippered pockets to stay more securely closed the zippered compartment that is under the flap keeps sliding open slightly that does not make for a very secure case the other thing that needs to be changed on this case is to either center the handle or add an extra handle so that it does not lean to one side when it is being carried
one thing i did n't notice about the design of this product when i purchased it on amazon is the absence of a second short handle if the short handle was designed to be placed in the center it would not be an issue , but it 's `` seated `` as if there should be an opposing handle if you choose not to use the shoulder strap and use this in a `` briefcase `` manner there is an odd <unk> i do n't like when i hold it this way
husband 's purchase he seems to like it from what i 've seen it 's sharp looking and has a lot of compartments it is sturdy feeling too . # stars instead of # just because it 's a little smaller than he thought it would be he likes to carry a ton of stuff so it is going to be important to not weigh it down too much ; i 'd hate for it to rip but so far so good
i would highly recommend this bag i 've had it for a while now , and its very solid and has plenty of space often i 'll keep my # . # laptop , a stack of papers , a couple of books and the charger and mouse there is still plenty of room for more in the front pockets though it has nice lines and looks sporty compared to most bags the strap is very comfortable too ; well padded and fitted nicely the only reason i take away a star is because the strap harness squeaks when i walk i 'm sure i could fix this with some oil but i 'm too lazy
it seems very nicely made and is nice and sturdy the only reason i gave it # stars and not # is because with the ipad in a protective case it is a struggle getting it in the bag
the case is very secure , if i dropped it on asphalt the mini would be protected it has ample room for more then one mini which makes if even more valuable
messenger bag is built very well , and does n't feel cheap i bought it to use with a microsoft surface tablet and would say that if you are buying it for that purpose it is a tight fit the surface is too big to fit in the spot it was designed to fit in , but fits in next to that spot i am taking off one star simply for the fact of limited space for other tablets i realize that it is specifically designed for the ipad , but could have been made with slightly more room to accommodate other tablets as not everyone will buy into the apple <unk>
when i do n't need my laptop , this case does a great job of carrying the essentials i can slide the ipad mini , some paperwork , pens and business cards in , and i 'm off i found the shoulder strap a little short and unnecessary , so i took it off docked a star because the strap on the back , which is supposed to allow you to slide the case over a suitcase handle , is n't wide enough for my suitcase i bought a black bungee cord , and that does the job
the bag is great , but the only problem is the squeaking at the place where the shoulder strap is connected to the bag its irritating while you walk the bag itself is spacious and smart looking since there is only one handle the bag tends to lean forward when carried using the handle overall , its a good bag the squeaking can be fixed with a drop of oil as such
got the package right on time with no problem examined it and it is all i expected of a targus case very well made and designed would buy from this seller again with no problem
i purchased the targus case for my ipad hoping to have something that hold the ipad , plus an easy way to carry around cords , chargers , stylus pens , etc . the case does a good job of this -lrb- although i wish one would come out that would also hold a keyboard -rrb- this makes it easy when traveling to have everything in one place the case is stylish and light everything fits inside without any problems my only complaint is with the handles : they are only on one side of the case , which means the case does n't hang straight down when walking , this makes carrying the case <unk> it would have been useful to put the handle in the middle on top , or have two handles to provide balance
i have been wanting this bag since a long time though i had never seen it in person , pictures on amazon and targus sites were <unk> of the same it is a great bag with loads of compartments -lrb- actually , i kind of get lost in them sometimes . . but that is me unable to organize -rrb- it is not too heavy but study enough has very good padding and yes , the most important , feel on the back - it just sits right on the shoulders and does n't slip down them and the looks its my office 's envy !
nice bag that fits my ipad -lrb- or a netbook -rrb- snug in a seperate compartment . there is room in the outside compartment where i put my charger , a usb drive , pen and # size notebook the outside has a zipper where i drop my <unk> in when traveling through the airport overall a good back and you get that ecofriendly feel no real ` concerns ' , but if i had to say anything , the shoulder strap slides a bit and when you clip the front flap it does n't go as easy as others that being said , i am very happy with this and will be using it for a long time no need to take my laptop on short trips when my ipad can now accompany me and do the trick . recommended
like : it 's light , it 's small and it fits perfect for the few things we use it <unk> : it is front heavy , so if you hold it by the handle it will hang awkwardly all in all a good quality bag
i bought this bag for use in college with my toshiba satellite laptop i 'm an engineering major and need my laptop with me about # % of the time , and this bag fit the requirements almost perfectly able to store laptop , one textbook , one # `` binder , graphing calculator , <unk> , safety glasses , various pens , smaller notebook wish i could fit another textbook so i did n't have to go back to my car , but that is not a reflection of this product , i should have looked into that recycled material is very strong and all stitching seems great so far good compartments for <unk> devices too well-padded laptop compartment fits well and closes with a velcro strap across the top as comfortable as a laptop pack can be , though i 'm used to heavy loads overall i 'm very happy with this purchase
bought this for my wife she had a sling bag for her notebook , which can be quite a weight to lug around this backpack makes carrying her notebook a breeze , especially for travel she loves it
a beautiful case with a padded pocket inside that really protects a mini enough room left over for a paperback or mini magazine several additional zippered pockets for all sorts of extraneous stuff i keep a mini usb power adapter and cord tucked inside for on the go charging
as a mobile professional i was looking for a laptop backpack with sleek styling and a touch of flair i also needed a medium storage compartment for files and wanted to spend less than $ # this backpack met all my criteria i have been using it for just over a week and i like it very much the shoulder straps are very comfortable , the top handle is wide and sturdy and the backpack easily stands up without support so long as your load is decently balanced -lrb- this makes loading and unloading much easier -rrb- at current prices it is an excellent value i highly recommend it and would not trade it in for anything less than twice its price
i bought this for my boyfriend for his birthday his # . # & # # ; laptop fits great inside , with room for a book or two , and other small objects like a laptop charger , phone charger , pens , etc .
i was really impressed with this bag when it arrived it has plenty of pockets for various things and lots of space for my larger laptop i looked at at least a dozen bags before deciding on this one and am very happy with it
this is a nicely made travel case if i had my wishes though i would add a stylus holder and separate document pocket i use the provided pocket to hold a usb cable and chargers , and would appreciate a pocket for airline boarding passes etc .
i have had this carry bag for my ipad for quite a while and traveled with it all over the world it offers great protection and holds all the necessary equipment i need for the ipad i recommend this
this case is perfect for ipad it does protect efficiently your ipad , but also have enough <unk> for other accessories like cables or charger perfect for a fair price i only wish they have made it in different color . ps <unk> iit is also good for environment
awesome little messenger i use it for my ipad # love the inside color , green it protects my ipad perfectly it 's soo soft inside it has a zipper inside when the flap is opened which prevents my ipad from slipping off did n't notice the messenger was made from <unk> materials big plus for me i definitely recommend it
good , sturdy , and well thought out bought for my gf who went over to the dark side -lrb- ipad -rrb- and she loves it because it doubles as a small handbag when she wants to carry the ipad can carry the ipad and writing accessories , credit cards , makeup and much more
i love this bag it was a bit more than i wanted to pay but will save money in the long run because it is so well made and will last a very long time it has made it through an entire year of college for me -lrb- and i have been pretty rough on it -rrb- and it still looks the same as when i first bought it also , i love all the pockets
we have several pads about the house that need to be transported quite often i ordered this for my ipad air , but was pleasantly surprised to find that it will accomodate a kindle and nook in addition , but still is compact and will even fit inside my large laptop backpack the padding is excellent and there is a handy zippered pocket on the flap where i put chargers liked it so much i bought another for my girlfriend
bought this backpack to use for my # . # & # # ; laptop -lrb- thinkpad w # -rrb- this case fits it wonderfully lots of excellent padding , the handles are sturdy , zippers are solid , and i absolutely love the number and place of pockets it 's convenient , professional , sturdy , and stylish love it . # of my coworkers bought this exact same backpack after seeing mine , and we all could n't be more pleased with it it 's not super obvious from the pictures , but one concern that i had about this backpack was the <unk> lack of a center handle however , it 's discretely suspended between the two shoulder straps , and it 's quite easy to carry with one hand great price , great pack if you buy it , i doubt you 'll be disappointed
i recently bought a new dell inspiron # r laptop & was looking for a good quality backpack rather than the briefcase or messenger style bags i had used with my # in laptop this bag was perfect it has ample room for my laptop & has good padding around the laptop there are a ton of extra compartments on the bag & plenty of room should you choose to carry books , etc . for class i use mine for work & carry additional files , etc . my daughter is in college & saw it & now she wants one i would highly recommend it i think the construction & quality of the backpack is excellent
awesome and very comfortable bag with lots of pockets i 've had this bag for about a year but it is still great conditions you ca n't tell it ' s # year old it fits my macbook pro # `` perfectly -lrb- even with a sleeve cover on it -rrb- !
really pleased with this bag samsung <unk> # widescreen fits perfectly lots of room for other items , including charge cord and wireless mouse obviously well made , should last a long time being made of recycled material is an added bonus
i can fit my ipad , a small notebook , pens , hot spot and wallet in this bag with room to spare lightweight and well made i am going to buy a similar product for my laptop
for anyone wondering , the # . # `` <unk> tablet within the standing leather case -lrb- $ # . # -rrb- fits perfectly in the # . # `` targus <unk> <unk> mini messenger case moreover , there is also plenty of room for the kindle <unk> charger and both <unk> to usb and <unk> to hdmi cables if you want to take those along too nice looking bag , well designed and nicely finished
i got this bag for my work laptop which i carry everyday , either into the office or through the airport it is the perfect size and has stayed in great condition through my wear and tear
i bought this for a motorola xoom and it fits perfectly there is a divider in the middle , so i keep my xoom in the back section & whatever else i need in the front section the pocket under the flap holds pens & a stylus nicely i keep my phone and random stuff in the outside pocket it 's just what i needed
i have had this bag for a few months now and it works great has all the compartments i need for pens , paper , books , -lrb- laptop of course -rrb- , laptop connection stuff and some other features -lrb- music player holder -rrb- i have yet to use the only negative is the strap length i have been meaning to , but have not yet had time , to take it to a luggage store that fixes luggage i think they may be able to shorten it i 'm # ' # `` which is n't small and yet the shortest i can make it is still too long other than that , the bag is great
it has lots of useful storage and fits great into the small of my back , thus <unk> my back strain the drawback is the power adapter pocket at the bottom is small and is located in the main compartment
i beat the hell out of this bag every day and it still looks new after # months it has plenty of space for my laptop , pda phone , handheld gps , files , checkbook , and office supplies the pockets fit almost anything the wire pocket is very convenient i like the look of it too it really holds up in the rain keeping everything dry it wears quite comfortably for me as well i love this bag
i wo n't go into a lot of detail , but the fact is , this bag is great perfectly fits my laptop , external hard drive , power adapter , and lots more the mp # `` holders `` located on both sides are a bit snug for a <unk> ipod , but i was able to get it to fit nice color , extremely sturdy , and i can tell it will last a long time i did n't notice this in any <unk> , the pad on the strap had a <unk> inside which is really comfortable i did a lot of looking when my horrible `` verge `` bag purchased at <unk> . fell apart and the strap disconnected ... laptop fall down and go <unk> this was the nicest looking messenger with the features i needed buy this bag , you will not regret it ... are they paying to say this
it ca n't do much for the weight of a laptop , but it certainly carries very nicely so you 're back does n't constantly hurt only weird thing is the pouch intended for power cables is really too small unless it is just the cable the other pockets make up for it though it 's a good buy , especially if you 're in a rainy climate and need something waterproof
i bought this bag to accompany my new macbook it fits like a glove -lrb- it is designed to carry laptops of size # . # ' and <unk> -rrb- but the really cool thing about the bag is that it fits so much else besides i 'm a student in college and there 's plenty of space for any textbooks and notebooks i need , plus plenty of convenient side-pockets for everything from pens and <unk> to mp # players , flash drives and snacks it is incredibly sturdy , waterproof -lrb- as i discovered for myself in a pouring rain storm -rrb- and is very comfortable on my shoulder and hip this is not just a laptop carrier it is the ultimate all-purpose shoulder bag for any citizen of the knowledge age
i wish there were photos of the insides on amazon or kensington 's website it has more room than i thought it would the back is especially roomy - it 's divided by the handle assembly , bit there 's exactly enough room for my bose <unk> # case on one side and my laptop <unk> and food on the other side the inside main compartment has enough room for two # `` computers -lrb- although only one would be padded -rrb- , plus a few folders , <unk> or paperback books based on the ads and some other comments , i thought the styling might be too `` girly `` , but it 's not the strap is hard to remove , so i just keep it short and leave it on i was able to use the strap to attach it on my main luggage for wheeling through the airport by itself , the handle is a good length -lrb- i 'm # ' # `` -rrb-
kensington contour balance <unk> is a great , lightweight laptop bag i was having trouble with my shoulder and back , so i tried this model it has really helped being so lightweight , and maneuvers well when being pulled on the wheels there are also several compartments to hold you accessories and files i would recommend this bag to anyone
i bought this for my wife and she absolutely loves it it is very light and durable it would be fantastic if it included a computer sleeve or your laptop my wife is using the one from her old roller bag i would recommend this
no complaints about the product exceed my expectation because i have to ship the product to an overseas friend , i suggest that amazon use the the original packing instead of placing it in a bigger shipping box and <unk> extra freight cost
very light-weight , just the right size for # laptops -- will just hold two wide-screen laptops , with room for all cords and accessories , and just enough room <unk> over for a book or some files
this is the bag with the computer in it , it is lighter than the wenger ` patriot ' i bought for my girlfriend well thought out , and lots of good features i especially like the single shaft pull handle
i 've only been using this product a few weeks but i love how lightweight it is and how much room it has for what seems to be a smaller bag there 's plenty of room for my paperwork , laptop , and all the accessories i hope it 's as durable as it is usable
i read all reviews on other products before i made my purchase of this notebook bag this bag had awesome reviews so i thought i 'd purchase it to see for myself after i received it , i loved it so much that i ordered a second one to give to my husband who travels a lot in his job we both enjoy all of the room the bag has and how lightweight it is the only negative is that the pullout handle is a little wobbly , but on the positive , when it is fully <unk> it is long enough for my husband i would definetly buy this product again in the future
this is a really great and light bag that is great as either a rolling or shoulder bag it is easy to use and the back flap is perfect for a pair of shoes or all those cords for your laptop great pockets in the front section for your ipod , cellphone , blackberry , pens , etc . pocket for your laptop is big enough for my toshiba satellite # inch screen it is padded nicely and the handle on top of the bag is easy to carry for long periods because it is padded the back side of the bag where the wheels are located is curved to fit right next to your hip if you decide to use the shoulder strap i ride a train every day and walk about # blocks with my rolling bag and it is a breeze i 've been using the bag for about # months or more and there are absolutely no problems to report
excellent computer bag with lots of great compartments and very sturdily built the strap is a bit challenging to figure out at first but once <unk> it becomes very easy only annoyance is that i wished the shaft of the handle was made of more study materials -lrb- its a little shaky -rrb- otherwise , its an excellent buy with great shipping
