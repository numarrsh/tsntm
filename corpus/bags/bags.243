i really like the case , see through and a very pretty color only downside was the keyboard cover it was horrible did n't fit the keys at all and it had an ugly appearance when i tried fitting it on it became sticky and see through with bubbles <unk> just really bad even my friends commented on the keyboard cover it looks really bad
i purchased the purple hard shell case for my # `` macbook pro pros : solid build <unk> of venting along the <unk> easily `` feet `` provide great typing angle and ventilation when used on a <unk> : fit feels loose the top cover frequently lifts off the top of my macbook when i 'm opening it i really appreciate the color and the look of this case , however , it really feels like it <unk> the point i am always afraid that the cover is going to come off when i pick up my macbook , open or closed , and then drop it i appreciate the extra protection , but , since it is so darn loose i 'm really paranoid about it i 'm probably going to buy a different case
fits perfect ! color is nice , bright and vivid , but the keyboard cover does n't match , so i had to buy it separately other reviewers got theirs that match the keyboard but mine does n't - just disappointing as it is not
the project is very nice in terms of color it looks exactly as the picture however , when i put it on my macbook , the front does n't fit snug with my computer i recently bought a speck case and while that was more expensive , it does fit better than this one
this hard , snap-on case has been great for my macbook i have used it for almost # years now and it has held up very well one of the stands did break off , but i did n't really use that feature anyway i would recommend this case to anyone looking for a great and protective case , in a very fun and bright color i love my purple case !
the clips slip a little on the sides , and i ca n't see it helping in the case of a drop but light spills and scratching would be avoided with it
i love my purple ipearl case it snaps on in a second , and fits perfectly i 'm not sure how easy it is to take off , because i have n't tried i also like the keyboard cover , but it takes some getting used to it seems a little & # # ; sticky & # # ; at first it is either getting better , or i am just getting used to typing with it over my keys it is a very thin cover , but so far , it stays in place well i feel like the case and cover were well worth $ # ! ! i 've only had this for about # days , but so far , i am pleased ! !
only downside : no clip in the middle of the top ; the area used every time computer is opened without a clip in this location , the cover separates slightly from the macbook lid seems over time this may cause the cover to crack or break
i got this cover super quick i placed the order on april # th and i received it on april # th the color is just like the one in the picture and it fits perfectly on my new macbook pro now i have a cute purple laptop instead of a boring silver one lol i did not give it # stars because the cover prevents me from opening my laptop really wide
i enjoy the look of this ipearl mcover and it adds a level of protection to my laptop my son recommended it to me and i 'm very happy with it my only problem is it adds a little weight to the laptop , but that is to be expected the tiny feet put the laptop at the right angle for typing i am actually writing more on the laptop since i purchased the cover
i am a college student and i take my macbook with me to and from classes the hard shell cover makes me feel better about carring it around as much as i do
i just received my macbook pro <unk> mcover hard shell case for # -inch aluminum unibody a # macbook pro -lrb- purple color -rrb- it looks and fitted great i am glad i bought this case to protect my precious macbook : -- rrb- i just hope it lasts long till then it is a # star from me
had my first one for over # years , when one of my pegs on the back finally got broken off the pegs on the back are why i love it so much because it allows me to type without having my wrists resting on the edge of my mac , which is a very hard edge
i ordered the purple mcover for my macbookpro and love it i do n't see it providing shock <unk> if dropped , which would have been a bonus , but for the price it was worth the buy the color is bright , as seen on amazon and installation wise it snaps right into place i 'll most likely buy more of them and switch colors from time to time vendor was quick to ship and i received the product in no time -lrb- have the prime shipping account , so that may be a factor -rrb- i will definitely buy from this vendor again
does exactly what the details say , protects my laptop , fit perfectly and i installed it with no problem i also got the keyboard but it is flimsy and ugly , does n't even have the numbers and icons on it , so i am not gon na use it overall : pleased with my
the case is nice and the color is represented well in the picture there is a reason the keyboard cover is free , it is very cheap version of what i was expecting
fyi , this is not one of those softer plastic covers - it is hard plastic old school that 's not easy to tell when you look at the photos or read the description nevertheless , it fits the aluminum # `` just fine , goes on easy , comes off easy lots of ventilation due to feet provided cheaper than the alternatives as well
very nice cover i got this for my wife 's macbook . it covers the computer and adds a little flair to it along with the keyboard cover it really makes the white laptop look cute if you are into pink that is !
i purchased this because it was cheaper than buying from the apple store and wanted something to protect my mac-book pro i was n't sure what to expect it is easy to put on and looks nice i am really happy with it
received it on time gloves mac well , protects from scratches , regular wear and tear # stars because keyboard cover package came with is not exactly a fit but i still use it for now
i love this new cover it fits very well and was easy to put on however , within two weeks , the small rubber feet on the bottom have come loose i have lost one altogether i 'm not sure where to get replacement ones
i get a ton of compliments on this cover i did have to remove the bottom snap on i found the fan seemed to have to run a lot with it on but it 's the exact color as the pictures and everyone loves <unk> so do i ! :
i ordered this item and it works great it fits perfectly and is the right color and everything looks just like the picture only thing is if u order the protective keyboard and screen protector together , it <unk> each item individually and they are shipped at different times
i seem to always need a new case every few months before because the cases i bought before were cheap - but never lasted long for when i needed to bring my laptop around campus this one is a bit thicker and the small stand is a nice feature
i received my cover today i was a little apprehensive when i first saw the package the packaging is cheap and it makes the cover look like it is something sold in the dollar store the purple color is true to the photo , which is what i was looking for the only thing i do not like about the cover is the bottom it is slippery where the flip out `` feet `` are , there is no <unk> pads i use my macbook on my lap # . # % of the time , the non-slip pads are a must since i do like the color and everything else about the cover , i plan to keep it , in hopes of finding some pads for the bottom i think the price could be a little cheaper than it is due to the quality of the item
i have been a speck case user for many years i decided on this one actually for a replacement for my daughters # `` mbp she had the speck case , and had cracked the bottom hands down , the bottom of this case is the best i have seen , both for ventilation & angle the top of the case , if i were not to have had the speck to compare it to would have been fine i really prefer the top of the speck , and so did my daughter , she only used the bottom that said , for the money , this case is a no brainer , and for sure when i make my next mbp purchase , -lrb- i do this on average twice <unk> -rrb- i will be buying this case the speed of delivery also was very impressive i look forward to doing business with them again as well
love the case , very attractive and colorful easy to use the only drawback is that it holds fingerprints easily i love the little tabs that lift the computer a little at the back
the shell case is really useful and pretty , fits perfectly fine on my macbook pro the only think i did not feel # % happy is , the offered a free keyboard but it did n't come with the case of course i <unk> and the sent it to me really quick but for the rest i feel really pleased
id give this a # star review if the quality had been better it lasted me about a few months before the bottom rubber circles came off scratches have become too noticable to even put on my computer anymore its cute but i wish it had been more scratch proof and more put together
the product not only arrived exactly when it was estimated to , it was exactly what was in the product description aside from the extremely affordable price , it fits my macbook pro # ' perfectly with all ports accessible i only wish that there were a clamp at the top of monitor as when i <unk> my laptop , it moves slightly but not to much to cause a problem just my personal <unk> i guess other than that , a perfect product that i am glad i purchased and would definitely buy again and recommend to others
i really like this macbook pro cover i got the cover to protect the outer casing from scratches and scuffs because i take my laptop everywhere , esp school its easy to snap on and ready to go instantly it does n't make the laptop bulky and still fits in my sleeve i would definitely recommend
recieve this review from a picky person very easy to put on , and looks like a million bucks ! ! ! everyone has a complement for it i like how the apple logo looks thru get it , you will not be dissapointed great purchase ! ! ! only reason # stars , is because i have not had very long , i still need to see how it will hold after a while of handling
it fits my aluminum macbook even though it does not say that on the specs i am one of the few people with an aluminum macbook and it 's hard to find any products that are still made for it
it was the color that attracted me to this case and am i glad i bought it it was real easy to just snap on and is just as easy to remove it perfect fit and great protection for your macbook
this product is okay for the price but you have to be very careful i purchased this item in a different color before and i noticed that if you do n't pay attention when removing -lrb- kind of difficult to remove -rrb- , it leaves scratches where the product attaches to the mac
thought it would of been darker but i love the protection the case provided and the stands cool but i do n't use it feels like the weight of the laptop will snap the plastic
i love my hard shell case in purple my macbook pro was purchased in december # and i knew i needed to take care of it as it was my first mac this case has made it easy to protect my laptop as well as view movies , documents , and photos when on the go b/c of its little legs when i 'm traveling and want less glare i just flip down my legs and i 'm cooking with gas if you are on the fence about purchasing this i say look no further this has been one of my better purchases on amazon and i could n't be more pleased
i love this case , is really cool looking and fits perfect i am not so crazy about the keyboard , it takes a tad to get used to the feeling i think but all together it looks nice and different
i love this hard case it fits my # inch macbook pro perfectly the bottom is sort of weird , with the vent holes although macbook pros do n't have vents i also like the kickstand that lifts the computer up the front of the case is nice , but there is a square around the apple logo that is faint and you can slightly see it i wish it was all completely purple , but the case works well and is nice for my usage
the delivery for this product was fast , i received it within # days of placing my order the color is so vibrant and cute and both the bottom and top covers fit perfectly and go on easy i like the fact that the bottom portion of the cover does not cover the small battery check light button on the left side of the mac i would recommend buying this case
i truly love this product snaps right on and looks gorgeous on my mac a neat little <unk> when i open the box , it came with a silicone keyboard protector ! ! i would definitely buy again in other colors
love this product so cute , so simple and so easy to install ! ! i would recommend it to any customer who has a macbook pro and is looking to protect it from <unk> while still being stylish love ! !
this case is the best it fits my laptop perfectly and i love the legs on it it elevates it to a perfect angle for typing and just in general the keyboard cover is very thin and you can hardly feel it there but it protects the keyboard from crumbs during those <unk> times and any <unk> or spills that might occur i would recommend this case to anyone who wants to protect their laptop and keep it looking nice
my parents wanted one of these once they saw ours they love the case and the keyboard cover for their new laptop this will keep the computer looking like new
i bought the purple mac book case for college and it is amazing i love the color and how it protects my mac book while im in class ! ! i would recommend you to buy this !

my sister purchased this for her computer and when i saw it i had to get my own it arrived just days after i placed the order with standard shipping snapped on super easy without having to force it or struggle and thus far has really done its job i move my laptop around a lot and this case has really done a good job of protecting it i read some of the <unk> reviews and it seems to me most people who were <unk> purchased this case for the wrong computer i think its an excellent buy and well worth the great price
the purple mcover is one of my favorite cases for my macbook pro this shell case is a perfect essential for those who want to show off their favorite color , use your computer in <unk> , and it is great for movie <unk> with the built in stand this product is hands down my favorite case , and i will be using it for as long as my computer lasts i know that will a be a very long time because of the quality of this case that mcover puts into the durability of the product
this product is absolutely wonderful i could n't have a better case for my macbook pro it provides slots for all openings there is even a small clip stand on the bottom of the case to cool down the computer i have even gotten a comment with someone thinking i actually bought a purple macbook i had to tell them that it was just a case a very wonderful product
not only does the case fit perfectly , it also stays in place and protects the computer very well the greatest thing about it , unique among other cases i have seen , is the little handles that you can take out so the computer <unk> slightly i find that it makes writing easier
i just received the case , and received it super quick the hard shell case fits my mac great , and the purple color is really nice the keyboard cover looks great too so far , i am very happy with my case
i have the latest model of the macbook pro # in the case is easy to snap on and off if necessary , but it stays on and does n't fall off you can also see the apple logo shining through on the back , which i really like i know on some cases , the bottom piece of the case digs into people 's wrists , but that is not how this one is it fits so perfectly the only minor problem i have is that when you have the case on , the laptop does n't open more than about a # degree angle , which is less than it would without the case on it 's not a huge deal because i usually do n't need to open the laptop that far anyway * the free keyboard was also a really nice addition to this purchase it feels a little weird when typing , but i 'm sure i 'll get used to how it feels
purple case is great and matches with all the accessories i have purchased for my macbook pro case arrived in excellent condition and it is durable case is easy to put on laptop and take off no instructions required
i have bought three -lrb- # black , # aqua -rrb- of these mcover cases and i loved them it keeps my macs new , it protects them from scratches , dust , spills and it gives it style people when they see the cover have no idea what type of laptop i have until the apple logo lights up i 'm a computer technician and its a lot easier to replace the mcover case than to replace a screen or the lcd cover this purchase is worth the money , and they have a variety of colors definitely , i do recommend these mcover cases for people to protect their valuables
i bought this case as an added layer of protection for my macbook pro , and it works perfectly the color is great , and the price was right too - a lot cheaper than what you might pay in stores no problems with fit or overheating overall this seems to be a really well-made product
i recently got <unk> to the way of the mac and after seeing that the case was <unk> aluminum i decided to look for something to protect it also i love to customize everything and the purple case was perfect , the color really is as awesome as it looks on the screen it came quickly and with the other items i ordered was free to ship the case is idiot proof for installation and has n't so much as moved from its install point , nice and snug i love the little feet on the back for ventilation help and none of the ports are blocked at all this was everything i hoped for and i would gladly order one again if i ever manage to break this one or just because i am seriously <unk> the green overall , awesome service , product , and experience
