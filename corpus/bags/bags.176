i bought this case for my new mba very good quality case i use my laptop every day , and i 'm glad to have this case it protects my laptop from scratches and gives it a unique look i definitely recommend this case
the leather of this case looks and feels more expensive than the price i receive compliments almost on a daily basis from colleagues and friends on this product in addition , i particularly love the way the little flap on the back of the case which allows it stand on top of this , the product fits the mbp retina # & # # ; perfectly i love this product ! !
in my opinion , this is the perfect case for the macbook air i was originally looking for a sleeve to put my macbook in , then i stumbled across this and thought that it was a great idea that i could use my macbook while it was still in the case the look and feel of it is very nice , and the inside cover that goes around the trackpad is very comfortable apple should definitely sell this i am very happy with my purchase just a sidenote to casecrown , you need to make this for all macbook models because my friends want it too
i researched cases for a long time before choosing this one , and i made the right choice there are lots of cases on the market today for the mac air i wanted something that was n't bulky , protected it well , stylish , and not too terribly expensive this one actually matched the cover on my ipad as well which was good one other that i did like was one that looked like a book but i 'm very satisfied with this one quit researching and worrying which one is right go ahead and order this one . you 'll like it
i ordered two of these , one for myself and one for my husband and they are perfect and excellent for the macbook air perfect fit , easy take , adds no weight and looks very professional
i absolutely love , love this case it fits my macbook air perfectly and looks good at the same time i love the comfy suede interior surrounding the mouse part , it keeps my hands nice and smooth . easy to charge from the open sides i had the apple logo sticker and stuck on the leather which looks absolutely perfect very practical and highly recommend it
had considered getting a more expensive case as i thought that for the price of this one , it could n't be all that good however , after reading all the other reviews i also considered that all the previous users would not lying to us and so i took the plunge and bought it great decision , full stop ! ! the case does what it says , fits my mba very snugly , is sturdy and has <unk> with the rigors of packing and unpacking into my backpack i 've even had the guys at tsa admire it for its style buy and you 'll love it too
i bought this and was contemplating that it would be a cheap cover -lrb- given the price -rrb- with my surprise , i found it to be extremely elegant and received several <unk> from co-worker and the wife -lrb- those married knows how hard that is ! -rrb- i recommend the item to everyone - you ca n't go wrong with it
i am very pleased with this laptop case i love the way it looks and feels i look around for a case long time online , and i think the review do this product justice although i do n't think the flap in the back is really needed , the few time i have used it to prop up my laptop , it has worked just find i 've <unk> several compliments at work it 's comfortable and discrete , and the price is totally fair
a smooth finished look on this , good quality i have n't had issues with my corner bands slipping off , or with my computer running to warm and have owned it for a couple months
fits my # macbookpro retina very nicely it looks good and softens the sharpness on the leading edge of the keyboard which makes it more enjoyable to use for extended periods especially when typing a lot the look is high quality ; the feel is a little dry to the touch meaning it does n't feel like supple leather on the outside the wrist pad area is suede feeling and is very nice
case is great to carry and big enough to accomodate a kuzy hard shell on my macbook pro retina # & # # ; would recommend this case to anyone who wants to carry your computer in an attractive case while adding protection from rain and other liquids great seller , fast shipping and solid product
not only does this fit the macbook air like a glove , it offers protection ; the corners of the air are vulnerable , but it still protects the top and bottom if you want to protect your mac and have a great looking case , this is it either you can use the air while it 's in the case , or you can remove the case
i was n't sure whether i would like this case or not , but i love it the wrist guards to protect the aluminum from sweat and wearing the aluminum to the perfect stand at the bottom to tilt the laptop up i love this case and it looks amazing too ! :
i wanted a case for my new air and based on the reviews thought i 'd give this a try i love it it fits perfectly and looks great i would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a cover
this is a great case - not too heavy , but protective and sharp looking i am not easy on things and it is holding up very well under lots of use i have been very pleased with this cover and would highly recommend it when mine gets to ragged , i will buy another
just received this today and i 'm very pleased with both the appearance and quality it fits like a glove looks <unk> and professional , especially compared to the <unk> pink plastic <unk> temporary cover it replaces looks as if i have a brand new laptop
i love my macbook air it 's so thin i can stick it any where portfolio , folder , notebook etc . but this cover makes it look so much nicer than stuck in a book the inside of the cover is soft so it protects the bottom and top aluminum as well as the wrist rest theres also a flap underneath to angle the laptop as i now love my case too :
i recently purchased a macbook air # in . and wanted to protect my investment i looked at all the options i could find for covers , only to find that there are n't that many for the mba when i came across this one , i was skeptical , but i ordered it anyway after several days , i must say that i love this case it is lightweight , and i really like the leather folio look i also like the soft feel where i rest my wrists while i am typing i do n't think you can go wrong with this case
it does an excellent job protecting my computer it is comfortable to use and you do n't have to mess with taking it on or off , you just open it to use the laptop i tucked my magnetic closure strap under the computer and never use it , i do n't need to
cheap , attractive , lightweight , and holds up what more do you want my only complaint is that the part that goes next to the mouse pad is n't very easy to clean and i am putting my hands on it a lot i purchased this for a macbook air , and it has protected it quite well
easy to use looks like a notebook when i carry it i thought the snap tab would get in the way , but it does n't great product and great price
this thing is just beautiful when i saw straps on the corners -lrb- the ones used to be attached to the screen -rrb- i was disappointed as hell but when i attached it there was no problem with them - they do not eat any of the screen space it is very well to hold , it does not slip it feels solid and expensive and comfortable and , again , beautiful perhaps you want <unk> <unk> but for this you 'll have to go for carbon stickers or things alike , a case for a laptop can not physically weight less then # grams which is the case
my wife discovered this for her mac book air and it was so good we looked for this for my retina # inch pro very satisfied , not going to try dropping it to see if it protects against falls but it fits well and protects it while it is just sitting around easy to carry and not much weight to it
ordered mac air # and the case together , it fits nicely leaving the track pad and keyboard area open the material is faux leather but does not look cheap , it has got microfiber material inside <unk> mac air from scratches expecting this cover to last long
when it comes to purchasing a laptop , i tend to think that buying a case is protecting an investment after all , you 're going to be using the laptop for the greater part of <unk> years might as well spend a little extra money to not have to replace it this is a very well made case it fits the air comfortably and does n't add any significant bulk
love this case looks and feels like an expensive luxury case soft and sleek and after a year of daily use , and multiple <unk> and drops , it still looks good and protects my air what more could one ask for more colors would be
works great and so far no issues at all i was worried due to some of the other comments but i am very happy i got this , works great while using on the couch it has enough grip so that the computer does not slide around protection is great , no issues with air flow or power connection while in the case
i just bought the new macbook air # inches # and i wanted something to carry the computer like a book , as i am replacing an ipad this is the perfect solution computer fits perfectly it 's like carrying a book
i bought this case three months ago , and am completely satisfied with it it is light weight , stylish , and made with quality material it does exactly what it is intended to there is nothing i do not like about tis product so far
the `` brown `` one is actually a kind of `` yellow `` , it is not good for man i returned it but the quality is very good and it fit my mbp retina very well , that 's why i give it # stars
i mistakenly posted this to the mab # `` version , so will <unk> to the mab # `` with the following update update : still very happy with this product the magnetic tab is really non-issue if you use the case as i do -lrb- i.e . , folding the lid cover underneath when in use -rrb- you can simply fold and tuck the tab under the case the macbook air is so thin relative to its weight that it needs a good case for those who must carry it around from meeting to meeting -lrb- including the <unk> <unk> stops ! -rrb- this case is perfect for my macbook air # it is light , has a very nice soft texture , and does not add much bulk the suede material surrounding the touchpad feels better on the wrists than the brushed aluminum and protects against my <unk> it is is a little annoying how the magnetic snap tab sticks up from the bottom , but it does n't really get in the way of using the touchpad one reviewer was <unk> bothered by the led apple logo being covered up , but the case is so thin and flexible you can simply fold the top cover underneath when using it this may also help take the extra weight off off the display hinge
just bought a # & # # ; mac air and wanted a leather case to protect it this case from casecrown has exceeded my expectations it protects my mac totally and makes it look very stylish nothing but positives on this case i highly recommend it
finally , cases that look nice , made from quality , and also affordable everything for mac these days are ridiculously expensive i would highly recommend this case for people with a macair you will be very satisfied with this case do n't let the price fool you
i absolutely love love love this <unk> it looks great , fits well and is all the protection i need the quality is high end i also really like the soft suede like covering that my wrists sit on while typing i would recommend this to anybody with a macbook air
purchased this for my # year old grandson he ca n't get on youtube or any game site so very slow and freezes up constantly i 'm hoping to return it since it did n't come directly from amazon , who has wonderful customer service , i hope i do n't have a problem
it 's a decent device for watching videos on youtube or social networking sites like facebook , but for anything else you might expect a small computer to do , it 's totally useless
item will not perform as described , it is junk , will not open <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , etc . it is a windows <unk> system , this is never mentioned in this add i feel abused by this seller <unk> and amazon for backing them and allowing them to falsely advertise on their website please stay as from from <unk> as possible , horrible return policy and false advertising
i purchased this bag directly from the slappa website for my asus g # jw laptop it 's a heavy laptop and i wanted something sturdy to carry it after # months the main handle -lrb- not shoulder strap -rrb- has separated from the bag on one side i logged into the slappa website to see what the warranty is and it 's # days , so looks like i 'm out of luck i would of expected more than # months of use for a hundred dollar bag something of interest i tried to leave this exact same feedback on the slappa website and guess what my feedback did n't show up so it looks like only the positive feedback makes it to the big show
a bag that can handle my # & # # ; laptop there is a separate sleeve pocket for the laptop , with space in the same area for all my cords and accessories lots of extra pockets , too i take it to work quite frequently , and am able to carry all my things in this one bag , unlike my previous one with the old bag , if i wanted to take my laptop to work for <unk> studying , i had to carry a separate bag for my work stuff this bag can handle it all kind of heavier than i expected -lrb- empty -rrb- based on the composition materials listed , but still a great bag i could do without the big pad in the shape of their hand logo on the back of the bag it adds unnecessary bulk
i got this bag for my husband ; who travels a lot and must carry along lots of <unk> gadgets he reports that the bag is great just a little heavy i asked if it was heavy & # # ; cuz you put a lot of stuff in it ? & # # ; and he stated that the material is just heavy it is a comfortable bag to carry well worth the $ $
love the build quality , love everything about it , but it is a little heavy by itself considering the enormous size of it in the first place but overall its perfect
this bag is versatile , solid , comfortable to carry and holds my dell notebook -lrb- or would hold # or # -rrb- and a change of clothes so i can easily carry it on the plane filled , turned sideways , it slides under the window or center seat well and under the aisle seat with a <unk> push -lrb- because the aisle seat is a little narrower underneath -rrb-
overall , i like this bag i do have a few thoughts that might help out someone on the fence the material of the bag is a little weird it feels cheap , but seems durable it is very slim , which is something i like , but you ca n't fit a lot into it my main annoyance with the bag is the velcro fastener for the front flap it is extremely loud to open i ended up adding magnets on top fo the velcro so now it closes <unk> , but definitely not an ideal solution if you do not like the sound of velcro , i would look elsewhere
this bag is the perfect size for a # & # # ; notebook but do n't expect to fit much more in it even a charger is pushing it the bag is nicely made from good leather the strap is like seatbelt material , so it 's definitely made to last
high quality it looks more expensive than it 's actual price , the only thing bothered me that it size a little bit bigger than i thought so the check dimentions before purchasing
it is a very nice compact bag i would certainly recommend it however two things would be a slight drawback when opening the main compartment the velcro ripping apart is extremely loud not so much of a big deal for me but might be for others i just minimize the number of times i open it when in the library my last bag had a very nice cloth attache case handle at the top of the bag which gave me an additional handling option i am considering an <unk> to have that feature added as a whole i really like the bag
everything about this bag was just right for my # inch macbook air there is just enough room to fit my laptop , an ipad , a notebook , a <unk> projector , and all the cables and adapters i need to cary with me as an added bonus , i love the color and it looks really stylish with my suit if you 're looking for a small fashionable laptop bag for a macbook air , this is the one
this bag is durable , attractive and precisely holds my # & # # ; air and a few accessories be warned though , this is not a big bag it holds my laptop , ipad mini , a small notebook and a few small accoutrements like pens , earbuds , and a few cables and then it is full it will not hold an # . # x # sheet of paper <unk> , it will not hold a book larger than a paper back , and if that paper back is thick it wo n't go without bulging all that said , if you want a slim bag that looks great and capacity is not issue you could not do better than this bag
i bought this to replace my boyfriend 's <unk> messenger bag and it was everything i 'd hoped for the inside is a nice bright yellow which makes things easier to find , and it has several pockets and sleeves for laptop , files , pens , change ; whatever you are carrying and on top of everything it 's water resistant which is perfect since the last time he used his old one it was raining the only down side is the velcro is a long stripe which is very strong and makes more noise than the average velcro , but still worth the investment
some reviewers complained about the noise the velcro makes when opening this bag it 's true , the velcro is pretty intense not just with the noise , but it makes the bag fairly hard to open other than that , it 's the perfect bag for my mba there 's an easy fix for the velco issue ... just put a strip of duct tape over it then cut out a small <unk> in the tape where you want the velcro to make contact after this fix , the bad opens easily and without much noise plus the sliver of the duct tape looks pretty good against the black and yellow i 'm happy with my be-ez
i have had this bag a few months , but only recently starting using it after just a few uses -lrb- & # # ; # -rrb- some of the seams on the outer flap pocket gave way i only use this pocket for thin reading glasses , so it was a surprise
bought it for my boyfriend he is very hard to please he uses it every day to carry his ipad this green was a good color for him did n't look feminine no too big nor too small holds a decent amount of stuff
i bought this case for the motorola # x # <unk> that i use with my motorola droid <unk> smartphone it fits perfectly with room for my point and shoot digital camera there is still room for small wall chargers and a few misc items great case , very well made , excellent materials i really like the light compact size i highly recommend it for small notebook computers
i only gave it # stars because they are little things they could have added to make this a great bag , like a key lanyard however , other then that this is great product with the usual timbuk # quality i use this bag for may daily commute to work , and it 's perfect i carry my laptop and planner with plenty of extra room available i would recommend this little gem
i was looking for a tsa approved lightweight bag which is not black , and not a backpack when i first saw this one this seems like a solution i 've been looking for i wish i 've waited little longer so that i could purchase this bag with $ # . #
this is a great bag to carry only what you need not a lot of room for extras -lrb- as stated in previous reviews -rrb- if you go onto timbuk # 's website there is a feature that will tell you whether or not your laptop will fit in the bag -lrb- although , i think this bag is discontinued ... -rrb- i 'm not sure that i would pay $ # dollars for it , but it is a well-built bag with just enough function and character to make it a favorite i love the durable fabric and the cushy laptop compartment i will say that the organizer is too slim on pockets and could use a key lanyard i got a cheap dell bag from work that i hate -lrb- bought this to replace it -rrb- but their organizer blows this one out of the water all in all a great bag
backpack is a bit too casual and too <unk> looking for daily commute so i decided finding alternative ways to carrying papers , lunch and occasional laptop to office i do not like putting everything in one briefcase type bag gets too heavy and bulky this product is perfect as a companion to briefcase it 's lightweight , just the right size , not too chunky when not carrying laptop , it works well as a lunch bag if you do n't want to carry typical lunch <unk> type of product i tried fancier cross-body style messenger bag made of leather in the past , but they were heavy and uncomfortable something about the design , weight , and shoulder strap material makes this product quite comfortable and versatile for many different usage if you have to carry big heavy laptop , this may be a bit too thin for that , though overall super happy
the backpack distributes the weight very evenly however , if you are # feet tall or taller the -lrb- size small -rrb- backpack is too small it is impossible to place a water bottle or anything that you need ready access to in the side compartment most reviewers said that they liked the fact that the backpack had a bottle opener but never used it the reason they never used it is that one has to take the back pack off in order for it to be of any use defeats the purpose and makes it a silly <unk> , which admittedly , it is if you are anywhere close to # foot tall steer clear of this bag the capacity is sufficient for a laptop your charger and one book , any more and the small backpack can not handle it
i was looking for a minimally sized , ergonomic and strong laptop backpack for my petite -lrb- under # ' -rrb- wife some -lrb- maybe just one -rrb- reviewers had commented that it is pretty small that combined with the positive reviews for other <unk> convinced me to give it a try turns out <unk> # is not particularly small , so we had to return it she would have been happy with a smaller , lighter pack with few additional pockets this pack may be a # star product for the right person this review is intended as a warning for shorter folks
it 's everything it says it is on the breakdown - though it is a bit smaller than i thought it would be thought it does mean i do n't carry as much stuff so it is kind of a plus it 's a tough little bag and i hope it 'll last a while - looks like it will
i really wanted to like this bag it has a lot of things that i liked -- like the side zippers , roominess , and pockets the reason i returned it was because it was too big many reviewers talked about its `` small `` size the only thing small was the width overall , the size is similar to many other backpacks also , the material is very stiff and heavy it was like wearing a big rectangle on my back
i bought this bag since my messenger bag was giving my back issues this bag was a great solution the pockets are well designed and the build quality has n't failed me yet and i 've had it for more than # years my only complaint is that the base of the bag is too small or round for example , it never seems to stay up right when i put it down the bag always seems fall forward when i put it down it 's been a small problem when my camera or phone then comes out other than that , it 's a great bag and i would recommend it
i used it for the first time today it had plenty of pockets/compartments for my wallet , keys , phone , make-up plus room for paperwork and my lunch loves having the water bottle holder my only complaints are the front chest strap is not vertically adjustable , it is a bit too high for me a waist strap would help secure the load to your back to reduce neck strain lastly , i got sweaty on my back where the pack it , it is not a breathable as the description would lead one to believe the size and weight are perfect for getting to and from work
great backpack , and comfortable when riding i like the side zipper access , although i forgot to close it once and almost lost my computer the side pocket holds my lock , but i wish there were another for water bottles or something else the light strap is handy , but just a few millimeters too wide for the two rear lights i own to complete attach for comments about the size ... it is the size that it is if you want one bigger or smaller backpack , buy a different one wait for the pack to go on sale i do n't think it is worth the full price , but for $ # it is a great deal
i 've had this bag a few weeks , and i really like it i use it for school and work i commute by both train and bus , so i like that its small and does n't get in the way much i really like the swing around side zippers - i never have to set my bag down any more to get out my commuter pass - i can even take it out while walking , it makes <unk> more convenient the bag looks very well made with sturdy materials i like the messenger style in a backpack because it really lets you stuff the bag full when you need to the laptop pocket is very well re-enforced and protects the computer nicely - i do n't need to put my laptop in its protective sleeve when its in the backpack the reason i did n't give it five stars is because it was a little uncomfortable at first my last backpack had a little bit more padding on the back than this bag does , but i 'm used to it now and overall very happy with the purchase
this is a fantastic product , heavy-duty , rain resistant -lrb- for seattle weather -rrb- i gave this to my # -year-old son who is rough on things and rides his bike too and fro i will also likely purchase one for my husband who takes the train to and from work every day , to carry his ipad and essentials great , well made , sturdy product ca n't go wrong
i 've used the backpack a few times so far i have a bad back so i was nervous about carrying my laptop on my back this backpack is so comfortable and the weight of it with my laptop does not hurt my back the straps are also very comfortable and cushy on my shoulders i never thought in a million years that a backpack can feel so nice there is so much room and so many different compartments that i have also carried library books , a binder , pencils , my mouse and have a lot more room for other things if i needed to carry it i would recommend this product to my family and closest friends
love timbuk # bags and the attention to detail it 's sturdy and can easily hold a # & # # ; macbook air , and plenty of other stuff i need for my daily commute to work
i 've seen a lot of reviews on here saying that this bag wo n't work if you 're close to # ft i 'm # ' # & # # ; and i love it very accessible , waterproof on top -lrb- and maybe sides -rrb- i do n't use the side zipper so the size of my laptop does n't really matter , but i tested it and it works fine for a # . # inch laptop
timbuk # are known for making bags that last -- and this bag appears to be no exception i have to carry black bags for my work , so i was looking for a bag that was not black for when i ride my bicycle i was originally looking at a messenger bag , but i know from rude experience my shoulder starts to hurt and the bag tends to flop around when i 'm riding well , timbuk # solved both problems with this bag , and they gave me a set of awesome <unk> colors as well i really like the side access zippers for the laptop pouch and the smaller pouch it 's not that i get into my bag while i 'm riding ; rather , i like the fact that i do n't have to rip up the velcro every time i want to get something from the pocket i also like the chest strap ; when i ride , this strap keeps the shoulder straps where i want them finally , the back padding is a nice touch it gives a decent ergonomic feel to the bag , and it sits nicely on my back while i 'm riding well done , timbuk # -- every <unk> be <unk> , <unk>
have n't actually used it out in the world <unk> - upon inspection i really like it made the purchase for our upcoming trip to alaska one of the most important features that i wanted for the backpack was for it to be waterproof and made of durable materials it appears to fill the bill , but only time will tell i guess it 's very organized and roomy and will make going through airports fairly easy i have done a & # # ; dry run & # # ; to see if everything i would need to carry would fit and it did i also have to travel with a <unk> machine for sleep <unk> this pack would handle a laptop computer and <unk> machine nicely as well as a few more things
its an amazing backpack and i absolutely love it it is the perfect size for all of my books and etc for school ! amazing and i love it so much stylish and cute
i was concerned that this bag would be too light or flimsy , but i find it to be very comfortable i feel that it is well made and has plenty of room for my laptop , e-reader , # -inch tablet and much more when i travel i would recommend it
always been a fan of timbuk # bags , the <unk> currently sells at a more expensive price in my country buying it off amazon even with the shipping fee is still cheaper the bag is awesome , its can fit lots of thing like many other timbuk # bags , it has <unk> accessed to many things , many compartments material wise seems to be long lasting timbuk # does have lifetime warranty only thing is that i 've been looking out for the extra small <unk> bag tho , this one is at a normal size even though it 's small all in all a good item
overall the backpack is very well made i wo n't give it a # star as the main compartment was less than expected the <unk> is too small should have key hook in the pocket like most of their messenger bags should do more models for <unk> like the built quality like the color like the comfort of the shoulder straps and back panel , made my heavy laptop seems weightless
i got this , becuase i ca n't afford a pac designs messenger bag until i can , this bag will do i use this for hauling a lot of stuff : laptop , change of clothes , jacket , lunch , etc . i like the load distribution i would have preferred the bag be a little more turtle like and expand out more as opposed to being <unk> to have gear more left right this is probably a center of gravity design for biking it is made of strong material and sewn with good , tight seams
water resistent , large -lrb- enough -rrb- , convenient and comfortable i took it when i cycle to work , brought it out for outings and even to work i think it 's gon na be my daily bag for a while i have nothing bad to say about this bag , it 's really one awesome bag that everyone should have
the timbuk # phoenix daypack is an amazing backpack i commute by bicycle # miles a week and the phoenix backpack holds everything that i need to bring to school and to work books , clothes , shoes , food , and anything else i need to pack the phoenix can hold it it is well designed to fit comfortable for the commute with its padded back and the weight distribution makes it feel like i am not wearing it all timbuk # designed each zipper pocket to accommodate everything you can think of i was a little skeptical about how it would perform in the rain with its light weight material but so far i have <unk> in steady rain and it keeps all my possessions dry i own the timbuk # deluxe stripe messenger bag , which i love and still use , and the phoenix daypack is perfect if you prefer the classic backpack look timbuk # for life
i have only used the backpack for a week , and i have to say that it is awesome the first time i put it on it did not fit very well but i just had to adjust it and it felt great , so do n't be worried if it does not quite fit at the very beginning laptop case is awesome , but i found that putting the laptop in the main compartment makes the backpack easier to carry , especially if you are not that tall i have n't been through heavy rain yet , so i am not sure whether it is really water-resistant also , the nalgene # oz bottle fits perfectly
was looking for a backpack that was comfortable , sturdy , and roomy i found all three in this one i stores all the books i need plus my laptop it also does n't cut into my shoulders like some have before it is a little pricey , but if it lasts then is well worth it
this exceeded my expectations as i am a big guy -lrb- # ' # & # # ; # -rrb- i worried about the bag being too small for me , i was totally wrong this bag is huge it 's the most balanced bag i 've owned even when fully loaded it does n't slide i 'd of my shoulder if i 'm carrying it with one strap i like the storage pockets which are spacious enough to hold my bike lock , laptop charger , external drive , keys , ect this bag is worth the money
i 'm # feet tall , and the medium is the perfect size on me i was looking for a bag which does n't look extremely bulky , however fits lots of stuff , this one does the job also it feels like it 's built to last
product looked fine , but when i plugged in the usb port to charge the unit it did not seem to be making a good connection when i pulled the plug out the port broke and pulled loose from the port housing had to return it and never got to use the product
this is not what it is advertised to be , the keys are far too small i am going to have to buy another keyboard with the correct size keys the battery power does n't last long it is not at all what i expected
<unk> connection between tab and keyboard is clunky the instructions are not clear the keys are soft and way higher than the mechanism , spacebar only works in the middle i 'd return it but i do n't have time to get to the post office
this was not what was pictured what the box shows and what it has in the box are two different things the one on the cover shows it having the whole for the camera and the facing camera but it does n't
the worst experience <unk> product is no good i try for # days straight to connect with the <unk> and never did i 'm really frustrated because i was so <unk> for the product and when arrived to my house and try to connect the keyboard with the tablet never
i had this product for less than # days and the on/off toggle broke off rendering it unusable i contacted the company about a replacement and was told that since it was past # days that they could not help me - and `` have a nice day `` not a company i will be doing business with in the future
bought this keyboard trying to ease typing texts on my galaxy tab , but could not find any way to adjust it in order to be able to write <unk> or other western european latin characters so , if you are considering buying one for speed typing these kind of texts , just save your money and keep using the <unk> <unk> keyboard
the carrying case arrived with a slight problem the charger for the case did not insert with ease and then would not charge as per the instructions though the price was great , my not being able to use the keyboard with my samsung tablet made it a bad <unk> me , i feel like i got what paid for <unk> cheap price and cheap equipment -rcb- the worse part of the deal was the carrying case was not even made for my samsung # & # # ; tablet the case should have had an opening for the camera to be used yet there was none the camera is in the center , not to the left or right rear
keys are & # # ; spongy & # # ; and require a little wiggle when pressing for it to respond i can type faster on the screen it is also a little bulky when closed , it is the thickness of an average novel i do ; however , like the magnetic stand on the back . i 'd suggest most customers would be best to stay away from this keyboard , and look elsewhere i must note : it is functional , just not practical for trying to type with anywhere near the speed of a traditional keyboard
received the keyboard promptly , but was disappointed it was a <unk> keyboard the case is nice , keeps the tablet still a compact traveling size and does the job but , the <unk> did n't allow for speedy typing , and was an <unk> in using it i ended up returning it
the case itself is nice , but the keyboard is n't made properly for a keyboard there is only one shift key and most people use a left and right one when typing i feel that this information should be explained in the description to avoid the disappointment and the waste of time with the product hunt and <unk> <unk> might like it , but i do n't
great idea - ok product the keyboard is a bit small , but i have small hands so that 's ok for me however , the keys sometimes do n't type the letter you want or give you ten of the same letters you have to be very careful when using it which makes it a bit challenging and slow to use
great item for anyone looking for a tablet bluetooth keyboard works great and shipped quick in good condition any kid could <unk> <unk> homework and reports right on there tablet
yes nook color with an n # a card opens up bluetooth , and this is a great tool originally for the samsung , but the dimensions are not far off the nook 's : takes a little <unk> tuck action , but works works great with my galaxy s # as well well made , and feels like
the bag was cute but it had an odd odor , the stitches on the handles were falling out the laptop compartment wo n't fit anything bigger than a # ' arrived quickly and returned it easily but i have n't seen the credit on my card yet
i have a # ' dell laptop and the zipper barely zips over it actually , it only zips when i have nothing else in the bag i do love the quality of the bag and the pattern , so i just deal with an unzipped bag the laptop part in the center is nicely padded and protects my computer , and i can fit a decent amount of things in the bag -lrb- as long as i do n't plan to zip ! -rrb- overall , i 'm satisfied with this purchase
great alternative to function as computer bag and purse it is durable and fit my computer , ipad , and makeup kit no problem one of the posts on the bottom fell off fairly early and i keep finding excess threads coming out of stitching inside , but overall great purchase and value
