expandable and good space - holds my laptop and workout clothes but cushioning is minimal for laptop and fabric is not as thick as some other messenger bags satisfactory bag for the price
this item arrived on time , was billed correctly , and met my expectations based no the image showed at amazon 's website only item over use , and i have certainly used it ; -rrb- , is that if you need something quick you will be frustrated would be great and i would give all stars if it had a quick access pocket
i already had a neoprene sleeve for my # . # `` laptop and needed a sturdy bag in which to carry it this was exactly what i <unk> , and at a great price
i am very happy with this bag it carries my # `` computer and all my work material comfortably update - i have now had this bag for # months , taking it to work every day still no problems today i packed my # `` hp pavilion , a book , a # ring binder , several cables , pens , external hard drive , and i still have room to spare i agree with another review that there is very little padding but i am ok with this
this bag is definitely very sturdy , useful , handy , good looking and worth the great deal price i have given it four stars coz there bag kind of sinks in the back and there is no way to adjust this even with the adjustable band at the end the length of the straps are long enough to sink back for a short person or for women
i paid # . # for this and it was well worth the money my daughter has # college classes and it is perfect for a heavy load i would buy it again
this backpack is a great buy i needed more space to carry around all my college textbooks and my laptop , and everything fits in with room to spare there are all manner of pockets on the inside to hold all my little things like my pens , cell phone , gum , flash drive , etc . the detachable key chain clip is great for keeping my id cards and keys all in one place the bag itself is made of good quality fabric and promises to last for a long time the straps and back are well-padded , making it easy and comfortable to carry even when heavily laden all over , a good buy for the price
i got this for my last euro trip to use as a carry on i like all of the different compartments and bottle holders it is durable and held up to my constant abuse perhaps that will change once i use it more , but for now i will say this is a nice durable product i also like the color
the protection offered by this case is pretty good , however i would prefer it to have some sort of compartment or other method for wire management for the bamboo 's usb cable i 'm afraid over time the cable dangling in the case may scratch the bamboo
i recently got the wacom bamboo create tablet for the holidays and wanted to get the sleeve specifically for my product but it was on back order found this and gave it a shot even though i was n't sure it 'd fit my tablet turns out it fits it perfectly my only gripe is that it could use a smaller pouch on the outside to hold the usb cord as mine is detachable sturdy and feels like it 's good protection for my investment
i bought it for my sons <unk> tablet and he loves it he was so excited to know he can travel with the tablet and not worry about it getting scuffed or broken in the process he stores all the program cds that came with the tablet in the case i 'm very glad i got it for him
it is a little big for the tablet , but this actually helps me because i can store <unk> too material is strange i think it is n't neoprene , and it is like a memory foam but a little harder colors are great
i do not believe that the product indicates that it is for the bamboo create but based on some other reviews we and the posted measurements we purchased it my daughters create fits very well inside of it without any problems
it 's heavier than other laptop bags i 've had , without providing any greater function ; the zipper handles both snapped off within a day -lrb- zippers still functional , but you have to grab them awkwardly -rrb- it 's a bag , it works , but it 's not a very good one
i like the bag but one of the zippers on the main compartment broke within a month of having it it is still usable because it has one other zipper for that compartment but it is annoying that it is already broken
size is perfect , the outer fabric holds up well , but the stitching in the handle grip began unraveling within a month and now all the handle grip is cracked and falling off
just as i looked for a case for my tablets , i needed one for my laptop i 'm so paranoid about my laptop breaking that this solved all of my worries looked in stores for an economical bag and found nothing that was n't a whole lot of money this is perfect great product , great value
i got the bag on time and there were no disappointments the red is really rich and it comes with so many pockets and compartments it holds all of my stuff and protects my computer , which is the most important love , love it
i liked the look of this when i first looked at it - a little shiny , the black <unk> <unk> were a little more matte , the strap seemed sturdy , as did the stitching my small # `` macbook fit in perfectly , a little snug which is how i prefer it to fit then , after looking at it with my laptop inside i realized the zipper was n't sewn in straight . it kind of looked `` wavy `` between the two side panels instead of straight across it 's not a deal breaker for me but it was a big enough flaw that it bugs me and it speaks to the product quality the color inside is vivid and pretty the cushioning and protection is standard for this type of bag in my experience by the way , i got this in a larger size at the same time and it , too , had <unk> seams
this is a great <unk> bag for my macbook pro with enough padding to provide the required protection , but i 'm less happy with the pattern the black one was significantly more expensive
this laptop case is even cuter in person it fits my macbook pro # `` with some extra room for papers or cords or whatever lots of padding in it as well perfect for a girl that wants a fashionable and functional laptop case :
perfect fit for my macbook air outer material is a <unk> finish which makes it very easy to wipe off but looks very cool lots of compliments on this one
first of all , i love the sort of art <unk> floral pattern of the front , that 's what initially drew me to this laptop sleeve at the same time , `` sleeve `` is sort of a <unk> , because it has way more padding than most of the neoprene sleeves that are more typical this case is fairly low profile , no unnecessary pockets or bulk of mother messenger bag style laptop carriers so , if you do n't need a ton of pockets , but would like a little more protection than most laptop sleeves , then this is the bag for you the straps can also be removed if you do n't want them but please note that this bag is only for laptops # `` or smaller
i saw this product in the apple store and had a chance to examine it before ordering it online it is a very practical laptop cover with a handy strap so you can carry it off your shoulder -- particularly handy when traveling and you have to pull out the laptop before going thru the security check in the cover itself has very good padding and the product is well made and sturdy the only thing i wish it had was a pocket to put the power plug in otherwise i love the black and white design that is so fashionable and in now i would recommend this product to any of my friends and colleagues
this notebook sleeve specifically sized for # `` laptops should not be confused with laptop cases , which have pockets and compartments for peripherals the acme is exactly what it calls itself : a padded sleeve with a zippered top and a shoulder strap , nothing more it 's great if you want to protect your laptop for short excursions to a wireless hotspot or a meeting just do n't expect to put anything else inside ; you wo n't find even a pen holder the exterior is a shiny , vinyl , slight iridescent white with a black pattern the interior is a soft , stretchy , <unk> purple that helps the laptop slide inside with ease the straps attach with strong plastic clips , an attachment method i usually hate on laptop cases , but in this case , the weight of the laptop is sufficiently light not to cause problems if you want something more functional , look at the various laptop cases and briefcases on the market if you want something <unk> -lrb- but not elegant -rrb- and simple , this sleeve may be what you 're looking for - <unk> <unk>
i ordered this item after careful measuring and my laptop had plenty room when i got this item in the mail , my laptop did not fit , i could n't squeeze it in . i had to then pay $ # to return it and i am not happy about it
this laptop sleeve is really well made , has good padding , and should straps , but it lacks organization structure that is important to me at a minimum i would like a side pocket for my power cord and would be even better with a small slit pocket for a bit of paperwork likewise , i 'm not sure i like the `` patent leather `` <unk> other than that it 's very lightweight , has good protection , and an overall good product if all you want to carry is your laptop
this came on time and as expected the only surprised was with the product itself i did n't expect the patterned surface to be so shiny and plastic feeling i thought it was more fabric textured , but i think maybe i just was n't paying attention to the details of this item it fits my apple very well though and the back is fabric other than the shiny surface , everything else about it is great
i love the laptop sleeve . . the price was amazing , and the cushion inside is awesome ... the only thing is i have a hard time getting the computer out of it because it fits so snuggly i guess it should to protect it
this is a very nice bag it 's light and looks great my only complaint is that it could have really used some sort of small pocket i know it 's marketed as a sleeve , but since it does have a shoulder strap , it implies to me that it can be carried by itself somewhere to put my wallet or even just credit card would have been nice for when i go out with my computer and do n't want to take another bag along other than that , great product
i have one of these for my # `` macbook pro and one for my # `` , and i have to say that the # `` model seems to be the most <unk> in relation to the computer it 's thicker than a neoprene sleeve , but not so thick that you 'd question whether or not you should just go for a laptop bag the padding is quite good , and fits unibody # `` mbp 's quite well i 'm not sure i 'd subject it to being tossed down a flight of stairs , but bouncing around your car or backpack should be fine with this one thing that is n't <unk> in the picture , is that one side of this is shiny faux patent leather , and the other sides are ballistic nylon the design looked relatively neutral to me in pictures , but in person , it 's very feminine all said , this is a pretty decent sleeve , but if you 're not in love with the design , you 're probably better off getting something different there 's nothing extraordinarily good about this sleeve , and the price is in the middle of the road as sleeves go
an attractive but functional case for my laptop it is a snug fit for my # inch hp notebook , but it does accommodate my extended battery which juts out from the battery well almost an extra inch the case is shiny vinyl on the pattern side , plain on the other with a purple felt interior which makes losing random small objects less likely and protects the shiny surface of my computer from extra wear overall , slim and trim without any extra storage space if that is what you seek it makes a great sleeve for using inside another <unk> designed bag , too , such as my rolling office bag i am quite satisfied with it
this is exactly what it is advertised as ... a low profile sleeve that you can fit in a bookbag , messenger bag etc . think about airport security , a lot of times you need to remove the laptop from a bag , but it is fine if you keep it in a sleeve the whole point of the sleeve is that it is n't so big it fits your power adapter , lunch , keys , cables , etc . the floral design is a bit girly , but unlike the photo its most of matte black on glossy black the inside is purple and there is a metal logo plate on front all in all i found the construction and quality very high ... the padding seems thicker than some of the caselogic laptop bags i have seen and i would n't have any concerns about using this on a long trip
it is way too small for my gateway # . # `` laptop i did n't realize # inch would make that much difference it will not even go in it plus it was going to cost almost as much to send it back as i paid for it
this is very nice looking but just too snug it is a massive struggle to get my # inch macbook pro out i have to make sure it is absolutely and completely unzipped , turn it upside down and pull and shake my laptop out although it is designed to protect -lrb- and does so while stuck inside this thing -rrb- i am worried that i will actually damage my laptop just trying to extract it maybe mine is defective i am disappointed but feel it is not worth the hassle to return it
the website description is misleading when it says it ` fits most # `` laptops ' , which leads you to believe that it will not fit some and be snug in fact , this sleeve is too big for a # `` laptop it 's much too large for my daughters backpack and the laptop easily moves around in the case , not offering the desired protection we 're returning it and will be looking for a better fit it obviously works for some with larger notebooks but not for our needs
i like a lot of things about this laptop case , though it also has a few drawbacks it is attractive and a bit different looking , <unk> <unk> black <unk> <unk> over the cream colored , smooth plastic front of the bag the back is a finely woven black cloth which looks as if it will take a lot of wear the bad is fairly thin and light , yet the padding seems adequate to protect a laptop in most conditions the bag has just one large compartment for the computer and no other pockets , internal or external it is useful to have extra pockets for <unk> , cell phones , etc . , so i see this missing feature as a drawback the biggest problem for me though , is that the case is too small for my laptop i purchased my compaq presario cq # last year , so it is not exactly a <unk> , but it does not even come close to fitting inside this case
i absolutely love this laptop sleeve i have gotten so many compliments on it it looks smart and stylish , and not at all like a bulky laptop the sleeve provides adequate protection for schlepping my laptop back and forth to work however if you are hard on your laptop , this is will not provide the ultimate in protection another con is that there is no room for anything else in this case ... not even the power cord or a mouse however i dock my computer once i get to work , so this is perfect for me
this product is a fairly good laptop sleeve ; the only issue with it is that my # inch laptop fits a little too snugly because of this , it is hard to get out of the sleeve when i actually want to use it besides that , however , the product is nicely padded for protection , has a strap for easy carrying , and actually looks nice it is definitely helpful to have , but it should have been made slightly bigger
i really like this new sleeve as a storage case and transportation case for the laptop it does what it should - provides protection from accidental dropping , impact , liquid damage , etc . - very small -lrb- not much larger than the laptop it protects -rrb- , so it is lightweight and easy to <unk> size makes it great to store a <unk> <unk> does not - offer much storage -lrb- which would make it larger and heavier
the product is durable and nearly perfectly fits the # `` macbook pro great design and there is padding on the inside of the zipper as to not damage the computer great holiday gift
i love a handbag , it is a given with family and friends - and if i could trade them all in for a lifetime supply i would -lrb- do n't judge me -rrb- what i love most about the acme is that it is great eye candy and well made there is enough cushioning for my macbook pro to feel safe it is not a steel case for a laptop , so if you are the type that does a lot of running around and more than your share of pushing and shoving and need a little more protection look elsewhere but the bag was sturdy enough to take moderate abuse and the sleeve has this wonderful mother of pearl like coating on top of the black design , which sadly is not stitched but plastic the strap felt sturdy as well there was room to spare for the adapter and a notepad
i ordered a cover for my # in macbook pro , and i was shipped a # in cover the company had me return the product with no hassle and gave me a refund the cover looked exactly the way i expected and seemed to be of good quality , just the wrong size i will reorder
the look and style of this bag is great the pattern is really pretty in person -lrb- i was afraid it would look plastic -rrb- and the inside is a very nice <unk> purple the strap is a great length and comfortable to carry the only downside , and i realize this is my own fault for not thinking about this factor before i purchased , is that the bag has no room to store any accessories my netbook fits perfectly , but there is no room for a charger , mouse , etc . so it really is n't functional for taking a netbook on a trip or to school for more than a few hours but the customer service by the company was great and i got the bag very quickly with their free shipping
this sleeve barely covers my # . # inch <unk> <unk> netbook it is a tight squeeze to get it in and zip it once in the <unk> it is better protected but there are no pockets even for papers it is basically like a little purse i use it and put it in my backpack which is better than just putting it in there uncovered the cover on the wet black version is shiny
i received this netbook sleeve in black it has a vinyl front in a <unk> design and a solid cordura type material on the back the interior is well-padded , has sewn seams and is a very pretty eggplant color the strap hooks & case rings are made of metal my # `` acer netbook just fits into this sleeve i can get my <unk> <unk> wireless mouse inside & the sleeve zipped , but there is a distinctive bulge if i do this i love this netbook sleeve and will use it regularly ; however , i wish acme made had sewn on an outside pocket for carrying a wireless mouse & netbook power cords # stars because i ca n't carry everything together -lrb- mouse , netbook & power cords -rrb- . # stars for good looks & quality
first let me say i absolutely love the design and look of this netbook sleeve aside from its looks , the case also features a shoulder strap , water resistant materials , and a decent foam padding the sleeve provides pretty decent protection for the netbook secondly , price is excellent for the quality and look of this sleeve i rated it four stars because the sleeve just fits my acer netbook and has absolutely no room for the power adapter for me at least , bringing the adapter along with the netbook is a must however , my kindle and ipad fit in the sleeve and so do their power <unk> so , most likely i will continue my search for a light weight sleeve for the netbook -- one that either will fit the inclusion of the power cord or one that sports an outside pocket for it again , for the price , you really ca n't go wrong with this stylish and useful sleeve whether you purchase it for your kindle , ipad or netbook
this case is well made and includes a black nylon web strap about # inches wide the case has about # inch of padding all the way around that gives a suitable amount of protection for you computer i like the look of it and will probably use it as a <unk> bag as well i gave it four stars because while it is just a sleeve , it is certainly strong enough to have an extra pocket to carry money , a credit card or cell phone it is small enough to conveniently carry your computer , but from a woman 's point of view , large enough to make it a bulky accessory if you have to carry a purse as well
this is a stylish looking little laptop case it 's well padded , well made , and feels good in the hand the zippers could have opened a little wider for my taste , but i suppose that 's minor this could easily double as an ipad carrying case too the side with the design feels a little like stiff vinyl though and may crack over time but overall , this is a great little bag and the price is right go for it
i like this sleeve a lot - included was a strap to carry it on your shoulder - it is sufficiently padded on the inside - the design is attractive - there is only one main compartment , which depending on what you want to use it for could be limiting this can be used for a number of things other than a netbook , and i often use it to carry my wii or my kindle overall , if you do n't have a lot of excess peripherals that you need to carry as well , this is a really handy and stylish case
i really like this sleeve i have enough bags to carry around -lrb- purse , book bag , etc . -rrb- i can carry it using the strap or throw in my book bag it light and padded it is easy to access my ipad and feels secure carrying it around .
if you have seen this at a retail store and then order from amazon you may be disappointed i had looked at this at office depot and liked it very much checked on amazon and it was $ # less so i ordered it when i got it , what a disappointment is was smaller and made very cheaply i returned it the size description is not accurate for what size laptop it will fit
this carry case is not durable the inside fabric lining used to hold the padding easily pulled away from the stitching that held it in place only after a few months of use for the price i paid , they should have used a more durable fabric for the lining
about a month after using this case <unk> , the d-ring holding the straps in place snapped , rendering the case pretty much useless to me , as that 's how i use the case most often also , after putting my laptop into the case , there is a ton of space left over in the computer compartment i 've been able to fit in about three extra notebooks in there , which makes me worried for if i ever drop my computer , as some kind of cushion needs to be there at all times
i use this bag for a # inch hp tablet fits with a little room to go it 's very basic with the main compartment and a side pocket with <unk> / cell phone holders since getting my hp tablet , i 've been able to stop carrying around paper and books so i wanted a smaller bag this is the perfect size and also has a sturdy handle and shoulder strap looks great too
this bag fits my thinkpad t # s perfectly and gives extra room for the charger and a portable mouse it 's constructed well and is really light one of my favorite things is that it was a handle on it and a shoulder strap so i can carry it however i want
if you put anything in the side pocket , it will stretch out the material holding the zipper , which makes the zipper <unk> when carrying this flaw is not very elegant , so i returned it otherwise , it was a nice case
i just got a macbook # inch and this bag is the perfect size and it 's really cute my only gripe is i wish the handles were on the outside somehow . you ca n't close the bag with the handles out other than that i <unk> it over to starbucks with ease
this was a perfect gift for my mom i could not find any decorative laptop cases that i liked in town , so i am so glad that i chose to look here it is even nicer looking in person , and seems like it is made well
pro 's : nice design not your typical laptop case and does n't look like it on the street lightweight and simple just for your laptop and a bit more without the bulk of the common case and my girlfriend loved it now she just needs to switch to a mac ! :
i was really excited when i ordered this bag and was a little disappointed when i finally got it the compartments are great and the size is perfect for what i have the back compartment is perfect for my ipad # my main complain is the back part of the bag is really uncomfortable it feels awkward on my back when i 'm wearing it -lrb- messenger style -rrb-
works great does as advertised the quality is great and is very durable i can toss this thing around without fear of breaking anything that being said i wish i 'd have gone with the bigger one
i do like my kata # in # camera bag very much it seems to be very well made with strong zippers , reinforced seams and durable heavy-duty buckles kata bags are uniquely styled while not sacrificing <unk> and convenience as a person 's equipment list <unk> , so will their need for a bigger bag and when it does buy a bigger kata camera bag
this is without the best bag i own for general use it provides quick easy access to my primary camera and accessories generally i prefer to have it set up as a sling bag , but for longer hikes or on the mountain bike i wear it as a back pack my primary travel dslr lives in this back with both a telephone and a wide angle lens this bag makes it easy to grab and go whenever needed , and thus this bag is with me most of the time
i was looking for a backpack not to big so i can carry it around without the bulk o weight ; but depending on the occasion , i would like to carry all my stuff i have a d # , battery grip , with # lenses , # flash , gorilla tripod , extra batteries , memory cards , cleaning accessories , etc . it fits on this wonderful bag i 'm getting use to the different ways to use it , but everything fits tight and feels secure
this kata bag is quality made it holds everything that i needed it to hold and is stylish the problem is that i 'm only # ' # & # # ; ... and this bag is chunky ... when i put it on , it was <unk> i returned it
overall this is a very good bag it is a lot of room to carry all of your equipment too much room for my needs very well made top compartment is a little small given the bag 's size with my setup , a d # and an # mm lens , the camera moved around a lot in the bottom section regardless of how i packed it it also seemed like it put a lot of stress on the lens mount when the lens was attached in the end , i ended up returning this bag and got the kata # i bag this one was just too big and boxy for my use if you need to carry a lot of camera -lrb- s -rrb- / lenses , this bag would be great
i bought a kata <unk> d- # and i returned two days later it 's a great product , very comfortable and the quality is outstanding however , it 's bulky and way too big for my needs -lrb- i tend to go out only with my # <unk> + a couple of lenses -rrb- now i 've bought the # - # and i much happier with this model
this bag is as close to perfection as a bag can get pro . 's : durable and and <unk> : there are not enough secure compartments the bag is a bit of an <unk> -lrb- i guess aesthetics were not in the original design .
you would have read all good review bout this one ... and it certainly is i would have given it # stars but why is there no bottle <unk> bottle place ! ! i will need to carry it around all day when traveling so a bottle <unk> should have been an obvious but kata chose otherwise , why ? :
this kata camera bag is made of durable materials and is in good quality the inside is big and provides very good protection for your gears the only thing i do n't like <unk> are the straps it will become loose and longer when you carry heavy gears for long time
perfect layout and design fits on all airlines as a carry on holds dslr camera with grip , # lens , flash , laptop , cords and accessories is great for going through airport screening as you can open it just enough to get out what you must
it is a comfortable backpack and big for carying all the stuff i need on mountain trips if you do n't carry the laptop you will find that space useful for a water <unk> the upper compartiment is also very big and you can put there some sandwiches or recharger , batteries and so on i also <unk> the tripod holder wich i find useful not only for carying a tripod you can put a bottle of <unk> in the tripod holder if <unk> do n't plan to use a tripod overall this is the best backpack i 've ever had and i am <unk> happy that i bought it at avery good price thank you amazon
i 'd been searching for a photo bag that had three features as a requirement # -rrb- backpack # -rrb- laptop compartment # -rrb- rollaboard handle <unk> the kata # - # met these requirements i bought the bag right before my trip to <unk> and the kata 's <unk> design of not appearing too much like a camera bag is a helpful deterrent to getting robbed the bag does n't scream `` look at me , i have an expensive camera in this bag ! `` . one of the greatest features of this bag is the luggage handle attachment strap its build quality is really good and the interior is easily customizable the quick access compartment for the camera body can be used from either side the bag also converts from a traditional backpack to a sling bag in about # seconds i highly recommend this back to any traveling photographer
if i 'm going on a trip and taking the dslr with me , this bag comes too it fits my laptop and a lot of extra stuff , so it 's perfect for travel it works well as a carry on , and fits under a seat on a plane
very nice holds all my equipment , easy to get to everything , straps are strong and the sling works great if you are looking for a great sling bag this one is it
it is a very well made dslr bag i normally do n't use dslr bags but for traveling and this bag carries a lot of stuff , including the laptop and its accessories with luggage allowance going down i carry this bag along with my carry on and this bag goes on it 's handle easily i love how it hides all the extra lengths of adjustment straps
for my use -lrb- <unk> <unk> in third world conditions -rrb- , this is the perfect size and feature set i 'm packing # lenses , canon # d body , macbook pro , led light , media , portable hard drives , extension cables , and miscellaneous accessories for a trip to <unk> next week <unk> it arrived , it looked a little smaller than i had imagined , but it is actually an excellent size it took me a little bit to wrap my head around the designers ' thinking about the zippers , compartments , straps and various pockets , but i am really happy with the versatility it affords for the size , it 's substantially lighter than other similar bags , due to their <unk> construction materials the shoulder straps appear well-padded and sewn , we shall see how they hold up but i anticipate very well kata 's bag quality is <unk> it is one of the three <unk> in the video world -lrb- <unk> , <unk> and kata -rrb- this bag does not disappoint by the way , it does n't scream `` i 'm a camera bag ! `` which i also like very much
the bag was torn on the inside and the tags looked like they were put on again so i dont believe the bag was new it was advertised as new but this vendor ended up selling a bag which was previously used as new which was a huge let down
this is a nice genuine hp bag i knew it would be too big for my hp # . # inch netbook but i can carry all the accessaries and my tablet as well
i bought this bag primarily for bike commuting and so far is very good keep in mind that you 'll have to get super minimal in the stuff you carry i actually use a traveler <unk> laptop charger , an hp elitebook # , ipad mini and a super minimal <unk> - can that 's it . you 'll get your wallet and keys in there and your company id good quality , good materials and construction
when i ordered this bag , i was worried if it was too little obviously when it was delivered , i am satisfied to say it help my laptop well and accommodated few books along with the charging cable i am pleased
i purchased this to replace my old case logic after the zipper broke , and it has served as a worthy replacement the <unk> really saves me a headache , and the <unk> is far above par mind you , i am a novice when it comes to these things ... never really been much of a man purse guy -lrb- like it or not , i have come to terms with it -rrb- but this is great for anyone who carries more than just a few things with them during their daily commute it holds a lot for the size - i use it to tote my surface , keyboard , mouse , a few books for work and other office essentials -lrb- along with various other <unk> -rrb-
nicely made , looks like it will hold up pretty well it is small so do n't plan on using this for a laptop and other items like an e-reader - but for a small -lrb- # `` or less -rrb- laptop and power supply it fits the bill i am using it with an hp elitebook # p , which is a convertible tablet and a little thicker than most # `` laptops
great messenger bag that is very light and durable it has ample storage compartments and a small footprint , too i purchased this for my surface pro and ipad air because i needed a smaller case , but also , it can hold my # inch lenovo yoga and ipad air including both chargers with room to spare i honestly did n't think i could find such a nice case for the price and very pleased
specially designed for hp mini , as soon as i received i <unk> all the <unk> to carry all my on-the-go gadgets with my hp mini no problem , i had plenty of space and protection i 'm so happy to order this one for my wife
purchased my mother in law an hp mini and wanted her to have a nice bag to carry it around it this fit the bill and looks pretty nice too she was super happy its a good bag with lots of compartments that at first glance looks like a purse
looks to be a pretty nice bag , however , laptop compartment is smaller than advertised the large bag is supposed to fit laptops # . # `` wide by # . # `` high my dell m # is # . # `` x # `` should fit , right but in fact , it does n't it will fit in the main compartment , but you lose the -lrb- admittedly small -rrb- protective layer in the laptop compartment more importantly you lose the tsa approved feature where you can just unfold the bag and do n't have to pull the laptop out to have it x-rayed not the end of the world , but it would n't hurt to get the <unk> right in the description
hi all , i chose this bag because of the good reviews and because its tsa compliant ... sounded like a great feature the bag is definitely roomy and would probably fit all my needs except for the main needed feature ... the computer space the description states a medium bag will : `` fit computers with dimensions not to exceed # . # `` wide `` problem is that my # . # `` wide laptop will not fit i cant get it through the zipper opening i had to return it the day it arrived i do like the bag , so i 'm gon na try the large size and hope my laptop fits just beware of the stated sizes ... they are not correct
do n't buy this bag if you are looking for protection for your laptop the padding is extremely thin and one side of your laptop will be resting directly on your <unk> there are lots of zippered pockets -lrb- maybe too many -rrb- , my favorite is the only one accessible from the outside , on the bottom . it 's easy to access the pocket without looking the straps are not able to be removed from either side which is good because the hand hold is awkward , and not comfortable for carrying like a briefcase otherwise the quick release buckle to expand then <unk> is a good feature as another reviewer mentioned the bag is large , even the medium sized the metal buckles need to be <unk> every time the bag is used but overall the style , material , functionality are all very good i wish it was a tad smaller , and had more padding i 'll be keeping this bag and using it every day
generally i like this bag and i am glad that i bought it but there are a few things i would definitely change the shoulder strap material is too flimsy and easily gets flipped around , so every time i put the bag on my shoulder i have to straighten the strap out the front hooks are difficult to hook into # the handle on the top of the bag is not set in the <unk> so whenever you hold the bag by the handle it tilts awkwardly # the # zipper pockets in the front are very thin and do not expand they are only good for storing thin object , but nothing with bulk -lrb- i.e . not a computer mouse -rrb-
the tsa flap is one of the best functions with this bag i now need one less tray when going through security just unzip the flap and i 'm ready to go while the flap that covers the other items is nice and large , if you need to open it in a quiet setting it can get quite loud it also takes additional time to have to hook on the metal hinges everytime you want to close the bag the <unk> can keep things fairly organized with the large compartment however , the front storage area does n't have much depth to put items in once unzipped there is very little room otherwise great bag
looking back , i got my hopes up too much by reading some of the reviews for this bag , which made it seem like this was the perfect bag , and the best laptop bag ever it is a great bag , but still just a laptop bag , it did n't make much of a difference in my commute or travel i take my laptop and supplies with me every day to work , and i have also traveled with this bag it 's well organized -lrb- probably perfectly so -rrb- , and i do n't have any complaints on the placement of items , the quality , size , comfort , etc . it 's an overall great bag i 've had a little trouble with the straps that hold the cover closed , they do n't always want to attach easily , and have a tendency to come loose also , there could be more padding for the laptop , but the <unk> are adequate for use as long as you 're careful and do n't throw the bag this is a great bag , and i would purchase again
bought this bag for my commute into downtown chicago on the train from the western <unk> i wanted something that was <unk> and light weight and not your heavy , stodgy , and way too overdone leather messenger bag the <unk> color with black trim and lime accents looks awesome love the hidden `` <unk> `` pocket and it 's ease of access when on the go the quick adjust strap with memory buckle is so convenient and allows you to switch from position to position only reason i did n't give it a # out of # stars is i wish the handle was a little more substantial than just a nylon strap
i 've always been a fan of timbuk # , but as soon as i started using the command , all my other timbuk # 's have sat unused in the closet the few pockets it does have serve to really help organize day-to-day items without limiting the ability to carry those <unk> items the laptop pocket swallows my very large laptop , and in the two years i 've been using this bag regularly , no damage has come to my computer plus the ability to swing the bag open for tsa is nothing short of awesome ! the stress of getting separated from your laptop while going through airport security <unk> because it never leaves your bag the quick release buckle works great , and allows you to slip the bag over your helmet -lrb- including <unk> motorcycle <unk> -rrb- , then since it back up without having to remove even thick , padded <unk> gloves my only complaint is that i really wish there were better color options
i 've owned one timbuk # bag from years ago that has held up incredibly well , so it was a no-brainer to go with another one for my laptop this is a great size for a large computer like mine , a # `` widescreen the pocket for the laptop has these little `` nubs `` inside it which both protect the laptop and keep it from any sliding -lrb- which there is n't much to speak of in the first place -rrb- it is incredibly roomy and customizable , with organizers that you can rearrange to your preference inside the main pocket -lrb- via a system of fabric loops and velcro -rrb- it 's a very cool set up the shoulder strap is well-built and comes with a good shoulder pad no worries about it digging into your shoulder my one `` negative `` -lrb- and this is light -rrb- is that the color selection is limited this is incredibly minor , but i 'm just putting it out there
this is a really nicely designed laptop bag has all the nooks , crannies , and organizers to hold all your wires , power supplies , phones , etc . i especially like the power supply storage since it is conveniently located at the bottom of the bag and is accessible without opening the main bag same is true for the laptop compartment finally , if you travel , you do not have to take out the laptop at the tsa security checkpoint because the bag opens in a way that is tsa approved for scanning i originally purchased the timbuk # commute # . # but it did n't fit my laptop make sure you go to the timbuk # web site and measure your laptop accordingly to ensure it fits in this or any other of the laptop bags the sizing is correct - i just thought i could squeeze a few more inches out of the bag but there is n't the tolerance for that
i bought this bag in college and it worked great but it was n't until i graduated and started bike commuting to work that it really became awesome laptop , lunch , change of clothes , cell phone , wallet , etc . it all fits no problem and is comfortable on the ride metal clips are functional and attractive i also use this on plane trips and the <unk> <unk> is super handy if for some reason my bag ever failed on me -lrb- which i doubt , because it has shown barely any wear after # years of daily use -rrb- , i would buy another in a heartbeat
i have had <unk> bags i carry them every day i have the north face , nike , <unk> , timberland and various other brands , but all were lacking in someway or not professional to carry every day then i researched and found the timbuk # bags it has so much storage areas my wife calls it my purse , since i carry it everywhere it stores everything from my ipad to my pistol to baby diapers , sometimes at the same time lol i can not recommend enough
maybe the best bag that i 've bought so far it 's held up extremely well , with only minor wearing along the buckling spots easily fits all of my day-to-day items only thing that has n't fit yet is a full sized keyboard
