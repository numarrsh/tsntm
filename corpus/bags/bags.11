i bought this backpack as a direct replacement for the synergy backpack i bought almost # years ago almost every detail was the same or very close in the pictures ... however there are several differences worth mentioning if you had the older model this backpack appears to be slightly smaller than the original , just slightly , not enough to make it an issue , unless you have a # `` laptop stuffing the same contents in this bag , it was a little tighter another change that made a big difference to me was the absence of # pockets in the laptop storage area . # smaller pockets that i used for interchangeable drives are no longer present also , there used to be a larger pocket i used for paperwork in that section that is no longer there i used the original swissgear synergy practically everyday for almost # years and if this bag can have that kind of longevity , i will be very happy if the bag would have been exactly the same , i would have given it # stars but due to the absence of the # pockets i used pretty much everyday i had to kick it down a couple <unk>
i love the number of pockets and padding it is very comfortable to wear my only complaint is the zipper system is a thin wire that <unk> around the cloth and not really a tooth type of zipper a tooth zipper would be sturdier and able to handle minor abuse my backpack got hit on the upper corner which smashed the & # # ; zipper & # # ; and made it unusable i tried to bend the wire back into place but it was too damaged and i only made it worse and totally busted the zipper that said , i liked it well enough that i bought another one to replace the broken one -lrb- which also now has a minor zipper issue after some usage -rrb-
does n't hold quite as much as i 'd hoped , but overall i 'm pretty satisfied with the backpack itself however , i 've been using it less than two weeks and the material on one of the backpack straps is already fraying i 'll be returning it soon
i had to replace the motherboard and memory chips after being caught in the rain without an umbrella never had this problem with previous backpacks otherwise nice backpack , seems sturdy it has a lot of space without <unk> the shape of the backpack
my tests of such items need to last over years i did take the bag through europe already and it seemed to hold up okay if you use all the pockets though it does get a bit tight , eg the side pockets the seem a little strange i put toothbrush and razor in there ... seemed to work okay i think there could be a few design adjustments but for the money i think it 's good so far just starting out a new school so this year will put it to the true test
plenty of room , very durable with lots of compartments i use this to tote my laptop <unk> files back and forth to work would also be very suitable for school use there is great padding on the straps i would buy again
i like every thing about the backpack except for # thing the length of the straps for the adjustment of the shoulder straps are just too long when you are just carrying it these straps drag on the floor and then you step on
this is the best backpack i 've ever had i 've used a dell backpack , but that was not this good i 've been using this for # years now and its performing exceptional ive used this bag as my carry on , laptop bag , gym bag and camera bag and still no complaints i totally recommend this ! but there can be better bags out there but this is totally worth the price i paid
this product is extremely useful for college students that have books and laptop to carry it has many pockets , both large and small , for keeping all your things organized one downside is that it is heavier than normal backpacks
the backpack is pretty good and as described ... does n't feel heavy or bulky ... has lots of space for your weekend trip ... work good for me : -rrb- i have seen a few other backpack from swissgear but i like this the best so far ... ! !
i love this bag 's design and , for the most part , it 's quality however , this is my second bag i liked it enough to by a second one when two zippers went bad on the first one after a year -lrb- cost more to fix than to buy a new one -rrb- i put this bag through a lot and it is well designed and rugged , but i just had a zipper break on this new one -lrb- # months old -rrb- fortunately , it is on a pocket i do n't really need zipped so i continue to use it did i mention i really like the design just needs better zippers , wenger
i read a few reviews which stated that there is no way that this bag will properly fit a # . # `` widescreen laptop i just bought the bag and it fits my dell inspiron e # -lrb- which seems like a `` full `` sized # . # `` widescreen -rrb- easily i just wanted to set the record straight for anyone who is looking for a bag but afraid that their # . # `` widescreen wo n't fit unless you have some gigantic machine that i have n't crossed <unk> with , you 'll be happy with this bag ps - i first bought a ogio <unk> from ebags and found it to be a <unk> ... <unk> , huge , and my laptop did n't even fit into its ridiculous side zippered pocket
pros : lots of pockets ... very durable and sturdy ... has a flat bottom so it sits up ... good looking cons : does n't fit my panasonic <unk> laptop very well ... have to <unk> it in there
i 've bought # <unk> of this bag for my husband he travels weekly and is extremely rough on his bags , so he needs something sturdy like a swissgear for his laptop and other accessories he needs for work the newest version of swissgear 's computer backpack is n't quite as large as previous versions and does not come with a chest strap if those features came back by the next time i need to buy a backpack , this review would be a # -star
well made , good amount of pockets , but it has a fairly narrow base so it has a tendency to fall on its face no matter how i pack it
i bought the synergy because i needed a robust backpack that can fit the stuff i carry to work everyday i needed a backpack that was a little more robust and <unk> with a lot of pockets synergy backpack by swissgear definitely does the job and , so far , it 's been great the only minor , pet peeve of mine is that the side pockets are too tight but a minor thing compared to the overall functionality of the backpack with is very good
i just received this last week so ca n't comment on durability however , my dell latitude e # and lenovo t # thinkpad both # . # inch screens fit easily into the swissgear backpack however , there is no padding between top of laptop and zipper so a neoprene sleeve may be needed for better protection
built to lasts long the laptop compartment is just a little bit to tight for my sony vaio but perfect for my compaq , both have # ' screens the difference is in my laptop 's footprint
i spent a lot of time looking at backpacks , walking to the cash register with one in my hand and deciding against it i did n't want to pay that much , i saw this one on line and bought it so far so good , it has pockets everywhere and for the price i do n't think you can beat it i would recommend this product
it 's worth for it 's price it has enough storage space for a laptop and all it 's accesories you can use it for a short travel with # set of cloths and other stuff for travel it 's base is rigid and stable the top pocket is really useful for keeping mobile and <unk> and it 's easily accesible
this is a good buy for the price i 've had this bag two years now and the seams are starting to unravel , but it 's lasted good until now my only other complaint is that it 's quite heavy - add # lbs to whatever load you are
this is a very durable backpack and has lasted me two years only recently have the metal holes on the front started to come off , and they are only cosmetic -lrb- though may lead to a weakness in the fabric later on -rrb- the backpack has provided wonderful protection for my laptop and has plenty of room for books and accessories for a full-time college student , this has proven to be very useful and quite durable
i bought this bag for my # inch laptop it fits perfectly the bag is a little heavy and heavier when you add the computer , books , charger , and other accesories there are so many zippers and storage spaces , that i am not even yet sure what to do with them all overall , a very good and useful bag
this is a great bag it fitted my # . # `` screen laptop very well it has a good number of pockets -lrb- still getting used to the bag , spent about # minutes this morning searching for my ear phones -rrb- , which greatly increases the utility of the bag i made a step up purchasing this bag , i previously made use of a cheap targus back , i have no regrets with my decision to purchase a wenger swissgear product the material is decent , and -lrb- yes -rrb- the bag is quite comfortable to carry as the straps do indeed absorb the weight and shock of whatever you put in the bag the bag ended up being bigger than i expected , -lrb- which is a good thing -rrb- , cos i like big bags and currently go around with quite a <unk> stuff i have had the bag for just one week , i will probably keep you guys posted if my opinion ever changes about the bag ; if not , it means i am still enjoying the bag
first of all ... this bag looks <unk> on me as someone have said before -lrb- i think -rrb- , you 'd look like a ninja turtle with it trying to find a way to compress all that empty space so it wo n't look like a shell second , i do n't know why but for some strange reason , the bag feels heavy everything i had put in the messenger bag that came with my laptop is all i have inside this bag , but this one is heavier to carry as for everything else , i like it just the way it is
i purchased this pack for a son going to college i ended up using it for a couple of months myself it is very designed and built it has pockets everywhere it has a surprising amount of padding on the back to allow comfortable carrying of a laptop and other papers zippers appear to be first quality only issue of concern it that the pack is smaller than the massive ll bean packs that my hs kids now have it will probably not hold a days worth of college books but what it will hold , it will hold in comfort fits a # inch laptop well
i ordered this bag after finding it at amazon cheaper than what was advertised at other stores and web sites bag was shipped quickly in perfect shape although it is a little more bulky then i would like it is very durable and looks great
i am very satisfied with this swissgear backpack as already reviewed by many others this is the best backpack i found although it would have been ideal if there were few other color choices i purchased this from beach camera - who provided the best price in comparison to everyone else in the market the quality of the product delivered is as expected i would have appreciated if the free shipment option could have delivered little earlier instead of taking more than a week but otherwise its overall a very good deal
this is a great bag if you do n't put a lot in it for women , a regular size -lrb- # lb . -rrb- laptop and a couple textbooks and a few extras like pens and a wallet can have this bag weighing in at over # pounds in no time while i like the quality and the fact that it holds a lot , the sturdiness of this bag means that it weighs a lot even empty , i think it 's really heavy stronger persons than i might love it , but i found that it was too large and heavy for daily use a waist strap might help alleviate that for future similar models
i like this pack except the side pockets are a little bit of a stretch for larger size water bottles and sometimes you only have limited choices at some airports
i would give this product five stars if the chest strap were adjustable up or down unless the pack is sitting very high on your back , the chest strap will about <unk> you other than that it is ruggedly constructed i especially like the metal cable reinforced handle
thousands of pockets , you will make use of every square inch of it however i miss some <unk> pockets and the stripes that are used as a belt in some other backpacks
this is a great backpack with a lot of room and a nice strap on the back to slide over your luggage handle to help carry it through the airport if there is one knock on the item it would be that it 's a little too big to go under the seat on the plane
i have purchased this item twice in different occasion , the first time was for me , then my friend liked it and asked me to get one for him too it 's a great bag and very useful when traveling and hiking i would recommend it for any laptop <unk> or frequent travelers
plenty of features that i really like * ventilation <unk> in back , to manage <unk> * large compartment separate from laptop -lrb- i can carry two days ' clothes , in winter , in addition to my lappy * many smaller compartments that are easy to get to * thoughtfully laid out in general * full , just fits under an airplane <unk> 'm <unk> towards * shock-absorbing shoulder straps reduce <unk> but lend <unk> -lrb- especially when running -rrb- , and i wonder about their <unk> am disappointed * no rain flaps over zippers true , they would make the zippers harder to get into , but still , they would keep some water out in the rain * a rather flashy design i would prefer a simpler , more <unk> design , perhaps with one well-placed color splash on a more uniform dark background too many swiss gear symbols <unk> the backpack -lrb- on every zipper pull , for example -rrb-
i 've had these bags for # + years now and do n't ` need ' to ever change them out b/c they are such a great product , but just like new looking bags i have all tumi luggage and this is as good for a # of the cost ca n't go wrong with this product
this bag is durable , sturdy , and has plenty of shock support and cushioning to protect my back i can safely transport my laptop , and the bag has room for # textbooks , notebooks , a lunch box , and all of my little miscellaneous school items this backpack will last me at least # more years
i had the ogio metro until it was stolen ... but this one makes up for what the metro was lacking the pockets are great and plenty and it has separate places for my laptop , tablet , headphones , planner , umbrella , and cords it is easier to get on my back and is more comfortable when wearing than the ogio i thought the ogio was great until i got this one to replace it this one is even better ... and it actually feels lighter than the ogio but i seem to have more in it
gave this to our son for his birthday and it was a big hit ! the backpack is well-made : sturdy fabric , handles rugged , zippers strong he needed one to carry his laptop and this fit the bill ... it has plenty of space for other items and lots of pockets for carrying accessories the price was very reasonable for this product
i bought this for school and to use with my # `` macbook pro fits perfectly , although the laptop strap at the top has stretched since than , but its no big deal since the strap does n't really do anything the handles are reinforced and the bag overall is built very sturdy it will be one to last for years
i 'm in the computer business and this is by far the best `` computer case `` i have ever used there are so many pockets to carry everything and the computer is suspended from the bottom , keeping it save from being hit when you set the backpack down i am very pleased with my purchase
this <unk> bag is amazing it holds more than i ever need it to , but it does n't impede anything by having these capabilities one of the best purchases i 've ever bought and my laptop has n't gotten a scratch i highly recommend this for anyone who needs it
i have been using this backpack for # or # years <unk> flights to and from the us to the middle east and central and south america my macbook pro fits well and secure in the laptop portion . lots of pockets and storage i can fit enough stuff in here for a weekend work trip and have some room for some entertainment gadgets
i got this backpack to carry around my macbook pro widescreen , my old bag had to be carried and it was too much on one side for my back with this i 'm able to carry the computer and lots of other stuff with no problem , the ergonomics of the pack are excellent the only complaint i have is that the chest strap may be a little too small for big guys , mine seems a little tight even at the <unk> setting but i never really use the sternum strap anyway so it 's not a big deal overall , the bag is a good value , it carries my laptop well , has lots of pockets , and distributes the load well
this backpack is great i am a college student and carry a # . # inch laptop with heavy medical books and i can barely feel anything heavy on my back due to all the backpack back padding it holds a lot of things and can organize easily in this backpack
i decided in this based on other reviews , and i agree with them it is a good product , strong materials well design plenty of room and compartment , and cheaper than other places
very nice backpack i looked at a lot of backpacks online with this being one of them , then i saw a guy with this pack and that did it bought it through amazon that day i 'm not disappointed
been checking out laptop backpacks after reading various reviews and personally checking out the synergy backpack i decided to purchase one definitely max size laptop is # . # & # # ; luv the number of pockets in this bag , i like how swissgear has placed pockets at the top of pack where you typically have a lot of unused space quality of how the bag is constructed seems to be very good , but we 'll wait to see in another # months to a year
this backpack is excellent , it has the right space for everything you ever wanted to ` put in a backpack books , folders , laptop , mp # player , keys , pencils , and all the spaces are big enough also the materials are of excellent quality
i bought this pack for my husband before he left on a two week business trip he loved it it had enough pockets and plenty of inside space for his lap top and papers
this bag is wonderful for travel . it has many compartments for various items and the shoulder straps are comfortable for <unk> <unk> items around my boss gave these as christmas gifts last year and definitely serve a good purpose
i do n't easily write reviews , but i thought after owning this bag for more than # years i owe to this bag a review still no problems very sturdy -lsb- no problem with rough use -rsb- , carries heavy load when i require it sometimes , dark so you do n't have to clean it often -lsb- or at all also enough packets for me to store all i want , that too into their proper <unk> like computer , book , bottles , smart cards , <unk> , <unk> , phone , purse etc . and most importantly for a laptop bag , it does its job very well if you are a guy , you wo n't go wrong buying this it has that masculine look as well so obviously not very good for girls -lsb- in terms of style only - functionality wise it would be still perfect -rsb-
i bought it as my laptop backpack finally broken after three years of <unk> duty overall , i am satisfied with this backpack it has huge amount of capacity even i have n't expected i can easily put my coat , books and laptop inside without any problem the sock absorbing is excellent i ca n't even feel the heavy load when i walk on campus one thing that come with these advantages is well , it 's too heavy if you do n't put much load inside it is <unk> to have this backpack without much load
i use this swiss gear for school it 's wonderful so many pockets two pouches for water bottles , and great back support it is easy to over load it , so be careful
i bought the first one of these i saw in best buy over two years ago since then i have traveled across campus , across the country , and back and forth the first batch of these had a couple of problems , but wenger backed up the lifetime warranty they replaced my first backpack after more than a year and a half worth of use and abuse , and the replacement is even better constructed the bag i have now is the synergy that is for sale here and i have had it for almost a year now and it still looks new i carry a # . # `` laptop , power supply , trackball , a few books , a <unk> of <unk> , a <unk> , and usually some snack food , all in this little bag they take the use and are super comfortable no matter if i 'm <unk> across the parking lot in the morning , or standing in line at the security check at the airport absolutely the best laptop backpack i 've ever seen
excellent backpack , holds things well inside the large compartment there is a partition for loose papers the ipod area is also nice because it keeps your ipod easily accessible , however i rarely have my ipod in there when listening to music it is nice for travel purposes , for example on an airplane with the bag under the seat you can easily grab your ipod out and but it away useful pockets , but not too many unnecessary pockets if you spill a drink in the large compartment -lrb- like i did -rrb- , your computer will most likely be protected -lrb- as mine was -rrb-
i have had this backpack for two weeks and it is everything i expected i needed a backpack to carry my laptop and other items to work this backpack has plenty of room for two laptops , accessories , books , lunch and more i would highly recommend this backpack to anyone that wants to replace their traditional laptop bag with something that is more comfortable , functional , and has more room
i 've had this backpack since may # i still use it every single day this is by far probably one of the best purchases i 've ever made in my entire life
top quality all around the materials , zippers -- all excellent there is a nice protected small pouch at the top for a smaller item like a small camera , which protects that item as well looks good too
this bag makes taking your <unk> / etc . extremely easy i have loved this bag since i purchased it earlier this year , but i found out how useful it was after we had a fire at my workplace since i am now a `` turtle `` with my office on my back , i appreciate it even more the padded cushions for your back make even longer walks between meetings very comfortable
a hs senior , i 'm constantly carrying a ton of books i can fit a lot in there , leaving laptop out when not necessary very lightweight and kind on my shoulders if any shoulder or back pain occurs is because i 'm just carrying way too much
excellent bag for carring your laptop and all accessories has separate section for file folders also padding on the back straps makes carring it a breeze i recommend this if you carry your computer with you
i 've had this bag for almost three years and it has been amazing i 've taken it on several trips and while there is wear and tear the only problems i 've had have been user error -lrb- i slammed the buckle in my locker door -rrb- the padding protects my laptop very well , and all the different pockets are easy to organize and can hold just about anything you need i 've even used it to pack my heavy climbing gear the bottom is great , it 's thick and rigid , offering protection and keeping the bag upright i love this bag and am getting another one to replace mine , with the broken buckle
i used one of these for the last # years and carried it all over the world i use it to hold my laptop and all of the other things i need when traveling for business or pleasure the old back pack got worn out and it was time to replace it mostly , the old one had gotten worn on the bottom from dragging along the ground when attached to my roll-on bag the new one is even better than the old they got rid of the waste straps and the padding for the computer is even better than before the whole bag just seems tighter and easier to carry i 'm not sure exactly what the changes are , but i love it
i was hoping that this bag would be my all in one tech bag , and it 's that and more i carry with me to work two # `` widescreen laptops -lrb- thinkpad t # and dell latitude # -rrb- and it works great my initial concern was with my thinkpad i have the # cell battery which sticks out quite a bit but it fits just fine with the battery connected the second laptop may not have the greatest protection in the world sitting in the front but i also do n't throw my bag around the side pockets are great for carrying my two power supplies and there is still plenty of space for other items i 've read other reviews that say the straps have too much cushion but i love it when i carry two laptops at once other bags i have would cut into my shoulders with the weight of two laptops but the extra cushion is a life <unk> when carrying the bag for an extended amount of time overall could n't be more pleased with this buy
very comfortable with enough pockets to make you lose things overall a great backpack that hopefully will hold up as long as my last wenger pack -lrb- # years of abuse -rrb-
just got this bag and have taken a few business trips with it what did i do for so long without it having previously used a leather shoulder bag i find this new backpack to be lighter , infinitely more versatile , and , since it 's a back pack , much easier to carry padded packets with lots of storage make this the right bag to sort out work items from kindle , headphones , etc . and it has a killer handle
this is by far the best backpack i have ever owned shoulder straps have a suspension system so even when loaded this feels light and easy to carry lots of useful pockets and zipper pockets very well thought out product kudos to the swiss
everything good said about the bag by others is true ; it really is a super backpack it goes beyond being well-made sturdy the padding is thick but unobtrusive , and it rides high enough on the shoulders and upper back to take the strain off of the hips the craftsmanship , right down to the double stitching , is evident amazon filled the order and shipped the bag promptly , making the buying experience a pleasure those looking for quality and efficiency can do no better than the wenger synergy purchased through amazon
my son saw this at best buy when he was shopping for his laptop computer and decided this was the backpack that he wanted for college it was highly recommended by the staff at best buy i found the same backpack on amazon.com for nearly # . # less , and the shipping was free my son is extremely happy with the features of the backpack and i was extremely happy with the price i highly recommend this to anyone looking for a backpack in which they can carry their laptops safely
this is the second one i have bought the first began to fall apart on one of the shoulder straps still i looked around at other bags and decided to buy the same model again -lrb- though it has some small improvements -rrb- for all of its pockets and features
i purchased this bag before a long # week business trip in march to asia i had it packed to the max and it held up <unk> have made # more trips since then and use this bag as my main carry-on plus holds all of my business necessities would n't travel without it !
i 'm going to keep this review brief and to the point : this is the best backpack that i have ever found on the market for a # `` laptop i have been through several laptop backpacks before this one , and this one far surpasses all of them this one has tons of pockets and roomy storage compartments , and it feels strong and sturdy in your hand it also stands upright on its own , with or without a laptop in it the material is very strong , the zippers are strong and smooth , and overall this backpack is just a true delight the backpack could probably use a little more padding around the top and side edges , but that would just be nitpicking at this point i highly recommend this # `` backpack it 's a shame , by the way , that this company does n't make this bag in a # `` version i just upgraded to a # `` laptop , and was forced into buying this company 's # `` ibex backpack the ibex backpack is ironically a huge step down from this # `` synergy backpack
i 've had a wenger backpack -lrb- i think it is this model , but the interior color is different -rrb- for maybe # years it 's still holding up basically like it was when i first go it , except the padding on the shoulders is compressed , as you might expect it holds a lot of stuff , including a large laptop , and is very durable my biggest complaint is that when it 's full , it really sticks out a lot in the back , and people sometimes comment on it -- like i 'm wearing a shell on my back overall , i 'm still very happy with this product
i purchased this backpack in # to use as a daily carrier for my laptop , lunch and coffee and misc stuff after many loose coffee cap spills inside the <unk> and trips through the washing machine i am still carying this bag daily to and from work and school i 've never abused the bag but the bag and it 's contents travel through an xray machine <unk> belt daily on my way into the nuclear power <unk> where i work it is the most durable bag i 've ever used i 'm looking at a replacement because the outside fabric is starting to fray some after looking at other bags and reading other reviews i 've decided to stay with this bag why change when you already have the best
i am not a sales person to sell this product i am a person who is using this and i am really happy with this it is just the best bag we can find i have seen all other brands and <unk> with # big <unk> notebook backpack this is just for a person like me who would like to stuff everything into one the more you stuff , the more you realize how less you have stuffed i just love this bag swiss gear is swiss gear a brand , quality and <unk> which is hard to beat
my sister bought the bag for college over a year and a half ago she still has it and it looks great i , on the other hand , decided to be frugal -lrb- ok cheap -rrb- by buying a `` computer `` backpack from walmart i have gone through three bags for the one bag she bought i decide to buy the bag for the spring semester and i could n't be happier now i know why she bought it it has room for my # . # `` toshiba laptop , its adapter , a # -subject notebook , and a few text books it does have a lot of pockets that i put my pens , pencils , recorder , and all of the contents of my purse the bag is <unk> too -lrb- i.e . not specifically masculine or feminine -rrb-
thanks it was what i was looking for for my laptop it keep it safe and has a lot of room for all the stuff i need for work i would advise anyone looking for a laptop back this is the one
sturdy , well organized storage options for with or without a laptop enough space to carry laptop and a few clothes and necessities for short trips or for the & # # ; delayed checked luggage & # # ; scenario on longer trips every space is easily accessed it is quite comfortable to carry even when fully loaded and yet it still fits easily in in overheads or under most airline seats
i would highly recommend this to any college student that totes their laptop around actually i would recommend this to anyone who totes their laptop anywhere it fits standard size laptops and offers two cushions for protection plus there is the added benefit of how roomie it is it will hold several textbooks plus binder with the laptop as well knowing how much the laptop cost , the price was very reasonable and gives me sense of relief that when my son is throwing his <unk> in the car the laptop stays protected the shoulder straps are cushioned for extra comfort and can be adjusted for an even more comfortable
i was looking for lots of storage space and this backpack has it the padding for the laptop is decent and there are plenty of pockets to carry just about anything it is well made and should hold up for years the price is a little high , but i got a great deal at amazon the one negative is that it is on the heavy side
i bought this backpack to be able to take my # . # `` computer with me on a long trip without having to carry it like traditional luggage or a briefcase it was great for the purpose , protecting my computer and giving me plenty of room to carry all kinds of other stuff the backpack is not light and not small , but it is very well made and full of useful and usable features it is very comfortable to wear , although i found the chest strap to be <unk> a bit too high to be of much help i like the variety of pocket sizes and locations the main handle at the top was well padded and more than adequate for carrying it fully loaded when you do n't want it on your back if you need a really sturdy , roomy backpack to protect a computer and carry a bunch of other stuff along with it , this is a good choice the biggest challenge will be remembering which pocket you put something in
this item is great i use for school and when i go for short trips i can carry books on it or cloths it 's very suitable for laptops with widescreen -lrb- # . # only
i see this thing everywhere i go it 's built well to last for a long time tons of compartments to keep everything organizes you can carry # laptops in this bag if you really wanted to the shoulder straps are quite comfortable and its got a reinforced handle for carrying it by the top great padding for your back to maximize comfort definitely something to consider when looking for a backpack to carry electronics and notebooks -lrb- both the it guys i know use this bag -rrb-
i 'm going to make this short i paid about $ # total and it 's worth every penny i 'm a big guy over six feet and <unk> this pack is tough i have a dell inspiron # i use the pack to carry back and forth from my computer shop and when i 'm out on my bike this pack is with me it 's got all the right compartments and i 've got plenty of room left over for the future or i need to tote something you pay a little more and it is made in china but it 's a good deal i 've used it a few weeks now and it holds up i should also mention that it seems to be good about getting damp as well i would n't trust it to get soaked but in a light rain your stuff should be good until you get shelter or it stops
this backpack is amazing for carry a laptop and books almost everywhere the backpack comes with tons of padding on the back and some on the shoulder strap to make the backpack feel later than it actually is the backpack also has tons of pockets ; there is a place to put everything my macbook fits perfectly into the backpack as well in addition to the macbook , about # medium schoolbooks fit in the backpack as well the only down is to this backpack is that it is huge if you just have a laptop in the backpack , it takes up just as much space if there were books in the backpack this is due to padding on the bottom of the backpack , although it can be folded inwards , but this might be a hassle other than bumping into a few people on the bus , this backpack is a must have for laptop owners
this bag has more pouches and pockets than i know what to do with it 's sturdy and well made it 's also very large i have yet to need to carry so much stuff that the bag would n't cover it
so , i 've gone through a few backpacks and cases for laptops , and so far this is my favorite i 've had it about a month and it has been great - lots of pockets and compartments - makes it easy to organize your stuff , especially if you have lots of gadgets , cables , chargers , etc . - back compartment for laptop only , but can fit two thinner laptops if needed sometimes i have a need to toss my wife 's tablet into the pack - small top compartment for music player and accessories - i love that this is n't some deep pocket , but just the right size - bottom of main compartment has a fold down flap to keep the base flat - very rugged construction - well built . cons - the only thing i 've not liked too much is that the shoulder strap when used on a single should does n't quite feel as snug and comfortable as other backpacks i 've tried
this backpack is i believe the ideal backpack it 's got a lot of room and many pockets as well as a laptop holder it is on the heavier side , but this is as close to perfect of a backpack as it is
i think this is the only product i 've ever wanted to write a review about i bought my synergy -lrb- that name for this bag -rrb- in # and have dragged it around the world , many times with two laptops and a video camera or a change of clothes in it if i 'm making a short trip , there 's actually enough room to pack a few necessities so i only have a single carry-on i 've had no problems with the zippers as a small number of reviewers have seen in fact , i think that this is is exceptionally well-made i 've beaten mine up pretty good over the last three years , and if a strap fell of tomorrow , i would n't think it <unk> me anything i like the bag so much that i just purchased another in case something happens to this one - it 's that great of a bag * # months after this review - i 'm still using the original
i am a backpack aficionado and tend to carry anything and everything with me # of all the bags i 've owned , this one has got to be one of the best very durable -lrb- as are all swissgear bags -rrb- and the amount of pockets are amazing no matter what 's in my bag , it always stands upright as well i would highly recommend this backpack to anyone who is interested in getting a bag with a little pizazz
this is an awesome well mad back pack that holds a ton of stuff it has a ton of compartments and its easily the best backpack that i could find its very stylish as well
i have had this backpack for almost # years and it is still going strong it does n't fit large items due to the arrangement of the pockets , but it is great for a laptop and several books
this backpack seriously has an enormous amount of storage space there are many pockets , and yet the backpack itself looks streamlined the zippers look like good quality zippers , although they are not metal one thing i really like about the synergy is the <unk> support that allows the backpack to stand upright you would think that such a backpack would be heavy , but it 's actually quite light very happy with my purchase if swissgear puts out more products like this , i 'll definitely be buying more of their stuff
this is by far the best backpack i 've ever owned it holds a ton of stuff , way more than you 'd expect it has a nice pocket for you laptop the bottle holders on the side come in very handy i 've had mine for about # years now and i 'm pretty rough on it and it is still in great shape the backpack is very well made i just bought one for my daughter who is in high school and she seems to like as well i very highly recommend this backpack if something were to happen to mine , i would most definitely buy another one of these right away
i purchased this for my son for christmas he needed something to carry his computer along with books , etc . to his college classes he is very happy with it his computer is well padded , there are lots of zipper compartments for various items - plus , it is very comfortable to wear her loves it
i have been using a targus backpack for years , and when it wore out i decided to try this one because of the additional padding i can fit my laptop , camcorder , digital camera , and all needed accessories in this bag and it is still a light load and comfortable when traveling through airports
i 've bought this backpack for two of my sons -lrb- college students -rrb- it seems to be <unk> both have been using it for a couple of years and they are both in good shape
i have been using this backpack for # years , still using it and the results are excellent i would recommend this to any new backpack buyer it has multiple pockets for various use and is a real convenience i love this
awesome backpack for your laptop and other gear , ie . cellphone , gps , chargers , literature etc . . this pack has so many pockets and compartments , it holds the laptop securely and safely i have a toshiba with a # `` screen and it fits perfectly , thats about the biggest laptop it will hold the shoulder straps are padded and contoured so it feels great we traveled via air recently and this was a great carry-on it holds alot , and i mean alot , of stuff and fits great in the overhead i would recommend this to anyone , great pack at any price i chose the free shipping and got it in # days , awesome
