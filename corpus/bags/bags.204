i bought this item because i now split my day between two jobs , and needed a bag that would let me carry books and binders , along with file folders this bag is perfect the handle has a little too much play , but it works great every time the bag itself has a roomy interior with enough inner and outer pockets to hold extras i 've had a lot of compliments about this bag and i 'm happy to brag about it
i purchased this case for college , and i am extremely happy with it it is strong , great quality , lots of room , looks very professional <unk> for those in need of carrying heavy books i would recommended to anyone and the price is great ! !
i bought this as a gift for an employee that just got her law license and started working for me as a new attorney when it arrived i pulled it out of the box and was instantly jealous i want one ! ! ! i 'm getting one for me i 've been looking for a quality nice bag like this for years i did n't know if the quality would be good like on this one , but it was i really like it
we looked locally at all the usual office supply <unk> this was less expensive than any of the decent rolling cases and easily as nice as anything we saw up to near $ # we just got it and looking at the quality i think it is going to hold up well i 'll update in a few months with how well it 's holding up and any pros and cons we see
i purchased this for law school my books are huge this brief case has plenty of room it 's a tad manly -lrb- <unk> shape , bulky -rrb- but does n't bother me at all it fits effortlessly down the isles in my classes it holds everything so far nothing has broken on it i 'm <unk> it lasts also shipped so so fast
i was surprised at how big it was i thought & # # ; i do n't need anything this big ! & # # ; but i have only had it a couple of months and i have filled it to capacity several times and i did n't even have my laptop in it i do wish it had some more dividers in it , sometimes things shift around a bit but overall this does exactly what i bought it for should have bought one years ago
i was so excited when i ordered this because i just bought my macbook and i was excited to customize it my package got here and i was eagerly awaiting to put it on when i opened my package , a clear case was inside i ordered a hot pink case not happy at all ! ! ! if i could rate this no stars , i would !
i have only had this case for about # months and for some reason the corners are cracking i 'm very displeased because i was expecting it to but higher quality than this garbage i do n't know if maybe their was a defect in the case that caused it to start cracking , but i would highly appreciate it if you would send me a new one
i just bought a new macbook and wanted to buy a case to put over the laptop there not cheap and do not want it to get ruined i received it in the mail today i was not happy with it at all it looks very cheap and does not even stay on the macbook it 's the right size but does not snap together i was going to send it back but the price to send it back must ending costing more than i paid for it in the first place i will not order from this seller again i learned my lesson
the product did not fit my apple computer and the back cover was delivered broken the product arrived quickly and the return went smooth , but i did not like this product
cheap , key cover wo n't lay flat in places and is easily <unk> by typing normally prevents heat from dissipating and will add heat to whatever unit you use this on not sure if this would help prevent failure during a spill either
never got a chance to use product the description says ` blue ' . i received hot pink this purchase was for my son and he was not about to use hot pink i tried to exchange for the correct color that i ordered and was told it was unavailable i do n't know why you would put ` blue ' in your description of a product and not have it available had to waste time and gas returning useless product
after a few months of use the corners started to crack and not long after all two corners on the bottom cracked and fell off my computer stays on a table or desk and i do n't carry it around on a bag , not a bump or anything and the corners simply fell off very disappointed ! ! ! i read other reviews <unk> to the same problem please amazon , help us ! ! !
have been waiting over a month for it to be shipped still have n't received it and going back and forth with customer service , only to find out they are now out of this color option
this is a great price and a great color it was very easy to put on but after less than # months it is cracking in all of the corners -- top and bottom i carry my macbook in a padded sleeve in my bag so there is no reason this should be cracked hope to return
smacktom shipped my case within # days , which was awesome once i opened the package , i realized the case was not the color of the picture on amazon the picture is very misleading the case is a dull green , not the <unk> blue that the picture <unk> i am going to return it
the top part looks really nice on the laptop then i noticed the bottom part is way too small does not fit at all ! so im trying to take the top part off and it does not want to come off ! ! !
the case fits well and is actually a nice value for the price , but i thought it was worth noting that the keyboard cover does not fit it 's a nice looking keyboard cover , but appears to go to a completely different keyboard i would return it , but it 's not worth the return postage unfortunately , i will have to go out and purchase another one i 'm disappointed and would hope that the seller would correct this <unk>
it is perfect love the color and love the rubberized texture everything fits nice and snug just beware the screen protector only covers screen where u view things not edge to edge was very excited about the product but it did n't even last # months before it cracked and chipped i did not use it roughly at all most of the time it sat on my bed and never was dropped or misused
it 's a very nice color but the only bad thing is it gets dirty really fast , rubberized should n't has finger prints as much as the clear snap on cases when i used a wet towel to clean , it leaves spots like faded here and there on the case , even after it dried spots are still there i could n't return because i used the screen protector , so i ended up ordered the clear set instead of the rubberized on ebay , and i like it a lot better
great concept - horrible <unk> rubber keyboard does n't stay put on the board just annoying when you 're trying to type the plastic outer shell broke after a few days of having it from there is just continued to chip off pieces of plastic until one side was just a sharp corner then the back side started to crack and chip off the only good thing i can say about the product is that it actually fit our macbook just fine would definitely not recommend save your money and invest in a bit more expensive case
cover was awesome keyboard cover was dirty when placed on my computer you can tell the clear part is <unk> and the pink has black spots all over it i 'm thinking someone else owned the keyboard part
it lasted one year & # # ; so i guess for that it was okay the spongy key pad cover was awful i took it off i would purchase a color cover , the clear looks dirty after about # weeks
considering the fact that macbook pro generates substantial amount of heat , i do n't think that this hard cover is suitable for apple macbook so i will give it # out of # secondly the key board cover definitely helps the computer to protect from dust , but the material substantially reduce the speed of typing hope one day this <unk> cover material will be smooth enough so that typing speed will not be reduced i will give here # . <unk> , the transparent computer screen may protect the computer from dust , but the material creates lots of air bubble so , i will give it # . once again i want to <unk> that this is a review of the material not a review of the seller
i bought the skin case and the keyboard cover for my pro i just received the skin case , no the keyboard cover and the skin case has poor quality it had <unk>
this came in the mail pretty quickly and i received everything in the picture the top cover snapped on easily , and the keyboard cover fit perfectly , lining up with the right keys , but the only problem i had was the bottom cover i had a difficult time trying to snap it on because it was slightly too small after a good five minutes i finally snapped it into place and everything was good until two months later i noticed a crack on the bottom right corner of the case i did n't think too much much of it at first until it chipped off a few days after and i scratched my wrist on the sharp corner of the case
the casing is a very cheap and flimsy material that cracked and broke the first time i removed it the keyboard protector is amazing though ; it makes it a little harder to type though
the case itself is great , fits well and all but the keyboard cover 's letters dont match the letters of the laptop and it sort of bothers me the screen did n't come with directions or anything either
the case is nice it fits and the keyboard cover is great however , this case is not a hot pink like the picture i was <unk> more of a hot deep <unk> and instead i would compare the true color to a neon barbie pink it 's still cute , but i would like to warn those of you who may be super picky about color
the keyboard cover is a great tool for keeping your machine clean but , it does take a bit of getting used to at first you will be surprised -lrb- and disgusted -rrb- at how dirty your keyboard gets over time i find the hard case skin is more aesthetically pleasing , however it does keep scratches off the top and bottom of your computer you get what you pay for , and overall i am satisfied with this purchase
we were looking for a cover that would offer & # # ; grip & # # ; when moving the macbook around based on the description it sounded like exactly what we needed when we recieved the product it barely had any & # # ; grip & # # ; to it it does offer some form of protection so we are keeping it one drawback is that it picks up smudges easily but it is not easy to remove them overall a decent product for the price
after i bought and used it for a month , i realized why the hell in the world i would want hide the beauty of one of the most beautiful products of decade so i removed it besides , it <unk> my mac hell bulkier -lrb- at least i felt that -rrb- i would say , the product served it purpose well , only if it was needed
i love the color of the case it 's a bright orange that 's unique to my laptop alone it feels soft the reason i give this # stars is because the keyboard cover sucks it 's very thin , and you can see the black through it , which makes it look dirty also , not all of the letters line up precisely i have n't tried to apply the screen protector yet
this product was perfectly fine during the first month but then after that it just started to crumble there were cracks on each edge of the case and it started to break but on a positive note it does protect my laptop and so far there are no scratches on my macbook the extra stuff added like the the screen and keyboard protector are in good shape the letters have not faded on the keyboard protector which is good overall i am satisfied with the product i just wish that the case was n't cracking at the edges
i had a red hard shell that i used on my pro and i loved it but after having it for # years , it cracked so i came looking for a new hard shell and keyboard skin i was specifically looking for a blue other than mint because my roommate has a mint hard shell and i didnt want to get out computers mixed up and such so when i found this bright aqua color i bought it upon its arrival i was excited and when i opened it , guess what color it was ? mint i am disappointed that they advertised a different color than the one that comes in the mail but it protects my macbook pro and thats what i wanted so i suppose i cant be too upset
a mac is designed so that the aluminum case dissipates heat through the body with two pieces on my mac and the keyboard cover my mac easily starts to overheat i like these items they work every well the keyboard cover it a bit sized wrong though and bubbles up in spots i dont even use any of this product anymore i dont like my computer actually having to turn it 's fan on my mac is usually so quiet with all these pieces it 's a little loud
this is a really cute set but it seems that my laptop is warmer now that i am using it i took the plastic cover off my keyboard , hoping that it will solve the problem
the outside case is great it looks good and has protected my macbook from any damage however the keyboard cover is very stiff and i often think i typed a letter but did not , because the cover is so rigid however , you do get used to it
it is in good condition overall a good problem the only thin is the bottom case sometimes snaps off , as it does n't fit other than than it is a good
used on a mid- # macbook pro # `` . the shell fits great and looks good and yes , you can see the apple logo through the shell -lrb- since it seems to be of importance to a lot of people -rrb- the screen protector did n't work right for me , leaving a ton of air bubbles no matter how i tried to <unk> them also , the matte finish did n't seem to help at all with glare the keyboard cover does n't fit my model it does fit older models , so if you have a friend that owns one , this would be a cheap -lrb- fairly lame -rrb- holiday gift as noted by <unk> -lrb- after i ordered mine : -lrb- -rrb- , if you own a new mid- # macbook pro # `` , look elsewhere while the hard case is cool , it does n't justify the price
tends to look greasy , and its hard to get off when i want to clean my laptop but overall it protects my laptop , which is the main purpose i bought it
i liked the rubberized case and its muted color however the protective keyboard plastic sheath does not line up with the <unk> and is annoying i tried to reach out to customer care to have just the keyboard protection replaced but was not given the option so i ended up keeping it minus the keyboard protection
this is a great deal for the price the orange looks great on the aluminum of the macbook although it 's very nice looking when first put on the computer , after a while , you begin to see hand marks on the outer cover because of the frosty finish also , the keypad cover is very nice however , once it is placed on the keys , you can see the black of the keys underneath it , causing it to look dirty i recommend a darker color key cover -lrb- the one i currently have is purple and it looks great . lastly , the screen cover fits really good once it is placed onto the screen , it gives a frosty appearance i 'm a bit indifferent about it thus far , but it 's definitely done its job so , all in all , it 's a good purchase
they case is fine and fits perfectly , but keyboard cover does n't lay flat around the edges also the print does n't match up with the keys on the actual keyboard so when it lights up you see them both
every case i have ever ordered some how ends up with a crack in the corner it does n't matter how careful i am with my mac just a <unk> on any case i treat it like it is my child
it started cracking within three or so months of use still pretty cute and the apple shows through perfectly had to stop using it but continued using the keyboard cover , that is starting to look greasy and gross : -lrb- it 's been around eight months though the screen protector does n't look bad either i 'd say it was worth it
this product really helps protect my macbook pro from the sticky hands of my one year old the cover itself fits perfectly and is easy to wipe off -lrb- even when little sticky hands get to it -rrb- the keyboard still allows the keys to light up on the underside however , the reason i can only give # stars is because the keyboard cover does not allow the keys itself to light up since i have young children i am manly on the computer at night and this would help
this product is a great value it comes with four items the front , back and keyboard cover are fantastic it also comes with a screen protector that i did n't think lined up very well the keyboard cover makes it difficult to type at times but i just take it off all in all , a great purchase for the money i would recommend
quality is ok for the price i had a little difficulty snapping on the bottom cover i 've had it for about # weeks now and it already has a small crack at the bottom so , beware , the quality is not that great it looks awesome on though it 's more of a fashion cover than a protective cover but , i would definitely still buy again
the case fits perfectly and looks very clean the keypad protector is nice , but it compromises the backlight for my keys the <unk> sheet did help significantly , but there were air bubbles everywhere so i just took it off
i really like my new case it has protected my macbook very well and it is soft and smooth to touch my only problem with it was that the keyboard cover fit the keys , but it was n't sticking on as well as i would have liked
the keyboard cover fits the keyboard perfectly and always keeps crumbs out the cover itself is also great , could fit a little more snugly on top , but other than that it is good
fits <unk> <unk> screen protector eliminates <unk> great to the <unk> case is very <unk> <unk> protector makes screen appear slightly <unk> cover blocks some of the keyboard <unk> the price , it really ca n't be beat , especially with the screen protector and keyboard cover thrown in only a few problems : the case picks up smudges from your fingers very easily , and the keyboard cover makes it so that the backlight that shows through the letters on the keys can no longer be seen neither of these has really bothered me though , and are things that i think buyers should be aware of other than that , this case comes highly recommended
my wife loves it we did n't use the screen protector but the case and keyboard cover is great my wife uses her computer in the kitchen so the keyboard cover protects the keys from <unk> and <unk>
cheap case for the pricing there are some marks on the case which makes it look kinda of old or used pretty fast delivery as well will recommend and purchase i did not like the screen protector as well
i really like this case its worth buying but when i received it the bottom had a crack other than that i would of gave it a # star review the keyboard cover protector fits perfect love it a really good price
the case is a little more clear than the picture but it is still really pretty also , the edges of the case are a bit sharp so it 's sorta uncomfortable when typing but its bearable besides that it was a good buy
it was really cheap , fit perfectly , came on time , over all a very good product however the only thing i was disappointed about was the color i thought it would be more of a grayish blue by looking at the photo , but instead it is much much brighter aqua blue it is n't a deal breaker though , just not what i expected by the photo
i really just wanted something to cover up some scratches that was n't silly the orange cover is fun the cover is also sturdy and easy to hold it was really easy to clip on the keyboard protector feels weird , but you do n't have to use it
for the price , this product is amazing the only reason i did not give it a # was due to the fact there was not a manual or some sort of <unk> <unk> to applying the screen protector on
this kit contains the <unk> laptop case , a screen protector and a rubberized cover for the keyboard big thumbs up for the laptop protector , with the exception of the fact that one of rubber feet was glued on off center i imagine i 'll need to <unk> that someday i have n't tried the screen protector because i 've found them problematic on other devices but the rubberized keyboard cover is , in my opinion , a waste of time it fits the keys correctly , but it doubles the effort you need to press the keys and the rubber is noisy compared to the whisper quiet of the bare keys overall , i 'd say the kit is a good deal because i would have paid the same price for just the laptop case
very quick shipping it was nice to get the product early since i was concerned for my computer the rubber scratches <unk> , but it fits securely and protects the corners nicely
protects my lap top from being scratched up it took some time to get used to the rubberized key board cover but the act that it protects the keys from dust and other particles makes it worth while i also like the looks of the
this item is not the color pictured above , but it is still a pretty color and workable the screen protector does not fit the entire glass area of the screen but it does cover all of the screen that is not black that was a little disappointing , but not a big deal the keyboard cover also has a button or two where the picture or letter is smudged looking and so you have to know what is on the key underneath in order to know what it should have on the cover also , i have read a lot of reviews saying that the case does not fit and the bottom piece slides off that seemed to be the case with mine , but then i snapped the back part -lrb- by the computer hinge -rrb- then snapped it onto the front and it fits perfectly my order shipped quickly and that was with free shipping that was supposed to take # days -lrb- i got it in # days -rrb- overall , i am happy with this order
the package came as described the only thing i had problems with was the protective screen it was not easy to place on other then that i had no <unk>
nicer than what i was expecting top and bottom shell snap to the body easily and fits well liked the keyboard pad as well did n't care much for the screen protector took it off and liked a cleaner look without it , and without having to bump up the brightness some slightly rough edges that need to be sanded down , but overall , i like this for my recently purchased mbp
everything in this set fits the macbook pro perfectly the keyboard cover is slightly stiffer , but the keyboard still has a pretty good feel to it the outer cover fits well and looks nice the only issue with it , and it is very minor , is that when your arms are resting on the laptop while typing , the edge of the plastic can irritate your wrists a little but it is not that significant to warrant not purchasing the product and the cover for the screen went on very well it does take away the <unk> of the display , so if you like a shiny display , you might not want to install the screen cover all in all , i would recommend purchasing this item
the case cover & keyboard cover are great , but the screen film ai n't so hot it left bubbles between the film & the screen , & cut down on visibility but # out of # ai n't bad
the cover is exactly what i expected rubber case that easily snapped on ; love the keyboard cover but did n't use the screen cover the apple icon does shine through for those interested cleans easy , does n't attract <unk> nor does it get hot with prolong use
overall , i feel as if i got my money 's worth i did n't know it also came with a screen protector so i <unk> excited about that it 's a gift for my husband since he just bought a macbook and since his <unk> is black i figured he would enjoy it
this was a great deal in that it included a laptop cover and keyboard protector a few notes very easy to attach the cover the cover does add some weight to the laptop it is not too much , but it is noticable the keyboard cover takes some getting used to , so be prepared for this you will likely make a few typos as you get used to it , so be prepared for a little frustration i think this is worth it to have the extra protection
this pink case is adorable i get compliments on it everywhere i go the only bad thing is that the bottom part comes off easily despite its one minor flaw , i am still happy i purchased this item i highly recommend this to macbook users
i received the case and keyboard cover faster than expected it its true to the color on display its worth the price , the only thing is that the keyboard does not allow you to see if its on caps lock or not thats why i gave it # stars overall a great product and i do recommend this product
i got this case to protect the outside of my computer when i 'm not at home , and it works wonderfully although i do n't like the keypad cover , the case works very well it does n't make the computer overly bulky and stays on better than i had expected
i really think this was a great deal for the package the case is cool and sleek , perfect for stickers and whatnot it lets you personalize your computer without ruining it or making it permanent the keyboard cover is a little weird to get used to , but it does the job and keeps crap out of the keys i <unk> yes
i purchased the cover for my new macpro and it fit perfect upside : it snaps on easily and comes off without difficulty i was hesitant to use the keyboard cover but i gave it a try and it too fits the keys really well the color is a little off from the picture but still i like it the down side : my son <unk> accidentally with water , it now has water stains so it does not clean easily the key protector can effect your typing but it is easily removable as well in all , i like the product and it does the job of protecting my mac i would buy another -lrb- of a different color just to switch it up -rrb-
gets very visibly grimy from fingerprints you can clean those off by <unk> with windex , but i find this case extremely tedious to keep looking not grimy just from day to day use -lrb- or merely picking it up once -rrb- that problem aside , this case does its job weigh your options and decide if you can deal with extremely visible fingerprints and <unk> maybe this is the case for you it was not the ideal case for me
very nice matte black finish and popped right on and fits perfectly i was expecting ` rubberized ' to mean a ` squishy ' feel that if pushed on would actually indent <unk> -lrb- like memory foam -rrb- , but this is a hard case ... otherwise great product
it is lovely , came quick , snapped right on . the only reason i did n't give a # is because i would have liked if the key pad was solid black with no clear spacing
it seems to work great and you can see the apple clearly it was not the color shown in the picture but it is still a cool color i actually got it or my girlfriend and she loves it overall i am pleased
this product works very nicely so far i did spill water on it though and part of it is now a different shade of blue then the rest , which was a little odd also had a lot of trouble with the screen protector so just gave up on that
i got this for my boyfriend as a & # # ; good job on your first semester of dental school present , & # # ; and he loved it everything fit great and he loves how it 's rubberized
i was afraid that it would not fit when i first saw it but then i figured out how you had to attach it it looks great , i have gotten many comments
looks fabulous and is very protective the only negative i can say is the key covers make typing a little difficult - you have to get used to pushing the keys a little harder than you would without them
i purchsed this because it does not matter how much i wash my hands -lrb- due to make up -rrb- i always leave some kind of residue on the keyboard this protects my computer from any dirt and make up marks
i loved this cover so much for some reason the sides were chipping and a little bit broke off , i was so sad but it was rubberized and felt so good and it was such a beautiful color it was a great deal because it came with a keyboard silicone cover and also a screen protector
really nice cover -lrb- nicer than i thought -rrb- i bought it while it was on sale cause i only paid $ # for it , not $ # the keyboard cover kinda takes some getting use to the screen protector was a little bothersome to put on so i just left it off the case allows the computer to slide on hard surfaces -lrb- to turn it around , slide it over etc -rrb- overall , pretty good saw some of the same cases at stores that were around $ # so im a happy customer
this was a great looking case and fit my macbook pro perfectly it was easy to put on and fits securely i do n't really like the keyboard skin but that 's personal preference - there is nothing wrong with the product i was very happy to find this item at such a great price
the top and bottom case as well as the keyboard cover are protective and decorative they are a great way to make your computer personalized , while also giving it an extra boost of protection
fits on my # in # macbook pro -lrb- not retina -rrb- perfectly looks very slick the keyboard cover takes a little bit to get used to when typing but overall protects it from <unk> , and that 's what i wanted
the case fits my macbook pro perfectly after the first time i put it on my laptop , it clicked when i opened it -lrb- the bottom and top parts clicked when i opened the laptop this is no problem , though if you want something that looks pretty good and fits your laptop , this is it this is the simplest version of it -lrb- white / light gray -rrb- so if you want something that pops more , i suggest another color of this product overall , # /
i bought this case for my refurbished macbook pro -lrb- considering how expensive the new ones are ! ! -rrb- , and after putting the cover on the macbook ... it looks like a brand new laptop everyone in the university has their eyes on my laptop ... . just amazing i would recommend this to anyone who loves orange and would like to be bold ... and be different !
this came in easy to fit and also had the key pad cover which i was not expecting nice fit glad i order it when i purchase another mac i will definitely buy this
# -rrb- fast shipping - i received this order within a day when it was supposed to arrive in # days # -rrb- i love the color of this case the pink is soooo bright and actually looks pink # -rrb- the keyboard cover is a bright pink as well # -rrb- the screen protector was easy to put on as well overall - i love it
i was very pleased with my purchase it was very timely , in fact it was early and i love the color everything was in perfect condition and it fit well on my macbook pro the screen did take me a few minutes to figure out but the results were great ! i recommend this product hands down
i absolutely love it fit perfectly and with ease comes off without a hassle and without damaging the lap top keyboard feels soft and smooth i would recommend it to anyone
you get a laptop cover , keyboard layout cover , and a screen protector they all work perfectly if you like the color blue and your macbook pro needs protection , you ca n't go wrong with this
great product . it is exactly as stated in the title and showed up in one day . will be doing business with smacktom again in the near future . great products , insanely fast shipping
i love it keeps my computer protected and makes it look cool i was a little sad i did get a turquoise color but the aqua green is amazing and unique
i just got my first mac laptop and i was very excited about finding a case this case is perfect it is the perfect shade of purple -lrb- my favorite color -rrb- i just love the way it makes my macbook look the keyboard cover is great too i am glad i purchased it
