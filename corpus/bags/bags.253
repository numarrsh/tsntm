i loved this case because in most stores , you are limited to black , blue or red cases they are extremely boring and not that great protection wise . i loved this case because it 's super cute however , it 's wonderful in <unk> as well i would certainly recommend and purchase again
i bought this laptop case for my # year old daughter for christmas & she loves it ! it got shipped in plenty of time for christmas , i 'm % # satisfied with my
well padded and very roomy my # . # & # # ; computer fits perfectly large outside pouch for charger , mouse and more i have n't had it that long , but so far it is holding up very well
this laptop bag has so many pockets and places to put everything i need to carry it 's <unk> i have a # . # `` laptop and there is plenty of space for the laptop there is the laptop compartment with id holder , pen holder etc . there is a velcroed outer pocket and another pocket that zips really you can put all your purse material in here and your laptop <unk> and only carry one bag
i 'm so happy with this laptop bag - it 's just as gorgeous and well-made as it looks it has tons of pockets -lrb- large and small -rrb- , very sturdy zippers , straps , seams , and velcro closures there is a weird & # # ; new car & # # ; smell , but i aired it out and stuffed it with dryer sheets over night and it 's fine the colors are vivid , the size is exactly what i expected , and the shipping time was awesome even though i did n't go in for expedited shipping i would recommend this product from this seller ! !
well i received this today <unk> this was based on two items one , the pocket for other items like the ac adapter and mouse , the other was because the handles <unk> supposed to retract into the sleeve a little background may be in order in that i never get what i think i should , but then again , i am addicted to ordering on line it 's a really neat sleeve the accessories have plenty of room i just wish those handles <unk> into the sleeve so they would take up less room in my back pack but i have to say that the pocket makes it worth it - hands down
we bought this to go with our <unk> 's netbook it fits nicely and is lightweight for him to carry around he 's had his computer for a few months now and it is still without a scratch or crack he 's got a compaq # . # -lrb- which is the exact same as hp -rrb- the foam is a nice thick density and has protected it from a few drops overall , very happy with the case there is enough room in the pocket for his mouse , but not his power cable
works awesome for my sons netbook and he still has room for his plugs and wires . loved the fact that it had a handle not many other sleeves offer the handle and the front pocket extra features that make this bag a winner
i ordered this for my toshiba # . # `` netbook i wanted something that was n't too bulky so that the sleeve could fit down inside a backpack or a larger bag in addition , i wanted something with handles so that i would have a secure grip on my netbook when carrying it in the sleeve the two handles adhere to each other with velcro and can be easily folded down if need be as other reviewers have noted , the outer pocket stretches to hold the power cable and a small mouse when i need it it looks a little `` lumpy `` when stretched -lrb- note photo -rrb- , but i 'm fine with that the zipper has two `` pulls `` so it can be closed quickly from both sides at once this bag probably would not give much protection at all if the netbook was dropped , but for preventing scratches and for a <unk> carrier , it is perfect
i absolutely love it the pros are that it has a sleek design and it also has tons of storage space it even has a nice thick shoulder strap ! ! ! ! you can lock the zippers together to keep your mini private ! ! ! i love it now , the down side is there is a little cushion on the inside to lift the battery pack upward ; however it is n't enough space to allow the air to flow through over all i love though ... . and ladies ... ... its super cute ! ! ! ! !
i take my netbook out with me often , and needed something to keep it protected this sleeve is perfect the handle makes it so easy to carry , and the zipper pocket on the front is a great spot for any accessories -lrb- cord , usb stick , etc . . i actually use it to store my phone and debit card when i take it in to the library or coffee shop to work i get lots of compliments on it too you ca n't go wrong with it
this netbook sleeve is convenient , especially with its handles it serves its purpose well plus , it looks great if you 're looking for a netbook sleeve that protects your netbook and looks nice , buy this one
my toshiba mini nb # -n # <unk> fit as snug as a bug in a rug into this sleeve the handles , that velcro closed , make portability a snap i would recommend this product in any color for use with any netbook , as this toshiba is probably one of the bigger netbook products
purchased this for my ipad which has the defender case on it and it fits perfect just wanted something with a handle to carry it when needed this was a great purchase love the material
super protection for my daughter 's netbook she loves the color and i love the added insurance traveling back and forth to school the handles are a great design feature my daughter loves the pocket for all her extra `` stuff ! ``
i purchased two # `` netbooks -lrb- for # year old twin grandchildren -rrb- , <unk> # `` netbook -lrb- for a high school granddaughter -rrb- for christmas # <unk> carrying cases for all of them so i searched amazon.com <unk> up with two sleeves for the # ' netbooks and a glove sleeve <unk> for the # `` netbook the price was excellent for all <unk> them in three different colors to distinguish one <unk> another i ordered just before christmas and they all <unk> time for christmas morning
i was excited to receive this bag for my new # `` laptop boy , was i surprised when i opened the large shipping box and discovered the bag was just as big compared to the advertised specs -lrb- # x # -rrb- this bag is huge when fully loaded the dimensions would be # x # if you want a bag this big , i 'm confident you 'd be pleased with your purchase unfortunately , my new laptop , plus lots of paperwork would rattle around in this bag
i opened the box the first thing the wife said was what is that a purse then went on to say i thought you bought a laptop bag when indeed yes i was suppose to get a laptop bag so to make a long story short if you want a laptop bag do n't buy this it looks like a purse other then the look of a purse the product is nice it is constructed well an has a <unk> of pockets
i really like the look and feel of this bag , but if it 's supposed to fit # `` laptops then i 'm # pounds soaking wet this bag easily fits a # `` notebook and it could probably accommodate a # `` laptop the bag is well-made and the quality is just right for the price , but do n't expect a snug fit for your macbook pro -lrb- or any other # `` class product . i give it # stars for my wife 's # `` notebook though
this bag had every feature i was looking for and has been great since i purchased it in march my only complaint is that the velcro tab that holds the strap for the laptop slot came loose less than a month after it was purchased i have super glued it back on , but it is lifting again it may be difficult to get in and sew it in place not a bad purchase , but i will be interested to see how long it holds up
i have not had this case long but on inspection it is first rate riveted at stress points and sewed at stress points lots of pockets i expect this case to last a long while oh , and it looks great too and fast shipping
what a great product i was looking on amazon for a carrying case for my new macbook pro and stumbled on this gem this case perfectly fits my macbook pro keeping it safe while i travel : which is a must for anyone who seriously uses their mac , while looking good every carrying case i looked at in stores was either too small and did not fit my height or too small and looked like an ugly purse ... obviously not what i was going for this bag is not too small , it easily fits my mac as well as my books and notes and whatever else i feel like carrying at the time it really does it all another great feature is the straps on this bag they adjust easily and do n't get twisted like many other bags with all of the features and the perfect size as well as a great price this is a must buy for those looking to protect their lappy on the go
i am really pleased with the quality of this briefcase there 's plenty of space for other small items besides the computer it 's good looking and also not too big i was a little leery it might look too large , but it 's really perfect i like that it has a zipper compartment inside and on the outside i would n't hesitate to recommend this ... it 's great
very well-built bag that works very well with my toshiba portege # . # inch laptop plenty of room for my charge , the mouse , other odds and ends , and papers appreciate the shoulder strap , although i do n't use it
the case is well worth the money i purchased the brief case for my grandson to use in college it is made of quality material , is insulated to protect his laptop and has several several inside pockets for pens , phone , etc . i would certainly recommend it to others
beautiful bag , seriously kind of upset i do n't have more to do with it now that i have it but for everyday use or long trips this thing is perfect , and the inside even looks great in a nice blue
i purchased the casecrown smart briefcase for my daughter to keep her macbook secured when she goes to college and she loves it she carries her macbook in it where ever she goes
the bag is great the shoulder pad is nice and thick very comfortable i was thinking i would use my laptop sleeve inside as extra padding but the laptop area is super <unk> and protected the reason is did n't get # stars is the strap use to tighten the buckle closure constantly loosens itself other than this great bag easy for travel slips on top of rolling luggage and folds flat for security so you do n't have to take it
ordered this as part of a going away present to my girlfriend , who is moving to nyc for college this is a sharp looking , comfortable , stylish , and seemingly well made product her macbook pro # `` slides nicely into the laptop pouch -lrb- which is lined with a very soft microfiber fabric -rrb- , even with it 's hard-shell case plenty of room in the main bag for anything from books , binders , charger cables , underwear , magazines , or alcohol lots of smaller pouches for whatever random things people have to stash away the carrying strap is sturdy , comfortable and detachable , with the pop-out handle being a nice alternative it feels well made , with adequate padding , intelligent design , and good materials hopefully it will stand up to the test of time my girlfriend loved it all in all i would recommend
i like the backpack i was in a bind as i needed the backpack the day it arrived or i would have returned it the fabric around the zipper is <unk> colored it is not that way in the picture
did n't get much usage out of this since it was so tight fitting on the laptop this made it a royal pain to mess with quality seemed good and it was well designed just if they had better advertised the product up front in any case , if you order one be sure to get it bigger than the maximum size because it will be a very tight fit
i have an acer a # tablet was looking for a case and in my search it suggested this tablet when i got it i saw it was for an ipad put my tablet in it , but it was a real tight fit i do have a neoprene skin to protect my tablet so that made it a little tighter than normal did n't know if i should keep it or not decided to try it for awhile after some use , it is not quite a tight , so i kept it really like it now good protection , easy to carry
this case for the ipad is very well constructed and the handle makes it convenient to carry around i would have given it five stars but would like for it to have been # inch taller i have my ipad in an incipio case for protection around the house and fitting it in the targus crave is very tight with the zipper difficult to close - but it can be done without any case the fit is great but i prefer to leave my incipio sleeve on for added protection
currently i carry a targus laptop backpack for work , so i was excited to try the crave backpack case the pack is designed for laptops up to # inches , but has one additional large front pocket to hold other items such as paper books this pocket has a built-in organizer for pens and small electronics , such as a blackberry or iphone there are three additional smaller zippered pockets for more storage one of the features i like about this pack is the leather-like bottom so the pack will not get wet if set on the ground or another wet surface the pack is lightweight and comfortable to carry however , it wo n't be replacing my current targus bag because it is just not big enough for all the other stuff i carry around i will however use it as a carry on for flights , since there is enough room for a computer , my nook and headphones its small size would allow the pack to fit easily under a seat
i love this bag ; i 've had my eye on it since i first got my ipad it 's cute , professional , has an optional handle , and protects my ipad from scrapes and bumps i love the pocket in the front , i put my iphone in there but , i wish it had more pockets and a little more space there is n't much room for anything else , if i put my iphone in the pouch i ca n't fit the ipad charger it 's a great case though , one of the best for the ipad
it 's the lightest and most comfortable backpack i 've ever had there is a sufficient number of pockets/compartments for different things i wish there were different colors available -lrb- e.g . grey -rrb- , but black is good enough to go with everything this is my second purchase of the same exact bag because my nephew fell in love with it too so i gave my first one to him and purchased another one for myself
oh , how i ever live without it most i love is carry handle no need to carry by arm -lrb- <unk> -rrb- , just hand i look everywhere on the market for hand carry and only amazon have this i can put transformer and cord in outside pocket all have zippers also it have good <unk> inside no need to have ipad <unk> protector -lrb- will not fit with <unk> protector -rrb- it is very lovely to have beside you just unzip it , pull ipad out and ready to go
when i <unk> my ipad , there was <unk> missing how to carry it with me on trips , or for business meetings plus it gears , targus crave slipcase does it all
i have a # & # # ; laptop & it fits perfectly in this backpack with plenty of room for # school books it 's lightweight , plenty of cushion , & weather resistant great buy at a great price
i have given this to my husband and # of our children with the ipads i bought them and they all love it extra pockets for cord and a few small items but yet very compact and easy to carry
i have had this backpack for over a year now and it is awesome if you want a <unk> , well-made , slim backpack then this is the one for you the main pocket for the laptop is only large enough for a # `` laptop
lots of padding zipper opens just the right amount enough room in side pocket for charger and cord fits nicely in my briefcase it is exactly what i was trying to find
i 've had this item for over two years and i absolutely love it the quality is very good and sometimes i used as a travel bag i feel my ipad is protected i would recommend this item
i have used this backpack for the last three weeks and let me tell you , i am an <unk> on backpacks i carry them to work , to the library , to the store , and use a backpack when i am riding my motorcycle # months out of the year i am always looking for new designs and features in a backpack , whether i am toting my laptop or going to the grocery or <unk> store targus crave backpack case has some great , no-nonsense and , may i say , common sense features that many other backpack/laptop cases and briefcases do not have i love the fact that the backpack has a heavy , <unk> leather , water-resistant lining on the outside bottom of the bag to protect the contents of the bag from moisture on the ground i can sit this bag on the ground and not have to worry about the contents getting wet , dirty etc . the outside of the bag is constructed of durable , water and <unk> nylon material with <unk> microfiber interior that is very plush and cushions your laptop or other items excellently it also has a zippered side compartment to store a power adapter or other items and has a double zippered front that has a place where you may <unk> your keys , which i find handy when riding my cycle all in all , a great backpack at a great price with many features you ca n't find in other <unk> bags
great small bag for the ipad everything fits and is compact serves well for protecting our investment -lrb- lots of cushioning -rrb- i would recommend it for a quick & easy to carry bag
this is a good backpack the straps are comfortable and easy to tighten while wearing it , keeping the pack high on the back it has two side pockets # . # `` x # `` and a pocket in the flap big enough to put a small note book in # . # `` x # `` the storage area would hold # college size text books and has pockets that would hold pens , laptop cables and a wireless mouse + and a netted zippered pocket the laptop storage pocket is lined with soft <unk> material and would hold any laptop i have seen it is made from water resistant nylon and the bottom is made with rubberized nylon and the back is padded so it sits comfortably on your back
i had the same backpack for # years and got stolen i decided to buy exactly the same one becuase it looks great , it 's very durable and you can fit a lot of things inside without bulky look
i love this case it 's nicely padded and looks and feels well made it has handles that can retract back into pockets , and these pockets can also be used to store other items -lrb- these pockets run the entire length and width of the case and have a snap closure -rrb- it also has an additional zippered pocket in the front for storage the main zipper will not harm your ipad while it is stored inside , because there is a fabric lip to prevent it from being scratched in a pinch , you can also use the case as a kind of stand i 've posted some additional pictures above to show how this is done the ipad # -lrb- with smart cover on -rrb- fits snuggly inside without too much wriggle room , but it is not so tight that it 's a pain to use case is lined inside with a <unk> kind of material overall , a great case
this backpack is sturdy , well padded and should well serve the purpose for which it was made when i tried it on , the first thing i noticed is that it rides high up on your back , like it should as can be seen in the picture , it is well padded , but what can not be seen are all of the pockets both inside and out finding a place to put everything else you want to take with the laptop only thing i found to the negative was it reminded me that i really need to get a new laptop that is not quite as heavy as my old one - like the newer lightweight ones
looked for the perfect case for a long time saw this and all the great reviews , and decided to try it it is perfect not only does it look nice , but everything fits perfectly in it i have been able to fit the charger , cord , a portable stand , and a headphone splitter in the front pocket alone the ipad pocket has a soft interior and is well - padded this case is also thin and light enough for easy travel / storage love , love , love it
the lightest and the best backpack i 've ever had i 'm sure you wo n't regret it my # st one served me # years it 's not even torn out i just purchased a new one because i want a different color
i bought this backpack on campus last year for $ # without checking on amazon first i would n't have done so , but i spilled fish <unk> in my old bag so it was kind of an emergency this is my first review on amazon so it 's clear that i like the product i travel a lot and i also take public transportation so i 've put some quite some miles on it in the last year i use this bag for everything , even when i am hiking because the two pockets on the side allows room for water bottles i did n't buy this bag for the style i wanted something to fit my frame because most backpacks out there are so big and tacky looking that i tend to look ridiculous wearing it as a # year old i am the kind of gal that <unk> my things and i figured this would rip in a couple of months , but it 's still in great shape people still compliment it so it 's not just me being overly excited about something i wanted to give it four stars , but i could n't find anything wrong with it so five it is
i recently purchased a nook color and was having a hard time finding a slip case for it i came across this product while searching amazon.com i decided to go ahead and order it even though it specified it was specifically for an ipad when i received the product , i absolutely loved it my nook color fits perfectly inside and the case is easy to carry highly recommended for any nook and or kindle product
love the colors , very vibrant green inside zippers are solid and the entire bag feels of excellent quality as title says my asus tf fits in no problem both with and without the keyboard dock the only time it was a tad snug was when i had a neoprene sleeve on the tf before i put it in the bag , zipping was a bit of a squeeze that time really excited about this bag when the bad weather hits , not having to worry about rain or snow on my electronics is exciting * <unk> : after using this product for weeks now , awesome fits the tf , keyboard dock , mini hdmi cable , wireless mouse , cell phone , pens and <unk> stylus , all with no prob best all in one bag without being bulky and it looks great have not needed to carry charger but i assume it would fit also
there 's too much space left which is actually uncomfortable when carrying your computer inside the design is nice , but this sleeve is only for # inches computers , which i do n't know if they exist
i got this same sleeve for my netbook and it was perfect , so i decided to get it for my laptop but it was too big and bulky my laptop is # / # & # # ; , so this sleeve would fit a bigger laptop and be fine it 's well made and great design , just too big for what i needed
i purchased this cover for my toshiba # `` satellite laptop it has a great fit , very snug with extra room on the corners for additional protection the pattern is bright and looks the same as the picture the cover is a little thinner than i expected , but it does seem durable and reminds me of wet suit material a bit slower on delivery , took the maximum estimated time my only con : my laptop with the sleeve does not fit into my carrying bag even though the sleeve is thin , it does create a bulkier outline , so be prepared if your carrying <unk> is already snug
i actually have not used this cover except when it first arrived to see if it fits and it does its sturdy and quite nicely done the bad part nothing can go in it besides the laptop not even a small pad i know it is a laptop sleeve , but being able to put a writing pad in would be nice therefore i have not used it , i instead use my laptop briefcase which i felt was too big to stuff with stuff o well , nothing is perfect
i just received my laptop sleeve today and i love it i have a # . # `` laptop and this sleeve fits it perfectly i 've been looking for a sleeve for quite a while now and saw all the good reviews on this one so i decided to give it a try - i 'm so happy i did this sleeve is not bulky , but it protects your laptop the only thing i did n't like about this sleeve was it opens from the top and that 's it i thought it would zip all the way around like a portfolio , but it does n't other than that , i love this product and would <unk> recommend it to anyone
i got this for my wife 's new dell studio because it appeared to fit the studio is quite a bit wider than most # `` laptops so it was n't fitting well into my other # `` sleeves we bought this one because it has a cool pattern on it it is cool looking but the fit is really tight it is literally like putting on a wet suit , very difficult to get on and off usually it takes two of us , my wife will call me over and i 'll grab the sleeve while my wife grabs the studio and we both pull hard this is a bit ridiculous , hence i downgrade it to # stars it should n't be this hard to get a sleeve on and off
i bought this for my dell studio # i thought it would fit because it said that it would fit for laptops up to # inches , but i could not even get my computer into the bag it should specify what type of computer it will fit to avoid further confusion for others
this sleeve will not fit a true # `` laptop i purchased it for my sister as a graduation gift for the # `` dell vostro # the laptop will go in the sleeve with a little adjusting here and there ... but it takes alot of work to pull the laptop out if you want something that is cute , maybe to carry over inside another bag , go for it just make sure you have time to pack and unpack the computer
i am loving this sleeve i do n't travel often but i wanted something cute and functional for my laptop i was just throwing it in my backpack and that was n't smart i have an hp and it fits great it 's a little big but i would rather have that wiggle room so it slides in and out easy bi also love the pattern i did n't want some boring office looking cover i wanted something fun the inside is a very hot pink color , it 's looks great with the black and white
this laptop sleeve has room to spare for a macbook pro to fit a nice design and allows you to keep the computer in the bag when traveling through airport security a great sleeve for anyone with a thin laptop
this case is so nice it fits my # . # `` toshiba laptop perfectly it is a snug fit but still has enough room to zip it comfortably there is plenty of padding and the design is very pretty the inside is a hot pink color which adds a little more fun flair i feel like my laptop will be well protected with this case great price too highly recommend to everyone ! :
great bag , beautiful color only thing i would change is the lining color - cream it is visible on the top portion even when the bag is totally closed i have some concerns that it may show dirt otherwise , a great purchase
i gave this to my wife as a gift for her new laptop she is very happy with it so far as she did not want a bag that was bulky this is a great size for her the only reason i did n't give # stars is that the # `` laptop it 's used with has an extended <unk> battery which makes for a very tight fit this would be a perfect fit for a computer with a standard size battery
there is nothing i do n't love about this bag i wanted a slim , protective laptop sleeve/bag with handles as well as a shoulder strap , and this bag 's smart , minimal design is just right the shoulder strap is widely adjustable , comfortable to carry , and very easily detachable this slim bag could also slip into a suitcase or backpack for travel the two roomy side pockets provide ample room for my power cord/charger , a few other accessories , plus a book or magazine without making the bag look bulgy or distorted all of the zippers are secure and unobtrusive , and are slightly tucked down beside the handle flaps where they wo n't get snagged or come open by accident my # . # `` laptop fits securely inside the main compartment without being too tight , and the slightly shaped corners seem like they would protect nicely against bumps oh , and the color is great too it 's classy enough to fit in at work , but is so much prettier than boring black . * bonus * if it gets dirty , you can just toss it in the washing machine great bag , and an absolute steal at this price
the case is nice and fits my # . # laptop nicely i question , however , the leather used in the construction in the description , it states , `` leather `` ' , it looks like `` vinyl `` or a high grade `` plastic . `` model <unk> #
owned this case for # years , dozens of flights , one cross-country drive and <unk> abuse while completely overstuffed only replacing because i need more capacity -lrb- carry enough cables and accessories for three normal people -rrb- - looks great , takes abuse - dedicated laptop compartment with good protection - useful ` file ' compartment on back of case behind laptop compartment - use for tablet and external laptop monitor - magnetic clasps for front <unk> - not enough storage for me -lrb- but i carry ~ # cables and multiple power bricks - if you fill the front compartments to the bursting point , the leather will <unk> over time : - -rrb- professional appearance , durable leather and a well-protected dedicated laptop compartment if you do n't carry tons of cables or want to maximize cargo space for an airline carry-on , this is a winner
i have had trouble finding laptop bags that will hold together with the abuse of travelling that i have given them also , since i have a walking <unk> , i tend to drop the bag with the computer inside this bag has reasonable support and is oversized such that the computer is protected by the <unk> of the bag and the strength of the leather i wanted a slim bag that will not expand into a small suitcase it fulfills that charge very nicely it has ample room for the laptop , charger , trackball , portable hotspot , files , and the like without becoming huge the magnetic latches on the outside pocket for files , papers , or magazines was a nice touch
i use this targus netbook case for my acer aspire one # . # ' netbook and i have had no problems the case is roomy enough for the netbook and a few accessories note that the pocket is not the full width of the case so while i keep my mouse and other small accessories in it i keep the power cord and adapter separate
i take long trips on my <unk> and love this slipcase for carrying my netbook with me on travel it is well constructed and fit all <unk> accessories in the side pocket such as power brick and travel mouse the cover provide a little added protection while traveling
purchased for an hp dm # z # . # laptop fits easily with a little room front zip pocket hold mouse easily front will hold charger and cord with a little effort i wanted sleeve to prevent scuffs to laptop and carry mouse ; for that it is perfect
looks good and fits the acer # very nicely you can even tuck the power cords for the acer in the zippered pocket if you do n't mind a little <unk> do n't recall any funny neoprene smells with it i use this when i want to throw my acer # in a backpack , and it keeps it protected i also bought a targus citygear atlanta messenger which is a perfect fit for carrying the # , charge cables , portable usb drive , etc . . that is my main bag , and it also looks great
i bought this sleeve for the dell d # it fits perfectly it is thick enough to protect the hardware there is a layer of protection underneath the zipper too , so that the zipper does n't scratch inside i bought the black with black color combination it looks good , even if you look at details like stitching etc .
i needed a simple , quality case for my asus vivobook # . # and this slip case is the perfect size the accessory pocket allows a place for the power adapter , so you have everything together the stitching and quality of material are excellent the zippers open and close more smoothly than my roocase covers - very nice i find this netbook case perfect for air travel ; it protects my computer , is well made , does n't add bulk , and fits my asus vivobook perfectly
i was very excited to receive this case because i love the unique design however , it does not properly fit the # -inch macbook pro as promised , so i had to return it the case was too roomy for my macbook pro , and i did not feel like it would provide adequate protection for the computer because there was so much space for it to move around inside the case also , while the case is very padded on the front and back sides , the edges of the sleeve provide almost no padding , leaving the sides of your laptop vulnerable to impact but , this may also be due to the fact that the case did not provide a snug fit for my computer bottom line : it 's a really cool case , but it does n't fit my laptop if you buy this , and find that it fits your computer , great
this is the best fitting sleeve or case i have found so far for the lenovo t # s protection at the top and bottom are good going through tsa screens without having to remove will be nice but without a <unk> like the zeroshock models , there is virtually no <unk> impact protection
i bought this for my ipad even though its for a netbook its a bit big for a bare ipad but with a silicone cover it works good without it flopping around in the case the clear side with air bubbles is good protection against direct impact and i put the screen facing the bubbles the other side is neoprene and not as cushioned as i would have prefered the zipper opens easily
you do not have to remove your laptop from this case when you go through tsa further , your laptop will remain perfectly safe throughout the traditional bumps and jostling of consistent travel
i ordered this case because i like how it is clear i just got it today -lrb- on the day it was expected to arrive . . <unk> ! -rrb- and it 's awesome it perfectly fits my # inch hp # mini netbook there is about an inch of space towards the top so it even fits my extra battery if need be it also seems very durable and safe overall , very happy with this purchase
this is the exact laptop sleeve that i seen on the internet nd direct from the maker this is the best price out there delivery was very fast it is exactly as pictured i love it very well made and no defects at all
they 're well padded for maximum protection , yet fit like a glove , allowing your laptop to take up a minimum of space inexpensive too , as i have priced many laptop covers lately , including those that afford style without proper protection altego laptop sleeves are hard to find , but but well worth the effort the first one i owned had problems with both zippers , which eventually broke , perhaps because the fit is so perfect , maybe a bit too tight be careful placing your laptop in the sleeve , and make sure you pull the zippers in a smooth fashion , not <unk> them at all i bought two this time , just in case i have a problem down the line it 's a minor complaint considering the neat , clean look and space saving feature
bought both my boys the swiss gear backpacks very sturdy backpack , they are on their # nd year of use with nothing broken off , and not wearing through on the bottom only negative is that they are limited in space , it seems now a days kids have so much stuff these backpacks are crammed full , but they hold up very well got them on sale and would buy again and <unk> them
i have bought this bag for daily use while commuting in metro to and fro to work carrying my # `` laptop even though this bag is not exactly made for laptop with those extra safe guards , you can still use it to carry one this bag is for those who do n't need the heavy duty swissgear bags with lot more pockets and an added weight
yes , i used it as my purse coz i 've never known if i 'll be buying stuffs to carry or not sturdy , great fabric that does n't dirty easily , pretty easy to clean , the colors do n't fade out much
not waterproof , nor water resistant i 've had this comfortable love for # years of school and # + of travel it 's been my gym bag , laptop <unk> , grocery <unk> and motorcycle pack i lived out of it for # straight months of travel and a <unk> # more i run it , alone , through the washing machine maybe once a month , air dry i 'm pretty rough with the little guy and he has n't so much as ripped , stained or snagged in his years of service i love love love pockets , and while this does n't have a bunch , i guess it has enough to keep me satisfied yet force me to organize in other ways i 've loved this backpack however , i 'm <unk> up and out for a waterproof pack with a <unk> <unk> profile
he is # , and the size is just a little too big -lrb- which is a good thing -rrb- - room to grow into without being cumbersome now he uses it for school , and it is a good size for his needs this pack would be slightly too small for my needs like all swissgear products i have used , the quality stands above the rest of the pack
to be honest i have still not been able to use the pacsafe as the loop does not fit at all through the eyelet i have hurt my fingers trying to bend & squeeze it through with no luck it is impossible & i would like a refund if i ca n't get it through using <unk> to squeeze the wire
found this pretty useful when i traveled through europe in some low priced hotels bag fitted my computer and other valuables only drawback is that it is somewhat heavy and not very collapsible when not being used but , did the trick for me
look - this is probably not going to stop a thief with wire cutters however , it would likely keep pesky <unk> from looking through your valuables when you leave them in a hotel room also , it makes it difficult for & # # ; <unk> and grab & # # ; thieves at the beach , park , etc . i 've used this often in hotel rooms i loop it to a permanent fixture such as a sink , heavy bed post , etc . it 's lightweight , easy to transport , and doesnt take up much space i can easily fit a laptop in there , a watch , documents , and camera makes me feel much better when i have to leave valuables in my hotel room i would imagine that if you could loop this to a <unk> stand or other fixture at a beach or park , you wo n't have to worry about someone <unk> your stuff when you 're not looking
whenever i 'm travelling to tropical <unk> and want to spend time at the <unk> , my mind is put at ease with the pacsafe travelsafe i can put my valuables inside , wrap it around a tree or a couple beach chairs , throw a towel over it and i feel comfortable that it will keep my valuables safe can a pair of cutters cut through it will it stop <unk> of opportunity yes , i feel that it will
took it to the beach and pool on vacation and attached it to pool chairs while we swam plenty of space , i put my ipad , # iphones , large camera , wallet , and there was still plenty of room for more
we recently ordered this pacsafe luggage travelsafe as we travel to mexico and <unk> and we read in various reviews how safes in the rooms had items stolen from them so we thought we would give this a try we have used it in # different <unk> and found that no one attempted to try to get into it it 's a great product and we believe that it really does deter theft it holds quite a bit and we have attached it to <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , etc . and it is easy to lock and unlock we would highly recommend this product for anyone traveling
the travelsafe worked very well-made me feel secure about leaving valuable objects in my hotel room probably should have read the instructions more carefully as to how to securely shut the drawstring but quickly got the hang of it it was a little difficult to secure but figured out a way to close it quickly and easily i loved how it could store both my kindle and my macair plus any other valuables i brought also it packed flat going out upon returning i put some small items i bought in the travelsafe and used it as a container to keep small objects from shifting in my bag i would definitely recommend this to everyone who has to travel with valuable objects !
this worked great for my daughter while she was on a mission trip in the <unk> republic it kept her laptop safe while she was gone during the day doing mission work
i had my <unk> stolen after checking my baggage a couple trips ago i found this referred to on the tsa site and decided to try it not inexpensive , but if i could secure my meds in checked baggage my traveling life would be easier it works great ... just zipped open luggage liner a little and locked it to the suitcase frame also took a picture in case the whole suitcase disappeared ... and put a note to any luggage handlers to that effect inside the case nothing has disappeared since will buy another for the other suitcase one of these days ... for things not easily replaced
i have been taking this with me when i travel for the last several months it works great it 's lightweight and built strong given enough equipment and time , it is possible to break into this , but for your everyday thief , it will prevent them from stealing your valuables
we bought this for a recent trip to the caribbean we had heard stories of <unk> safes being opened by <unk> employees and did n't want to chance anything it is much bigger than we thought we were able to fit two ipads , a kindle , two wallets , car keys , two iphones , an ipod touch and still had plenty of room for more we secured the chain around a bed post and hid it behind the <unk> out of sight when we left the room it came with # keys which we split up amongst us so we 'd have <unk> in case one was lost the product rolls up easily and is secured with a large rubber band which makes it easy for packing in a suitcase i would recommend this product for peace of mind
