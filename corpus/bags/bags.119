i bought this because i outgrew my smaller pack i have one camera body in this and # lens with lots of room left for filters and accessories this is very comfortable to wear on hikes to get that picture i just ca n't live without i am not too crazy about the tri-pod holder ... it straps to the bottom of the pack i think it would be better to have it <unk> vs horizontal it might work better for smaller tripods but mine is pretty stout all in all i do like it and can live with the tripod holder
thanks to the great pictures that were provided for this product we got exactly what we wanted from this camera backpack the item was shipped promptly and the order was accurate the backpack offers an adequate amount of space for equipment and seems to be pretty sturdy so far
i 'd been shopping for a new <unk> bag , and found one at a local retailer the price was about $ # , so i searched the internet for bags , and i purchased this one through amazon this bag is about twice the size of the one at the local retailer , and was about half the price i love the adjustable storage compartments in the main body , as well as the other pouches and pockets if i could make one improvement on the design , i would add more straps to secure items in the main compartment when i 'm on the go , i do n't always have time to lay the bag flat to retrieve items , and i need to take care that items do n't fall out as a very novice photographer , this bag suits my needs perfectly
the product is well made and sturdy it fits all of my current camera stuff the good feature is the flexibility to fit larger lenses ... would need that for the next lens i am planning to purchase
i have used this backpack for about # months now and it has been awesome plenty of storage , adjustable compartments , and feels secure when carrying it through the woods i 'm so very glad i chose this backpack
this bag has just the right amount of room for all of my gear and a few odds and ends i usually carry three lenses -lrb- including my big # mm which has an # mm <unk> -rrb- , the camera body and a flash in the main compartment there 's still <unk> for another lens i would n't carry anything longer than a # mm in here though as you would use up too much space it could stand a bit more padding on the sides and bottom however if your careful with your gear it wo n't matter much it has a chest and waist strap which help balance the load on those long hikes the compartments are velcro lined so you can adjust them as you see fit so in closing this bag is well worth the money and very useful
excellent product , protects the camera and lenses very well , you can <unk> of the spaces how ever you want , thick walls , and very good materials , lots of bags for other stuff you can carry
the back pack is a great way for my husband to carry all of his camera parts with him on trips hands are free for luggage , etc . organized compartments for all the things he takes & nice cushioning & construction
this bag is a lifesaver , it holds all your stuff and even extra stuff you might think you need it does get heavy but that 's because i have it so loaded down it is very good to have in your vehicle then transfer your stuff to a smaller unit when taking photos
this is an exceptional traveling backpack great for hiking and extended photo outings there is an amazing amount of storage space inside the pack i have my rebel xt with a # l <unk> , in addition to a wide angle , stock # , and # mm prime for starters then , i also have all kinds of filters , cleaning supplies , batteries , gps , cables , memory cards , etc stored <unk> the pack in the many zippered and velcroed pockets and compartments there are straps on the bottom for holding your tripod , and a <unk> holding bay on the back perfect for stuffing your jacket into a great <unk> highly recommend this backpack to anyone wanting more versatility and better <unk> for long sessions with their camera
this is such an awesome idea <unk> up our hands so we could take great pictures was easy to carry on the plane we do n't have a lot of equipement yet so it gave us plenty of room to carry other things like sunglasses keys and snacks really glad we purchased this
i bought this backpack in # and it has been thrown around and put into all sorts of situations i 've taken it on a number of hikes and road trips and it still looks and performs as good as the day i bought it this is definitely a quality product that is durable and will last a long time
this is the most satisfactory camera bag i have owned , and i 've been through quite a few that were much more expensive the bag is well padded to keep contents safe , and all components are easy to access
the bag i 've always wanted it 's perfect to travel with you camera full of accessories , i even fit my laptop in there , a little bit <unk> but it fits well
i love this backpack it 's perfect for all of my camera accessories it 's not too big or too small and has a whole bunch of pockets for all my filters and other extras including my binoculars it also has straps to hold my tripod so i do n't have to lug it around while i 'm walking which is great the best part is that it does n't cost # $ like most of the others do i 'd reccommend this to anyone who enjoys outdoor photography
the bag seems to be well made and it has lots of pockets and compartments the dividers in the main compartment are easily moved to accommodate different sized lenses and accessories there is even a compartment that fits my netbook computer
i bought this for my wife for christmas at a fraction of the cost of a direct online store or god forbid a retail mall store the separators are velcro movable -lrb- the good velcro -rrb- and there is plenty of room for the hobbyist might not be enough if you are big time , but more than enough for us plenty of extra pockets and flaps for everything it is a great product that i highly recommend
this is the best camera backpack or bag i have seen the materials and built quality are outstanding i had never seen zippers so smooth as the one contained in this backpack i can fit a digital canon slr , # large lenses , a sony <unk> <unk> , a canon flash , and all sorts of cables , batteries , memory cards , etc . easily in this backpack it is very comfortable to wear in the shoulders the nylon material is very resistant
i 've had this bag for a couple years and i really like it it 's roomy , durable , and is easy to take along with you i 've <unk> all over yosemite and salmon creek falls with this bag and it 's protected my equipment well . and yes , it 's been dropped a few times cameras for kids : fun and inexpensive projects for the little photographer -lrb- volume # <unk> photography using examples from the california central coast : a visual guide to the central coast and digital <unk> <unk> with the digital photography of john <unk> : learning photography with
i have all my equipment in it that i use on a daily basis plus i also have my portable video camcorder in it my wife 's point and shoot nikon camera , and both of my daughter 's point and shoot camera which one of them is an <unk> camera
this bag is exactly what i was looking for i am not a professional photographer but can appreciate the design and comfort of this bag it can hold my # d , s # is , one extra lens , filters , a tripod , a small jacket , bottles of water etc . the list continues and this bag can carry all of them ! amazing to see such a useful tool for such an affordable price
one of my most satisfying purchase make sure u do n't load it with very heavy lenses or body , a rebel with a few basic lenses is good enough anything heavier and you are in trouble
i bought this because my original lowepro was stolen and i was short on funds , so i went with the canon it is a great bag i have been dragging it through desert country in new mexico and have no complaints padding is adequate and roomy enough for two bodies and several lenses i noticed it is a bit narrow when i placed my canon # l in it , but of course it is soft and padded , so there is no problem zipping it up bottom line : you ca n't go wrong with this item
for <unk> something bucks you get a high quality backpack specially thought for photographers the backpack is rich with small details meant to make you 're life easier and to protect the content you put in it i think it 's just a great product , at a great prize
i <unk> this thing around dc last week for # hours , and not a worry to mention well balanced , i had it full of a camera , # lenses , flash and miscellany i cut all the extra straps off , and just have the shoulder harness left and it looks good too of course , it 's a great advertisement for thieves so never let it out of your grip
i like the lens storage this bag offers you can adjust lens storage compartments to accommodate different sized lenses there is also a loop on the outside to hold your tripod this bag is a bargain for the price and storage it offers since bags this size and quality are more expensive this is a great quality camera bag and i would recommend it to anyone
this bag is an excellent value , especially for the price it is very well made of durable material , and the zippers also seem -lrb- so far -rrb- to be able to <unk> to the constant <unk> it has plenty of pockets and compartments for your lenses , miscellaneous gear , manuals and it even holds your tripod on the bottom of the backpack the only disappointment to me , is the compartment for notebook storage is not large enough to hold my # `` macbook pro bummer , but ... it 's not that big of a deal
adjustable spaces inside the pack hold all your camera stuff and it 's easy to tote around great if you have any notion of expanding your lens count someday or just want to pack other things for the day
i am very pleased with this purchase al my stuff fits inside and the price is very good compared to similar products quality of materials is also good i am very happy
i bought this bag for my canon eos rebel xt and the lense and other equipment i have my husband and i like to travel the us and we go on # day trips to bigger cities like washington dc , la etc . the bag has been perfect for this purpose it is made in a way that you do n't really feel it anymore after a minute of wearing it it has enough space to carry all my stuff and you can fit you water and whatever you need to travel in it as well the quality is good and i have a good feeling when i travel on the plane that it keeps all my equipment safe the only thing i can recommend in addition is <unk> a smaller case that you can fit your camera in , if you do not need to carry all your stuff i have one of these and it fits in the bag , too
this product is great for hiking or just going around town it 's not huge but it 's big enough to hold my # f # l , # , flash , # d body , # f # l other accesories with a ton of room to spare i feel <unk> enough to get low or lay down to get my shot without the bag flopping around interior design could n't be better , fully customizable velcro <unk> are great , unlike some backpacks that are only customizable by an inch or two great build quality i would pay well over $ # for this , it 's a steal at $ #
asin : `` # - # this backpack is fantastic my daughter is # ' # and # lbs and it is not to big or bulky for her to carry to school her camera and accessories fit in great lots of room and the equipment is well protected i recommend this product to all
i 've struggled in the past with comfortably -lrb- or uncomfortably more often than not -rrb- toting around my camera gear to the national parks i love visiting so much , but this backpack has made all the difference i can fit all the camera gear i need with room to spare for the water and food i need to bring with me on my hikes ca n't wait to take it on my next overseas trip
this bag is <unk> great it holds all of my equipment plus any extras i may need to bring along on trips i recommend this bag to anyone that needs to safely transport their camera equipment
good options for the price it can accommodate the following with ease canon s # is , <unk> # , <unk> <unk> # pro , <unk> <unk> # pro , one . # x olympus lens and couple of rings and filters . this still has some space left i personally like the canon <unk> on the bag . worth it for the price . it still has space for manuals , cleaning kits and any other carry-ons highly
this bag was more than i anticipated it is large , with many compartments , light weight and has straps to hold your tripod i like the neutral colors and the delivery was quick . . but best of all was the terrific price , just under $ # . #
the backpack style is perfect for hiking around - it does n't slip off the shoulder , etc . it is still easy to get your camera out quickly i can fit my camera and video camera in it no problem plus all of my wires , etc . i priced anything like it at as many stores as i could and this beats the price by half often and it is better built than the rest way to go canon
i was n't too keen on the green color -- i was actually looking for a gray/black color combination however , when i received it , i stuck a velcro piece on the & # # ; canon & # # ; logo and put a u.s. flag on it looked great and very military -lrb- i 'm retired <unk> -rrb- the inside is excellent -- i recommended it to my cousin who just got the same camera -lrb- canon t # i -rrb- it has a lot of room and pockets for the few accessories that i have , this pack is perfectly functional for me
i bought this backpack to take to disney world with me not only did it hold my camera and all the lenses , but it also held my personal items it was lightweight and comfortable , and i would recommend it to anyone
this bag fits your dslr and much more and is reasonably comfortable and convenient removing the camera from the bag is simple and safe with how the zipper curves at the top to try and make sure the bag does n't open and dump everything else out the buckles to hold around waist and chest are useful the front <unk> pouch is useful for <unk> stuff like a water bottle for recreational use without a ton of lenses and accessories i ca n't imagine spending any more on another bag and noticing much of a difference i 'm a weekend warrior so my experience may not <unk> to someone who needs to use it every single day
bought this pack and used it for my trip to <unk> several weeks ago , it worked great carried tons of equipment and it was my personal item on the flight only minor issue is the pack rides high up your back but its not a backpack per se overall an excellent photo pack with lots of room and extra pockets , etc ! !
has a ridiculous amount of storage for a really fair price i 've seen a ton of pro photographers use this case , and now i see why give you easy access to your camera , with the option to carry flash , a stand and up to # lenses
this photo bag has plenty of room for my setup -lrb- # lenses , a big flash , the camera body , accessories , memory batteries etc . . . -rrb- and seems to protect it well the bag is water and dust resistant and the zipper seals do n't get in the way too much i do n't have any real complaints , but do n't expect it to hold your camping gear and photo equipment it is what i 'd consider a medium sized bag
this is a really good backpack and my opinion better that most other famous brands that would cost # or # times as much i owned this case for about # years now and i really gave it a beating during this time , yet it is still in a perfect conditions the backpack include many side and front pockets and compartments that would easily accommodates many accessories the main compartment is currently holding a canon # d with a # l mounted , a # l , a # as well as a # ex and it still has some room for more i love it
this bag holds my digital rebel xt <unk> lens , sigma # , and a <unk> # , sigma ef # <unk> super , filters , cleaning supplies , and tripod it 's well padded and well made , i heard a complaint about the construction of the straps and was concerned until it arrived the straps do not come close to my camping backpack , but i do n't <unk> carrying # lbs in this canon bag either this is a steal at this price i looked at <unk> for any similar bags and found that $ # would have gotten me something similar
this is an awesome bag i have a lowepro that i paid $ # for when i bought my camera , and i will be selling it , as i do n't need it now this bag is bigger , better made , and has more features i 'm loving it
i do n't have a cannon camera i have the sony alpha # but this bag fits my camera perfectly with all the lenses and filters i 've seen this same bag at best buy for $ # . # maybe i should have bought two
as a <unk> professional photographer , i needed something to support my mobile adventures that would carry the bulk of my gear ; you do n't ever need all of your gear at one time this backpack is designed fantastically , and that 's coming from a engineering and design background for over # years until i went into business for myself last year as a <unk> i love the bag , you will too it 's one of those products that you get more mileage out of then you think you would or could i love the hands free thing also , and the comfy feeling when it 's hooked over my shoulders
ok - so i 've only had my canon rebel xt and the backpack for a short while , but so far they are great with the limited number of lenses and equipment that i have , i have lots of extra room for <unk> items without having to carry multiple bags i like that i can have both hands free while carrying the backpack comfortably i can see that for people with many , many lenses , it might not meet your needs , but for me it 's great i can fit my digital video camera , my point and shoot digital , and my rebel xt and its lenses all comfortably inside this pack i like the extra pocket for a sketchbook and/or thin notebook i plan to make a few <unk> and add some extra velcro straps inside the inner compartments to make the inner pockets a little more secure i may also try to <unk> the `` canon `` logo on the outside i do n't really want to advertise the fact that i have camera equipment inside the backpack i received my order quickly , and the price was much cheaper than the local best buy -lrb- no <unk> to best buy ... sometimes they have good prices :
this backpack has it all it can hold so much equipment as well as lots of other things in the numerous pockets the dividers inside can be moved around to best suite the equipment you 're carrying cons : no good spot to strap on a tripod
this provides you enough room to have two bodies and multiple lenses budget dslr pro bag good for people using it in normal and travel <unk> it is not tough bag so plan according to your usage
i was looking for a good camera backpack and this worked out well it has several adjustable compartments inside the main area , is well padded can hold quite a bit side velcro pockets are good for smaller items too
i finally understand how comfort and photography blend in perfect <unk> it should have more protection on the area where the camera lies but overall , it 's a great bag it has a lot of compartments and <unk> # lenses or flash , three lenses and # bodies -lrb- one with lens -rrb- you can <unk> the <unk> i 've read that tall persons have problems on their shoulders with this bag not for me -lrb- # ' # `` -rrb- everything else is $ # and up -lrb- <unk> , tamrac , etc . -rrb- so my advice is : buy it you will not regret it
i love all the compartments and space it holds two of my dslr 's with lens and even has room for my flip video camera 's and additional lenses not to mention the price was excellent i got it for $ # from amazon
i have traveled throughout alaska and washington state with my cameras and <unk> safely stowed in this backpack it is well designed with <unk> compartments and zippered pouches there are also side straps for your tripod i could find nothing anywhere that compared at twice the price
this backpack bag holds everything for me i had read other reviews about the build and size but for me it 's perfect i do n't have any problem with quality of the build nor the size i feel it 's any excellent product for the price it holds my canon # d with # mm is usm lens with hood with room to spare i also carry # mm is usm , # is usm , kit lens , and a # ex speedlite it has outside pockets perfect for filters and <unk> inside for memory cards and a lot more i think it 's a great buy
it is not a <unk> <unk> but for the price i paid -lrb- under $ # -rrb- there is not a better bag in the market even compared to bags with twice that price tag , it is a better bag it holds a lot of stuff , more than i anticipated , and it feels comfortable if it gives me # years of use i 'll buy another one and will still be ahead of the game i would definitely recommend it
this canon camera bag it arrived so quickly it surprised me the last bag i was using was an <unk> and now i can go places and feel like i am taken seriously all of my gear is easily accessible as well as very well protected this bad can hold all of my gear and more that i might need on any given occasion i am completely and <unk> thrilled with this bag and so proud to be seen with it as a photographer the quality of this bag is heavy duty and as well as allows the extra room and adjustable pockets on the inside for all my different lenses and equipment this was a very smart buy ! thank you so very much canon cameras us ! you have one very satisfied customer !
i bought a new camera but was n't at all impressed with the bag it came with , so i purchased this one this is every bit as high quality as the more expensive brand bags at half the price i 'm very happy with this purchase
this is a great bag and works well for a full frame body and several lenses plus some accessories iv ' e been using this bag for several years and it made it to several mountain trips it 's durable and the inside is adjustable so you can tailor is to have your lenses and accessories secure i 've recently got another traveling bag but i use this bag still when i do n't take all of my equipment and specially when going on hikes
this backpack has plenty of room for two cameras and lenses i am able to put my <unk> + lenses and my video camera plenty of pockets and moveable padding - makes it very flexible
i was looking for a bag that was easy to carry around and have easy access to lenses and other equipment this bag fits the bill and provides additional pokets for notebooks , water bottle and other extras this bag might be a bit small for two camera bodies with multiple lenses for each
i love my camera backpack it holds everything nicely the only problem i have had is the zipper grips have come off and i have had to replace some of them now all i need is more lenses to fill the slots
a compartment to hold a laptop holds my camera , # lenses , flash & misc items i had a small bag that came with my canon t # i and quickly out grown it this bag is a must have and worth the price
price vs quality what can you expect you can put a lot of lens compare to over $ # bags less quality but works great only concern is the zipper quality ... little poor & light zip
i ordered one of these bags it has a lot of pockets and wraps on it so that you can put all your camera equipment you can attach your tripod on it with the straps also , there are many splitter pieces with which you can create your own holders i recommend this product for amateur photographers
well the bag i got with my rebel kit was absolute crap , so i decided to go with the official canon bag it 's very sturdy , has a ton of room , and great color scheme a must have if you 're on the go with your dslr
this bag has all the space for my needs . i have a canon # d with # f # l , # # . # tamron , # mm # . # canon , and a # canon which all of those lenses fit with ease and still have room for a flash
love it but please keep the zipper on the bottom of the back pack because the so slowly open if you have the meeting on the top . . just use common sense thats
this photo backpack has all the features of the higher priced brands plus more the inside compartments are totally adjustable to your equipment and can easily hold a couple of camera bodies and two or three lenses there are two inside zippered compartments which are perfect for lens caps , memory cards , lens cleaning supplies , etc . there is a larger outside zippered compartment for larger photo equipment or manuals this compartment also has a place to hold pencils or pens , and other miscellaneous photo supplies you need to take with you on photo excursions there is an outside zippered compartment as well as an adjustable <unk> pocket where you can place a book or jacket or other needed items , in addition to a velcroed pocket on each side you can even carry a tripod with the bottom straps , to complete your photo equipment requirements for perfect images the construction and materials of the backpack are quality rated and straps are totally adjustable to fit your body for comfort i would recommend this photo backpack to anyone - and it is priced right
we needed a bag for our cannon # d but with our previous bag we were forced to remove the lens everytime we put it up ! the cannon backpack allows you to be able to simply unzip , grab camera , and take your pic at first i thought the bag could have had better , thicker padding but the bag does it 's job we bought this for vacation and have been happy
this has been a great bag for me it wears well and i love all the compartments i have a nikon camera but had to have this bag even though it has a cannon name tag on
bought this bag from bestbuy it was $ # found it on here for $ # same returned the one from best buy . great bag theres a lot of room i have two cameras and # len 's and all the
i bought this pack to hold my digital slr and a couple lenses and accessories i take it everywhere with me , hiking , biking , to the <unk> , to the beach , etc . it has held up nicely the inside is very well padded and protects my camera equipment the flap over the zipper keeps out dust and rain i have hauled it with me on some extremely dusty adventures and i have yet to get dust into the camera compartment the pack is lightweight and comfortable to wear i 'd recommend this to any photographer who has to haul along multiple lenses
i was looking for a backpack to carry my canon slr because i dont like side pouches or things that hang on my waste but a backpack is functional to carry items for people who like to have their gear at their fingertips then a waist pouch is better i do n't mind having to take the back off to change lens also if i need to <unk> a filter or etc , then the side pockets are with in my reach and i can pull out and place the <unk> lens over <unk> lens there are rip away velcro compartments where you can adjust to the specifications of your equipment i can store more than enough stuff in the backpack for a day of shooting my only complaints are the straps are thick and not as soft as i would like and at times can rub my shoulders i could remedy that by padding it but i 'm to lazy to because it does n't bother me too much
i had previously purchased a $ # ` normal ' pack for all my equipment and later found this needless to say , i returned the pack and bought this i couldnt be more pleased such an amazing pack , spaces for everything , and the main compartment is totally customizable with velcro partitions also includes the tripod strap which is a great plus great for the cost
this backpack is quite inexpensive but provided an efficient means for me to carry an eos digital , # lens , filters , rain gear , jacket , etc . there is plenty of padding for the lens
searched around for a back pack style camera case and found many that were pretty good until i looked at the price thought that it was a combo that included a new camera <unk> this pack and saw over # reviews which were nearly all positive and the price was fantastic figured that so many people could n't be wrong and guess what they were n't i ordered the pack from electronics <unk> and <unk> waited for my delivery that came a week earlier that expected the pack was everything i expected and more i made a great decision and all of the previous reviewers were spot on
the back pack looks good , works great for my camera gear and has enough compartments to carry lots of different size equipment only suggestion is don & # # ; t over load it becomes heavy i would recommend this back pack
i purchased this just prior to a trip to europe in may and boy was i glad to have it i followed other 's advice about not zipping to the top , so i had no problems with the zippers opening , although , i 'm not sure i would have , they are very sturdy zippers i was most impressed by the capacity and loaded weight it is very well balanced i carried my canon , with two lenses , plus my sony video camera , all the extras -lrb- batteries and chargers , etc -rrb- i had it quite loaded , but it was easy to carry highly recommend this backpack
even though i have a nikon camera this canon bag is perfect i can actually fit my camera and all my other equipment in there plenty of cushions that i can adjust for what ever i need to carry , including my wallet i wanted a backpack type bag for ease of use , on my shoulders and my back . :
very good bag and the price was very reasonable as well i put my canon eos rebel xs camera , two lenses , filters , cables and charger in there and still have plenty of room for future purchases
i use this for wedding photography so it takes a beating it fits a lot of stuff in it too i have two camera bodies several lenses , hoods , batteries , cards etc . the dividers are heavy duty and movable so you can customize your bag to fit your equipment has protected my equipment from a lot of stuff
i purchased this camera backpack knowing it provided more storage than we needed for our simple digital slr camera when we travel , we have plenty of room to store our camera in the waterproof inside and a few diapers , etc for our <unk> this way , we only carry one bag and do n't need to take the diaper bag along on hikes or short trips
i travel <unk> with my camera equipment and was looking for a roomy , well arranged , camera backpack this was the one lots of room and easy transport through airport security extra room for personal items
this is not a professional bag , but it works well for this hobbyist it carries three lenses , my canon eos rebel body , extra lense hoods , cleaning gear , <unk> manuals , etc , without a problem this thing is very nice for the price i paid -lrb- $ # . #
i bought this bag to replace a small shoulder canon bag i previously had i am a <unk> photographer and when doing weddings i needed something that could hold all of my gear -lrb- several lenses , tripod , flash , hoods , etc . . . i chose this so that it would be easier to carry a backpack vs shoulder strap the bag is very padded all around so that your back is very well protected weight is evenly distributed the first day i used it , it was pouring rain and all of my equipment stayed dry interior is protective and compartments are <unk> this bag for the low price is just unbeatable get one and you will not be disappointed
this case will not hold a dell e # inch wide screen if you try you can get it in , but the velcro flap wo n't cover , and it really <unk> the bag . get the targus # inch
i bought this based largely on the mention in time magazine my wife got a contour by kensington overall the contour seemed to be much more sturdy with more space and a far more comfortable padding system on the back i sent mine back and got my own contour and i would recommend you do the same
the backpack functionality is very nice , but the laptop part is not , especially if you have a # `` laptop this pack was used to carry a # `` hp laptop and the sleeve tore during just a couple uses this bag might have lasted if it was used on a # `` laptop i will not purchase another like this
i bought this bag to carry my laptop to and fro from office and since it provides an extra large pocket , it lets me carry a few other items as well the shoulder straps have nice cushion built into them the bag serves these main goals however , it is pretty <unk> i use nyc subway to get to office and you can not easily keep this bag in your lap the bottle holder has been provided too much to the side and hence if you bend a little to the side , the bottle will fall off in addition , the bottle holder does not have any straps -lrb- and the built in elastic was pretty bad -rrb- and thus you can keep only one size of bottles in it the bag is also pretty heavy and hence after the laptop and adapter and few other small items , it is a pain to carry it around i would recommend this product for an occasional use and not for a daily use
it fits my # `` notebook , that 's good it seems a little small at first in that you have to really work to get it back out of the bag , but it gets better i was a little disappointed with the actual space in the bag though ca n't really fit more than # textbooks in with the laptop
i bought this for my husband for christmas it is exactly what he wanted and much less expensive that what he had seen in stores the bag makes carrying the notebook seem much lighter it has room for plenty of stuff without being bulky or geeky
i ordered this backpack so i could easily carry around my new # `` dell inspiron # - it fits fine , and the backpack is comfy and roomy not many useful external pockets `` cell phone `` pocket is just another zippered pocket , nothing special reflective lining strips are starting to crack and peel off -lrb- after # months use -rrb- it fits my stuff though -lrb- i always have an ac power cord , mouse , headphones , mousepad , folders , notebooks , etc -rrb- only the bottom is waterproof , some rain did get inside the top of my backpack but no real damage was done it does the job
a very good purchase for the price with the laptop and other cords in it , it feels weightless when you put it on the <unk> are wonderful , and it is very comfortable i highly recommend this bag to anyone who needs to carry their laptop and prefers carrying a backpack than a shoulder bag
i purchased this bag after much <unk> and i am very happy with it i have a dell # . # `` screen , etc etc . . . it fits with enough room for all of my stuff i would recommend this bag to anyone . the straps are ultra comfortable too . wears nice and i have had no problems . great bag
purchased this as a gift for my daughter who walks to work with her notebook computer , etc . she loves it excellent back support and lots of pockets to carry stuff
this is one of the few cases that will accommodate my <unk> laptop this bag is very sturdy and well padded the case has ample room for laptop , cords , and accessories a special pocketed area is fantastic for ipod , digital camera , mouse , cell phone , and a handy clip for keys there is a convenient port for your ipod <unk> cord the bag fits nicely in the overhead compartment on the airplane , and even fit under the seat in front of me on a small commuter flight it 's roomy enough that i actually took it as my only bag for an overnight flight and was able to carry laptop , accessories , a change of clothes , and cosmetics the only improvement would be to have wheels because fully loaded , this can be quite a weight to tote
this bag does just what it was designed for , plus most people do n't realize i 'm carrying a laptop my laptop has been well protected through all types of weather and -lrb- i must admit -rrb- a few bumps and falls it is the right size to be used as carry on luggage for flights , i have had no problems so far on planes carrying the bag is a breeze for the design makes it very comfortable on your back very strong material has been used on this bag , i give all my bags a rough time and this one has stood up to all my abuse going on at least six months now the zippers are very good and have held up well to the overloading this bag takes i would recommend this bag to anyone
i just got this laptop bag and i love it i knew the company made quality bags because my boyfriend has another model and it 's well built i decided to go for this model because it can fit my # `` powerbook + my school books the pack is super comfortable on your back , it kind of molds itself to your back even with a lot of weight it 's still solid i think i will have it for a long time highly recommend this companies products .
