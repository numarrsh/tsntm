i needed something to protect my macbook pro during my trip to germany and the sleeves at the apple store just felt too thin and expensive i found this good deal on the incase neoprene sleeve and i am happy with my purchase it fits well and it was easy to get the laptop in and out quickly i had my laptop in my carry-on and a back pack during the trip and the sleeve did a good job protecting it i would recommend this product
this sleeve fits my # & # # ; macbook pro perfectly it 's not super tight but fits snug , but there is still enough room to add your plugs or a small case to hold your accessories
i do n't understand why anyone with a macbook pro would n't buy an incase neoprene sleeve to protect their computer -lrb- this one or <unk> one fits your laptop . i 've been caught with mine in the rain , i 've knocked it off my coffee table , and i 've spilled food on it through it all , my mac is safe
perfect for protecting my new macbook during travel the color is beautiful and perfectly matches the speck satin case in purple , as well for a reasonable price , i see no reason not to get this sleeve
fits over my macbook perfectly -lrb- even with a hard case on -rrb- , it is super soft inside but still seems to provide good protection esp . when i am carrying it around in my bag
this sleeve works well the only problem may be that it is a little loose , but when you put a case on the laptop it fits perfectly but otherwise it is a great investment and it is great to <unk> no scratches hope this helped
color and style were just what i was hoping they would be it has a nice faux fur lining on the inside i bought the kuzy rubberized case for my new macbook air and even with that case on the computer fits perfectly into the sleeve
i just got it today and was hesitant , but it 's worth more than the price # stars because my macbook pro # & # # ; fits nice and snug , soft interior , great material , and the color is just like the picture i would recommend it
a very sturdy case that protects my mac well - it molds to the environment around it , so to speak i also have a clear hard-shell cover for my mac and it still fits :
a great sleeve for a macbook pro -lrb- # & # # ; -rrb- or a macbook air -lrb- # & # # ; or # & # # ; -rrb- this definitely does not provide stiff protection against damage with computers , but the soft and fuzzy interior does provide a minor amount of protection against soft bumps and bangs inside a bang it wo n't protect a computer against getting broken if it is dropped
this bag is beautiful , but only if you are hauling around a kindle or ipad i have a l # `` x w # `` laptop and it does n't fit into the protected storage case inside this <unk> bag i 'll have to go with the horizontal model or a different brand
i was very disappointed in this bag it is beautiful and i really love the look , but that 's as far as it went i knew the bag was big when i ordered it , but beware , the <unk> is big because of its capability to detach the inside space is not very big all i carry is a # `` laptop , an ipad -lrb- v -rrb- a small spiral notebook and the associated cables it was a very tight fit unfortunately , i had to send it back
it was n't very expandable the handle did n't stay in the extended position when rolling it and i would have liked more outside pockets especially fir a water bottle the look was great and i hit many compliments in the appearance
the bag is beautiful and sturdy but within the first three weeks , the shoulder strap completely broke i was sent a new one but having to work with the case for a week and a half without the strap was inconvenient that being said i am always pleased with the ease of returns from amazon and the bag <unk> is very functional and seems quite durable hoping the strap issue was just a defective unit
excellent bag , fits down airplane aisle easily , wo n't fit under aisle seat , but will fit under middle seat getting lots of compliments on this bag and only had it two weeks it will hold everything i need , have plenty of room because the laptop is stored on the outside pocket however a little concerned that when the bag tips over the first thing to hit the ground is the laptop , but seems protected i would recommend this bag to every female that is tired of carrying a traditional black <unk> bag , this is a step up in style , very professional looking
i was really up in the air if my wife would like this bag or not i can tell you i made the right choice ! ! she loves this bag ! perfect size , very classy , and very well built it 's not bulky like other wheeled bags
read alot of the ratings prior to buying this computer bag i 've been wanting something different from the boring black ones that are out there only wished it came in a cream colored version also wished the handle locked in mid position i 'm short -lrb- # ' # -rrb- so it 's nice to have handles that adjust and stay at different heights
i carry a laptop and a usb monitor plus all my electrical cords , a wireless mouse , my <unk> and more love that it has the detachable rolling option since i do n't like to use the roller in the snow
this bag is everything a travel case should be it is light weight , versatile and very stylish i get numerous compliments on it the only small criticism i would give it , is that it does not have a small exterior pouch for incidentals -lrb- e.g . keys , boarding pass , etc -rrb- it has a couple of small pouches on the interior but they are accessed by opening zippers having said that , this would not have kept me from purchasing this bag it works great and looks even better !
i like this backpack because of its space inside it which is a lot you can put any laptop inside it and it will fits the only thing that i did n't like was that it is made with a bit poor materials but in relation to the price it is convenient
this bag was good for a year or two , but eventually the main zipper started tearing away -lrb- plus dangling threads could catch in the zipper -rrb- bag did n't get much abuse , so expected it to last longer
fits a # `` macbook pro without thinking twice plenty of padding my only complaint the right side of the chest strap snapped i think it 's <unk> , but if this is a dealbreaker , consider a different bag
i really liked this backpack , the only thing is that i thought it would be a bit smaller and turned out to be bigger than i imagined , in the images gives the impression of being more compact
i bought this backpack two years ago , and just now the zipper broke -lrb- an issue another reviewer ran into -rrb- despite this , i love the backpack and i 'm quite surprised that it lasted two years i use my backpack literally every day for work and school , and it held tons of textbooks and laptops with no ripping i 'll probably purchase this again if the zipper gets any worse
this is a great carrier for the laptop on trips you can cram a lot of extras into it take it on the plane and have some easy to reach necessities with you
i have tried many laptop bags but this one is the best and maybe i should by another one just in case i lose this : -rrb- comfortable to carry , has many pockets for many different things holds a lot of stuff the inside color is a nice red just great product that i use with my # inch laptop that has an oversized battery
i wanted a well built backpack that had pockets that would allow the backpack to be packed in such a way that the load was distributed vertically my previous backpack when loaded became cumbersome due to the load <unk> to the bottom making the pack unnecessarily thick and bottom heavy
i liked it very much it is so light that if you carry an empty bag , it feels like you do n't have anything even after placing my # `` inch laptop with the adapter , it was so comfortable
like i said , i 've owned this backpack for four years and the fabric and stitching looks brand new i hauled a # inch macbook pro and twenty pounds of books around in this thing while only using one strap for two and a half of those four years i admit that the buckle holding the lower strap to the upper did suffer irreparable damage about eight weeks into that <unk> stretch but i bought a rugged little carabiner and tied the straps to that i 've not had any issues since this is the perfect backpack for a college or even high school student or any other human being on the planet that needs a computer + books backpack
i bought this backpack for my toshiba satellite l # <unk> # # . # -inch laptop i paid $ # . # for it it fits the laptop perfect it has good padding in the laptop compartment it has enough room for all my accessories and a little more overall , a great buy
i do n't need to duplicate all the great things about this sleeve i will just say that for the amount of money i paid for it , it 's extremely disappointing that it did n't hold up there is one large hole in a corner and others <unk> i do n't take the computer with me on a daily basis , so it has n't had the kind of wear that might be expected am i <unk> to expect an item that costs this much and is not used intensively would last more than # / # years it 's just a nice neoprene sleeve , so if money is no object , go for it i got a new macbook , and i came here thinking i would buy a new tucano second skin , but was <unk> to see that it cost at least twice what it is worth
i 've been using this protective sleeve for my laptop for # months now , and i really like it it fits my # `` macbook pro perfectly , even with the colored plastic shell on it i love the protective edge cover that keeps me from scratching the laptop with the zipper the laptop slips in and out very easily and is well protected for putting it in a bag etc . i could do without the large letters labeling on the sleeve , but it 's not that bad overall nice product at a nice price
the tucano second skin microfiber sleeve works great i have a # . # `` macbook pro and it fits like a glove the inside is nice and soft and protects the laptop from scratches there is a flap that covers the laptop so that the zipper does not scratch the finish the outside of the sleeve is a nice soft microfiber it is soft to the touch and will protect the laptop from minor bangs definitely great protection for my laptop plus , it helps keep the dust off when not in use very light weight and fits into my messenger bag quite nicely i would definitely recommend this to someone else or even purchase another one
this bag is too big to fit under an aisle seat of a boeing # , which makes it pretty useless for me i wish i 'd known that before buying it the zip-thru feature works pretty well some features are not thought through very well there is no dedicated storage for the ac adapter that all laptop users carry with them if you carry anything with a cord in the outer zip pocket , and you also keep pens in the pocket 's pen holders , the cord will get tangled up with the pens the materials and construction seem good and sturdy
this is a good bag lots of room and airport ready i like all the pockets and easy to access computer slot the only thing that i do not like is that it does n't stand up when i set it down it always falls over
i have now travelled enough with this bag to say that it serves my purpose : zip thru security without having to remove the computer from its bag the bag is comfortable to carry : handles are good and the shoulder belt -lrb- comes with the bag -rrb- is very , very comfortable i have n't rated # stars , because the bag is # or # inches too tall , in my opinion if the bag was shorter , the pc pocket would still hold large laptops -lrb- my # `` floats within the pocket -rrb- and the document pocket could still hold large notebooks and folders being shorter , the bag would slide more easily under the seat in front of me , allowing to put my feet aside the bag , not over it the bag looks nice , seems built to last and is well organized , with numerous pockets and storage options
this bag holds my # `` mac laptop and its accessories quite comfortably i do n't know what i expected for the airport security features , but basically you store your laptop in a section with * nothing else added * so that the bag will unzip to open flat this prevents the need to take the laptop out of the bag please note that every other time i 've travelled with a laptop someone has asked me to turn on the computer there 's no way the bag will help you if you have to turn it on , as you 'd still need to remove it from the bag but for those times when they just want to x-ray it , this will decrease the time it takes you to get through the security line
this is a nicely made laptop bag , with many storage pockets and a secure placement for your laptop i like that it has a form fitting compartment with a strap to hold the laptop in place so , do n't think you can buy this bag to fit a laptop bigger than # . # -- there is no room to spare because of the form fitting buffers the other large compartment has plenty of room to hold <unk> / mouse , etc . there are also many smaller compartments to hold your cellphone , business cards , pens , small notepad , etc . i do like this case and it works well for someone who travels with their laptop but for me , for everyday use , i would like something a little smaller , as i would only need room for the pc and cords , i do n't need all the extra pockets/compartments however , if you travel for business , this is a nice secure case , with a lot of room for those extras that you may have to carry around
terrific laptop bag it has nice features not even listed , like <unk> handles that naturally come together with a slight magnetic catch no more fishing for dangling handles laptop protection seems good and top access is easy and fast
i needed a bag for my new # . # `` laptop this bag fills the bill nicely well made , well padded with plenty of storage for <unk> , as well as my usual assortment of things
the hook for this case is the fact that it can zip open and lay flat such that the laptop is totally separated from your files and other electronic components when going through airport security and it does just that , although i am somewhat dubious as to whether or not <unk> will allow the bag to go through with the computer still inside that said , this is a great bag for everyday use , even when not traveling for a big bag -lrb- easily accomodating the # . # inch screen on my dell d # -rrb- it is surprisingly light and features a very comfortable strap there is ample space for spare components , as well as plenty of room for paper files , something often lacking in laptop bags as such , it is n't cumbersome for day to day use , but also provides plenty of room for traveling all in all , i have no complaints , it even looks good
i purchased this bag in the last month since then i have taken two different trips and both times it was so simple to unzip the center section of the bag and lay it down on the belt to go through the xray i have had a tsa person question me about the bag but only to make sure i had put only the laptop in one side another tsa guy was excited to finally see one of the new bags it is very roomy and i would heartily recommend it
this laptop case offers everything you need it is extremely comfortable to carry on your shoulder , with a nice padded strap your laptop fits securely and there is a separate compartment for your accessories
on the plus side , the product works as advertised and is a pleasure to use through tsa security -lrb- even if tsa employees were not always aware that these products had been approved -rrb- on the negative side , it ripped very easily and was unusable within three months after purchase with moderate use
great compartments and storage gets through tsa no problem , but the <unk> clasps that connect the shoulder strap to the bag itself have a funky design if they are twisted or turned , which they tend to do with their <unk> shape , they will release from the bag that means the strap can suddenly release from the bag sending the bag and its precious contents to the ground my laptop hit the ground , and hard , once before i learned to always check even so , the <unk> thing has released a few times i need to buy another one to be honest , i would n't buy this one again because of that one feature i do n't know what your laptop costs , but mine was way too much to risk to poor clasp design
i like this bag alot the external pockets for cables and power adapters are really handy , and the non-slip should pad is great -lrb- in fact , i often use it with my camera bag -rrb- the only negative , which others have noted , is that the connectors for the shoulder strap are a bad design if you twist them the wrong way , they 'll unhook themselves when this happens and my precious laptop heads for the pavement , i must resort to my special <unk> words to express my <unk> if it were n't for this one flaw , this would be a <unk> bag as it is , it 's a very serious design flaw
so far , i had this bag for # months so far , it is holding up well i would say that this bag offers good value much better than the tumi which is a waste of money it is lighter than the targus i had , albeit a bit smaller and not as <unk> the different storage areas featured can hold many small stuff i wish the shoulder pad be made with stronger material
this has been a great bag lots of storage cables , papers , pens , flash drives and cards i carry a laptop and an ipad and both fit in it comfortably with lots of assorted cables and headphones not having to remove the ipad and the laptop each time i go through tsa is the best feature all you have to do is unzip it lay it open and the zip it up after its gone through the scanner it is also very strong
i have a # . # inch sony vaio i 've tried several bags and they were either too big , or too small this bag not only meets the standards for `` checkpoint friendly `` , but it also meets the measurements for under the seat storage it holds my laptop , power supply , mouse , etc . , plus has room for my portable video player and a few other <unk>
this case is awesome at first it looks cool , fits well , and is overall very stylish but as you continue to use it , it fits less and less well my laptop has now begun sliding around inside it disappointing to say the least especially for a product that looks so good
i realized that since i cant fit my charger in this case , i end up putting it in my shoulder bag anyway but when i pack my laptop for trips i like having this extra sleeve for protection
i wanted a sleeve for my <unk> macbook air so that i could slip it into my usual bag during my commute rather than carrying yet another bag for a very thin and light laptop this fits the # & # # ; macbook air perfectly , and the zipper works reliably the material is n't familiar to me , but it feels like a very firm memory foam it seems more than adequate to protect the laptop from scratches from other things in my bag or light bumps along the commute , but i would n't trust it for a fall down a flight of stairs -lrb- if you 're looking for this kind of protection , you 'll want something other than a sleeve .
the case arrived quickly & is exactly what i wanted the padding is just right for protection but not too thick the mba slides right in without having to fight it it seems to have a strong zipper & there is padding between it & the mba overall a good design & i 'm happy
this thing 's a winner it 's nice and thick -lrb- though sleeve + macbook air is still thinner than my old macbook -rrb- , and the foam really works - it cushions well without being too squishy it 's very soft inside so it does n't scratch up the computer , but still tough on the outside good , solid zipper without loose edges on the case to get caught in it most importantly , and this frequently goes <unk> , it fits the # inch macbook air like a glove - no rattle , goes in easily , just perfect overall , it 's one of the best sleeves i 've ever used no extra space -lrb- if you want to toss your cord in there , you do n't want a sleeve - you want a briefcase -rrb- , but also not so snug you ca n't easily get it out thick enough to give plenty of protection , but thin enough to disappear in your messenger bag or backpack firm enough to take a beating , but soft enough not to transfer that beating straight through to your computer highly recommended , i 'd buy it again in a heart beat
this sleeve has stiffer foam than i expected or have experienced with my other sleeve it conforms well to the macbook air and give me the impression it will evenly distribute any impacts and keep it save
this tote is pretty but the stitching looks <unk> & the bag looks a lot cheaper than it was i did n't want to spend a fortune but i think for more than $ # this should have been a lot nicer if i did n't need it for a business trip in # days i would return it definitely not very happy with this purchase
this is a perfect & # # ; briefcase & # # ; for me has plenty of pockets , can be slipped over the handle of a suitcase when traveling , is lightweight and zips for when it is raining
stylish , comfortable , well made i use this for my work laptop and files everyday there is plenty of space in this bag , without it being too big and bulky like some other laptop bags
fantastic for work and for travel i 'm an engineer at a tech company so i always have a <unk> of gadgets on me , and , thankfully , there are pockets for everything the only thing i am sad about is that it got dirty a little faster than i 'd hoped it 's also a little floppy and does n't stand well on its own other than that , i 'm very pleased with the amount of storage it has , as well as how roomy the laptop compartment is plus , it 's <unk> pink on the inside
this bag has absolutely surpassed my expectations i 've only had it for a little over a week , but it 's exactly what i need it 's the perfect size for my laptop plus a couple of books or my ipad it seems sturdily made , and there 's tons of pockets for all the stuff i need to carry my favorite is the clear , zippered pocket on the inside ; it 's great for things that i normally lose in bags , like flash drives and my ipad stylus it 's cute , functional and professional all at the same time
interior space ok i find a flap design cumbersome when trying to remove the laptop also the strap attachment point is cheap : nylon strap folds easily and gets jammed up into the metal buckle so that it does n't hang `` straight `` ; an annoyance mostly
the bag seemed to be of good quality , but it did not suit the purpose for which it was purchased we needed something a bit thinner -- not as bulky the return process was quick and smooth
i was looking for something to carry my asus eee pc , charger and a few other items around this little bag has more than enough room to fit the charger , extra phone charger , external hard drive , and much more it seems to be well constructed my only complaint is that if you want to throw this thing over your should and go you might be disappointed the shoulder strap always falls off my should , but it works great as a messenger bag
i wanted to downsize from a backpack , but still wanted to keep things organized the case logic <unk> # messenger <unk> does an excellent job in that department only wish it had room for a standard file folder
this is the perfect bag for my hp # p its very good organized , with pockets for my zune , portable hd , cell phone , wallet and more this is another great product from caselogic
i was looking for a bag to carry my # `` macbook air and this was the perfect size i wanted something that was obviously small yet large enough to carry the laptop plus magazines or any letter size documents i also wanted the bag to be vertical & look very clean , this bag met all my requirements by far you ca n't beat the price , i paid under $ # dollars for it the only negative i would say is that it probably needs a shoulder pad not to due to weight but prevent it from sliding , not a problem if you sling it over like a messenger bag
received this bag as a gift to carry an # `` macbook air , and it 's perfect it 's a great travel bag for the air with plenty of room for power cord , headphones , extra accessories and even a few books a few outer <unk> provide quick access for boarding passes or other paperwork
i 've been using this bag for a while now it 's great it 's just big enough to fit my netbook along with my kindle , a couple of glasses cases , a bottle of water , and numerous other small accessories i still use it well after passing along that netbook , though it 's large enough for lots of stuff and small enough to not get too heavy of bothersome
i absolutely love this bag it looks great , it holds my notebooks and a few thin text books along with the computer , cable , pens , my phone and wallet the strap does n't have added padding , but it is still pretty comfortable this is a great bag for male or female go for it
got my macvelope today - sorely disappointed its banana yellow and is made really cheaply the string is too short and the ties are about to <unk> off at any moment seriously what manilla envelope looks like this
the product was good the only problem is that when i opened the case there was a black mark on it <unk> it was <unk> maker or some thing other than that its ok
i really wanted to like this i loved it when it first arrived but it was n't a snug fit for my macbook air # `` that i could live with but with less than three months of use , the velcro strip on the flap started to come off its barely stuck to the flap and soon will come off completely , making the macvelope unusable which is making me sad :
i bought this because i thought it would be funny and it was at a good price unfortunately the case has an overall cheap feel to it in about a month the red string came off and now it 's just a yellow velcro sleeve the inside is a nice nylon and protects my laptop from scratches , so it serves it 's purpose as a case however i 'm on the market for something new the cheap yellow surface has become discolored from other things in my bag rubbing against it it 's a good cheap solution for a case , but it is not something you will use very long
this case is * really * tight when used with the late # macbook air also , the inside lining is larger than it should be , which means you can see wrinkles through the yellow vinyl
i heard about the red string falling off , but that did n't bother me much because the velcro is what keeps it closed anyway what does bother me though , is that the side stitching was not properly done so there is about an inch hole on the side of my macvelope you can actually see where the needle must have slipped off the vinyl and came back on an inch later , definitely not the best stitching or quality control it 's still serving its purpose and i plan to sew it shut myself rather than go through the hassle of returning it for a new one it 's really cute though , if not for the poor sewing i would have given it # stars but then again , i think giving it # stars is fair for a product that came with a hole in it
i purchased the # inch macbook air just as it came out , so there were no new cases made just for it i thought it would be cool to get a case that looked like a manila folder so i purchased this case it looks nice , not too cheap looking , but not very high end either -lrb- i mean just look at the price -rrb- initially i thought i would have to return the case because it was too tight to fit the computer , but after forcing it a few times it loosened up nicely i think this case provides good protection against scratches and some protection against drops i bought it because it 's mostly fun but it seems -lrb- so far atleast -rrb- to be pretty practical and well made
this case is a fun way to carry your <unk> gadget it 's also pretty functional since it feels almost indestructible the first one i received was a little roomy , and my macbook air slid all around after writing a quick note to the company , they sent out a new one that was much tighter great product and great customer service
i have used this case now for a couple years and i love it people always love the novelty of it and i just like it 's protection for my macbook air
this envelope case is really clever the mac <unk> of the hand pulling the computer out of a yellow envelope sold my dad on buying a macbook air i got him this envelope case for christmas and ca n't to see what he thinks of it it is really very durable and visually attractive in person
these are individually good products the case zipper is its weakest point ; it could be more substantial to withstand the rigors of professional use -lrb- i use it to encase a # `` macbook pro and an ipad -rrb- otherwise it 's fine and the envelope is both good and fun -- lots of <unk> when i bring it to a meeting the really problem is the combined usage the envelope is made of substantial material and is slightly too big for the zipped case , so its two upper corners wear down the case material from the inside i did n't realize that this was happening until i noticed that the case nylon was wearing thin at these two points so : each is fine by itself -- especially considering the price but be careful in using them together
i bought this product expecting the envelope to bear the `` macvelope `` logo however , it <unk> a logo saying `` grantwood `` , which in my opinion takes away from the general feel of a customized envelope for macbook air also , there were several fold marks on the back of the envelope , hence the three stars
these products are the ideal companion for the macbook air they are made with a good material thanks amazon and the seller for the fast delivery on brazil i highly recomend these combined products for all macbook air owner
this was a great buy for both the envelope and the carrying case i only paid ~ $ # the envelope will protect a late # mba from scratches , though i have seen better sleeves for the previous generation the carrying case has lots of room for carrying <unk> in addition to the computer the only downside i saw was the `` grantwood `` logo stitched onto everything , though i 'm sure i 'll get over that totally recommended at this price
you ca n't find a more fun way to carry your air the smiles from people when you take your air <unk> of the envelope case are priceless and the regular computer bag is great when you need to carry stuff with you decently built , at a great price
i wanted a bag that could carry my laptop as well as power cord and extra 's i like the fact that the bag opens from the top so if you do n't zip bag completely shut , stuff is less likely to fall out it also has good padding in back and bottom pack to cushion you and computer
works fine with my dell xps # the size is just right , there is ample room inside i just wish they had a front zippered pocket for easy in/out when i travel i use one of the side pockets instead
my laptop is a # & # # ; monster it 's a gaming computer , so it 's bigger than the normal # & # # ; laptop it fit like a glove , and i love all the storage the straps are padded for comfort , and there 's also a waist strap which i have n't used but glad it 's there my laptop weighs nearly # lbs , and this makes it comfortable to lug around i was using a messenger-style bag before which killed my shoulders , but this backpack makes it feel so much better and the price was amazing , $ # . # for this quality is <unk> of -lrb- it 's cheaper now , hurry and get yours ! -rrb-
compared to almost every other padded laptop case for large screen laptops this one is a steal ... and it 's well made i feel safe putting it in there i mean its a laptop so you do n't want to smash it around or let baggage at the airport check it ... but that 's the same with any laptop case it 's a nice solid construction and for toting your laptop around in a normal fashion it 's great
i bought this item for my asus ul # v series laptop i was concerned because of the different design of the laptop but it fit well there is less than an inch space -lrb- maybe half an inch -rrb- on top but it does n't make a problem since the case inside has another securing place
i made sure to get a sleeve that was as close as possible to the measurements of my laptop i got rather surprised though , when i saw how snug it fit my dell studio # -lrb- # -rrb- i got it on time , and i am very pleased personally i love how it sticks out , without being full of brand names or hello kitty
i 've always been hesitant to buy one of these covers i decided to give em ' a try because i feel over loaded w / a backpack , purse & laptop bag it fits my laptop nice , is durable , soft , and i got it at a great price very happy with it
this little case is just what i needed to fit my new # `` sony viao into it 's a beautiful shade of red and i can find it easily it is light , yet has protection for stuffing it into a tote bag or a briefcase love it and would definitely order it again for another computer well worth the price as it has superior workmanship
i am happy with my purchase : -rrb- i purchased this sleeve case for my new # inch sony vaio and it fits perfectly the inside of the case is soft and protects my laptop i think the red color is beautiful and i believe it 's great for the price
it fits my dell # z with # -cell battery very snugly there 's not a lot of room for much else , but this is a great sleeve for portability the sleeve is nicely made and seems to be good quality at ~ $ # . # it 's a bargain , too this sleeve would be a perfect fit for the # z with a # -cell battery , but the # z with # -cell battery will fit if you insert the laptop with battery side * up * it 's a very tight squeeze , so if you do n't want a tight sleeve for your # <unk> # -cell , choose another product
i got this for a netbook and found it pretty well as advertised but maybe a teeny bit on the small side -lrb- although it stretched enough to work -rrb- sleek styling , adequate padding for putting it inside a backpack , but i would n't trust it to buffer a fall zippers sturdy enough
for as simple and easy as this product is , my review will just be as simple it 's well made , durable , and protects your stuff with a nice big pocket for accessories
this is the perfect case for a netbook . do n't wont something cumbersome but you want to make sure the device is protected this fills the bill on both counts i 'd buy it again and again
this case was one that i bought for my early # macbook i bought the right kind and it fit fine , but was hard to take off when it caused my mac to overheat luckily , macs are built well enough to withstand that it was really annoying to have to take
the case is easy to put on , it pretty much snaps into place there was only one issue i found with the product , but it was remedied with a quick online search the bottom of the case comes on and off easily , but the top was really hard to take off i looked up the case online , and people were recommending to insert a credit card along the edges , to release the tabs that hold it in place other than that , everything is working well , and it looks great
certainly worth the cost everything is great , with one small exception with covers on , the range of motion for the lid is slightly diminished , meaning , the top covers binds with the body when the lid is open fully it 's not a deal breaker , but a consideration if you need the lid to open to the full original angle otherwise i love it and would buy another
