i bought this just to lug around all of my things for class , but i have wound up using it for my computer i 've bought computer bags in the past that advertised # . # size , but my computer would n't fit my computer fit very well in this one i 'm very happy i bought this bag
i just got this and have n't actually used it yet , but i figured i 'd add a few comments since i <unk> on them so much when i was selecting a bag the most important thing for me was a bag that could fit school books as well as my # . # `` computer , and this seems like it will do the job i was able to fit about # `` of books in and the bag was able to comfortably close -lrb- and i might even be able to squeeze more in -rrb- it claims its width is # `` , and that was the best i could find when i was looking at the specs of different bags online some drawbacks : no handle on top to grab , which i did n't use often on my old bag but it does come in handy no special slots for pens or small items ; just a zippered pocket -lrb- which i 'll try using for <unk> -rrb- and an open mesh pocket -lrb- the description mentioned something about a full organization panel , but i 'm not sure what that <unk> to . the side panels seem a little thin , and since that was the first thing to tear in my old bag i 'm hoping this wo n't be a problem overall , it does seem like a good bag and i needed it for the book space , but keep in mind that it does n't have some of the features that you might be used to
i got it in a matter of days i thought it would n't get to me in time for school , so i contacted them about <unk> it but it came in time the color is a bit muted than in the picture , but that 's not a problem it has many compartments , for your laptop , notebooks and there are two sides for your water bottle will fit , which is a bonus then the front pocket outside it is big enough to carry like your wallet and pens
i am a college student and needed a computer bag that was durable , protected my computer , and i could lug around campus this bag looks great in the pictures and it 's exactly that it is really durable inside and out . i would prefer a little more room for things however it is completely functional the strap could also be more comfortable , so if you carry a heavy load often i would not recommend this bag this completely works for my needs and i really enjoy using it
i really , really , really , love this bag i havent had it for very long but i am very happy with this buy the price is great and the bag is even better it has room for everything i need to carry with my laptop and has padding so it will help keep it safe from damage the style is cool too ... though the cloth on the inside of it has a design i 'm not all that crazy about i still love it i recomend it to anyone who wants a good <unk> bag for a great price
this is a high quality bag i use it as a `` man bag `` so it 's a little big for me but i was unable to find anything near this quality bag for the price the large inner pocket has divided into # sections which will hold # `` laptop in one easily in the other one is also a zippered pocket and cargo net pouch for quick access items there are # end pockets under the end of the straps which appx # . # `` i use it to store the face plate for my cars head unit and cell in the other there is also a large zipper pocket on the outer flap appx # in `` you ca n't go wrong with this bag i did n't measure the the bag but my appx sizes pretty close the straps are thick and wo n't roll on you
i use the bag for work , since it is bigger than i thought i am able to keep all my stuff in there great for me since i dont have a lot of space at work and am always moving to different locations
the quality and design are <unk> i use it daily for books and files , occasionally for a laptop instead of my wheeled laptop case additionally , it is an excellent value
love the bag it is nice and stylish for me and my husband it 's very strong and it protects the laptop with the padding in the bag it has a place where you can put your charger , a book or so , phone cable , and lots of other accessories for your computer i even had room to put my camera in the bag as well i am pleased with my messenger bag and how it protects my laptop
i absolutely love this bag ! i was looking for a bag that would hold my # . # `` wide screen laptop , and this one fits perfectly my laptop does fit a little snug , but all in all it is exactly what i was looking for it has plenty of room for the cord , mouse and any work papers , so it does double as a briefcase it is also a very stylish messenger bag the only drawback is that it does not have a small handle on top of the bag , or the strap across the back to attach to a rolling suitcase -lrb- not that big a deal for me -rrb- i would highly recommend this bag to anyone who is looking for a bag for their laptop
i 've had my bag for almost a month and it 's been really good it has held all my textbooks as well as my laptop with no problems the only problem i have is that the stitching on one of the straps has ripped about two inches and the foam inside the strap <unk> through i have n't been particularly hard on my bag and my textbooks are all paperback and not that heavy so i do <unk> why it ripped other than shoddy craftsmanship :
i was looking for a lap backpack to carry my mac pro # , this bag serves the purpose well i wo n't recommend this bag to men it just looks too cute and a bit
great design for the best price i received my new backpack in just a few days , which was great i love the design is simple , but elegant and the padding on the straps make the load very comfortable
this is one quality laptop backpack for the money it looks cool and it 's made of durable materials and engineered well i purchased this for my netbook and though it 's made for larger notebooks , still protects my asus and keeps it snug as a bug in a rug great buy , and fashionable
i 've always liked backpacks , but some styles that fit laptops are just a bit too <unk> looking for me this factor is really cool because it 's comfortable , looks a little more hip and urban , plus i really like the <unk> brown i can keep my laptop safe and stash extra stuff like sunglasses , keys , cellphone in the extra pockets
a lowepro backpack for as little as $ # . # and a stylish one at that you got ta be kidding i ca n't tell you whether you 'd love it or not but someone must 've screwed up in corporate pricing or quantity it 's a bargain i got one and i love it
this lowepro bag is amazing i have not had a problem with it since i got it , and it has more than enough room for all of the things i need for school , plus my laptop it 's sturdy and provides a great weight <unk> so your back never gets sore there is more than enough padding as well so the shoulders do not get tired
i just returned to grad school and i wanted a bag that would safely transport my laptop and various <unk> first of all , my laptop actually has a # . # inch screen and it fits just fine the laptop portion is well padded and provides a snug compartment the interior of the bag allows me to easily carry three books , a binder , my laptop cords , etc . there are also slots for pens , a zippered pouch which works well for my earbuds and a few other pouches the pack is a nice quality and i 've received compliments on it it 's also pretty comfy ... nice padded shoulder straps
i absolutely love this bag it has a lot of space for all of the peripherals and has tons of padding for the laptop i only wish i had bought it sooner !
for the price this backpack was well worth it it will carry about # of my college books plus my laptop , and has a special area for pens , and other supplies
got this for a large laptop and have thoroughly enjoyed it for years now it would be nice to have a bit longer top flap and straps for <unk> a jacket down , but other than that , it 's great
i got this for my laptop at a pretty decent price about a year ago it was a little bit bigger than i thought it was going to be , but it 's not bulky it serves it 's purpose of storing and carrying a laptop in a safe and relatively easy manner , as well as storing all of the necessary accessories for your laptop even then , i still have extra space left to fill with various items i may need
i like this laptop bag since it has lots of pockets so that you can get organized well for your travels also the separate zippered slot for the laptop is very useful i really liked it while walking through the airport security and removing my laptop over and over the only bad thing about this bag is that it 's a bit huge i was expecting a little bit smaller when saw the pic on amazon but it almost exceeds my shoulders , so may not be a good choice especially for tiny women in my opinion , it 's not good for daily use because of the size , but excellent for travels
this is a great backpack it holds my # ' mac perfectly there are plenty of compartments for pens , my wireless mouse , cables , etc . i also like that it keeps its shape but is still flexible my last backpack was about as sturdy as a paper bag i also like the colors , very distinct and easy to find , although i admit i only got the green one because it was cheaper
i was n't really sure about buying this backpack , but decided to because of all of the great reviews the backpack arrived surprisingly quickly after ordering and it 's much better than my old backpack it 's very comfortable and helps support my back well with all of the stuff i have to carry in my backpack the laptop area is just the right size for my laptop , although if you have an older , bulkier laptop it 's unlikely to fit in the backpack aside from that , the only complaint i have is that i ca n't fit as much in this backpack as i could in my last one , which is n't necessarily a bad thing all in all , a great bag , nice places for everything you need to carry : books , pens/pencils , cell phone , extra keys they also started selling these for almost twice the price that i bought it at my local bookstore , so it 's definitely worth purchasing on amazon rather than in store
i got this bag because with the messenger laptop bags , my shoulder was hurting because of everything that i needed to carry around with the laptop this bag works perfectly laptop fits perfectly with enough room for all the other things that i usually carry
the front zipper pouch is great for tickets or small items you want to keep close at hand there are plenty of organizing pockets for your phone , mp # player , keys , pens , wallet , power cord , mouse , web cam , etc . lightweight by itself , it does n't add pounds to your travel
fits my # `` widescreen laptop snuggly i can tell however why the price was so cheap due to thin materials used the carrying handle could pull away from the fabric if used very long colors are accurate to pictures i expected more quality assembly from this company and have been disappointed
i had been searching for a laptop case when i came across this one i loved the colors that it appears to be in the photos but when i got it in the mail , i was a little disappointed the places where it looks white are actually more of a beige color and it looks more & # # ; <unk> & # # ; than it does online i ended up keeping it because it is a nice bag , but if you are looking for something that is green and white , this is not it the quality of the bag is good and the <unk> fits the laptop 's cord and other things and there are two additional small pockets on the inside nice design but not representation of the color
this is actually the second lowepro i have bought i loved my first one and it still functions great with no rips or tears but got filthy over the years highly recommended bag
there was no way to use this case without covering up the speakers on my # `` phillips dvd player similarly , there was no way to place the dvd player in the case that allowed me to open the dvd door to change dvds without removing the device from the case entirely pay close attention to the product photos and make sure your dvd player will work with this ; mine sure did n't
using this with a sony player as pictured and the strap that holds the player does not work well the strap is too thin and ends up sliding into the gap between the screen and bottom part of the player , so the only place it actually supports the player is the hinge area in the middle this does not provide a secure hold , the player easily <unk> , and goes crooked in the case also , the wide strap that is supposed to go around the seat and clip to the case is not long enough even with the strap fully extended , it does not reach around the seat of a toyota <unk> , -lrb- not an overly large seat -rrb-
i usually write my reviews after i 've used my products for a while the true nature of the product shows up after a while i brought this product long ago and i 've not been able to use this comfortably it 's been unsteady and difficult to use and manage not worth it ! !
i have had a couple cases for dvd players in the past and this one is a bit disappointing the way that the loops are set up makes it difficult to <unk> between to seats and it ends up flopping down also i found the <unk> you use to connect to the loops are very hard to use especially with finger nails i would not buy it again
prior to setting it up in my car the clip broke that secures the case in the car i do not think that the broken clip will prevent the use of the case , but i have to say that we as consumers should expect more i anticipate that this case may have an extremely short <unk> based on poor materials i would not recommend it to a friend
got this to hold dvd player works just fine for that , but i do n't think it would hold up to tough use , or to use by children in the car
i bought this to hold a # `` dvd player so our # year old son can watch movies on a # -day car trip in the backseat we wanted something that would sit in between the seats it has one strap that goes around the <unk> and the case attaches via velcro over the strap then it has # straps that are supposed to hold the player <unk> by attaching to the bottom of each front seat the only problem is that our front seats have nowhere for the two straps to attach to the case also does n't have much room for extra storage of dvd player remote , dvd 's , cords , etc . also , it does n't seem to be cross functional to attach it the back of one seat like others i 've <unk> i would recommend finding another product that can work for viewing in both positions , and that has more storage
the case is just fine we just needed one that would mount on the back of the headrest and could n't find one we were able to make this one work though
this was a gift , and it states it fits a # to # inch portable dvd player its little large for the dvd player we got -lrb- it is a # -inch -rrb- it was a recommended item by amazon , they should look at the products more closely before <unk> them up for a deal the case opens up so you can lay out the dvd player to watch in a car but the dvd player we have slides out when placing open to watch it doesnt work well with newer sleek dvd players , maybe with older bulky ones this case will only be used for carrying because of that flaw
the case itself is of good construction and makes for nice storage of a dvd player or small netbook however , when installed in my toyota suv , it sits so close to the back seat that the kids feet can kick it when they are in the car seat i dont know if its just that my suv is too small or if the design is just not a good idea anyhow , it does what it says it does , and if you have a big back seat , like a minivan , it will probably work great for you
i ordered this for a two day trip from california to texas it was to hold a sony # in portable dvd the case is great if you want to just carry your dvd player around , but is challenging to install and maintain stability in my <unk> excursion
it needs side holes for plug access and wires for headphone and power chords the top strap attaches fine , but the bottom strap needs to come with a better way to secure it to the car
the dvd case is nice looking and has plenty of storage the directions are so so and i still can not figure out how to connect to the bottom on my seats
overall , this case works well the straps are just about infinitely configurable , but you must spend a little time figuring out the best approach for your particular setup everything i need fits into the case , including the adapters and remote for the dvd player i would prefer some side pockets instead of the one big pocket for storing items , which would allow much better organization straps and cords tend to end up in a <unk> , but this is a minor annoyance another improvement would be an outside pocket to hold a few dvds the case is somewhat ugly , but it is more useful than the better looking cases i tried before
just used it for few days my sony dvp-fx # fits perfectly in the case and protects well it also stores all the accessories and ease to carry look wise it does not feel great but performance wise it 's great removed one star for the look good value for money i recommend it
i 've got a # `` toshiba player and it 's a tight fit in this case , but it does fit it 's hard to get to the volume and on/off on the sides of the unit , so i guess they should think of easier side access some how , but over all it 's a pretty good case we set it up hanging from the back of a seat instead of <unk> between two seats like in the picture and instructions that works pretty well , though i do n't think it was designed for it nice thick case should protect the player pretty well looks kind of high <unk> i do n't think you 'd guess it 's a portable dvd case if you saw it zipped up it 's got a neat audio port splitter jack that comes out through the bottom -lrb- if hanging -rrb- of the case you plug the attached plug into the player and it splits it outside the case for two head phones -lrb- if you need that -rrb- we are n't using head phones yet and only have one kid , but may one day we may have her wear headphones
this little case works great for the most part the biggest problems are storing everything there are three straps that have to be stowed , along with the dvd player , remote , charger , etc . the front part of the case is open , so in some configurations , when the dvd player is setup to play you do n't have a good spot to store items that are n't being used this is n't a huge deal , but it is inconvenient overall this is a great case for the price
worked out great in the car , although we had a problem attaching to the back of the seat the case is sturdy and had enough room for all the accessories for the <unk> dvd player
i purchased this for my daughter 's sony portable dvd player it is great as a carrying case ... it fits her cords and headphones we carry a separate case for her movies i really wish they all fit in one this case does hook onto car seats , but the way the seats are shaped in my <unk> outlook made it difficult it takes me about # minutes each time i hook it in the car i have to <unk> because it did n't fit my seats the way it was supposed to i honestly think each time i hook it in , i do it differently as long as it holds up , that 's all that matters to me the case and strap itself are great quality and i do n't have any doubt in using them to hold up the dvd player
we ordered this dvd player case for a cross country trip we were taking we have a # / # year old and knew we would need a dvd player to get us through the trip -lrb- va to ok -rrb- we have a # expedition and the case worked very well i would recommend this case to anyone
it 's a bit large for our dvd player , but it securely keeps the player in place while the car is moving we mount it between two bucket seats , works like a charm
pretty good player case for being a universal style takes a little to set up in the vehicle the first time but pretty easy once done a couple of times
i think for the price it 's the best out there if you do n't have a built in dvd player i used it for my daughter & drove # hrs to ny & back without any problems i did n't see it move once i would purchase this again if mine broke tomorrow
not a lot to say that has n't been said , but it 's a great case that feels sturdy and holds our dvd player very well suspended between the two front seats no complaints so far
i recently purchased a sony dvp-fx # inch portable dvd player and needed case for my van the case works great just as advertised it holds all of the cords and a couple of movies i would buy it again
i did some research before i bought a portable dvd player case i wanted something that i could use as a case , as well as a mount for the portable dvd player in the car works perfect for a portable dvd player case you can fit everything you need in the case there is room for a few dvd 's as well my husband has been the one to install the case as a mount in my car for the dvd player , and it does not take him long and it works perfect overall , very satisfied with this product
this bag was the cheapest one it 's good quality and holds everything you can hang it on the back of one seat ... does n't need to go between the two front seats very happy with purchase
it was exactly what i thought it would be it worked well in our # town & country between the front seats and all three of the kids could see it well its also nice to have the compartment for movie storage in the back it has quite a variety of configurations as well
this case worked out perfect for our new sony dvd player it easily hooked up to go over our suv <unk> chairs plus it makes a great carrying and storage case for the player i would recommend it
this saved us in our # hour summer vacation drive it was perfect for my son to watch his kid dvds it was easy to install and work with we installed it in our # <unk> the only challenge was that our son is tall -lrb- like us - so our front seats are far back -rrb- and his feet could touch the dvd player while he was sitting in the middle car seat we just had to tell him `` you touch the screen and it -lrb- <unk> the <unk> -rrb- goes away . he quickly learned to keep his feet off of it without the dvd player we would have stopped every # minutes - with this we were able to go solid for # . # hours each time
i read a lot of reviews before deciding on this case it was easy to set-up between the seats of our <unk> odyssey works great and holds all the cords + a few dvds very pleased with this case
my son tossed the case with the portable dvd player inside from our second floor i thought that was the end of the player to my amazement , the player was protected from damage i highly recommend it
this is a really nice case , especially for the price it works well in the car to hold the dvd player in multiple positions it works perfect with the sony # inch player or the lg # inch player
i am mostly happy with the computer back pack i did think that the pockets in this were going to be a little bigger then what they are i would have liked it better if i could carry a little more in the bag i do have to say it is nice to be able to carry the computer on my back ons not in a <unk> case type bag it is nicer both for my hands and arms and also nicer for my back to even my weight on my back <unk> of one side
i tried one of the swiss gear -lrb- by wenger -rrb- laptop bags and wasnt happy with it it was uncomfortable on the back then i switched to the targus <unk> backpack its comfortable on the back , spacious , strongly built and looks good all in all , i would recommend this bag to anyone who 's looking to buy a reasonably priced backpack
this backpack is very nice i love all the different compartments and pockets i 'm a big fan of pockets one thing that 's a little bit of an inconvenience is that i almost have to unclip those two corner clips in order to fully access that middle <unk> everything else looks wonderful i ca n't wait to use it
it 's just a computer bag , but i 've had a lot worse over the years nicely designed , fits my dell latitude e # easily , and appears to be rugged enough that i wo n't be needing to buy a new one anytime soon
this backpack worked perfectly for my needs my laptop is pretty small , so it fit easily in the back compartment i loaded the bag down with a bunch of other stuff in the various pockets and was able to find things readily the one thing i wish it had was a strap you could attach on the front between the two shoulder straps for extra security and comfort
lots of little pockets and spaces to put things more than enough space for my # `` laptop fits firmly and comfortably on my back i would definitely recommend it
this pack was purchased to carry a <unk> top for travel and outdoor use it is used by a female employee and she really likes that the straps are closed together and fit well for narrower shoulders our other packs , while they work well for our male staff -lrb- also targus -rrb- the straps were too far apart for our female <unk> it has a number of nice accessory pockets and has protected the lap-top well on a number of long trips and commuting we will buy another one for any of our female staff , in particular
the bag was impeccable nothing to say but the carrying handle <unk> and <unk> at the first use not that <unk> for a carrying bag the return was much more expensive than they give you i paid # $ for shipping plus # $ for import fees and they only give you back # $ <unk> i think there <unk> wrong do n't you think buy it if you have money to lose
cheap leather , ugly wheels the inline skate wheels found on other brands such as wenger are a much better solution mcklein 's <unk> on their cases being detachable is also problematic , as it lessens the structural integrity of the bag , resulting in squeaking and looseness i returned it immediately
the pictured item is not what was delivered the delivered item had wheels sticking out from the sides by # inch , which <unk> part of the purpose to make it something i could fit under the airline seat one the positive side , the detachable case was easy to detach -lrb- probably more easy than the pictured product -rrb- still , i would like the picture to match the product when i make a purchase
i ordered the model # in november # and loved it tried to order a second one in late december , inadvertently got the # for an almost identical price ebags sent me a bag that is not like the one pictured the handle sticks out from the back rather than being flush as shown the wheels stick out on the sides , not <unk> as shown , making the bag too wide to fit down the airplane aisle while the configuration of pockets looks the same , the materials are substantially different and the look is cheap i would n't buy this again for half the price
love the bag , hate the roller first unit delivered the roller handle worked fine for a while and then it came apart thought maybe i got a dude and returned and replaced same thing happened unfortunately , after the normal # day return policy if you want a roller , avoid this one
i purchased this product based on the reviews i read and of course , the price it is leather and it does look good it is not as roomy as i thought , but if you are planning on carrying a purse and extra bag for a small food container , then this bag would work , no problem i work in downtown and i use the bus park & ride service so i am happy i do n't have to drag my # `` notebook and the rest of my stuff in my backpack anymore however , the telescopic handle on this case is starting to really tick me off this morning i almost did not make it to the bus , because i had to keep fiddling with the handle to bring it down it also is beginning to get stuck on getting up i will contact the manufacturer to see if they can replace the detachable wheeled portion of the case for me i am hoping this is just a <unk> unit
the quality of this bag was really good ... nice leather and workmanship ... but it was far too small for a wheeled bag it looks much bigger on the site than it actually is it is very narrow and would only carry minimal materials in addition to a laptop i am going to return it in exchange for a much bigger , expandable bag
i received this bag last week after a prompt delivery , i was disappointed by the look it has a somewhat shiny texture which looks like cheap vinyl the detachable wheel base has these awfully tacky silver <unk> style wheels which has drawn comments from my co-workers -lrb- for example <unk> your briefcase and the like -rrb- not the professional carrier i was hoping for i will say the case itself and the pockets are really roomy the back pocket which holds the laptop will require you to have a separate laptop sleeve for protection as this does not have a padded spot overall just okay , and if i was n't in need of the bags use right away i would have sent it back to mcklein : do away with the cheap plastic <unk> styled wheels very <unk> for the price , more <unk> than what i would expect from your brand
the dimensions for this product state # x # . # x # inches what is misleading is that the # `` includes the wheels so it my laptop the is about # `` tall wo n't fit as the inside compartment is only # . # `` tall
i bought this bag in june # it is now march # and the bag itself is in great shape , but the rolling handle attachment has broken , rendering it useless as a rolling bag for $ # . # , i expected to get at least one year out of the product before having to replace it i did use it daily and commute by train and walk about # mile with it daily to and from the train stations it easily holds a two # inch laptops it is time for a replacement and i will not be buying this bag again
birthday present for husband he loves it ! seems like great construction , high end materials , good craftsmanship looks <unk> laptop with # & # # ; screen with room to spare -lrb- hp many extra <unk> long enough for tall man to roll <unk> big <unk> did not fit in overhead or under seat storage on all
bought this to replace a wenger laptop bag -lrb- one of the oversized ones -rrb- i grew tired of always having to carry it and the wheeled solution appealed to me if you are looking for a versatile and well-made bag , consider this one that said , a couple of `` wishes `` : i wish it had more pockets -lrb- or better designed -rrb- to carry all the cords and accessories we all have to deal with for various electronics i wish it had a fastener of some kind so you could secure it to a wheeled carry-on -lrb- <unk> style -rrb- for moving through the airport , etc . it sort of sits on top but there is nothing to secure it from falling off have not yet detached the bag from the wheeled base and frame , but it 's nice to have that option very good value in my opinion and very <unk> case
love this bag as it holds the laptop and tablet nicely i would have given it five stars but found it lacking in small item storage things like a wireless dongle does not have a place in this bag that being said , it really is n't hard to get a small case and that works well in this bag maybe if they included a small <unk> capable of handling miscellaneous cables , cards , or devices
i ordered this bag to fit my # . # & # # ; laptop and text books for school and yes they all fit in because there is a lot of space i like the fact that is is detachable when needed the front of the bag is hard leather -lrb- i prefer soft leather -rrb- and the top and sides is synthetic leather -lrb- rubber -rrb- even though they claim that it is all leather another thing i do n't like about this bag is that , there is no dedicated pocket for the laptop other than that , the seller shipped it immediately and i received it before the expected date
the detachable option can help with all the bangs on the bag when traveling the bag being leather has to adjust to what is being packed in there it begins tight from the beginning it is differnt from what is put there and catches attention from all
neat concept to have detachable rolling case has ample storage space would have given this a # star rating had there been a more feminine looking bag with all the same storage space it is nice to have the option of a rolling laptop case for a woman i would definitely recommend to a friend or buy again
leather construction very high quality easy to remove from the rolling cart portion however , on my second trip , the <unk> extension stuck in less than full extension i took the unit apart , and <unk> the up/down handle many times now it seems ok , but will it last overall , a very good product , worth the money
i use the bag as a college professor and use it all over the campus bag is elegant and roomy , with padding and room for my # `` computer i love the bag roller mechanism does not add significant weight when i need to carry the <unk> up and down stairs
i purchased this mcklein leather bag to replace my # dollar <unk> rollaway i had bought earlier this year for my dj gear i absolutely love the pockets and amount of space it has i 'm able to fit my # `` hp laptop -lrb- dv # dx -rrb- in the laptop compartment with no extra room to spare but it still fits nice the other compartment holds my # `` netbook , large notepad , microphone , and still has room for stuff like a bottle of water , <unk> , shaving cream , etc . the power cables for each laptop are kept in the # zip up compartments back where the handle base is these zippers are also used to separate the bag from the rollaway unit which is another great feature , but i do n't see the need to remove the bag the wheels are super smooth , and most importantly the bag feels sturdy and stands up straight when fully loaded with stuff , which my other bag tended to lean forward when fully loaded the front # pockets are great for cell phone and keys and has plenty of room as well as pen holders it says it 's `` genuine <unk> leather `` if you are wondering about leather quality it 's not fine leather jacket quality but it 's great for # bucks
this bag looks great , but the functionality of it is pretty bad for one reason the bag squeaks when you walk with it for a bag that costs nearly $ # , having it squeak each and every step is unacceptable i am going to reach out to them to ask for a refund as well
the bag is much heavier than i expected it to be the interior pockets are too narrow and too few to keep me truly organized they are also not deep enough for my purposes an additional handle at top of bag would be a useful addition to the design
seriously annoying that there is not a handle in addition to the strap . for a quick secure grab the strap just does n't do . fun bag , but needs the added functionality
i purchased one of these bags and , upon receipt , immediately noticed that the strap was not the <unk> color shown in the photos , but beige i thought this was an error and had amazon send me a new one while i sent the first one back well , the second one i received had the exact same beige strap it 's not that it was ugly , but the beige color just did n't go with the rest of the bag -lrb- which has nothing else beige on it anywhere at all -rrb- if it was a <unk> bag i could understand , as beige and brown go together , but beige with black , white and lime green no ! aside from this , i still rated the bag three stars just having an <unk> strap does n't make the bag bad it 's a really nice and well-built item , and the pop of color inside is awesome , but i just could n't get past that beige strap that looked exactly like a seatbelt from a car with beige interior
love this bag wanted something more colorful and stylish than the generic black bags i wanted a messenger type bag and the design is very nice i have a # `` macbook pro and it fits fine with cords and my ipad i would love to have a handle on the top of the bag so i could lift it a little easier than with the strap the inside velcro with elastic to hold the laptop is a little short but i think it would n't move around much even if i did n't use the velcro strap also caught this on sale for $ # which is cheaper than any bag of this quality overall i 'm very pleased
i purchased this messenger bag on january # , # for my bf 's macbook pro although my bf 's macbook pro was # `` it fitted into the bag the durability and the wonderful , sexy unbelievable the only complain i have that it looks kinda big oh well its for # `` mac so it suppose to look big bt this one is pretty awesome
love this bag ! ! ! ! this is the best computer laptop bag i purchased it for my # inch macbook pro - i have plastic cover on it and it fits in perfectly in the back well padded slot sleek , good looking and very functional great space for a notebook , adapter or whatever you will not be disappointed
the # `` macbook pro fits absolutely perfect into this bag . and while the bag looks small and slender , it can house a lot of stuff besides just the laptop and charger it has several padded pockets -lrb- some zip -rrb- and a mesh seperator to keep things organized i only have one complaint : the front flap is a little more <unk> looking that the smooth looking picture it does n't look `` bad `` but not as clean looking as the product picture as far as # `` computer bags go , this one is definitely the most stylish , while also being well made , bag on the market
i bought this bag purely for its looks the <unk> is very tricky and not convenient most of the time , i just fold it over and let the velcro close it great for laptops i just wish the cool-looking lock was more
i was glad to find this alternative to the more `` business `` looking laptop messenger style bags i was a bit concerned that the low price and the <unk> style might be all fluff and it would n't have enough padding ... but it is well padded and a sturdy bag i carry a # `` macbook pro in it , along with the power <unk> , and a wacom pen tablet there is still plenty of room for more stuff like a compact external drive -lrb- my older <unk> fits , but seems like it is too bulky the lacie is fine tho . the shoulder strap seems fine without any padding , the strap & velcro closure seems fine too -lrb- tho the normal double buckle most bags have is probably more secure -rrb- oh , and the green may vary from the product photo mine is more green overall , a nice bag if you want something `` cooler `` looking that actually protects your gear
i bought this bag not knowing what to expect but i was pleasantly surprised this bag is excellent the color is rich and nice and its quite trendy i 'm very happy that i bought this bag
