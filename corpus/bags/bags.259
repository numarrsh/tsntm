this is a great small aid for your tablet it will accommodate small keyboard , mouse and power supply in separate top pocket and you 'll still have plenty of space for small bits and pieces the only drawback is that it has some unpleasant resin type of smell which , i hope , will fade way with time

i purchased this case for my samsung # . # tablet and it is wonderful , especially the price it is a little big for the tablet but that 's ok , i would rather have it a little loose inside than tight a lot of extra zippered pockets too , quality is tops

what a great bag for a chromebook at a super low price i do n't travel all that much but this bag will offer the protection i need for my acer chromebook you ca n't go wrong with this bag the only improvement i would offer is to have a dedicated pouch for a mouse and the charger on each end of the bag the bag is pretty slim design i suppose i could carry the charger in a checked bag i do n't like the <unk> on laptops and prefer to use a regular mouse i could leave the mouse home if push came to shove all in all , a very nice bag at a very low price you will not be disappointed with this bag
since when did amazon start making bags this bag is so cool that you wo n't believe its price it is great in quality and big enough to hold an ipad or even a bigger notebook , but small enough to fit inside your backpack without much <unk> it has another pocket where you can keep the charger , etc . i use it when i have to carry my ipad around the college but do n't wan na carry the heavy backpack everywhere
this case provides room for the asus netbook and its ac power supply a little bulgy , but no big deal if it 's necessary to take your netbook out when going through airport security , it is extremely simple to do so i 'm happy with it
you will not find another case of this quality in this price range i am currently using this case with my acer ao # h netbook and it fits perfectly it is a snug and semi loose fit for my # . # `` acer netbook the zippers are very thick and seem durable i can see this case lasting a very long time the front pocket is very roomy , i was able to fit the netbook 's charger and a wireless mouse and there seems to be more room for other things another thing i like about this case is the handles because it makes carrying around much easier overall i would say it is a great value and gets the job done
i have the acase pure genuine hand made leather case folio and it still fits inside there 's plenty of room inside there too i 'm sure most cases that fit the ipad can remain on while placing in this bag the construction is durable , feels like this would be sold at the apple store for $ # - $
bought two of these for christmas as gifts to go along with the two new laptops that went in them these are really good laptop briefcases i have one that i paid twice as much for , right here on amazon , simply because these were sold out these are better so if you need a good laptop case , this b it ca n't beat it , price wise , or functionality

i bought this case for my husband 's nook tablet i am very happy with it i was concerned after reading what a few people said , but so far i have found it is nice and will also hold my kindle # nd gen that is in a case with cord we like the idea of being able to put them both in a case that has a handle to carry them if anything goes wrong with this case , i will write back about it i especially like having the orange inside and the nice padding i also like the outside zipper pocket which is quite roomy this is really a good case , and i do n't think you would go wrong ordering it especially for the price

i searched all over for a case to keep my # & # # ; & keyboard together all i could find were cases with a built in keyboard why would the tablet maker sell the combo without having a case you could get for them this one is economical & perfect
this is a nice pouch and i carry my surface rt , surface pro # , and a dell venue pro # in it i 'll replace that dell with a surface mini when it comes out i 'm hooked on surface did i say i like surface computers yet
i was worried about whether this case would hold my tablet pc + all of the accessories i have , but it does i have a tablet with a keyboard , an <unk> cable , a power cord , wireless <unk> <unk> -lrb- old school , <unk> -rrb- , external hard drive + usb cable , and usb expander i fit all of that into this bag , and i still have room to spare for folded papers or my phone , keys , etc . it 's nice having the external pocket to separate things as well i would n't risk dropping my computer while in this , as it is only neoprene , but i feel confident carrying it around or putting it in my backpack
<unk> bag is just what i was looking for to carry my ipad in <unk> lightweight the ipad fits right inside it a very good carry bag at very affordable price i highly recommend this bag
i have an i pad # th generation and this bag fits if perfectly it even have outside pocket to store your charger the quality is great would recommend this product
first the price ca n't be beat then add the quality and space and the choice is a no <unk> i use the case to carry my acer chrombook c # and a small kindle usually i also include my amazon wireless mouse as i am not use to the acer touch pad . addition , i could add more padding if i believe that is needed i was hesitant to order the case as i had concerns the acer chrombook might be a very tight fit but know amazon 's great return <unk> , i went ahead and ordered the # . # inch case the acer fits and even has a little wiggle room - great buy
this was a home run amazon you did it it 's a <unk> <unk> it would have been a grand slam if it had had a small pocket -lrb- inside or outside -rrb- for a stylus but that 's almost like saying , `` i love my <unk> , i just wish it were in my favorite color ``
i have the zagg <unk> case on my ipad # and it still fits in this case with room to spare i am also able to store the ipad cable in the side pocket , and even tuck my iphone into the side pocket - fits nicely initially purchased # , but like this so well , have purchased more for other devices highly recommended !
i am very impressed with this bag fits my laptop perfectly and has lots of storage for my accessories plus papers , pens , magazines , etc . nice high quality and tough material easily <unk> with bags costing # , # or more times as much
works great to carry my kindle # & # # ; hdx , charger , even my phone in the other zipper compartment not a sung fit , but my kindle is in a case , so this works great as a way to carry it and some accessories
i kept losing or misplacing my stylus , so i wanted a bag for protection and papers too this has a side pocket that is handy for that , and the padding protects the ipad nicely slightly large , but works great at a great value
i bought this bag for my new ipad and it works great even with the larger than normal cover i have on my ipad it fits in the bag easily the bag is n't <unk> big so it 's easy to pack around i love the smaller zip pocket on the front i keep my cables and connectors in there the material seems to be good quality and i trust that my ipad will be safe when i have it in the bag it also has some heavy duty zippers that are easy to zip open and the price was unbeatable
i thought that was a very good product i liked how the strap was adjustable and can fit to any size i use this product daily and have found that amazonbasics makes it very accessible to access my laptop there is three pockets which can old many things that give you all the room you need to bring on the go i would highly recommend buying this item , not only is it a great laptop case but it it also an amazing price
item is exactly what they say or show it to be it is simple yet meets a wide variety of needs can be taken into many different settings and not be embarrassed or overly flashy the perfect bag for me to tote my tablet wherever i go
this is the perfect case for my hp chromebook and it is very well made for the price , this is absolutely the best case i have ever bought for a laptop
even with the flip cover/protector over the ipad there was plenty of room in the bag the outside zipper is a bonus i put my <unk> stand in it and it still has plenty of room for other things to go in it love this bag
it 's relatively thin and plush this is by no means a shock absorber , but you should n't be in the market for a neoprene sleeve if you 're looking for drop protection it 's nice and spacious my surface pro fits with plenty of space left over in the main compartment in fact , it 's big enough to fit a # `` ultrabook -lrb- which are only a little thicker than the surface pro -rrb- the front pocket lays relatively flat when not in use , but can hold a surprising amount enough for all my accessories i thought the handles were a bit excessive , but i found myself actually using them from time to time i 'm pleasantly surprised i definitely recommend this product to anyone looking for a <unk> bag
this case is just want i needed for my tablet and all its accessories -lrb- charging cords , headset , portable battery -rrb- it 's padded really well and the front pocket is great for storing all the extras very lightweight but put together nicely
ipad with the <unk> case fits great together the price for both just over $ # . # is n't bad either ordered both on a friday and had them on monday the amazonbasics netbook bag has good handles and the zippers work well and easy free # day shipping not bad either
as we only occasionally carry our ipad # to another location , i 'm very pleased with this case as it does the job we have a casecrown bold standby case -lrb- black -rrb- for ipad # which is outstanding , and even with the thicker dimensions , it fits the netbook bag very well this is an outstanding value for a basic carrying bag
this is the perfect travel bag for your ipad and chromebook my husband and i travel occasionally and were looking for a handy bag that we could carry our tablets in , along with their charging cords , etc . this really was exactly what we were looking for - ca n't recommend highly enough perfect for car or plane travel
i was shocked when i opened the <unk> packaging ... this is a serious , high-quality case the inside is bright orange to make checking to see if you left anything in there much easier , and the handles are quite comfy a big , beefy zipper with large <unk> , and a small side pocket to hold the charging cube not one thread is loose or unraveled on it and the neoprene , i would guess it 's # mil at least , it 's pretty hefty the amazon basics ipad leather folio -lrb- http / / www.amazon.com/gp/product/b # <unk> # <unk> -rrb- fits in it perfectly
this is the perfect ipad # / # / # case you can carry your ipad in soft and secure comfort and it has a front pocket that will hold the power cord , pens and even a small notepad got ta love it , especially at the price one thing that would make it perfect is if the edges were hardened just a bit
nice , compact , with a front zipper pocket that will hold the charger , a pair of reading glasses , & a small notebook if needed we use it on driving trips & flying trips
i love it great price for a good product i use it all the time when i travel the extra pocket is great for storing my ipad charger and my phone charger

this case <unk> the finest quality in both fit and durability while providing protection for my chromebook during travel in addition , the pricing is competitive and less than traditional brand names the storage pockets for accessories is more than adequate thank you amazonbasics for making this product available and enhancing my chromebook travel experience
i purchased the # . # carrying case for my ipad # it holds not only my ipad but my extra cords and mini speakers as well it is a sturdy <unk> case that will last in my opinion for the life of my ipad
i needed <unk> that my grandson could carry his nabi xd in and keep the charging unit away from the nabi . this fits the bill perfectly thank you amazon for having this
this bag could n't be better in my opinion , it 's perfectly small but with enough pocket space to hold my wall charger , mouse pad , mouse , and miscellaneous cables i had another laptop bag before this one but the zippers broke and they ran all around the case so it became useless ; thankfully this bag has zippers that only run along the top that 's my favorite part about this bag honestly , even if the zipper eventually does break it wo n't be necessary to replace
i bought this case hoping that it would have enough room to store my ipad that already has a gumdrop drop tech case on it the gumdrop has awesome protection , but i wanted this travel bag to protect my ipad from dust and dirt when i take it to work in the <unk> now anytime it is not in use i can store it in the bag and it is not collecting dust the ipad with the gumdrop fits comfortably in the amazon bag with a little room to spare the bag seems well built for the price and a definite value it works perfectly for my needs
great sturdy well made netbook bag holds up well love the side pocket for cords etc . fits well in day <unk> <unk> travel slim lines and not bulky love the handles use all the time and take everywhere handles and zipper have not broken great value for the money bought one for friend
my daughter uses this to carry her ipad for school fits the ipad while in a case or with the keyboard case too great room , protection and extra pockets highly recommend for the best protection
this case was much less expensive for the quality than anything available at stores the laptop fits well , and there is plenty of room in the outside pouch for the power brick and cord and a mouse i would n't hesitate to purchase another one
just the perfect companion to my asus eee pc # . # `` netbook it fits in perfectly without having to stretch the sides there is an inch of space left on top i have enough room for a small # page notebook and couple of pens outside pocket fits the power cord , earbud headphones the bag is sleek , sturdy and shall last forever the neoprene is surprisingly thick and cushy than some other bags i like the <unk> zippers with cute amazon logo price - no one can beat it !
it 's hard to knock any points off this bag , because it 's simple , yet solid , and that 's that it is what it is , and it does it well my only style point is that i wish the & # # ; amazon basics & # # ; logo was n't so prominent i 'm a frugal shopper , but i do n't like <unk> it
this is a neat little bag the materials and workmanship are first rate , it looks good , and it 's very reasonably priced fits a samsung n # . # `` netbook like a glove it 's small like a sleeve , but with the added convenience of handles and a place to stow the power adapter and cord i 'm very pleased with it
i bought this bag for my # rd gen ipad , which fits perfectly , even with a logitech keyboard/cover installed in addition , it holds my user 's manual and the charging cords for the ipad and keyboard , the latter items in the front pocket the bag is very well made , nicely padded , and extremely inexpensive nothing else even comes close in view of the amazon logos on the zipper pulls , i assume it was made by amazon nice work , <unk> , a terrific bargain
i needed a case that could hold more than my nook hd + and this is perfect daytimer , documents , glasses , charger , headphones all fit in here this is a great product , just perfect
these thing are great i got # for our tablets -lrb- # galaxy # 's and # ipad # -rrb- it not only holds my ipad , but the bluetooth keyboard as well it seems very sturdy and the zipper is heavy gauge and operates smoothly i think i 'll get two more for spares in case <unk> selling them . # bucks <unk> ! you ca n't beat it
replaced a targus bag that worked very well , but was just too bulky for carrying around all the time i just needed a smaller bag to carry the essentials i need for work and this bag rocks two heavy duty zipper pulls on the main section and one on the front side pocket make for a really secure feel the neoprene is soft and seems to be pretty rugged so far , though i do n't take it mountain climbing or deep sea diving with me -lrb- i do n't even take me on those kinds of trips -rrb- i think it will last a good while before it starts falling apart -lrb- if it does ...
ordered two of these cases and was very happy when i opened the box they are very nice and were inexpensive nice material , not hard like the old cases came <unk> very well in two different boxes inside and one outside box very nice ! ! !
ms surface rt with touch cover fits very nicely inside front pouch more than roomy holding the rt 's power transformer , my eyeglasses and # . # & # # ; usb hard drive the case is not too thick or too thin in my opinion just perfect
perfect case for the small acer laptop that i purchased from amazon it has enough pockets for the adapter , my wi-fi , a usb mouse , and flash drives included shoulder strap makes it easy to carry , especially when travelling i already recommended it to a friend who has a tablet
what 's left to say it 's well made and it fits my acer netbook like a glove the thick neoprene provides shock protection and the zippers are quality i 've seen much lower quality for sale in high-end stores at triple the price
as i buy more and more amazonbasics products , the more i appreciate the product line as with everything else that i 've bought from them , it 's simple , well made , cheap and interesting while this case is very simple , it does have the feeling of being high quality with good construction and materials , a heavy duty zipper with rubberized tabs and a bright orange lining to make it interesting i purchased mine to hold my dell venue # pro , and while it is a bit large for such a small tablet , it does have lots of room for accessories if i had to nitpick , i would suggest having the front pocket separated to give more separated storage , but for a small tablet , one pocket works for most times i carry it
needed a case for my mom 's netbook this was the lowest price available the padding -lrb- neoprene ? -rrb- is the same as the other name brands such as <unk> the zipper pulls are easy to use and are a soft plastic material the zippers work fine and the handles are padded shipping was fast and the frustration free packaging really is frustration free could n't be more happy with the purchase
i have an asus <unk> prime and is fits perfectly and with room to spare people were commenting of the orange inside but come on , are you going to have black cords on a black background , it orange for a reason and i dig it the outside pocket is great for usb cords , mouse and other knick <unk> but it better not be to bulky or it might looks akward other than that , the product does what it is intended to be , a sleeve for your # inch tablet , netbook or whatever you want to fit in it thanks amazon !
i bought this for my acer aspire one notebook that is ... yes ... an # . # & # # ; notebook then i get my roocase & # # ; # . # inch & # # ; notebook and it way too big ... at least an inch too large in both width and height not sure if its the acer aspire one of this notebook sleeve that is misleading in its size but can say for sure if you are buying this for an acer aspire one this is not the right
i got this case for my acer chromebook i guess you get what you pay for the plastic `` memory card `` holder sewn inside the main pocket is on the slant it is # `` below the seam on one side , to over # `` on the other side also , the case was filled with pieces of fabric and pieces of thread the only thing good about this case , is it fits my chromebook
case works great for my samsung ativ # t smart pc does n't offer much protection from falls but works great against scuffs and scratches and the front zipper pocket is clutch for power cord and accessories highly recommend it
does exactly what it 's supposed to do - protect the unit from scratches and little bumps fits nicely in my briefcase along with files , power supply and similar items it 's synthetic , so open it up and let it air out overnight to <unk> the odor
this sleeve is very well made and i am using it for my samsung ativ it is a little bigger in width , but its not a big deal especially when its really hard to find a good sleeve for the samsung
i was looking for a water-resistant case for my work macbook air this also has a zippered compartment for my charging cord i put this in a bigger bag and do not worry about the safety of my computer i would recommend this product
i purchased this on a gamble it would fit the asus vivobook and it definately does overall it is a well made netbook sleeve/case i purchased it for my asus vivobook # . # & # # ; and could n't be happier the netbook fits inside snugly with an inner flap to hold it firmly in place inside it also has two plastic pockets for cards or usb drives externally the zippered pocket is deal breaker in comparison to the caselogic version the external pocket easily fits the power adaptor and other items so i have what i wanted , an all in one sleeve/case to carry my vivobook at an economical price
the `` netbook case `` is a full # inch larger than advertised it 's not made for acer aspire one -lrb- if that 's what you 're thinking -rrb- it 's too big flimsy to act as good protection for that netbook the only thing this has over the caselogic case is a pocket also - the case pictured is not the one they will send you
this case is really too big for a netbook ; it defeats the purpose it would be more useful if it had a carrying strap , preferably cross-body otherwise , it 's perfectly acceptable and as advertised
i am actually using this for an old model bamboo fun tablet and it fits perfectly the pockets also holds the pen and the wires without sticking out , too much , so it 's a great cover to carry around in your backpack without worrying about incidents inside it
purchased several acer # . # `` netbooks and this sleeves fit the bill to hold the netbook and the charger it has another slip pocket that might hold some papers , a few disks or some misc . items , but just seems like it would add bulk it if you already have the netbook and charger in there all i wanted is something to protect the laptop and carry the charger if i wanted something to carry everything i had with me , i would get a backpack to fit it all in overall , it works for me
lots of pocket room for netbook charger and/or accessories a little bit to much room for the # . # inch netbook not a real snug fit , but that is not something i 'm too concerned with overall great quality product
i purchased this neoprene case to protect <unk> bamboo capture pen and touch tablet -lrb- <unk> # -rrb- and it is an excellent fit there is a little extra room , but i am confident that it will provide adequate protection also , i love the little side case for the cord , extra nibs , and the stylus
i love that this case has a pocket on the front for storing my tablet accesories and my hot spot there are also # little pockets on the inside that are perfect for <unk> my charging cord &
the zipper sewing came loose near the <unk> of the bag from weight stress , and ripped open i sewed it by hand with <unk> fishing line , all along both edges , for reinforcement so what happened the zipper itself pulled away from the fabric it was attached to the material is n't made to last , their warranty <unk> the workmanship is alright , it just ca n't handle the stress of real travel maybe it 's good for school books , but i do n't know that a student would be any easier on this bag than i was
i bought this bag during my last deployment which was # months ago so as i was packing and getting ready for my current deployment , the zipper to the main compartment thread came lose then one of the zippers popped out i emailed everki a week ago and still awaiting a response it was a # star bag until this point it carried everything from an asus gaming laptop , macbook <unk> , ipad , ipod , books , adapters , water bottle , and even a change of clothes with no problem
ok , ignore all the reviews of people who just bought the backpack a week ago and they like it to be honest , so did i. i 've owned this bag for just under a year and it 's already given up on be the threading on the main compartment 's zipper came completely loose , and now i have a # & # # ; section where i cant close the zipper . $ # down the toilet there is n't even a warranty if you want a real backpack , look elsewhere and before i am <unk> of treating it roughly , the only place i bring it with me is to school with # books fact that it can hardly withstand that is pathetic save your money
