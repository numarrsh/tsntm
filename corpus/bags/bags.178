bought this for my daughters mac computer and it fits perfect a very well made product she loves it . i also bought the carry bag that matches the sleeve would recommend this product
i love this case it 's got extra padding to protect my computer and it 's a perfect snug fit for my # `` macbook pro laptop it 's a great value and i would recommend it to anyone looking for a durable but light weigh case
i loved the look of this bag attractive contrast , nice feel to the surface fabric however , after using about a month -lrb- # weeks at most -rrb- , the interior of bag began to rip along the seam my # inch new macbook was stored and transported for the short time in this bag . disappointed but maybe placing the power cord inside with the bag was a bad move
i was so happy when got this bag , it was so <unk> and my laptop fit well but i used it only for several months due to its bad quality the stitches <unk> i used it with straps over the shoulder mostly and i put there only my laptop and the charger ! no other heavy things so , i am dissapointed :
i 'll start with i hardly ever review things unless i love it , hate it or want to warn this is to warn i really liked this bag so i bought one , the # st one ripped within # weeks hoping it was just that one , i bought a second one and now a day after the return window <unk> - it rips . it 's always tearing along the seams in a fraying way so it is irreparable i am so annoyed because it was great before . . perfect size , holds everything etc . ... too bad i hope they would make a better product but i guess you get what you pay for
so the case is pretty and seems durable only thing is , it is a little tight i have a lenovo # in and the charger is pretty bulky so i sort of have to stuff <unk> in and then it does n't seem like there 's much room for anything else it 's a good case , i just think i 'm going to have to have a separate bag for notebook or anything if i need it
i bought this bag and also a case logic uns- # -inch laptop/mac book air sleeve -lrb- tannin -rrb- but i thought i would use this bag more since it had a shoulder strap after using for a week or two , the bag began to rip and fray , i assumed it just could n't handle the weight and gravity i used the case logic bag more since this bag no longer had any
i bought it for my granddaughter and she was happy with it -- it was not her first choice , but it was the only one that she liked that her pad would fit into properly
i like the pattern i like the amount of padding and protection this offers sometimes i use this by itself , and other times i put it in my backpack i 'm just disappointed that the handle is already starting to fray and pull apart
i really am happy with my purchase , it perfectly <unk> my little macbook with enough room in the front zipper pocket for my cord and headphones i really love this bag it 's great for me to carry around my campus without having to lug around anything too heavy from class to class
i love this thing it has pockets on the front and back , enough space to have a notebook and place the charger in the back perfect fit for my laptop
the black laptop bag fits my # `` hp laptop with a little space left but im fine with that it is a great bag because you can hide the handles if you dont them and a strap if you want to wear it as a bag there are two zipper compartments where you can store your mouse and cords and anything else which is great it feels nice and is very durable . great bag overall ! ! !
i have been very happy with the laptop sleeve i purchased from you i am actually using it for my ipad and it is just what i needed quality of the product is excellent , provides plenty of space for all my accessory needs and it is really attractive
average quality base on the bargain price make good protection on my laptop with some feminine design custom fit my laptop and still have a little space for charger or extra battery carrying
this is a great bag it has pockets on both sides of the bags for cords , etc . the handles are perfect for carrying it by itself , but the long strap is a good length i am very impressed with it and really love it
every review is the same complaint i thought of buying this from you , but no i do n't want the hassle . do n't <unk> people with the wrong items its not right amazon should <unk> you , and pull your selling <unk> <unk>
i thought i would give it a try and see if i got what was pictured since it seemed that most were saying they ordered something without a zipper and the pic they saw did not have a zipper so it looked to me as though the seller had changed the picture well i still got one with a zipper and it is black but the front design looks nothing like this picture i 'm afraid to send it back , i may never see my money again or a another sleeve i do love hello kitty , just wish it was the cute one that i ordered
this product is not what i had believed to order , but entirely different i am deeply disappointed with the false advertisement of this product and do not recommend anyone buy it unless they would like to be ripped off
the sleeve case i received does n't look like the one in the image it does not have a flap that has the words `` hello kitty `` written on it instead it has a zipper that goes around the perimeter of the top half of the item other than that , everything else is the same
dont buy this for # -inch tabs - these tabs literally swims inside i am not using it for this purpose at all also there is not even one compartment in this cover which makes it unusable for any other purpose
it was an okay product but really needs an outside pockets to store the charger and such ; otherwise it fit my new # inch tablet just fine an offers some protection during transport and/or storage the <unk> ship was good an no issues with the overall case
i like this case because it is cheap and simple , is comfortable and i can keep several things in it it is a little big for my <unk> <unk> # `` but i got used to it
i have a # `` tablet and there is still over an inch or more of room from the corner i thought being the description states # inch cover , it would fit like a glove as another poster wrote but , for $ # bucks it is what it is i will use it until i find something better that holds the tablet in place so you can use it right from the case after purchasing this case , i am now clear on what i do want if you are looking for something to protect it while in your briefcase or purse , this does the job just know you can not really use it from the case sleeve there is nothing to tie it down , no pockets or anything like that
i use the case when transporting my <unk> element tablet to and from school it keeps is clean and safe without breaking the bank i use it over a hard case on the tablet and it fits perfectly but it would still be fine without it it does look a little cheap , but then in all fairness it was n't at all expensive so i ca n't <unk> about it too much
i have a kindle fire hd # & # # ; and the case is way to big for it alone i have a case for the the kindle itself which makes it take up a little extra room the thing i like most about this case is that i can store my charger in it along with the kindle it was also pretty cheap which was a plus
i have a generic # inch tablet my problem with that is finding a case to fit the <unk> sleeve is perfect for my needs i did n't expect an exact fit , so i 'm happy with what i got it 's a little wide for my tablet but the length is just right it has dual zippers that go up the top and side of the sleeve , so we can charge our tablets inside the sleeve , no matter which side the cord attaches the neoprene provides plenty of cushioning for impact protection i am satisfied with my purchase
i bought this sleeve to use with my le pan ii tablet it fits it perfectly , like a glove with little space to spare i wish it had more padding or been a little more rigid , but for that price you ca n't really complain
i was looking for an inexpensive sleeve for my new kindle fire # . # , and found this it is well constructed , perfect size for the # . # & # # ; fire , and is n't made out of tissue paper i am very pleased , and especially for the <unk> price
looking for a little extra protection for my vizio tablet for the price and quality this was just what i was looking for the tablet fits in just fine even with the hard cover attached the zipper works well and has a good feel <unk> on time i highly recommend it
this thing is great for my # inch samsung tablet fits the tablet and it 's leather case like a glove , and feels wonderful in your hands a tablet in this cover alone is n't a wise idea ; too soft and supple to protect from bumps or drops but combine this cover with a proper hard case , and you 've got yourself a great <unk> protector for your device i 'm absolutely loving this thing ; i ca n't recommend it enough
this is a great little case for the money to hold your gadgets do n't buy this case for the kindle fire , your <unk> will swim in this case the case is a generous # inches and the kindle fire is # `` or so that being said this is an excellent case for general purposes it is now my preferred case for all of my chargers , cables , usb cables , <unk> cords , <unk> <unk> and various gadget accessories i am definitely getting my money 's worth with this little work horse of a case
i bought this for my very first mac it is really nice for getting the computer from point a to point b because you can use the handles like a briefcase , or attach the shoulder strap and carry it with all your other things the material is good quality , and the lining on the inside is really nice my only complaint about the product is that the padding seems to be lacking i like that the case is n't large or bulky , but i would sacrifice space for some additional padding to protect my computer
nice styling , spiffy color duo and sturdy , lightweight construction incase manufactures some of the best bags for macs my old incase sleeve lasted over # years here 's to another # years
i would say this is probably the best bag i have ever bought . love that it has pouches in the front so that i can put the charger and superdrive in front for my retina macbook pro
fits my # & # # ; macbook pro perfectly it is very sleek but still gives good protection i put the laptop in this sleeve before putting it in my backpack and it works great
i did a lot of searching before landing on this page i 'm glad i did n't give up sooner i could n't be happier with this bag i do n't need a <unk> assorted pockets , cavernous compartments or fancy materials this bag is small and simple with room for your laptop , mouse , power cord , hard drive and maybe a pen and notepad -- that 's it the carrying handles hide away and the strap is removable , offering you the greatest flexibility of carrying options the strap has a nice pad and a the whole thing feels solid the contrasting color accents are a nice touch , and i feel confident that the laptop compartment will keep my expensive metal <unk> safe a dry this bag -lrb- really more of a bag than a sleeve , i 'd say -rrb- will be as thin or bulky as what you put inside it that 's the beauty of it
i purchased this bag in march # when it arrived , i fell in love , the size was perfect for my needs that warm fuzzy feeling did n't last long within # months the front zipper broke i decided to keep the bag and deal with a broken zipper now i 've used the bag just over # months and the handles are falling apart what a piece of trash for $ # , i expected to get a few years worth of use guess i was wrong
i wanted this bag to work so bad ! it is the perfect size for traveling when you do n't want to carry a separate purse and laptop bag the organization was great , pockets were fantastic , fit cords and files with tons of room leftover the strap on the back to hook onto your suitcase was an added bonus but on my very first trip , the silver grommets fell off the pocket tabs on both front pockets i am returning and due to the other reviews that comment on this same poor manufactured quality , i will be searching for another bag instead of replacing
only # months of daily use and the straps are already frayed and close to breaking too bad because it 's otherwise a great bag - well designed , attractive , and useful too expensive for just # months of use
this bag arrived with a hole on the inside of the lining the seller took off $ # for the damage i think it should have been more considering how much i paid for the bag otherwise it is a good bag and protected my laptop during a big move
the bag itself is heavy once you start adding a laptop , charger , etc . expect to be carrying around a lot of weight it 's large and roomy , so it 's easy to stuff lots of stuff into it
i ordered this , sight unseen , and it exceeded my expectations it has the look of a well made bag that will last year 's it easily holds my # inch laptop , a few one inch binders , and all of the items i normally carry in my purse there is a pocket for everything it 's too big to carry in place of my normal purse but it 's perfect for when i need to travel with my laptop and leave my purse at home
i bought this for a friend who got her first laptop and has <unk> of business related items that she needs to carry regularly it holds everything from the power cords to her file folders , checkbook , etc . if it came in leather it would be superb and i would buy one for my next laptop
really nice bag for the money , love the size and how much it fits all the little things you need to carry with you it has tons of room and space to store things and tuck away on the inside it also can hold two laptops if you really need it to the weight of the laptop is a bit heavy with nothing in it , but that is to be expected and it 's really a bother the only downfall that this bag has is that the straps do n't have a grip to it , so the bag falls off your shoulder sometimes , which is annoying oh , i love the color and the bag is made so well i expect it to last for at least a few years ! ! if you need to carry an office around with you , this bag will suite you just fine
wow , what a great bag i can hold everything in this bag plus my # . # `` laptop it is a great bag with lots of compartments as well as a great lining fabric that wo n't tear up quickly at all bag is very sharp looking with great quality . / / / / it 's been # months since i purchased this bag and i love it even more it has lots of compartments to put all my different things in order love love love this bag
i am very unhappy with this product my # in macbook air would n't even go into the sleeve half way then it was nearly impossible for me to get it -lsb- pissed me off even more -rsb- i would have returned it but there 's a damn restocking fee and i feel it would very foolish of me to return something , not get all of my money back , and have nothing to show for it so currently the sleeve sits on my office desk and i guess i 'll find a purpose for it do n't waste your money or time
made from high quality leather nice internal material as well its a bit too wide for the prime , but its still a secure fit it will not fit with the keyboard dock great for use around the house
this is a nice leather sleeve it has soft cushioning inside that protects your laptop well i did n't really care for the company logo being stamped in the corner of the leather , otherwise great buy
this is a great product for a great price i originally bought one that was vinyl because i was not aware that they had a leather one available the only thing i would change would be the closure , the vinyl one had a magnetic closure , and this leather one has a tab that tucks under a half loop not a deal breaker though for those that are concerned about the other reviewer 's complaint of the prominent logo on the corner , i do n't quite understand the issue with it the letters are no more than # `` and are stamped into the leather much more classy than a tag sewn in , does n't bother me at all because it blends right in it is a tight squeeze to get my mac in , however , the leather is loosening up and i would rather it be a bit snug than loose and sloppy great product , i would highly recommend
pros : this is a very comfortable laptop case it is made of high quality leather my macbook fits perfectly and is not loose in side it has a layer of hard cushion installed inside to prevent it from bending i preferred it to other products because of the quality it has , protection it provides and the way it looks -lrb- very classy and professional -rrb- cons : initially it was very tight , however now its smoother and i can place and remove my laptop easier
great item , i am very happy with it it protects my book and looks elegant it was pretty hard to take the book out of it at the beginning , but now it 's all right
this is me second purchase from <unk> case the first one was for my surface pro and they are same design , material , etc . and as same as my first review : its envelope design is only good for macbook air any other laptops with depth corner design -lrb- even having the same thickness with macbook air -rrb- will find little bit difficult to <unk> in the case other than that , or even that , they are the best leather case on the market , at least until now
this is a really nice product for the price it seems very well made and i could not be happier with the purchase thank you amazon for providing such great items at a wow price try and find something like this in the apple store for this price it 's not gon na happen
this is the perfect case for the # `` macbook air it fits like a glove , it 's high quality leather , and it 's not # $ when the macbook is in it , it looks like a binder of papers i trick people a lot by handing it to them and telling them that i have some forms for them to sign it protects the macbook well , especially when it 's in my backpack as i transit through airports great product , and great price
my newer macbook air fits perfectly in this sleeve - it offers a significant amount of protection and it looks like it costs a whole lot more than it does
when i discovered this product , i thought it was too good to be true a leather sleeve for macbook air for this price is <unk> not only is it leather , but it is very high quality , and has a very soft interior it was tight at first , but it 's leather , so it fits perfectly over time update - march # , # still perfect condition , protecting my macbook air as it always has
this is a very nice mac air sleeve it 's a good quality and i love carrying my mac with it i 'm sure my mac is well protected and stylish using this sleeve
this is the worst fitting sleeve i have ever seen it says designed specifically for the alienware m # x i do not see how this is possible i felt like i was forcing my laptop into this tiny case the corners were poking out and stretching the case this looked like it was doing more harm then good please see the pictures i returned this sleeve and bought the incase # `` neoprene sleeve case the laptop fits amazingly
this neoprene sleeve fits the computer really well in fact if the sleeve were a # mm larger length and width , it would be perfect neoprene is a great choice of material for a laptop sleeve but at airport security or any time i take my pc out to use as a laptop , the size of this sleeve makes getting the pc back into the sleeve a cumbersome process and does take noticeable time this is not an optimal situation when there are people <unk> , all rushed and stressed , waiting for a busy line to move really like the dell pc , not <unk> with the sleeve sold for the pc overall time rating : # . # stars for inconvenience and wasted time
the m # x fits snuggly in here but the design has a pretty big flaw the charger for this lap top is rather large and though the charger does fit in the side pocket , it just barely fits and is a struggle to get it in and out i would recommend this case for protection purposes but this may not be the best option for a travel case or something that will be used on the
this is nice to carry my m # x i wish the side pocket was bigger to fit the charger in easier but it is possible to get the charge and mouse in if you really work at it
anybody considering purchasing this should realize that it is a & # # ; sleeve & # # ; and not a & # # ; case & # # ; you are not going to store more than just the notebook computer itself and maybe your mobile device like an iphone or blackberry it is great protection for when the computer is not in use or packed in a suitcase with that said it is a fantastic sleeve it looks great and provides excellent protection for my m # x when i take it out of the house for brief use -lrb- without a power supply -rrb- or when i put it away at night
i purchased this sleeve just to protect my new laptop it so far is a perfect fit i use it just to go inside my carry on case for traveling might need something a bit more sturdy for everyday use the extra pocket with zipper has enough room to carry an external hard drive , some cables and memory sticks all in all what i use it for is perfect
it 's super pretty , but boy was it smelly -- offgassing ? scary but mainly , the zipper broke the first time i used it i do n't know if mine was particularly <unk> made , or that 's how they are , but this is not a durable sleeve
its very flimsy and wo n't stand up straight if you were to try to slide it in the colors arent as pretty as i would have hoped the eye spots are more orange and less purple as they appear in the picture above and the peacock is a very faded blue but its cool and different if you wondering whether to buy this i would suggest just waiting and buying one at the store where you can see it and feel it the case has a a strong rubbery smell that i hope goes away soon overall its kinda pretty and kinda cheap but it gets the job done and looks very different from what i have seen out there
this case is decent , but it definitely has its drawbacks it 's very flimsy and not high quality - if you 're looking for a nice plush cushiony sleeve , do n't bother with this one there were also a bunch of loose threads that got stuck on the zipper when i first opened it ; not a huge deal , but not something you expect from a brand new product i bought it for my # `` macbook pro , and it does n't fit perfectly -lrb- it 's a little tight on the sides , and too long the other way -rrb- also , i do n't think the colors are as bright as they look on the computer - the green in the background barely shows up at all that being said , it 's an alright case and it gets the job done it 's a good price , and it arrived a few days early
i saw this product and was a but wary of the colors finding them to be very dark and dull in the picture i read a few reviews and they stated the colors were much brighter and vibrant in person this is very much not the case the colors are exactly like the picture , very dull and dark it 's still a beautiful pattern and my macbook air fits perfectly in it
this case is really cool . the colors are vibrant and the peacock design is very beautiful it fits my # inch macbook pro very snugly i pretty much have to stretch the case to make it fit , but it does fit love this case , very simple
fits perfectly on my macbook with or without a hard case on it the design is okay i do n't know why i thought it would look better its cute though
i ordered this for my sister , for christmas she owns a macbook air although the cover is a little too big , it 's an advantage for putting the charger inside with it i received this really quick on standard shipping , so i 'm happy about that the product itself is pretty , the little <unk> on the peacock come out with a <unk> effect and look like little eyes the color is nice , overall i 'm satisfied with the product image although , there is a smell that comes along with it ... but that 's not too much of a bothersome for me great gift , great price
i love this case i never take my laptop anywhere without it it is big enough to hold some papers alongside the computer -lrb- i have a white # & # # ; macbook and it zips well to top it off , the design is super cute
i absolutely love this computer case i bought it for my macbook pro # . # inches it 's creative , colorful , and fits perfectly i got the item on time and was completely satisfied with what i received i would n't recommend this to anyone else simply because i want it all to myself ! :
fits great for my # inch macbook pro this wo n't prevent dents from a fall , but it keeps it safe from scratches , dust and other junk in my bag and it 's awesome looking
it 's as beautiful as it looks in the picture the fabric is super soft and stretchy , which allows me to put a notebook or two in there in addition to my laptop
just a great item , it arrived fast and its very pretty , snugs my computer nicely and protects it very well , i 've has it for a year and it still looks new
i bought this case for my # `` dell # z it 's a tight squeeze , but that was totally expected i 'm sure it would fit a # `` perfectly i had no problem with the coloring of the peacock it is bright and beautiful it is flimsier than the $ # cases you find in a store , but as long as you are just looking for protection for anything other than a fall it is perfect it also came promptly in the mail very happy with it
bought this for an hp laptop , for simple coverage and protection from <unk> straight out of the package , appeared just i thought it would however , in trying to zip my laptop up , noticed a hole between the zipper and fabric about # inches long dissapointed that first product bought for this laptop was n't even in one piece returned , and wo n't be buying another one
i very carefully measured my laptop according to the interior dimensions listed here , my laptop should have fit into this sleeve it did n't aside from that annoyance , the sleeve was fine it appeared reasonably well made , and the smell was not unbearable i returned it due to the size issue , but i assume the faint smell would dissipate in a few days
awesome cover case came just how i expected it and totally protects my computer i probably would have order a smaller case next time because this one is just a tad too big for my computer , but it protects it so well i love it
the only thing that would have been nice is for it to have a little more room for me to put a charger i guess thats why people get actual computer bags really , thats not even that big of a deal , i just put it in my purse whenever i need it overall , like i said , simple but good
it is absolutely perfect i feel like my mac laptop is well protected when i have to travel with it perfect opening so i have no trouble getting my laptop in and out
the velcro strips to fasten the case are not lined up correctly and for some reason my case did not come with the red string to provide extra closing i do not feel that my laptop would be safe if it happened to be picked up incorrectly ; the laptop would most definitely slide out
if u only need a casing to merely cover your stuff , then this might work for u i , however , needed something with better protection like a cushion or padding for secure travel case logic qns- # . # -inch eva molded laptop / macbook air / pro retina display sleeve -lrb- black -rrb- is way better than this
the object is as it appears in pictures it 's nice and the quality is not bad the problem is that there is printed in the leather `` macbook air `` i did n't know that and i did n't like it so if you do n't want to use it for a mac you might not like it . it fits really large for the # macbook
you ca n't beat the price of this cover -lrb- less than $ # -rrb- and super sleek i like the minimalist design which goes perfectly with my macbook air i have had this for about two days and the red string has already fallen off <unk> it back on the strings are useless in general since they do not stay in place once you secure them and do not need to be used since there is velcro closure on the envelope you pretty much get what you paid for with this
i love this sleeve my laptop fits perfectly inside i purchased this product because i was looking for a gender neutral sleeve for my laptop and both my fianc & eacute ; and i are happy with this purchase
the product has a bit of a fuzzy interior to protect the laptop ; i got the black one , and i already got many compliments on it i 've only used it for two days so i do n't know how long it will last , but it seems very durable it fits my macbookpro -lrb- # `` -rrb- perfectly neither i nor the friends who complimented the case could tell that it was faux leather the string on the back is kind of useless since it 's too much work to use and there 's already a velcro closure , but i suppose it 's nice for the style statement
this item is cool as it is but pulling your laptop out of this bag really <unk> people they love it and an instant conversation starter it fits my macbook pro # . # perfectly pro 's : - easy <unk> velcro just in case you forget to use the cable <unk> business <unk> 's : - <unk> the price , purchase # because you will not want to go without #
i use this with my sony vaio # & # # ; tab i am able to carry the tablet , my mifi and mouse and still have plenty of room love that it does n't look like a tablet is in it
this product is very classy , it fits my mac really well i am highly satisfied with the product . you could be carrying your macair with this case and others would have never thought you are carrying a computer around
bought this item in july and i always had it on my sofa or on my bed but still it managed to break on the corners within # months . do not recommend this
received my case as promised and arrived on time item was exactly as described in the listing case is hard and provides vent at the bottom to avoid over heating snaps on with ease i was a little disappointed in the keyboard cover -lrb- seems cheap -rrb- but it is cute and matches the case perfectly i gave # stars as i was n't concerned with the keyboard cover as much as i love the case protects my macbook pro !
it works great it does n't slide around like other kinds do i game on my laptop so it definitely gets a work out it also keeps food and dust from getting in the keys which had been a big problem living at college
the case although advertised for macbook air is too large for it it slides around in it it probably fits the pro and should be labeled as such it is a nice case just too large
not quite as slim as i was hoping for a macbook air , but certainly does the job quite thick and sturdy , well made i 've used their cases before for my previous macbook and never had any problems
this case is perfect for my macbook pro # ' eventhough it does say `` slim sleeve `` it still fits my macbook nice and snug in the case i even have a unibody plastic case which i use for my mac and even with that on , it fits fine in the case the only thing is that you probably can not fit anything else besides like paper in the case all the all , the case fits perfect and serves its purpose which is to protect my macbook overall very satisfied with my purchase
this case fits perfect on my macbook pro # , it is as in the picture and the texture is really soft with bright colors it arrived pretty fast i definitely recommend
the sleeve arrived on time and it was brand new -lrb- i was worried it would n't be -rrb- fits my # & # # ; macbook pro perfectly i 've had this for several months and i love it would strongly recommend if you 're looking for a neat look and good protection
i travel extensively while the size and weight are great on this bag , the straps gave out after three trips amazon took it back and i replaced with the crew # version which is heavier but better built
i purchased a swiss-made backpack at sam 's when i got home i read comments on several backpacks at amazon.com which made me to stop and <unk> if my sam 's back pack would be sufficient to meet my needs i ordered this travelpro and returned my swiss-made this travelpro will not hold many change of clothing the side bottle holder is for small bottles , but the zip pocket behind net will hold a larger bottle the shoulder straps are easy to loosen , just lift up on catch and the strap will loosen to tighten the strap put a finger in the ring at the end of the strap and pull i am flying this weekend and will test my backpack i will have my laptop , book , pills and five change of underwear and a pair of shorts and shirts .
