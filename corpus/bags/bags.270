this is a nice shoulder bag to carry your laptop computer in it is spacious and gives you plenty of areas to store laptop essentials and it is a great color
i ordered this case to use a few times a week to take my # inch hp laptop to school i had a similar one -lrb- white -rrb- , and the zipper broke on that one after a year i thought maybe it was because i used it frequently , but the same thing happened to this case , and it has n't even been # months i put my laptop in the case , and as i was zipping it up , the zipper literally fell off now i have a great case that looks like new , with no zipper , how worthless i really like the case itself , which is why i bought it again i will not be purchasing this case ever again
had this for about # months when the main zipper broke i will say that since my laptop has a large battery , it was a bit too big for the sleeve and likely put a lot of wear and tear on it would probably last much longer for a laptop that actually fits better than mine still use it without zipping it up
this arrived in # days -lrb- to <unk> -rrb- in my opinion the picture does n't match the color of the sleeve itself but if you search for what charcoal looks like that is what you 'll be getting all in all good buy for a sleeve
i rate this # stars because it has a nice snug fit and serves its purpose as a sleeve -lrb- despite the other poor reviews -rrb- this is not a laptop bag for extended travel i do not recommend trying to carry the charger with this product because it is a sleeve not a laptop bag i recommend this for light travel as a protective cover not as a complete travel bag it is easy to grip and not slippery and has a pocket to hold a few small accessories -lrb- charger will fit but too bulky _ bottom line _ yes , i would recommend this to friend looking for a light travel case to protect their laptop i would not recommend it to anyone looking to carry a bunch of accessories or for extended travel
when the product first arrived it looked small , but when i measured it the dimensions were as specified it fits snugly on my laptop and looks nice looks high quality enough to last for a while
i purchased one of these for my # inch hp laptop , and then i purchased this one because i liked the first one so much it has the perfect balance between cushion and bulkiness too much padding would make it take up too much room in my bag , but not enough padding would not protect my laptop from my day to day heavy use the front pouch is large enough to fit my laptop charger and travel mouse , or it 's also great for putting my tablet or a folder of documents
i purchased this bag on july # and here i am disappointed exactly # months later i was very happy with the size and the look of the bag it fits a lot of stuff , even my gym clothes and <unk> but the zipper broke two days ago this problem is huge because there are only three compartments in this bag - two narrow ones on the sides and one big one inside this means that everything i carry in the main compartment -lrb- which is pretty much everything -rrb- falls out fixing it would cost me as much as the new bag , so no point to bother at all
i bought this for my husband as a gift he wanted to have a small laptop bag for when we travel the zipper broke within two months we expected better quality from hp
after using the backpack for # semester , one of the zipper to the main compartment broke , and it will not close up properly although the <unk> from hp said that there is # year warranty for parts and <unk> , there is no one at hp customer service that can answer a question about their broken backpacks i spent hours on the phone with hp 's customer service , getting transferred from one department to the next , and yet nobody was able to tell me what they can do about their products that broke under warranty
i was really delighted by this product at first , but in less than a year two of the zipper heads have already come off and there are a couple holes in it this is with light , daily use
the seams holding the zipper are thin and tore open very soon with any load like in the picture only buy this for slim look to use with suit on occasion and very careful not for daily or typical use , only expect it to last # year with occasional use , cheap build <unk> there were multiple exposed threads
i bought this backpack for college since my camelbak was getting to be too bulky for campus travel after one month of use though , the zipper is starting to break on one side the rest of the material seems to work great , but there 's no point to use this when it flies wide open from a defective zipper
liked the bag itself , however both zippers broke within the first month of use if <unk> just planning a laptop and notepad it may be alright , but it likely wo n't hold up to much more than that
if you want something light with nothing else then this backpack is ok nothing inside apart from a pocket for laptop , that 's it ... no extras such as private pocket with zip outside pockets can take dc adapter , something skinny -lsb- -lsb- asin b # <unk> # hp ultra mobile backpack -rsb- , long , small only again very basic packpack
the top of the bag <unk> to you back which is great however it is highly and a little weird looking this bag is also small in width , deep in depth and <unk> i can carry alot of stuff and still look
i use every day ! it great and looks great to fairly big its made for a man the material wipes and cleans <unk> base is not reinforced so do n't sit in on <unk> and drag
perfect size for a laptop and a few misc items not convienent for school use , more of a work laptop side pockets are large `` skinny d shape `` there are only #
very nice backpack and not a high price you would not want to overload this pack as it may not last long but for moderate weights it should hold up well
this is a great bag for a great price it 's very comfortable , and protect the laptop well it does need more pockets i also use it for school and it is hard to fit my charger , pens , and mouse wit only a few pockets i have only a few text books and it fits them and my laptop perfectly
i ordered this laptop backpack to replace my standard issue dell messenger-style laptop bag while the dell bag worked fine , i found that my posture was pretty poor when i used it i wanted to get a backpack to help , but did n't want to a -rrb- break the bank , and ; b -rrb- get a over-sized bag with all lumbar support bells and whistles this one fit the bill while it 's a little light on the extra pocket space for gadgets and odds and ends -lrb- only reason i gave it # stars -rrb- , the backpack is solid in what it offers : function i love its low-profile look and that it does exactly what i need for a great price
the bag looks shiny in photos but the cloth used to make it is n't matching it it nice bag with lots of space in single cover there is a laptop section inside a bag and overall bag weight is too light
so i just wanted a think back pack because i do n't like the bulgy back packs and i thought this would be it i 'm a petite girl and this thing looks too big on my back it 's large and the top part comes pretty high on my neck anyway ... it was definitely not good for me , but i gave it to my boyfriend and it actually looked very nice on him and he really liked it
fits my hp g # . # `` computer perfectly in the dedicated compartment -lrb- which has a velcro tab that keeps the computer in place -rrb- there is plenty of extra room for other stuff in the other half of the bag it 's well padded and well constructed
if you want a backpack that is slim and trim , this is a quite nice one it 's durable , stylish and does n't have that huge pack look that a lot of computer backpacks have we stock this one at my company for <unk> laptops to users who take them home on occasion
the two pockets fit my cables and even a mouse but not much more than that the inside laptop slit holds my laptop and a thick book fine and also has room on the outside of that for anything else i need to fill it with like my charger and ps # controller its still very thin fully packed , not that you 'd wan na carry it with all that weight im happy with it
it 's exactly what i was looking for i really do n't need a lot of pockets to put my things , all i need was a slim light backpack to carry my mbp , adapter , keyboard and mouse and works and looks awesome it is really comfy indeed
it was bigger and of more quality that i expected great for caring around your laptop with ease and comfort the soft inner lining pads the laptop protecting it from dangerous falls i love it and i will encourage you to one if you need a bag for your pc
being a college student , a messenger bag is must for keeping your books , supplies , snacks , and most <unk> your notebook computer although i have used this bag with joy , this bag started a tear in the area between the belt and buckle good bag though
very nice and stylish little computer bag it has good / ample padding considering some that i 've seen has plenty of pockets of various sizes to hold components , some are even velcro bound for added protection my acer aspire v # fits very snugly in the padded compartment and i like the way it folds to provide room for a thinner or thicker laptop the only reason i did not give # stars was i do not know how durable product -lrb- stitching and handles -rrb- will be since i have only had for a week , but seems fairly well made
this bag is perfect for its intended use to carry a laptop , trackball and power supply everything has its own pocket including one the perfect size for the patriot memory <unk> boost xt -lrb- <unk> # <unk> -rrb- thumb drive that is configured for ready boost after removing the microsoft logo i like it even better
i ordered a # inch , they sent me one that was about # inches they had the <unk> to cover the # inch sticker with one that said # inches like if i would n't notice do n't waste your time or money no guarantees you get what you pay for
this cover was cute and sent in a timely manner , but the smell was terrible i brought it to school on the first day and people thought there were markers with a toxic smell in the room i tried to wash it and even air it out in the snow the smell just would n't go away it actually hurt my <unk> to be around i sent it back and got a refund the company was great about it just would n't buy another one
keeps laptop well , but not very practical the white color becomes dirty easily , but that 's the price you have to pay for the design also , adds volume to your laptop , so if you want to have it fit in a hand bag or something like that -lrb- girls -rrb- it will give you more trouble
this is a well-padded , tight-fitting sleeve that fits my # `` macbook pro perfectly it 's cute too , but looks a little cheaper than i expected somehow - maybe the white part is a bit more gray or something not a big deal though , it 's fine and does what i need it to and it has a butterfly on it so i 'm happy
this case is decent i expected the white portions to be white , but instead it looks a little darker , like it is dirty . as people mentioned , it does have a strong odor , but it does n't smell bad , it just smells like factory stuff , just a little strong air it out and you 'll be fine i 'm pleased with my order , because of the price and overall quality i recommend this case
i bought this as a christmas present for a friend and she loved it she had just gotten a macbook so it was perfect for her and its made of good material
i bought this for my dell # inch laptop it fits great the smell was strong at first , but will go away after about # weeks if you need a sleeve , i would recommend this one
this stylish little case i bought at amazon for a fraction of the cost it was listed elsewhere , was a great investment i is stylish and it protects my little ibook g # laptop well you 'll appreciate the economical , lightweight , peace of mind knowing your laptop is secure and protected from damage
this is really cute and looks nice on my laptop my only complaint is that the directions were printed on the paper you peel off the back and they were so faded i could n't even read them well so i just made the best of it , i mean it 's not rocket science . . but being that its made to fit various sizes of laptops you may have to cut it and adjust it but it 's nice , and worth it for the low price
i ordered this decal to <unk> my notebook i knew it would be too big but i used the left over decal on the space underneath the notebook keyboard now i love the look of my notebook
bought the matching bag along with it : -rrb- i love the fact that it has lines on the back of it that makes cutting it to fit just that much easier very good quality !
looks like the picture beautiful design , vivid colors , my laptop looks so pretty i love the extra pieces included to decorate the inside after cutting out the proper size for my laptop -lrb- # . # & # # ; -rrb- , i had enough scraps leftover to <unk> the inside too
tried to use this to carry my d # and a couple of lenses it 's so uncomfortable i could n't really walk around with it for longer than about # minutes before i could n't stand it anymore i 've used a cheap $ # amazon backpack that was more comfortable than the vanguard sling bag returned it for credit originally bought this through <unk> house , which says they have a simple return policy -- and its anything but simple it 's taking forever to get a credit from them ... they charge a restocking fee up to # % -lrb- ridiculous -rrb- ... and require an <unk> , tedious process for returns would n't buy anything else from this company
i bought this bag after much debate , i probably took a few weeks reading reviews and watching videos , i finally just decided to get this bad , and am pretty happy with it the price i believe to be a bit high , but over all i like this bag it suits my needs it is small so my camera and a average sized lens can fit , there is a pocket on the top perfect for the charger and anything you need to store so you do n't have to take a purse
i ended up returning this because the inside dimensions posted were a bit too small i have a nikon d # with the kit # lens and a nikon # lens , and the case was just a hair too small for the # lens if the case had been the size advertised , it would have fit with some room to spare that said , i liked the design
a little smaller than i had anticipated , but overall it seems like it should work well i am small person , so it 's not like i need a huge bag or anything i had a bit of a tough time fitting the camera -lrb- canon eos rebel t # -rrb- and the zoom lens in it , but i made it sort of work by taking out the velcro linings i would recommend this bag
this is good for day use , when carrying your slr , and one or two extra lenses not much pocket pace on the outside just enough for a lens cap or two , and a microfiber cloth definitely a bag for someone with a small or medium build any person who is larger build , will be better off purchasing the full backpack line , and not this sling bag
the bag is nice , a bit small but that 's what i needed handy compartment for stuff on top and good room for an slr with second lens in bottom section seems well made i was drawn to the orange but i also ordered the black color in case the orange was not what as shown that 's where i found out this vendor charges a # % restocking fee
the bag has room for all of the equipment i need to carry the padding is good and the lens cap storage pocket has room for two extra batteries as well i can fit the flash unit , charger , filters and other accessories in the top storage area the only complaint is the sony alpha # barely fits into the camera storage area the camera body protrudes slightly , which requires a little more effort when zipping the bag
great little day bag comfortable and easy to use , but just a hair on the small side -lrb- i.e . no place for a full sized flash -rrb- but otherwise i definitely recommend it
i like being able to access the side of the bag , but i am at a little bit of a loss for how to arrange my accessories properly we have a canon t # i , a nifty fifty , a zoom lens , and an external flash we 're able to sort of get them all in there , but it 's a tight squeeze and i feel like i 'm missing the ` right ' configuration of those velcro dividers i wish this bag were about # % bigger , but it does the job
i was worried based upon the price that this bag would be cheap and uncomfortable but it is neither of those things this bag is great , it fit my camera and # lenses perfectly along with some extras it is super easy to get to my camera quickly without removing the bag which i love i love that it does n't look like a camera bag and is very very comfortable i now carry this and slip my wallet into this so i do n't have to carry a purse at the same time
i really like this bag , but it falls just short of love likes : the compartment for the camera and equipment is adjustable , so i was able to create the perfect space for the equipment i regularly carry the single strap allows easy access to my camera i feel very safe pulling my camera out each time there is ample room for a phone , wallet and other sundry items and the lens cap holder is very convenient <unk> : the shoulder strap becomes uncomfortable after a day of carrying the bag and the velcro for the camera compartment after only a month is starting to show noticeable wear the concept is spectacular , but it falls just a bit short in construction and comfort
i am happy to receive the vanguard biin # bag few days earlier and in good condition this bag is big enough to carry my nikon d # with kit len , a nikon # <unk> # mm len , extra battery , remote control and two filter lens the size of the bag is small and nice to carry around when on the move i like it very much and glad to have bought it overall it is a good buy for me
super comfortable and fit my <unk> and large lens had to put flash attachment in different compartment love the side area i can hold water and the small side zip pockets for additional flash <unk> like that you can organize the inside the way you need to and there are two ways to to get into the main bag area wore at least # hours a day without complaint like the black a bit more discreet
the biin # is the perfect size for a # mm lens , another prime lens , and a dslr w / lens attached so glad i did n't go for the # , that would be way too small the # is already smaller than most book bags with the # i can fit the d # <unk> -lrb- you could easily fit a full frame with a # lens -rrb- , the # mm lens , and put some camera batteries in the prime lens compartment up top there is plenty of room for a camera cleaning kit and the battery charger i have no issues with water bottles falling out of the water bottle holder not once in my # . # week backpacking trek through europe . <unk> ; dr : get this bag it 's the best out there it 's discrete , not advertising you 're carrying a camera , and very compact but well organized
this case meets all my photography needs i am building up lenses , flash and extra battery grip and i think this will hold it all it is compact so i do n't feel like i am lugging a suitcase on my back and i can access my camera easily by spinning it to my front and opening the side to grab my camera i am also a sucker for the burnt orange too ; -
this is a comfy , inconspicuous backpack if you have an expensive camera the top compartment can hold an extra lens or flash , plus you can easily grab your camera without removing the backpack only weird part is training yourself to put the backpack over your left shoulder
i love this camera bag it is engineered so the camera is easy to put away and take out for photos i can also store extra lenses , etc .
just as described this is a backpack for a camera only small trips the upper pocket is big enough to hold your phone and snacks but that 's about it the rest is just for the camera accessories i really like it very convenient when using the side pocket
this bag is able to keep my nikon d # with a # mm lens attached , with a <unk> # mm and # mm lens as well as all my extra batteries , chargers , flash unit and memory cards
i really love this bag it 's compact yet it fits everything i need on a hike or while <unk> a new area i like that it does n't look like a camera bag and it 's comfortable to wear
this handled my camera beautifully nothing broke or scratched on my week long hawaii trip that was filled with hiking , <unk> , and lots of sight seeing the side zipper made it easy to whip out my camera at a moment 's notice and the top pouch was just big enough to hold basic necessities like phone , wallet , <unk> , or an extra lens it was comfortable to wear , even on the hikes and was easy to adjust if someone offered to carry it for me i ca n't wait to use this on my next trip
it is very light weight the side opening makes it very easy to access the camera it is quite compact but i usually carry my personal stuff in the upper compartment so i do n't need to carry my purse i definitely recommend it
the biin # is a really compact bag which is exactly what i wanted i am not a very large person and wanted a small bag to carry my camera ans # lenses in the field the bag is nicely put together and sturdy i would be a little happier if they had put a real pocket on the side instead of the mesh -lrb- like so many other reviewers , i will likely do a little after market mod my # main lenses fit equally well with either one on the camera and the other also in the lower compartment leaving the top compartment available for other goodies i shoot with a nikon d # and # mm and a micro nikkor # mm they are not tiny lenses but not true <unk> i am very happy with my purchase , but think that the biin # would have room for more and is probably not really that much larger overall
i received the laptop sleeve and was excited to open it i opened it and the smell hit me it was a chemical petroleum smell i thought well maybe if i left it out for a few days , all opened up , it would off gas and be ok five days later i sealed it back up in it 's packaging and shipped it back
this is a nice case , but it was too small for my hp elitebook # p -lrb- even though it was listed by the seller that the case would fit -rrb- next time i would order a size bigger
although the case is very cute and it arrived within a week , it does have the gasoline smell it took me about two months to get the smell off so besides that it 's great fits perfectly on my # & # # ; asus laptop
i am very happy with this item i have an hp # p # `` widescreen laptop and it does fit in this sleeve no problems at all it 's snug -lrb- but not difficult to close -rrb- , but that is what i wanted
this case is really nice quality , ca n't believe how reasonable the price was when i pulled it out of the package , i was a little worried it would be too small for my hp chromebook # , but it fits just beautifully not built for serious shock protection but it will keep dust , dirt and scratches off your laptop and provide a bit of extra cushioning inside a bag really like it
the picture is very deceiving the case is nowhere near that vibrant , but it 's still okay looking it 's made up of `` backpack `` type material and the inside is nice and soft so it protects my laptop well enough
i loved this product when it i first got it fits well over my # `` mac but i 've had it for about # months now , and the zippers are getting harder to zip first it was only one zipper , so i kept it off to one side and mainly used the other now , the second one is going i really want to love this product , but the zipper problem is becoming more and more of a problem every day . -rrb-
love the pattern and the material , but it is a little big on my dell notebook it does ' t have any kind of pockets so it has to go in a briefcase or purse that gives more protection
the design was great -lrb- pretty much as it looks like online -rrb- , but the first zipper broke off within a few minutes of opening the package and the second zipper broke off about two or three weeks later i had to attach a key chain to it so i could open it the case itself is really thin : it 's really only good for protecting for scratches inside a backpack however , it fit my mac # in perfectly with no shifting at all
i purchased this case for my wife to use for her new macbook -lrb- when they still made them -rrb- unfortunately , though its advertised that the case is for # `` screen computers , the case is too small my wife had to really force the zipper to get it closed , which eventually caused it to break off she likes the pattern on the case that she still uses the case and <unk> with it daily -lrb- really i think she 's just frugal and does n't want to buy a new case -rrb- be aware that this case , at least in our experience , may be a bit too small for some # `` laptops
bought this only based on its looks had it for just a little while when the zipper broke i do n't think the padding is thick enough to adequately protect a laptop
i really like this case it 's extremely lightweight & seems durable i was surprised when the case design included stripes on it however , i think it adds more style the inside seems to have met my expectations i would give # stars if the inside we 're even softer to <unk> myself the computer wo n't become scratched like fleece or foam by the way there is no external foam on this case , so it 's really a scratch protector more than a drop protector overall , expectations met , at least for the price
i use this for my acer chromebook to transport it when i travel easy to take the chromebook in and out through security checkpoint and keeps it protected i wish it had more padding and a separate pocket for the power cord , but other than that , it 's good
fits my macbook pro -lrb- # -rrb- snugly -lrb- with a clear speck cover -rrb- seems fairly durable and provides some water resistance my only complaint is that the color is a little off - it 's almost greenish instead of true beige
this is great , exactly what i needed it works and looks nice the only reason i am not giving it # stars is that the material feels a little cheap but as expected given the price i would recommend
this case was way cheaper than comparable macbook sleeves , and for the cost , it has held up pretty well the stitching is starting to come loose -lrb- no holes yet , though -rrb- , and although the case probably wo n't last the life of my mac , it will definitely last long enough to pay for itself also , it 's so pretty
the padding was thinner than i expected , but the size is perfect for my # `` mac book pro it fits nice and snug the design is prettier than the photos overall i love it
i have a # `` dell inspiron and this case did not fit it however , my mother was looking for a laptop case for her macbook pro and this fit just perfectly feels like a great , protective case wish it was sold in #
it looks exactly like it does on the computer screen as it does in person it is padded just enough so that it protects the laptop , but not too bulky the zip is also stylish and works well i think it is worth the money if all you need is a protective sleeve
the product came early which is always a good thing it fit my # inch macbook pro perfectly although i was worried there would n't be enough padding around the zipper , i was relieved to find a thin strip of fabric separating the computer and the zipper completely the design is exactly what is shown also i ca n't be more happy with it
i gave this # stars for functionality , # for appearance , so # was the <unk> honestly i feel like it is nicely padded and protects my computer well the zippers glide easily and never get stuck or snag on the fabric as for appearance the colors on here are so beautiful , which is part of what prompted me to buy it however upon receiving it the colors are full and washed out , the larger background color is thin -lrb- in addition to being dull -rrb- and the black fabric of the case shows through in person this is definitely bit as pretty but functionality wins over looks any day -lrb- which really , it 's not hideous , just less brilliant -rrb-
received it promptly and it fits my macbook pro # inch , easy to get it in and out of the case and zip up provides a little protection for my macbook when i have to carry it around in my large handbag well made although padding is thin butterfly design is ok , maybe will go for a more funky one next time
this is a great product and was delivered in a timely manner my new lap top fits perfectly it is made of a heavy material so i am not worried about any damage being done
this is so different from all the other case 's i have seen or used before i recently purchased a # inc , macbook pro and it fits perfect in it it protects on the inside and out everyone loves it just bc of the uniqueness i will buy over and over if i have too
i love this sleeve it 's super cute and the double zipper pulls let me just slip my computer in and out without even having to take the sleeve out of my bag if i do n't want to
first for the pros the sleeve fits perfectly over my macbook pro # `` the design is nice and it seems to have adequate protection ... although i have a hello kitty sleeve that seems to have more cushion the zipper seems to be of good quality as well i like the wide mouth of the opening ... so ease of getting the laptop in and out is great ... and it feels snug inside as well ... so it wo n't just fall out the color is a little darker than the one pictured here also ... these are all minor ... but it has an interesting smell right out of the packaging and i 'm waiting to see if the smell goes away after some time overall it 's a great sleeve for a great price i would recommend this to my friends
i bought the red sleeve and it is so cute it 's a snug fit , which is important my macbook pro # does have a speck cover on it and it still fits into this sleeve there are also fabric pieces to protect your mac from the zipper
i was very disappointed when i received the bag it is not brown at all the strap is very brown , and the bag is obviously black there are a few leather patches in the bottom corners of the bag that are brown looks nothing like the picture :
it is very nice looking , but not very good quality -lrb- it looks like it has a fairly good quality though -rrb- it ca n't hold something as heavy as a # inch super thin laptop i only used it for probably like # or # weeks , just carrying my laptop around and the fabric inside of the bag already start to tear , the handles are also seem to come off soon seriously , i wo n't recommend it to anyone
i bought this laptop bag may # , # and i use it for my laptop only in december # , the lining started ripping and it has become worse very poor quality you get what you pay for
love the functionality of this with the extra pockets and divider inside however the nylon material did not stand up well to any tension lining of the pockets , handles and inside divider have all torn in less than a year and now i am looking for a new one hope i can find one with similar features but more durable material
when this came it was to big for my i pad i did not note the size therefore it was my fault i had to return it the return process was so easy thank you amazon
my daughter needed a bag for church and this is perfect it holds everything she wants to carry and does n't get bulky the fabric is easy to wipe down and she loves the pattern
this bag is super cute and a great size with functional pockets i am a little worried about how it will hold up with my daily use as some of the interior seams are starting to wear after just a
