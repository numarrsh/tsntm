the case fits perfectly well , great color choices accidentally spilled fruit juice on it and it was easy to clean and did not lose its shape costs # of the price of apple cases , great value for quality
after buying an hp # . # inch ultrabook , i wanted a simple case to keep it safe from dust , scratches , and dings i wanted something that offered an additional pocket for the charger , a portable hard drive or any other accessories this case is perfect there 's ample room for the computer without it being too snug or too tight the outside pocket offers plenty of room for anything i need to put in there i like the blue color as well it 's a simple case that seems well made it 's exactly what i was looking for
the case is snug and protects my new ultrabook and the pocket doe accommodate the small mouse and power cord i can slide it into a tote bag bag easily it was a bonus when i saw there were also some handles inside i wo n't use those that often , but they are nice to have
this case is very portable with a <unk> sorta thing on the inside to help carry it the extra pocket is amazing i can fit my phone charger , my macbook charger , and my mouse inside of it <unk> a good <unk> <unk> metal on the inside holding the straps might scratch you 're <unk> but for me it has n't . :
this case is perfect for my # & # # ; retina macbook pro it 's well padded on the inside and has just a little extra room allowing the laptop to breath and not be forced into the corners of the case the front pocket is useful and can store more than just the computer charger i 've had no issues with zippers getting stuck and will agree with another reviewer who said the case smelled strongly -lrb- of plastic ? -rrb- when it arrived , though after a couple days it goes away i think this is a great case for the price -- it does everything it 's expected to and looks nice do n't question buying this if you want it
i was looking for a case that would be easy to travel with and would protect my computer without being too bulky i also wanted a case that had a spot for my charger this filled all my requirements and i love the color could n't be happier with my new case
i needed something that i could put my macbook in and carry with me in my camera backpack -- this works perfectly and the handles help when i just need to carry the macbook
it has a soft interior , and a fairly soft exterior it offers good protection , nothing crazy like that hard plastic stuff that exists but it 's good enough for normal use to put in a backpack or whatever the pocket in front does indeed fit a mouse as pictured . . and whatever other small things <unk> got around it does stick out though when you add a mouse and a charger . . not the prettiest thing ever when you do that ... but it is <unk>
i was reading the reviews of this product and some said it was thinner than they thought it would be , so i was n't that excited for it when it came , it 's actually a lot better i love the extra pocket and the color it even came three days earlier
love the color and glad i finally have something to use to protect my laptop when i travel also purchased the hard case in blue and both fit in perfectly i like that this has a front pocket to carry cords and other items
ipearl knows exactly what is necessary to protect macbookpro i love this sleeve as there is enough room in the exterior pocket to hold cords as well as a few smaller items the fit is excellent , while not being so tight that it is impossible to remove your laptop ... this design is perfect it is efficient , lightweight , and does the job that you need it to do protects your macbook shipping and discount for ordering more than one item made the deal <unk>
the case was totally the wrong color it looks olive green in the picture , but it 's actually almost a neon green i was really disappointed when i saw the color ... however the inside is soooo soft , it makes up for the deceiving color super soft !
so i initially loved this sleeve - it 's cute , unique and the interior is soft but - i have had it for just a couple of months and the pull tab snapped right off this is with regular use , zipping it in and out once a day ca n't say it makes it worth the money to have it break so quickly
i 've had this case for just under a month and the white lining , felt lining on the inside , and zipper tabs are already dirty the case itself is also prone to getting dirty and scratches easily however , i do love the soft <unk> lining on the insides , though i do n't really know how useful it is it 's cute , but not the <unk> case i 've owned
i love <unk> and was very excited to get my product it arrived before the estimated delivery date i love how the interior is very soft and it fits my # . # & # # ; macbook pro perfectly even with the cover on however , i was very disappointed with the color it does not look like the picture at all it is more of a neon green i am not much of a neon fan other than the color , the quality and delivery is good
i love it fits my macbook -lrb- # & # # ; -rrb- like a glove very cute and great quality has an extra pocket at the front that fits little extras without adding too much bulk
loved that it was roomy enough to leave my small usb wireless mouse connector on my macbook while storing it in this case . the design itself is so cute and just as pictured received many compliments wherever i bought this love that it is not only a sleeve but a padded sleeve which is very important during transport perfect size , would def . buy more for as gifts
this is such a cute , well made case i bought it for my asus eee slate # . # inch tablet and it work perfect i can have my charger and any other
i love the sleeve great quality inside out the inside is a nice color of blue and very soft the outside is just as described great quality , feel and color
i liked this computer when i first bought it , but only after two months the hinge on the back snapped obviously poorly constructed for this money , you would expect the computer to hold up sony refused to fix under the manufacturer 's warranty save yourself the headache and buy something else
this is probably the best deal going from sony on an e series laptop the # inch # screen is crisp and bright the backlit keyboard is well executed and easy to type on i love the matt paint job , and while the screen is n't mat it 's at least low reflective the headphones are ok , i prefer my at m # s , but these will make good travel cans overall the machine is very snappy with the only real <unk> being the mechanical harddrive i replaced that with a # gb <unk> # a few hours after getting the machine though , so i do n't really have much to complain about there the only real downside is that you will spend a solid # or # hours downloading updates for all of the utilities and drivers installed sony does make it easy to do fortunately with a nice single application to do the heavy lifting , but it 's still a lot of download time
i 've only had this computer for about ten days but my initial <unk> is really positive i love the size and weight -lrb- my previous laptop was a # . # screen but this # inch does not feel too small . i love the backlit keyboard and that it is so smooth i , also , love the look of the keyboard with the white and red around the keys i love how the computer comes on within seconds of opening the cover i love that i hear zero fan noise -lrb- so different than my previous laptop . there 's so much i have n't had time to try but i can tell i am going to absolutely love this machine i looked at dozens and dozens others but am so happy i made this my choice and ca n't think of a single reason not to recommend it to others
loved the bag , it was beautiful and i would have given # stars but it did n't fit my lap top in the padded lap top compartment it was advertised to fit the # & # # ; size , which i guess it did if you did n't put it in the padded middle laptop pouch but that just did n't work for me so i returned it
this bag was exactly what i was looking for i can fit everything i need in this one bag instead of taking multiple bags into work it is very stylish and i have received numerous compliments on it i would recommend this bag to anyone who is searching for a laptop bag that is chic and sophisticated and yet very durable
the new york bag by graceship is simply amazing i no longer am loaded down with tons of bags , instead i fit everything nicely in to my new york bag since it is not only great for my laptop , it also has organizational compartments to carry all my essentials that would usually be in my purse it 's functional and fashionable new york is sleek and makes every outfit look great it 's durable and just the right size to carry on a daily basis it 's definitely a must whether your a student like myself or in the work place the new york bag is something i would recommend to everyone
thank god for this bag i love it ! my favorite color to wear is black , so i love that it is black and goes with everything i am a college student and it is great for school and for work it fits my laptop , plus my notebook and work items i am thrilled to no longer have to carry both a laptop case and a purse this bag is durable , easy to clean , and just the right size if you are looking for a bag that looks like a purse , but is great for work and/or school , i highly recommend the new york graceship bag
first , i would describe the color as black , not blue i absolutely love my new laptop bag i like that i now do not have to carry multiple bags around i carry alot of things in this bag including my heavy laptop and the bag still is very comfortable on my shoulder and holds its weight very well the bag itself is very lightweight and its super stylish in my conservative business professional setting i like that it is a good quality bag for a reasonable price i 'm confident that i will have it for a long time
was very happy at first , but then when i investigated the product further i realized it was already falling apart - right out of the box the material itself seems fine , but the problem is that the seems are not sewn together <unk> so each edge is falling apart asked for a refund or replacement and was told they would get back to me ... that was # weeks ago
i was looking for an affordable sleeve to put my macbook pro inside while i carried it around in my bag it fits fine , but the materials used feel really cheap the outside feels like a nylon sleeping bag -lrb- not good -rrb- and the inside is <unk> but very thin material i ended up spending a little more and getting something else
i think that the case was not as supportive of my mac book air as i had hoped it fit well but i was concerned that if i dropped it , there would n't be enough cushion i wound up buying something else
i was a little disappointed after receiving this case , especially after it was rated so highly the one pictured is definitely at least # shades darker than it really is in
i have a macbook pro # . # & # # ; i also have the rubber coated hard case on the outside with this case i can not get my laptop into the purple sleeve case i took off the rubber case and it still was snug it also looks a little cheaper than the picture , but i still like the look it might work better for the macbook air
this product seems to be good quality , yet thin and very snug fit my mac has a silicone protective covering on it , therefore it would not fit into the sleeve . : -rrb- great product for those choosing not to cover the mac with protection when in use
this case is a good value for the price and has a cute design , but is not as protective as other cases on the market there is a thin layer of material protecting the laptop but not a think layer of foam as some other cases have
it 's exactly as i expected ... serves its purpose but , i will probably purchase the neoprene zipper one it 's something cheap in this one 's appearance , but a cute , purple case that i could easily put in the washing machine ideal for someone who wants to be able to put it anywhere and not worry about getting it dirty ... this will be easy to clean
i bought this because my hard shell case was too heavy and i thought it was silly to have spent all this money on a super light computer only to weigh it down with a heavy case this definitely does the trick it is light weight and takes up minimal space it even does fit the hard shell case , but it is quite tight my reservations on this are that the velcro is not sewed well into the case , such that after using the case for a week half of the stitching connecting the velcro to the case had come undone it has n't come undone further -lrb- i have been using it for at least # months now -rrb- , but it is really annoying and definitely should n't happen
i chose this sleeve <unk> to protect the outer case against incidental scratches while carrying my laptop around in a bag it is perfect for this after a few weeks using it i have not noticed any wear and tear or weak seams the sealing flap is velcro so i 'm not sure how long this will last at the risk of <unk> slightly <unk> it might have been nice to have an additional fastening <unk> in summary , this is excellent if you just want a lightweight cover for everyday protection for your laptop
this case is n't all that attractive or interesting , but it fits my mac perfectly and protects it from scratches and bumps while i 'm traveling or carrying it around great for what i paid
i bought this sleeve to cover my # & # # ; macbook air it fits perfectly and will <unk> its job of protecting my mac from any light bumps however , this product is very thin more expensive sleeves offer better protection if you 're already careful with your bag , this sleeve will do the trick just do n't expect any intense protection from this thin , cheap sleeve
this seems a little thinner than i was expecting i would n't use it as the sole carrying case ; i use it mostly to protect from scratches as i carry it in my tote bag as well the color is really pretty though
case is true to color and fits a mac book air very well my only issue is that it has less padding then i hoped for while it protects from any cosmetic damage it would not do much in the case of a fall
this sleeve is n't <unk> as another reviewer has stated , it 's a generic # `` size , but it 's pretty close to the mbp retina size it 's a tad long , but otherwise , it 's not terribly loose when i first got it , i thought it was actually designed for the older model , and they just decided to market it for the new one , too it looks good it 's put together well i do n't think it will protect my laptop from a six foot fall , but that 's not why i got it i have a heavy case for travel and a messenger bag that i use to carry this and other items i mainly got it so it would n't get wet , scuffed up , and would slip easily in and out of my other bags job well done for a good price
this is a good sleeve has a nice snug fit and keeps the computer safe from scratches when being transported i would n't trust the padding to protect from drops it 's great if you are using it for school or work and throw it in a backpack or bag every day though
nice , snug , very attractive case for a # inch macbook air i bought this to provide a little extra padding to my laptop since my laptop bag is n't very well padded the case is very attractive and fits the laptop perfectly it is n't very thick , so you 'll want to use it in addition to some additional padding for rough travel
i like the color and style alot , but it does n't have the firmness -lrb- sturdiness -rrb- on the outside or cushion protection on the inside that i wanted however , i like this option for scratch protection better than buying a cheap plastic cover that snaps on it will protect good enough from scratches and inside my bag pocket , but not sure about banging it against something and having the cushion protection
this is n't a product i 'm proud to own , but it does what it 's supposed to it covers a retina # & # # ; macbook pro and has kept it scuff free while loose in my bag
purchased for a new owner of a mbp # and it fits snugly not <unk> tight but you can forget this sleeve if you plan on running any sort of snap-on case in conjunction
i bought this sleeve after reading through the comments as i have an macbook pro # & # # ; without retina it had been specified in several feedback posts that the sleeve was not made solely for the macbook with retina and more of an universal fit that being said i was confident buying as it is only $ # dollars when it arrived the first thing i was surprised about was the exterior fabric which is like a winter jacket however after i got past that i realized this case was a bargain at $ # as it was excellent quality also , i was extremely please with the fit of the sleeve when i put my a # macbook in it as it was snug with the perfect fit in summary : good deal , fit for a # , would recommend
it fits the apple macbook air well , and that 's all we needed it to do i 'd give it a # rating -- but that 's a bit much for a basic product that simply works as advertised
i bought it for my # inch macbook pro because the # inch one from this same line was too snug its not super sturdy but does the job very well for the price
the other reviews seem too harsh on the fit -lrb- or the manufacturer has changed the product -rrb- , it fits my macbook pro pretty well yes , there is a bit of wiggle room , it is not a ` snug ' fit , but i 'm sure everyone with the popular snap-on cases would complain if that were the case no , this will not protect against damage that much i just got it because it was incredibly cheap and will serve as a good inner sleeve for a bag that is n't designed to carry a computer i expected the material to feel like a <unk> , but it is more plastic-y , like a <unk> jacket i 'm not a big fan of the choice of <unk> to keep it closed neither of these really affect my rating , but they should be mentioned
this case was nice and cheap i like the look of it in person it is a little loose around my # & # # ; mbp , but not terrible it does not have the neoprene padding which i usually expect ; it is just the quilted padding i do n't think it would protect as well against dropping it on a hard surface , but it keeps it safe in my bag
the build quality and material are so good and durable it is a perfect fit for the # inch macair to the extent that if you use a hard shell for the macair it wo n't fit and this was my only problem as i use a shell
i wanted something with a little color , but not too bulky the case is a little thin -lrb- not much padding -rrb- , but the velcro is amazingly strong , so i was never worried about my laptop falling out i use mine to keep my laptop protected on flights its a good way to easily pick it out over the dozens of other black cases , while not having to worry about it being damaged for the price i paid , this is a great product
i love this case it is sleek and fits my macbook air perfectly it is like a cute sleeping bag for my computer it gets # stars instead of five because i wish it was better padded but it is a very nice case overall
this is a great looking case -lrb- a little brighter than the pics though -rrb- unfortunately it 's too small for my <unk> ultrabook -lrb- i know it does n't say it 's for ultrabooks , but based on the dimensions , i was hoping . just want to let you know that if you think this is the case for you , but have an ultrabook , you should look for something a little larger i wish it fit , i love the look of this
i have a case on the air , so it was tight for a little while , but then it stretched and now it 's good i wish it had more padding on the outside , personally , but either way it 's a good buy
fits the # & # # ; retina display macbook pro perfectly i like how it uses velcro instead of zippers -lrb- sometimes metal zippers will scratch the laptop on the inside -rrb- i wish it had a pouch for power adapters , but at the price you ca n't complain much
i read a few negative reviews about this not being snug enough for the macbook pro # & # # ; retina , but i think it fits perfectly soft interior and a fair amount of cushion i had recently purchased the caselogic <unk> # <unk> backpack and the laptop pocket was a little to big for my liking with this case it fits nice and snug it 's like they were made for each other right down to the stitching and color i highly recommend both items together
excellent case for the money i have a late # mbp , and it fits easily but does n't have room slide around at all i use it mostly inside a leather briefcase -lrb- without padding -rrb- , and it provides more than adequate protection i also find myself using it alone quite a bit , leaving my bag in my vehicle the case does n't seem to <unk> `` steal me ! `` like a naked mbp
this is actually a very very good laptop sleeve i bought it for my moms new macbook pro retina # & # # ; it fits like a glove -lrb- or should i say sleeve ? <unk> -rrb- , has plenty of padding for transporting it around the home or gently to and from another location the color and outside material with sewn pattern looks great and feels really comfortable to the touch this sleeve wo n't take hard abuse but will take light abuse well and looks awesome doing it
love this sleeve just the perfect cover for my macbook pro the color is <unk> and just the right amount of padding it reminds me of the jackets my dad used to wear
i love this product it protects my precious apple macbook air and is not bulky it fits nicely in my purse and is a very stylish color i highly recommend it
very nicely made , slim sleeve to put my macbook air in my backpack and it does n't get scuffed up from the other gear in my backpack i recommended it to a friend and he loves it too very nice product for the price
i ended up ordering a slightly larger case for my # & # # ; macbook and it 's perfect i can fit other documents , etc . in there with the laptop , i think the correct sized case would have been too small to add additional items the material is great too
the product is as advertised its thin , and is perfect for carrying my macbook air the padding does not offer much protection from impact , but it does prevent scratches it also makes a good pad to put the computer on as you are using it
i use this daily for my macbook air and transport it in my backpack its a good cushion but if you 're clumsy , its not quite enough to protect the computer from a fall if you 're careful like i am , its the only case you need looks nice and provides enough protection if you 're using another bag to carry it
this is a great sleeve i literally just received it in the mail the velcro on the flap is really strong the outside material is nice because it feels like it is water proof , like a windbreaker jacket the inside is a soft , very thin microfiber -lrb- it sort of feels like felt -rrb- my # . # inch macbook pro with retina fits perfectly inside the stitching and quality seem like they will last for some time the color is identical to the color shown in the picture overall , this is a great sleeve , and the product is exactly as described
when i first ordered this sleeve , i had questions of they quality due to the price it was being sold at but when my package arrived , i loved it my mid- # macbook pro # inch was nice , padded and snug not only that , for under # bucks , it is the most stylish sleeve out there
i 've gotten several compliments on the simple style of this sleeve it 's a basic sleeve that does a great job of protecting my mba on my way to/from work each day it 's not bulky and does n't let the computer get jostled around inside it feels like a quality material , and remains like new even after several months of daily use this is a sleeve - there is no extra room for chargers , flash drives , etc .
i bought this because it was actually made to fit the # inch retina display so glad i did not only am i happy with the design , it was only $ #
i use this with a kuzy plastic cover for the full backpack protection for campus traveling the macbook slides right in and slides right out , even with the kuzy case great cover , great protection
after i purchased my mac air # . # & # # ; , i purchased a shell to protect it from scratches , but the # & # # ; sleeve would not fit i purchased the # & # # ; , and the fit was perfect
this case was chosen by a professor for his new macbook and when he asked me to order it , he thought the price was a <unk> it was n't and he was very pleased when i told him so he was more pleased when the case arrived as it fit perfectly and was exactly what he needed
i just got a # & # # ; macbook pro retina display , and i really wanted a great case to protect it , since i haul it back and forth to work with me every day i 've been using this case for about two weeks now and i absolutely love it i bought a computer case on amazon in the past that i was n't very happy with , so i was very pleased when i experienced how well this one works it 's quilted and thick , giving your laptop the perfect amount of protection
the sleeve itself is nice and plushy plus the inside has a soft fabric lining so it wo n't scratch up your mac the purple color i would say was spot on to what i saw pictured , based on how my monitor <unk> it i would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a simple case to cuddle their mac
this is a great case to easily slip in your macbook air # & # # ; i like to store the computer inside for protection but do n't like to have a case that is attached after all , the whole reason i purchased an air was because it is light and thin to use
it wo n't save your computer from breaking down if it falls , but it definitely helps protecting it from scratches and mild bumps it fits my macbook air # & # # ; perfectly , even with its shell i would recommend it
i recently purchased a brand new ipad # and i have been searching for a purple colored sleeve to place it in when its in my backpack this sleeve fits perfectly and allows enough room for my ipad to fit even when it has its case on it , just for added protection great product , great color , and great protection you could n't ask for anything better
the case is perfect for my new macbook air it 's a snug fit but that is not an issue with me it gives it extra protection while in my backpack especially when i 'm walking in extreme <unk> temperatures the color is exactly as pictured and it 's very pretty
i 've been using this for a few months and it 's been working as well as i could have hoped it keeps my laptop cozy in my backpack and stays shut when i shut it it opens up easily and the inside is soft so it does n't damage the finish on my laptop the textured fabric is pleasant to behold at such a cheap price this is a handy little sleeve
exactly what i expected my # `` macbook pro retina fits perfectly into my tumi backpack inside this sleeve a side benefit is not having to take it out of the sleeve at airport security the sleeve is allowed through the detector
not a whole lot to say about this sleeve i bought it to go alone with my wife 's new macbook air the air fit in the sleeve perfectly there 's not a lot of padding , but i did n't expect there to be i mainly just wanted this sleeve to protect against scratches when the air was put into a bag , and it does not disappoint in that respect
this case is true to color and fits my macbook pro retina # & # # ; just right using it gives me confidence that i 'm neither denting or scratching the computer during my commute easy to open and slide in/out of the case
i love the color it does not protect from bumps , only from scratches , but i purchased it to put it in my carry on , which already has protection against bumps and the price is right
i was n't sure about this one when i read the reviews , but i bought it anyways given the price it 's been great i bought it in combination with this hard shell case b # <unk> # without the hard shell case on , a # `` retina macbook pro would probably be pretty loose , but the shell case adds a bit of extra thickness i 'm happy with the combination and still satisfied three months in
this black case is discrete and very well finished , and for the special offer price -lrb- us $ # -rrb- was a no brainer even for the regular price -lrb- us $ # -rrb- would be a good value and even with the case star rubberized case , the mb air fits in -lrb- tightly
i chose this case because it did n't have a design with a zipper i have noticed all my past cases have worn out in some way due to the zipper so far , this case is doing the job -- there is just enough wiggle room to put a few documents in the case with my computer -lrb- which is what i like -rrb-
this case is great for my # inch macbook air that has a hard case on it it fits nice and snug , which i like the padding seems adequate and it serves its purpose definitely worth the price
it looks great has a good amount of padding fit my # ' mac book air perfectly it is very light way and very easy carry around or put into my purse ps i have had this product for awhile and it holds up well i still love it and it still looks like new
this backpack really gets the job done it looks small from the outside , but you can really fit a lot inside my only complain is the zippers - i wish they were a little <unk> and went in both directions -lrb- ie two zippers coming together -rrb- update : less than a year later , the seam on the right strap opened and the padding disconnected from the backpack trying to figure out if there is a warrant - very disappointed
the top of the laptop is not well protected not much space left after you put a laptop and charger and cables in the bag good quality construction and lots of intelligent details
i 'm out of school and just need backpack for <unk> ed classes , and flights i can fit both my ipad and laptop in . very cute colors , very comfortable . great buy
i love my backpack the shoulder straps are super padded so they do n't hurt you seems to be very durable i carry about # pounds of books in it everyday an sign of wear yet
gift for my wife very good quality i really like swiss gear just wish it was n't made in china i will ok for more american made items hard to find
this is an expensive and quality built backpack it feels good , and is fairly sophisticated , but somehow it just does n't work for me the way it holds the laptop is n't just right for my laptop the size of the pocket behind the laptop compartment is n't quite enough , so i sent it back , and ended up with a much cheaper but better functional samsonite backpack for my needs if this one meets your needs you wo n't be disappointed with the quality
i really wanted to love this product - fabulous laptop protection and great construction it was just too big for my needs , and i ended up either packing it full which made it quite heavy , or <unk> its space super compartments for a road warrior who needs to bring binders , a big laptop , etc . i find i needed a backpack to carry on my devices and very little else
overall , great quality and although it was smaller then expected it hold almost everything i want to carry i have had many compliments on the look and style as it looks very professional
great quality and construction , only negative is the deep front pocket does not open wide enough to make the business card holders and small zip pockets <unk> basically everything is <unk> in each compartment , breaking one of them into two shorter pockets would keep small items from falling all the way to the bottom the small side pockets are perfect for quick access items -lrb- ear buds , phone charger ... -rrb-
i like this backpack lots of compartments and well made my only gripe is that it is missing a zipper pull i will need to get it replaced but this is a hassle hopefully this is the only problem that i will find
