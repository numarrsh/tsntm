fits # mac book pro # `` no problems , easy snap in install i baby my gear so this is a nice scratch resistant cover plus it has that matte look which i like
i bought this sleeve for my # . # laptop it does fit well and slides in easily , but it does not have a handle i had an incident where my laptop fell and the sleeve failed to protect my laptop it cracked the top lid of my laptop at a corner and the cover of the screen lid popped out , but i managed to pop it back in the sleeve even created a rip in the exact spot my laptop was damaged
received it damaged , tried to contact the company and they would n't do anything about it plus i did n't think this would protect my laptop is any sort of way , maybe other than dust
i was n't impressed with this sleeve while it fit my # . # inch hp dv # laptop decently width-wise , there were several extra inches of height that caused my laptop to slip around inside this sleeve is also very thin - it 's just the neoprene shell there is no additional padding or scratch protection in this sleeve it 's also fairly slippery i would n't trust myself to carry my laptop around in this sleeve much for fear of dropping it overall , it 's an ok sleeve if you just want something to slide in your <unk> for your notebook however , if you are looking for a snug fit , scratch protection , or extra padding , this sleeve may not be for you i ended up returning mine for the price , there are much better sleeves out there
amazon and their dealer processed the order in a timely fashion -- no complaints there functionally , this case logic sleeve works just fine to protect my laptop unlike previous case logic sleeves , this one feels stiff and `` cheaper . it seems not to be made of the same material
its cute in color and big enough for my laptop , just wish it had a handle . other than that , its stylist and great for my laptop . i am loving it
its good , but the case a bit bigger than my laptop which can get annoying i would recommend it , but if you want a tight one for your laptop , i would not go with
this is just what we were expecting we went to the company website to make sure the dimensions for our laptop were accurate we would highly recommended doing this to get the right fit it works perfect for my laptop i just wish the fabric was a little nicer , more canvas like ... small detail though
it 's a case that feels great and i was personally a little disappointed that my # . # in computer has so much wiggle room it might be because my laptop is more thin instead of thicker so that would n't be the fault of the case -lrb- hp dx - # # # # # -rrb- color is right and can get a little bulky when adding more than just the <unk> -lrb- doens ' t fit a charger well
my laptop is a # . # inch asus i bought this sleeve because of it 's size and color -lrb- love purple -rrb- the product is great , but my laptop moves in it it 's kind of big for my laptop not a snug fit
i was actually looking for a sleeve that would fit my # . # inch macbook pro a little more snug than this at least this was i can also fit my power cord into the sleeve i love the color , and i like the material because it 's not to soft and not too rough i can now put my laptop into this sleeve and place the sleeve into my # inch laptop bag for extra space and safety please make one exactly like this in baby blue
it is nicely padded not too much extra room , but i still like it its kind of difficult to get the charger and cord to fit along with it , but it does if you do n't mind a tight squeeze overall for the price i think it is good
it 's nice for the price and an online student as myself i would recommend it it 's very <unk> i just got to get use to a newer model computer
the color was great and it has held up perfectly with occasional use is n't the most padded , but it definitely more than gets the job done and looks <unk> and modern
i love the color , and they have several colors available for almost everyone 's taste i like the material as well i may just buy this in more colors myself
bought this for my daughters laptop and am completely satisfied great style , looks and rugged case , for the money best buy around would recommend this case to anyone who is in need of a new case
i bought this to protect the new toshiba laptop i bought and was n't sure because there are so many other cases available , but i 'm happy with my purchase my only real complaint is that i ca n't leave the micro usb mouse adapter in the laptop , otherwise it does n't fit in the sleeve beyond that , it 's fine
this case fit my sisters laptop perfectly she uses it to get her laptop from the dorm to class every day and then home on the weekends it 's held up well and the color is beautiful
i love my sleeve it 's pink and very attractive the quality of the sleeve is excellent and i know my hp computer is constantly protected , which is the number one thing for me i would highly recommend it
i purchased this sleeve to protect my macbook while in my messenger style bag . it is a little bit roomy for my macbook but otherwise a nice case for the price it is an excellent value
i absolutely love the sleeves , as so much easier then placing in the carrying case all the time just nice to have for keeping dust off and at the same time protecting your laptop
i own a # ' # `` asus laptop , a laptop sleeve was necessary since i noticed a few small scratches on it i bought the logic # `` case , it arrived on time and does it 's job
very well built and it protects the computer well i like the bright color because it does n't blend into the background and i 'm much less likely to overlook it when going out or when leaving wherever i 've gone with it
at almost half of other backpacks in this category this backpack is awesome zippers feel good , plenty of room , and efficient padding only gripes are not enough padding in earphone pocket , and the backpack itself is heavy
when ordering the product i thought it would be see-through , as it shows in the picture it is actually a very light blue matte case you can not see the apple through it at all , and the color is very different from the picture i was very dissatisfied with this product
i was so excited about getting a cover for my new laptop and this one did not fit it at all and made sure i ordered the correct measurements do n't buy it it 's a complete and total waste
this thing cracked to hell after only having it a couple weeks i 'm a college student who did n't ever even drop my computer just pieces would crack off taking it in and out of my back pack between classes very cute color , but poorly
this was a disappointment the corners began to chip off in six months the feet fell off in nine by ten the bottom kept falling off my computer i would not recommend
item is being returned even though the look and feel of the cover is nice , the description of the item is misleading if the item does n't fit the newest version of the macbook pro # `` then remove `` new `` from the description does not fit macbook pro with retina display !
i wont encourage anyone to buy this item because it doesnt fit onto my mac the description is totally misleading it doesnt worth to pay so much shipping fee as well i returned the case as so many problems going on with it but i didnt get the full refund back i sent many emails to ask about the refund problem but they never reply my email
yes - the color is beautiful , but all pros stop there i am gentle on my macbook and this case has chipped in every single corner and plastic continues to break off randomly i would not recommend to anyone , as i am now on amazon having to purchase a new case & # #
in all # corners , parts have chipped or fallen off my speck case lasted # years and it still is in great shape this case did n't even last # months . will not be buying this brand again
put # stars because when i just put a cover on my computer , the sides changes their color in yellowish it looks dirty i tried to wash it with a wet cloth , but it still there do n't like it , now looking for another cover , other brand and material i do n't recommend it
this case does the job of protecting my mac , but when it 's time to type with it on , the plastic sticks up a little and my wrist lands on it it kinda feels like a pinching and hurts after a while other than that , i like it very sturdy , pretty blue , too
i do n't really have a problem with it , it 's cute i just would say it does n't fit perfectly a little snug , maybe i 'm just challenged and ca n't get it on correctly , but i have trouble getting it to snap on on all sides
it was the perfect color and i love the texture it is easier to grip . the only down side is it did crack with in two months from me quickly dropping it in my
<unk> and hot blue is not the color of this product -lrb- those in fact and # different colors -rrb- the case is a pale turquoise , not what i thought i 'd be getting but it fits my laptop well and does it 's job , and it is a nice color the picture just does n't reflect the real color
i received my kuzy case # day earlier than expected and it was packaged carefully to protect the product the case snapped on my macbook pro with ease and my jelly keyboard cover looks awesome now when i type , it is very quiet this will work perfect for a library or coffee shop i recommend this product to anyone that loves their macbook and wants to protect it in style
i purchased this product after finding two dents on my macbook it definitely adds protection and keeps it from getting even more dented however , it definitely has some issues there are four felt circles on the bottom that keep it from sliding around a desk and they have fallen off within two months in addition , it gets dirty and it is difficult to get on/off however , i can not stress how much protection it provides for my laptop definitely a good investment
the color was a lot lighter than i expected it 's not as bright as i thought it would be but it does what its supposed to so i ca n't complain
the only complaint i have with this item is that it over heats the bottom of my mac if i keep it on but now i just use the top and only use the bottom when i am taking it somewhere where it could be scratched or get dirty also , it 's not shiny as the picture <unk> , very sleek to the touch i have a decal sticker on the lid and the case covers it up because it 's thick
i love the color and feel of this case however , i 've only has my new macbook for a month and i already notice some cracks in the case from tension was contemplating returning it , but it 's still doing what it 's supposed to
my daughter <unk> for this is close to ` tiffany ' blue it has already cracked but is otherwise ok it fits pretty good and looks really nice -lrb- overall -rrb- after one semester the price was really good it arrived quickly in perfect shape i would rate this a solid # of # on amazons scale it has served it 's purpose of protecting her apple laptop i would recommend this to anyone needing a protective lap top cover that loves ` tiffany ' blue
the color is true to the picture and the case fit great i 've had plastic hard cover cases in the past , but none have felt as durable as this one -lrb- which is not super thin , but not also not too thick -rrb- the rubberized texture really protects against my mac slipping off surfaces or falling out of my hands , as the plastic cases would sometimes do when i 'd pick it up i would definitely recommend this case
i am very pleased with this laptop cover it is a tiffany blue and has a soft texture it fits perfectly on my # `` macbook pro i would highly recommend this cover with the keyboard cover
got this for my daughter she loves it there is a rough edge where the plastic was n't cut cleanly , but that can be filed easily enough she loves the texture , color , everything great protection for the laptop too
i love this case this is my second case from kuzy the first one lasted me for about a year before finally cracking after dropping my laptop however , it protected my laptop which did n't have a scratch this one 's color is absolutely beautiful
i had some reservations after reading the reviews that left a neutral impression , but went ahead and took the chance and was pleasantly surprised this is a very nice cover fits very well and has a great finish -- not too slick and not too rubbery my daughter is very happy with it
the case just came in the mail a few minutes ago and i fell in love with the color as soon as i opened the box it 's more of a tiffany blue than a turquoise as stated a few times before which made me love it even more you can see the apple logo while the computer is on i also love the smooth texture of the case but it 's not as & # # ; hard & # # ; as some may want it to be , it 's not flimsy either
i bought this case to replace an old targus case that the zippers finally gave out on this case is super light weight , but a little on the small side compared to what i was used to my dell inspiron # m fits perfectly in the computer compartment i wanted the separate compartment for my ipad , but i keep it in it 's own case , so both do n't fit in the compartment all of the little compartments seem great , but most things do n't fit it has made be <unk> down the paper i carry with me , which is a good thing i have not used it at the airport yet , but that will be great not to have to take out the computer i would purchase this case again , but if they had a case with one more paper file compartment , that would be ideal
well made with many pockets i use this for my # & # # ; thinkpad . the bag fits the computer very well and offers good protection a seperate pocket for a small tablet -lrb- my # & # # ; fits well -rrb- is provided as well as room for accessories i would like a little more room for my small # -ring notebook the shoulder strap is comfortable and has some heavy-duty clips
i am enjoying this case it is very light , does n't have any accessories , it is just what it says it is i like the look and feel of it i 'm not overly confident of dropping my laptop in this case , i have another sleeve that i carry it in as well but over all , i have no complaints
while others have mentioned this is a well-padded case , there are some <unk> here that i 'd like to see addressed a new <unk> of this case this is not a # -inch notebook sleeve the description on it -lrb- when you receive it -rrb- says # -inch case , and my # `` sony vaio has far too much room on all sides this would not have been the case -lrb- pun intended -rrb- if it had been sized correctly it 's far too big for the average # `` laptop , so be aware while the sides are reasonably protective , the bottom of the case is not at all , so you need to be very careful putting the case down or you 'll damage your laptop the zippers are completely exposed on the inside of the case , and can scratch your laptop , quite easily in fact there should be some material preventing this from happening overall , not a horrible case , but i ca n't say i 'd recommend it to anyone , and especially not to people with # -inch laptops # stars out of #
this is an decent notebook sleeve it offers moderate protection to your laptop -- i 'd still be a bit reluctant to drop my computer , but for everyday stuff it 's great what surprised me most is the case is the styling is a bit <unk> for my tastes , which i did n't really get from the pictures some of the accents remind me more of something that belongs on a purse ultimately a computer purse was n't really what i was looking for ... but my wife loves it :
i think this case is amazing very plush and protective while still maintaining a sleek look the briefcase style may give it a slightly <unk> appearance that could potentially turn off teens , but the handle makes up for it with convenience unlike a regular sleeve , you can actually carry this around without having to toss it in a backpack my only cosmetic complaint is that the shiny handle looks a little cheap and the <unk> is an unnecessary turn off also , the size is very accommodating to just about any laptop - but once you add the power cord and maybe a few other wires , there is a noticeable hump that is slightly tacky but probably unavoidable overall i think this is a very practical , high-quality product that looks good and will certainly protect your laptop from a nasty fall the size is just right and makes for easy travel wish i had gotten it sooner , would have made my life much easier
this # inch sleeve is very nicely padded and has a nice crisp and modern look i suppose if your lap top is a # inch you can use the other # inches for your chargers it is well padded and seems to offer nice protection for your notebook i do find it annoying that there is n't an extra pocket for chargers also , there is no shoulder strap other than that it is a nice sleeve
this black case is perfect for carrying a laptop or ipad the neoprene is durable yet padded so that if you drop it your computer is protected this case is gender neutral and ready for any purpose
the macally lightweight neoprene sleeve offers tough protection for a notebook computer the exterior is a black with a leather accent with impact absorption the interior is a soft lining to prevent scratches to the computer the dual handle is a comfortable grip with a clasp to hold the two sides together this macally sleeve is handsome , tough protection
from the time i opened the box this product stood out as a well made light weight safe case for my netbook and/or tablet on a recent trip i found it to be safe against bumps and the cramped space i had driving from new york to florida and back upon arriving home both my tablet and my # `` laptop i recommend this product for anyone that has to transport their laptop or tablet
i started using this instead of a sleeve without a handle that i was previously using for my macbook things i like about this - it actually is very light - nice to have a handle - leather accents look nice - substantial <unk> 've gotten a lot of compliments on it and i 'm really happy with it i could fit a charger in with the laptop as well if i needed too but i typically do n't i do n't have any complaints
the sole function of this thing is to cushion the blow of any bumps to a laptop due to terribly cheap materials it has absolutely zero absorption power i returned mine and bought a case logic one instead the case logic one is not much thicker , but the materials are stronger and able to absorb knocks and bumps
very thin , somewhat cheap feeling foam the velcro is nice , as is the design , only lacking in quality materials yes , this cover is cheap , but for over ten dollars i would expect a better quality build
i bought this for my wife 's # inch toshiba after being influenced by a number of # -star reviews the sleeve we received is as pictured , but the `` neoprene `` is a joke it 's some of the lightest weight foam i 've ever felt in a notbook case/sleeve i own socks with more padding than this case it will protect your notebook from getting scratched by other items in your bag , if you drop your computer from a height of more than # inches , forget about it
i give this this item # stars because my wife loves lime green & the price is cool but this item is to soft to protect your laptop i would not recommend for everyday use of this item just to use around the house , not for outside use like school or trips item is to soft to protect your laptop ! ! so , i just bought my wife laptop bag with more protection for her
real neoprene is a gel like substance that is also used to make fishing <unk> this product is a cheap foam rubber the name brand that i received is not even the same name brand that is pictured other than that , it fits my laptop good
it is a soft foam so will not give a lot of protection but looks good and should fit any # . # laptop it is good if you want to store your laptop and keep the dust off of it and the velcro top makes it easy to get in and out of
it is large enough with my macbook pro that i can fit the charger and papers in it also if you have a # & # # ; macbook you could probably fit it into the case
i use this to keep my laptop in when i am carrying it around the house i have put it in my bag to take to school , but it does n't have quite as much padding as it could i only put it in my bag when there is nothing else in there with it i love the cover over all , but with books and other items in my bag i do n't feel it would be protected enough i have a dell inspiron # z that has a # . # screen , and it fits perfectly in this sleeve
i bought this and enjoy it it 's a great cover for my dell # . # inch laptop it 's a little thicker than i expected , but it does its job i am happy this sleeve is thin enough that i can use it on my computer and place the computer in the laptop portion of my backpack without hassle and fuss and with the color , i never have to worry about confusing it with anyone else 's sleeve and it 's bright enough that i ca n't forget it on the table
i got this for my dell # & # # ; laptop and it is a perfect fit it is nice and stretchy and you can fit some more stuff in with the laptop , like the cord and a mouse for instance only criticism is that there is no handle or way to pick it up except just grab it and my laptop weighs a ton , so i wish it had a handle or something , otherwise it is
the laptop cover was exactly as described not made for hard drops but then agian it is not described as such color is true and quality is fantastic for the low price i would recommend it
i love this item because it protects my pc from dust etc . it 's easy to insert my pc in it i like the color as well and it was not expensive i also got this item right away i love it !
it perfectly fits my # . # inch notebook it could be thicker but it is ok for the purpose you can place your notebook in it even while the power cord is still attached to it two days after i received it , i ordered another one for my wife 's notebook i highly recommend it
i again received the item i ordered from amazon when it was promised the package was <unk> wrapped it exceeded my expectations of what it would be i would recommend this product for <unk> that wants to protect their laptop without a bulky leather case great job , as usual
bought the for my chromebook asus c # but this case has sooooo much extra room that i felt my chromebook would just swim in it , sliding side to side in the case so i returned it i prefer a tighter fitting so i know it is well protected
item i got is not the one thats advertised its a generic non roocase brand gave it # stars because it 's not a bad case im more disappointed than anything due to false advertisement . not a snug perfect fit for my acer c # top to bottom there 's probably about # in of room left on the top where the zipper is but the extra pockets are nice to put other things in like a charger or a portable hard drive case is soft but kinda flimsy compared to the case logic that i had purchased a week ago
i 've tried ordering this twice , and both times have been shipped a # something inch case , not what i wanted , i ordered # because that 's what i wanted i need it now as my previous case gave up , so i 'm keeping it if it was the right size i would give # stars
this was <unk> the right size for my chromebook , but i found it was a bit larger than mine too big is better than too small , but still ; i wanted something that fit more snugly it 's not so bad that i had to return it , though gets the job done
very flimsy neoprene and it is too large for an # . # & # # ; netbook it claims it is for an hp pavillion dm # . # & # # ; which is exactly what i have but this case was definitely too large i expect a glove like fit but with this case my netbook sort of <unk> around inside the only plus is the pockets on the outside could be
perfect size for my # . # lenovo yoga # s i found there to be enough room in the pouches for charger and head phones etc . over all very durable and good quality also there is a small slot for an sd card inside the case which is cool only thing negative was that it with a new & # # ; smell & # # ; which i am sure will wear off after a couple days
its a good and spacious case , but its slightly bigger for a # . # inch chromebook or any other laptop of that size however all the space is good for keeping the power cord , mouse and few other small things its soft and definitely a good protection for my <unk> # chromebook
i bought this to go inside my larger briefcase for scratch protection it is lightweight and good quality package says # . # & # # ; case , and it fits my asus # . # & # # ; notebook perfectly , not too tight there is plenty of room in the smaller zippered pocket for charger and other small items second pocket , which has a small velcro fastener only , so small items might slip out , is good for papers and flat stuff there are two little clear pockets for sd cards inside price is about half of what i saw in the stores , if you can even find this size anymore shipping was fast , within a week i also bought a pink one
i have a new hp # elitebook that is the small laptop/tablet and this fits it perfectly on the width and it has an inch or two room at the top i love it i already have some nice leather bags that are not computer bags but i prefer to use because they are more attractive than a laptop bag so i needed a sleeve that was n't too bulky this fits that perfectly for those who might bump their bag around due to travel or something else you should probably go with something with more padding this is just the neoprene with no extra padding because my computer is smaller if i needed to i could fit the power cord in the front pocket with no problem i know i had read another review that it is not big enough my laptop is also very thin for the price i would highly recommend this sleeve
this sleeve fits my # . # netbook , nexus # and my note # and the chargers luckily all my chargers are slim <unk> it is comfortable to the touch and fits well in the hand
love this case , and ca n't beat the bargain price holds my # . # ultra book with keyboard , <unk> , and chargers if it had a handle or strap , it would be nice , but for a protective sleeve it ` <unk> best
used with a acer chromebook my son uses it and he takes his chromebook a lot of places provides protection for the chromebook and was a good deal hold chromebook , cords , and still room for ipod and tablet
this holds the laptop and has two special pockets it is perfect to throw in suitcase when traveling , i hate carrying an extra laptop bag so this fits nicely in my <unk>
first , this is not real leather second , when you close it part of the air 's screen contacts the fake leather third , it looks as cheap as it is same as this one -lsb- ... -rsb- it went back
i like the feel and look of the product my only concern with it is that it does n't allow proper ventilation for my mac so it ends up overheating so i would n't recommend it unless you take it off every time you use it and only use it to carry the computer
i bought it as i could not decide on a case , and this was # bucks figured for # bucks , it would work for now it is actually quite nice fits well , looks good i personally think it is leather , but i can not tell either way for # bucks -- i am happy !
i agree with most of the reviewers that the product is well made some of the reviewers believe that faux leather was used i believe that it is genuine leather as mine definitely has a leather smell
the cover fits well and performs as advertised the little <unk> feature on the bottom works well too and when it 's flat you do n't even know it 's there good value for the money
this case provides a clean , professional appearance for my macbook air -lrb- # & # # ; -rrb- while adding much needed protection my only two complaints , the wrist rest area -lrb- left and right sides of the touch <unk> -rrb- shows wear from constantly resting my wrists , which is reasonable because it protected my macbook from being <unk> secondly , the left corner rubberized strip has come off and is barely hanging on i would tear it off , but the part that it lines is somewhat sharp regardless , i would give recommend purchasing this product
i purchase new cases for my computer often , and have been looking for something more compact this item is exactly that the leather feels great and it looks great i definitely thought it would look and feel cheap because of the pricing , but it far beat my expectations absolutely love it , and it totally transforms the laptop to look like a small notebook definitely would recommend this product , and for the price , you ca n't go wrong
i purchased a plastic cover for my macbook air but opted for this one later because it 's sleek and less conspicuous i can pop this in my purse and it looks more like a notebook that a computer i 'm not sure that it 's # % sure leather as there are some areas that have suede for the price it was well worth
this case fits my laptop perfectly i was n't sure what to expect , but when i placed my laptop in it , not only did it fit like a glove but it looks professional am planning on ordering the # `` case for my fiance
within a couple of weeks the case started to break and crack now the bottom piece wo n't stay on and the top has cracks running across the entire length . bad quality product
honestly , i was so excited to get this case i loved the color , but i placed the order # days ago and the estimated delivery date was set for august # st well i went to check it today , and the order has n't even shipped yet ! and the delivery date was set back for september # th being a college student , and having the risk of my newly purchased macbook air being damaged , it was just not worth the wait for me so unless you do n't mind your packages coming a few weeks late , i highly suggest trying a different seller
this is the most useless two pieces of plastic i have ever encountered . i expected a plastic protective briefcase instead i got two halves of a clamshell that do not even fit together or connect in any way not only that , only one side could fit around the bottom half of the macbook air the other half of the clamshell did not even fit the cover with so much plastic missing from the surface of each side of the clamshell to lighten the case , i guess , it serves no protective function against rain nor against <unk> i will get a thick neoprene sleeve instead
i just opened the package and # corners were already cracked or broken <unk> slippery too even though it has a matte finish i also do n't think its attached securely but did n't want too mess with it too much for fear i 'd break it its better than nothing and i like the color
