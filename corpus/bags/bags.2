this cover is too lightweight , as the thickness of the neoprene material used is too thin it does increase the protection somewhat , however it would not , i feel , provide anything other light ` knock ' cover secondly the case does not have any carry handles , which again adds to the risk factor i would , if given a second chance spend a bit more to get a higher level of protection
once you get the package , if you read the cover it says it is not only for the s series but it also for another type of laptop and the laptop case is meant for laptops that are up to # ins i bought this thinking it would snug fit with my s series notbook but it was way too big i kept the package for the power cord case other than the power cord case fitting , the case for the laptop itself is crap
i recently purchased an sz # vaio and <unk> this <unk> # carrying case from a sony store i read the product description here on amazon first and it does indeed state it is meant for the s series and # . # `` notebooks however , after testing it out , it is too tight for my sz # i literally have to stretch the corners to fit around and over the corners of the lcd one at a time when i remove my laptop , i have to be careful to `` unhook `` it from each corner as to not pull open my lcd from it 's closed position basically , the material is fine and feels great and offers good protection as a carrying case it is the size that is the problem for me if they made the corners a little more rectangular instead of rounded , it would probably fit my sz # much more nicely if you have an sz notebook , i recommend to not purchase this and to find an alternative carrying case such as tom bihn cases
bought this at the sony outlet store for the viao # . # inch laptop the other reviewers are right about the thin neoprene i 'm most disappointed with the zippers , unlike my old neoprene cover for a netbook , there is no neoprene flap protecting the computer from the zipper this case is too tight on the corners , expect to scratch the machine there is no sleeve for <unk> drives , etc . . that will have to go into the accompanying bag there are better designed and constructed sleeves out there ! -lrb- check gizmo dorks models -rrb-
i think this sleeve is designed for sony s series laptops , and is intended to be used as an additional protection , not a carrying case -lrb- no shoulder strap or handle -rrb- i bought it for my sz laptop , and it does fit the laptop but the four corners of the sleeve are really stressed out in fact , the fit is so tight that i do n't think the sleeve would last very long for a main laptop carrying case , i would recommened the <unk> # case for a sony sz laptop this carrying case is much sturdier , and it can store the sz laptop and power adaptor without problems i use the <unk> # as the main carrying case for my sz laptop , and i only use the neoprene sleeve when i transport the laptop in a backback or suitcase
essentially i have had the same experience as other reviewers it is a sleeve , not a hardcore protective case , and it functions very well except that the sharp corners of the laptop tend to screw with the zippers on the round corners of the case
this is a nice sleeve with snug fit on the vaio sz series , and i also like the ac adapter case which is really handy if you dont want to carry around a separate laptop bag the only thing that occurs to me is that the corners are too rounded for the vaio sz series , so it is a tight fit on those corners maybe some people prefer this tight fit , but i wish it had <unk> corners if you guys are looking for more protection , check out the <unk> # , that is one nice case
i went ahead and ordered this vaio case for my new inspiron # m after reading <unk> <unk> 's review i am very happy with this case and i can say that i like this much better than the shinza # `` zeroshock case the shinza case was too snug for my beautiful # m this sony case fits perfectly and i do n't have to worry about it being too small and tight , just enough room to slide in and out of the case with ease it seems like it was made for the # m so i encourage everyone who owns a # m and buy this case from amazon.com i want to thank <unk> <unk> and amazon.com for the great review and product
i have the vaio <unk> # laptop i looked , and looked and looked finally , decided to keep this combo very good choice i was concerned about the corners -lrb- zipper -rrb- , but the fit is great really like the extra little case for the power supply also keeps everything organized i ` throw ' both into my think tank artificial <unk> # and i am ready to go :
i ordered this based on other reviewers comments that this is a good fit for the dell # m but was still a little skeptical considering the provided dimensions and the one comment about it not being snug well , to me , it is a perfect fit i do n't use the extended battery and the case looks like it 's custom made for it -lrb- with a little room on each side , like a well-made suit -rrb- it is not snug -lrb- as in `` tight like a glove `` ? or someone who fits a large trying to fit into a <unk> ? -rrb- but it is absolutely a great fit i have not found anything out there that fits like this also , the quality is superb and very well made both items do have the vaio logo <unk> on them but the products come with a lifetime warranty from sony that 's fine with me what a great find at such a great price i recommend it to # m users <unk> and without reservation
i have a vaio z # the fit is not snug , as some other reviewers have noted , but i am not sure how much it really matters it protects the laptop just fine the z series can be taken in and out easily without have to stretch the neoprene , so all in all i think its looseness is really a plus
i was desperate to find a neoprene case for my new dell inspiron # m and was happy to find reviews that said this fits perfectly so i ordered it and yes indeed , it is a perfect fit
so i did buy this case for my sony vaio s # notebook , and i am very happy with it it fits like a glove it is a wetsuit like material , very nice it keeps it safe from scratches so i just keep my notebook in this case , and carry ot around in my backpack with <unk> books excelent case , a must buy for anyone who wants to carry their laptop with their usual stuff <unk> having to carry an extra bag for tour laptop
this product is simply amazing ! ! ! it is not meant to be used to carry your laptop around it is simply `` a shield `` to protect your laptop from scratches when you are carrying the laptop in a backpack or laptop bag the item is <unk> designed there is a soft cushion inside the neoprene case also , since it is neoprene , it conforms to your laptop size if it is little bigger than the case my dell # m fits perfectly in this case
perfectly fits a # . # `` sony notebook useful for protection against spills and dust you will need a backpack or briefcase with padding to carry your computer around since this case has none
i bought this for a # inch sony vaio laptop that i got on black friday also to have when i traveled to india , <unk> , and switzerland at first , when i saw this on amazon i did n't want to buy it because of how basic and boring it looked i 'm glad i gave it a shot because my laptop still looks brand new because of it slides in and out with ease and the side pouch comes in handy for many wires -lrb- ipod , cellphone charger , etc . . i would recommend this product if your looking for something not too fancy and to get the job done
i think you would be satisfied this vaio case , because it 's truly designed for your vaio laptop . also other # . # `` display laptops i highly recommend this one for everyone who wan na buy a case for laptop and its adapter
vaio specific zip up laptop cover - fits very well and leaves room for power cord accessories to fit inside i used this in conjunction with the travel case for extra protection when not using laptop keep it inside this cover so the unit is not out in the open
i bought this for my new sony vaio it is good as a cover while it is at home so it does not get dusty and it is good for use in a proper laptop carrying case it does not replace the carrying case , though it would be nice if it had handles and if somehow the adaptor pouch could attach to the laptop case
<unk> material and better because the two bags are really great my only complain is that there is no specific model for vaio <unk> series and this <unk> gets a little bit big , but fits . i would buy again
i had gone through # or # cases trying to find one that fits well and this one finally does it looks good and the small charger case that came with it is very useful my case was purchased to fit a sony vaio # / # inch
i bought this case three months ago and it has not proven to be that tough within a week , the top lid sides did not meet properly so that you had to spend a few minutes fiddling with it then , three weeks ago , one of the locking clasps fell off between leaving my plane and leaving the airport so far the manufacturer has not stepped up with a new one or an offer to repair it <unk> i should add that it has been on three plane trips and has never been placed in the checked baggage section
great case , the picture on amazon was rather misleading , but the case was build well has two sets of locks , one set on the latches , and the other is a heavy duty lock in the center of the case
ok , so have had this bag for almost a year yea , stuff can come flying out on the inside , and scratch up the top of your mbpro , which is annoying and it seemed to be nice and protective as i was slipping the strap on yesterday , it snapped off down by the clasps the computer landed on a corner the body of the mbpro has bent gon na be hundreds in repair cost for this will go with nice soft , <unk> backpack with huge straps from now on
does n't quite fit my # inch laptop and the power supply , but still great dimensions are about half an inch less than stated , and can be a little awkward to carry , but it still looks very sharp and <unk>
this is an old review i bought this years ago for my # in sony vaio let me just say this case with that vaio is heavy however it feels sturdy i always felt my laptop was safe in it given i still did n't drop it too often
before i bought a new briefcase i tried to do a lot of research to find the right one i felt that the vanguard <unk> series deluxe aluminum case would be that case after using it for sometime now i am thoroughly pleased it is roomy , it is secure and you can drop it without damage to you laptop i am very satisfied
good quality , holds all my stuff , great price i travel doing video work and the case holds up with all the pro grade cases for equipment things get banged around some , and my laptop is always safe
i usually read reviews for everything i buy , but the one time i do n't , i wish i had this sleeve claims to fit # . # inch laptops , but does not fit my dell plus , the quality of the construction is poor and i do n't trust it to protect my computer sufficiently i will be returning it
this zipper case is actually padded with cheaper polyethylene foam -- and only on the # <unk> faces of the bag only the polyethylene foam panels are encased in a jacket of <unk> neoprene on the outside and nylon in the inside note that the edges of this bag are <unk> solely of the thin <unk> shell , which i think most people would agree is not sufficient padding for your precious laptop the only reason i do n't give the icon # <unk> bag a lower rating is that i 've seen worse construction buyer beware -- do n't buy this bag sight unseen outer dimensions are # . # x # . # x # . # inches
its good , big enough the only thing you should know is that the zipper is grey and there is some grey fabric at the top that you cant see in the pic
not the best sleeve but definetely the best sleeve for $ # bucks . i mean seriously , $ # . it is padded all over even around the edges and the zipper area reading the other reviews i was expecting a piece of junk but it 's actually not bad at all the handle -lrb- padded too -rrb- is priceless because i hate carrying my laptop under my arm , too <unk> it is slightly different from the picture : the zipper and the area around it is actually silver grey which i like so i 'm happy with it , in fact my husband wants one too best $ # bucks spent in a long , long time
now that i 've had this bag for a year , i will tell you that it has not held up the leather is cheap and it looks terrible i 'm throwing it away
i purchased this bag thinking it was everything i needed , only to find out what a pain it is the <unk> clasp is always in the way when you 're trying to open it , and it will not stay open you have to hold the briefcase open with your hands constantly to get things out or put things in it always wants to stay half closed ... a real pain to use ! ! would not recommend at any price !
where do i start , do n't rely on the lock , or clasp to work -lrb- has never work correctly -rrb- the strap keeps coming off this is due to the clasp not working as designed
i was very happy with everything about this briefcase until after only a couple of months of use it began to wear -- not the way a high-quality leather item wears , but the way a cheap leather item does oh , it 's real leather on top , but that 's only skin deep all along the vertical <unk> along the edges , which of course is where the action is , the thin layer of leather has rapidly worn off underneath is not unfinished raw leather , but some kind of black <unk> like you see when a cheap pair of `` leather `` shoes begins to wear away this started to become obvious only a couple of weeks after the deadline for a full refund passed what a disappointment for a bag that otherwise seemed like a great value <unk> : the clips that hold on the shoulder strap have become pretty <unk> too -- more disappointment
i got this bag because it looked nice and sounded good online it is a nice looking bag , but when i started using it i immediately noticed that some of the edges began to fray the stitching also seems to be coming apart it looks nice enough from a distance , but for heavy usage you might want to bite the bullet and pay a little more
everything about the bag is what i expected accept the fact that the top does not stay open usually this type of bag has hinges that over center so that it will stay open for easy access not in this case had i could have put my hands on it before the purchase , i would have backed
# months in this is a well made bag . construction seems durable and has ample padding and some decent pockets . stitching is a little showy and worries me a bit
i really like this case it is stylish but still practical and does just what i need it has plenty of room , <unk> compartments , and the `` <unk> `` closure secures the contents very well the leather is beautiful as well
great bag ... just like my last one ; i loved it unfortunately , i 'm returning it because they advertise that the laptop compartment is # x # . # x # it is on the bottom , but the top is rounded before your square laptop will fit so you can carry it exposed , or you can order a different brand bag do n't be fooled by the manufacturer 's specs really sucks , because it is a great bag ... very versatile , lasts forever i 've wheeled my old one through the winter streets of <unk> and chicago on many occasions ... it always arrived looking great , always held all my stuff ... you could n't beat it
overall , it is the same mcklein bag i had previously which was # `` wide this back is a little larger ; however it is really less than the # `` they claim my # `` dell laptop barely fit this newer bag and would not close
i gave this product # out of # stars the leather is not that great , but it will do everything else about it is good it detaches easily from the base to carry by hand or over the shoulder it has nice compartments to hold all of your important papers and laptop accessories the bag is a good buy and a good value
researched a lot of different cases ... had the solo leather laptop case , which was great but my paperwork was more than the case could handle so had to get something a little bigger without being obnoxious this one had the right dimensions and had the appropriate # of compartments and the flexibility to take off the wheels the only observation so far . the <unk> hide leather is not as aesthetically pleasing as i thought it would be it has an artificial leather appearance to it some prior concerns talked about the color scratching off easily but this definitely has not been an issue it is a sturdy carrying case , which can hold a lot of one 's work / laptop without being too bulky
i love my new bag it 's beautiful i am , however , having a difficult time keeping the attachment on perhaps i am installing it incorrectly i 've watched the video and it seems i am doing it right but the clips keep coming undone
the mcklein # r is a quality made laptop case , however the website compatibility check list indicates that the case will fit a toshiba qosmio x # <unk> # laptop computer perhaps the particular case i received was smaller than the average mcklein case , but it is too small for my computer
the <unk> damen # black # <unk> laptop case is a great buy my # `` laptop fits in the case with no problem all my other contents from my brief case also fit with room to <unk>
first , the bag is genuine leather and well constructed the capability to easily use the bag with or without the wheels is great for those times that i have to travel with my heavy laptop or ca n't attach it to my wheeled carry-on the laptop compartment is easily accessible for going through security lines the compartments are very well organized with pockets for accessories there is ample room for lots of <unk> and it is expandable and , it comes with a weather proof cover great overall value
it is sad because a week ago , i would have given this bag # stars i have only used it for about three weeks , partially filling it will light snacks to take to work and carrying it from the car to the building and back that is all the wear it took for one of the handles to tear -- yes , that is right -- tear you can see the material beneath the `` leather `` now the handles are rounded , but as i do n't fill the bag with anything heavy , it hardly bothers my shoulder the tear on the other hand is a deal breaker for me why pay more money for leather if it is just going to tear so easily anyway i 'm ordering a replacement bag today -- but not a targus one other than those issues , it is an attractive tote bag , but mine does not stand well on its little metal feet and constantly falls over maybe i just got a dud
i love the quality of this bag the only reason i did n't give it a # rating is because it is a bit smaller than i thought this is not necessarily a bad thing , because you wo n't have to worry about it getting too heavy however , i wish there was extra <unk> for my power cord and other accessories needed for my laptop overall great bag
great looking , very professional but a little heavier since it 's leather my last bag was a <unk> with similar design but it was nylon and that was very comfortable and light but did n't look as great as this targus also the handles are leather and in a round shape instead of flat so not as comfortable if you 've loaded the bag up overall this is a great bag and i love using it
i purchased this lap top bag # years ago and it still looks as good as new very functional , and so fancy people ask me if it a purse
i purchased this bag to carry on interviews , and it 's been fantastic for that : it looks professional , but has enough space for all the essentials i anticipate continuing to use it for many years although i 've yet to use it as a laptop bag , it 's sturdy and the laptop sleeve is well-padded
this bag is an <unk> , nothing like the laptop bags that i have <unk> in the past it is made of good-quality leather and has more of a feminine , `` purse `` look i use it when i travel ; it carries my # . # `` laptop and accessories and anything else that i would normally carry in my purse , so i only have to carry one bag i love it
this was a gift for me to use for graduate school after two months of use the clamp for the shoulder strap broke while i was riding my bike home i promptly got a new one in the mail from the company -lrb- the lifetime warranty works well -rrb- , but the new one broke in the same spot within two days of use i also found that it was extremely wide , every time i walked in a <unk> the backpack would hit the side of the door i 'll be looking for something else for next quarter
i have to echo the review above i 'm still using this with the shoulder strap but the clips that hold <unk> straps broke after a couple of months use on the upside , the macbook was n't harmed when the breaking clip caused me to drop the bag i carry a full load around and would have been happy if only the attachments had been metal rather than plastic
at first i was delighted with this bag it <unk> well on a recent flight and easily held my things plus computer accessories my job , however deals with alot of moving from one vehicle to another , and the bag tore at one of the lower corners exposing the inner contents i estimate it lasted about # months so if you need a bag that will handle alot of <unk> about this one is not the bag for you
it 's really great when it 's not broken easy to carry , you can tuck backpack straps away when you do n't want them , fits easily under seat in airplane however , the straps have broken several times in a year i 've gotten i think # or # replacements
lots of room what you see in the pic is what you get do n't know why there is a zipper from the front flap into the main compartment though . enjoy
i just received this bag today i was quite pleased with all the storage and organizer pockets it has i really like the fact that it converts from a satchel to backpack configuration -lrb- have n't tried it yet - i understand the backpack clips have a breaking problem ? it fits a toshiba satellite with a # . # `` screen perfectly a very well-made bag and i highly recommend it
it 's a great bag holds a # `` macbook -lrb- or # bottles of wine -rrb- plus plenty of documentation , books , magazines , pens , papers , cds , etc . the outside mesh compartment holds a compact umbrella nicely the only downside it may be a bit too much bag for some people it is pretty big
i 've had this bag for a month and love it so far plenty of pockets , and stays out of my way pretty light , and the padded handle on top is nice it does n't feel as sturdy as a <unk> , but for the price it 's a terrific bag
i love this bag ! it is attractive , spacious , versatile and inexpensive what more could you want it has enough space to even fit a couple of binders or books and it also has plenty of compartments so that you can stash your belongings and keep organized it also was delivered very promptly like the next day or the day after even though i selected regular <unk> service i am very pleased with the bag and service
i was looking for something that i can use on a daily basis as a laptop case , but that would also double as a back-pack when i am at an airport this bag does it all when you use it in `` briefcase mode `` , the shoulder straps are neatly tucked away the only difference between this and a conventional laptop case is that this is vertical other than that there is no difference it has plenty of compartments i carry a fair amount of stuff in my computer case , but did n't <unk> from one of the huge cases that you sometimes see i have n't had a chance to use it in `` backpack mode `` for any length of time yet , but am looking forward to doing so during an upcoming trip when i tried it on for brief periods , it was quite comfortable for the price , a great buy
i am a student and bought this bag at the beginning of september by december the stitching on one of the straps started coming out and one of the plastic pieces holding the strap snapped i think this would be a great backpack for airport travel or lighter loads because of its great features it was not able to handle # textbooks , a binder and a laptop
this is a great bag in a lot of respects ... tons of space , tons of pockets for everything imaginable the only problem i have with the bag is that it appears that the zippers and pulls are of poor quality the zippers continually get stuck , making the great convenience of the bag worthless if you need a bag with lots of space and great organization -lrb- they really thought of everything -rrb- and have better patience than i do regarding the zippers , this bag is for you
this bag has many pockets for anything and everything , but the build quality is not up to <unk> , i 've had # plastic pieces on the straps break and # zipper snaps within # weeks of heavy use if you do n't use it every day with an insanely heavy load , you 're probably okay just do n't stress it , but it will not respond well
it is as the description says they do n't <unk> on the features i recommend it for any computer geek who needs -lrb- or ca n't be away -rrb- from the computer : -rrb- great gift , lots of storage , looks great , high quality i 'm very satisfied and recommend it highly
this is a great bag very comfortable even with all the stuff i end up carrying around there is a pocket for just about anything you can thing of so it is easy to stay organized i love that it does n't look like an expensive laptop bag , which i suppose makes theft a little less likely
my thoughts on this bag have been pretty well covered by other reviewers this is a great backpack with lots of storage space and the shoulder straps are much more comfortable than my <unk> . bean i recommend this bag
i bought this bag for nursing school thinking that i would be a good quality because it was a jansport it starting tearing on the seam and now has a whole within a month of me using it . for that price i am very disappointed and will not be purchasing anything again
i bought this for my wife a little over a month ago as a pregnant law student , it seemed like a good choice for lugging the necessities to class it was working ok , but occasionally she needs to use the backpack straps and not roll it however , when in school last week , as she was walking , one of the straps broke it still works for rolling , but she ca n't roll it up stairs and of course , we missed the return window by a week
the handle just came out of the slot after # week of use i would think that these backpacks should be sturdy enough to last at least on school year i would not waste my money on this product
i have used jansport packs since the # s they have always had the best product and service the zippers do n't work , they are hard to zip , they stick metal on metal my # in laptop computer wo n't fit in the main compartment without hitting the top where the zipper is i have tried to get jansport to fix the zippers , i have only used this once , no response from jansport amazon wo n't take it back amazon needs to back up their products , this is a rip off , do n't fall for the name it feels and works like it is a cheap knockoff of a jansport shame on amazon for selling this product
ordered this bag after doing tons of research on rolling bags for my daughter to take to school was concerned about the price but i sucked it up ... less then # weeks after the bag is separating at the back from the wheel section this is extremely disappointing ! ! poor construction !
i bought this backpack because of the jansport name and the # star reviews for my # year old son since he has many books to carry when we bought the # st one , the handle broke within # month i contacted jansport and they were very <unk> i would have to send the backpack to them at my expense and wait for them to either fix it or replace it and then send it back all that time my son would not have a backpack amazon was great with returning the defective product and i bought another jansport the handle broke of again within # months just from general use of putting the handle up and down and wheeling the backpack around i am done with jansport and will not buy another of their products
buyer beware before you drop $ # on this backpack it seems nice and like it is durable lots of compartments and feels solid but after # weeks it has already come apart at a seam at the top this is n't even an area that takes a lot of wear and tear but the real kicker is that after # month you ca n't return it to amazon jansport covers it in their warranty , but you have to pay the return shipping this is a heavy pack so shipping is going to run pretty high i am not happy at all about this and would not recommend this backpack
i was in the market for a new computer bag and i also needed a bag for school and work my current bag was putting a major strain on my shoulders and i wanted to get a rolling bag that did n't look too business when i first found the jansport bag i was thrilled , it was sporty , had wheels , and looked well built after # <unk> of normal use , the retractable handle is broken i plan on writing a letter to the company to let them know of my disappointment with this product
we were really happy with this bag until the release button jammed on the handle just four weeks after we got it the good news is that jansport is <unk> the warranty the bad news is that the cost of shipping to their service center , which they refuse to cover , is quite high
i prefered for a particularly long warranty period , but i was disappointed the bag 's handle was broken in # months i regretted that i paid too much shipping fee and amazon purchase
i brought this for travel but it is a lot bigger than i expected if the ground is a little bumpy this backpack does not roll very well and a little awkard to carry
i read <unk> of reviews online before getting this bag the amazon price is the lowest of all vendors i have been it using this for about # months now saves my <unk> <unk> : all kinds of hair and gunk get stuck in the wheels from rolling it on streets the bag is not spacious the placement of the bar that is connected to the <unk> handle is in the center of the bag it feels hard and also reduces the stuff that can be in the bag i feel that my regular backpacks of comparable size hold more stuff the computer <unk> is very tight and a # inch laptop sticks out on top
my previous bag was manufactured by samsonite it had great pockets and worked well with a laptop , files , folio , and miscellaneous work stuff that bag 's lower front pouch dragged on the ground and wore out faster than it <unk> have the zippers also were not heavy duty and came off track after about # months i expected more from jansport it has great rollers and good protection on the bottom and front so material does not drag on the down side - it does not have enough pockets , and the zippers are hard to work between the two , the samsonite is the better value
# -rrb- sturdy handle # -rrb- large <unk> # -rrb- cheap zippers : do n't look or feel very durable not very smooth zipper operation sometimes require some work to open and close the bag # -rrb- skimpy shoulder strap # -rrb- wheels rub when the bag is loaded up # -rrb- need more compartments and <unk> pockets , # -rrb- would be nice if there were two outside side pouches instead of one , typically used to hold a water bottle
repeating this this bag # nd time as the old one worked great for # years with <unk> use the new one i 've got is good too but the quality is not so great - the zip , the lining of the bag are very ordinary . wish they had kept the same standard my guess is that this bag would <unk> go for # years only with similar use .
had this backpack for a couple of days and , although it seems well-made and sturdy , rolls along fine , it 's not really comfortable as a backpack in addition , there is nothing to protect your back and sides from the wheels so <unk> from roller to backpack when the wheels are dirty -lrb- for example , when it 's raining -rrb- will get your clothes dirty
i have been using this model for carting my ` stuff ' too and from work for # years , these bags are pretty <unk> i needed a new one as the bottom was <unk> to wear if you have a heavy load to transfer from one place to another , this is the best i have found i walk with y bag approx # miles a day
i bought this backpack for nursing school it is very sturdy my only complaint is i wish it was wider as i have a ton of very large books to put in it overall it works
this is a great rolling backpack i can fit # pounds of books in it and still roll it easily it has good stability and plenty of pockets for my belongings it also holds my laptop well and has padding to protect it the downsides : it does not have little pockets for <unk> or small items , they just have to float on the bottom of your bag also it is pretty large so it is a little difficult to get through rows of desks at school , you need to sit toward the front
great product , great price , very sturdy for the price ... overall great product for the money i would have to say that we purchased other products and paid more but not as sturdy as this one and wow what a great price .
it 's jansport the space is a major plus there are # <unk> an extra one for a laptop the only issue i have is in <unk> compartment the zipper tends to get stiff and you have <unk> give it a really good tug
product was as advertised and item arrived when expected appears to be well built , although i would prefer some side pockets because i 'm a road warrior and take so many gadgets with me when i travel overall i would have to say that it 's a good value and it 's built to last
i have no complaints other than the zippers which seem to be cheap and nasty having owned a range of back packs , this has generally been a problem other than with some top quality and top price european brands getting the zippers to work <unk> and properly is not quite the current <unk> of my life but almost
my # th grade daughter specifically requested this bag after having a <unk> book bag last year she admitted that shoulder bags were a horrible idea for school -lrb- i had to keep myself from saying `` i told you so ! `` -rrb- and that she was not too cool for a rolling back pack currently , her rolling bag is stuffed with books and supplies ; just what she and her young back needed
this bag is very sturdy with lots of room for books , computer and more wheels are large and roll over almost any thing from grass to dirt road i use this back pack to walk # blocks to school , in snow rain and horrible winter weather , weekly and it is holding up very nicely the only thing i wish it had was more -lrb- it has # -rrb- smaller pockets designed to hold things like pens and usb drives etc . if you want a rolling back pack this one is awesome -lrb- no they did not pay me to say this -rrb-
i had an earlier model of this wheeled backpack and assumed i was ordering the identical item . unfortunately there is no longer foam padding being used for the pocket where the laptop goes and the upper dimensions of the case have been <unk> consequently i returned to my original which is still <unk> along after # years -lrb- except for the backpack straps which gave out . i have travelled around the world a few times with this bag and stuff it with my computer and camera equipment . the newer version is still probably one of the better value rolling backpacks on the market
i am a nursing student and my books weigh so much that i had to purchase a rolling bookbag and this was the first one i tried and i have loved it so far i 'm only in week # of school so i have n't had it for long but it seems to handle my gravel <unk> and enormous books with ease my only complaint is that the handle is a bit loose but i 'm sure i could tighten it up
i am extremely pleased with the service the delivery was very efficient i was of the opinion that a backpack by definition would be designed to be carried on the back this one can only be pulled this was a bit of a disappointment since this option was expected other than this <unk> , the product met all other expectations
i broke a wheel when i jammed my previous wheeled back pack into my car the backpack has served me well for # years of my <unk> program i searched for replacements and found good reviews for this jansport it will serve the purpose for the last year of my program but am disappointed in the laptop compartment i ca n't fit my laptop in the correct compartment and only that compartment is padded so i do n't feel my computer is nearly as protected i have a padded case i use with the backpack and think that will help . otherwise the wheels seem sturdy and the bag seems like it will work just fine
bought this # cc bag for my son 's use as a bookbag in # th grade based on previous reviews it has been two years now and this bag is still going strong it can take up a macbook pro , hardcover books , college sized notebooks , extra <unk> and gatorade with no effect at all to the bag 's integrity even with two years worth -lrb- and <unk> -rrb- of abuse the wheels have been very sturdy even with all the weight and daily use over a <unk> <unk> the wheels just wo n't break it has also conveniently doubled as a luggage bag for hand carry by a child during plane rides really worth the money which is why i 'm here to buy a brown colored version this time around
