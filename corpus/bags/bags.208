this laptop bag is great for the price it 's lightweight and has lots of storage space the only thing i find cumbersome is that the zip makes getting to the bag difficult i would definitely recommend this to friends
it 's a little bigger than i would have liked , but over all this thing is great it has so much room in it , i can carry everything i need and the kitchen sink ! ! excellent for the & # # ; on the go & # # ; individual who wants to have everything with them while they are & # # ; moving and shaking . & # #
it is very comfortable to carry and is large enough for my laptop , chargers , and cables i really like this case since others i have had in the past were not very durable this one is much better
carrying nothing but my macbook pro and one notebook while walking to <unk> side of the bags strap snapped and dropped to the concrete i would not recommend buying this bag to anyone the laptop ended up being alright but i bought the bag for its efficiency with over the shoulder carry very disappointed in this product
i like the design and the length is just right but this is not as durable as it claims to be because i found the outer covering of the pockets coming off within # weeks of purchase the space inside was too small , i wish it was expandable update : one of the top handles just came off despite being rarely carried and rarely used this is just after about # months of purchase avoid this product
it is a great case which fits perfectly to my macbook pro # & # # ; it has # very useful compartments the problem is just that , there is only # it should have another # or # for wires and accessories
i 'm in a college program online so my computer goes everywhere with me i feel like my clumsiness wo n't hurt my laptop in this bag could be a little deeper but i probably try to put too much stuff in my bag
does what it is meant to do and more , i can fit two laptops into the main pocket and a ipad mini in the front along with a phone and the chargers has taken a lot of abuse and is still in great shape i would recommend this bag to anyone
well made and functional i use it everyday for hauling my laptop , mouse , and power cord back and forth to work but , throw in a book , a lunch dish , maybe a thermos and i can barely get it zipped shut wish it had zippered expansion for a bit more room
the backpack is very good , feels well made and is comfortable to wear it is however , slightly bulky but i have n't had a problem with it in the dc metro it 's also not the most fashionable thing in the world , but that 's not why i bought it i needed a good backpack to carry my laptop and some other stuff to and from work without breaking anything , and this does the job well even gotten comments from friends that the backpack looks sturdy , calling it a & # # ; <unk> & # #
looks really modern and it seems like high quality product that could last pretty long but we 'll see what will happen during time for now , we are very pleased with it
needed this for college since my last book bag lost it 's ghost , lol it 's sturdy , keeps my laptop and tablet safe walked in the rain and nothing got soaked totally love this book bag worth the money
the zipper did n't work at all and it felt like the zipper was covered in wax or something so my hands were nasty after spending # minutes trying to get it to work
i chose this case for the cute design but was highly disappointed it looks like it has water stains on it it is thin and would n't offer much protection from anything except dust it smells horrible the case will not zip closed with the & # # ; hidden handles & # # ; exposed rendering them completely useless the search continues for a cute and functional laptop bag i only gave it # stars because it arrived quickly
case is great came as described only issue is that the zipper does n't zip easily it 's very hard to zip and unzip and i feel like it will break in the near future
i simply adore this skin it was just the kind of quirky bag i was looking for i wanted something that was lite and one that fit the computer nicely this really fits the bill thanks again for designing a wonderful bag
the case is very soft and adorable it is printed on both sides so it 's hard for me to tell which side is & # # ; up & # # ; when i have the laptop in it the handles fold in so you can zipper it up all the way closed with the handles out you can only zipper to the handle -lrb- if you plan on using the handle -rrb- which does n't really matter if you are n't putting pen 's or anything small in the case all in all for the price i say it 's a bargain
yes , she got a new laptop and wanted a soft case this is the pattern / design she chose she likes it and uses it every day i like that she likes it the price was nice and the quality is good it cleans easily as well
i had a speck . case for about # years and it was time for a new one i bought this one , it came on time , and it looks really good , but is n't the best quality the reason i bought a new one is because my old case was coming loose on the corners when i got this and put it on my macbook , it was only secure on # of the corners it stays on fine , but it does n't feel completely secured
i enjoy this hard shell because it gives me a little more protection from scratches and small nicks obviously this is n't going to keep my computer from getting smashed by something heavy but the hard shell has definitely proven its worth
this shell is my favorite cover and i like that the apple logo is cut out so it can shine easier it fits perfectly , but sometimes the bottom unsnaps from the front of the bottom edge this is the area where my wrists rest when i am typing i easily <unk> , and even though i notice that they are not completely snapped on , the bottom blue protection does not fall off i have dropped my macbook pro and the edges did not get dented , but rather the case cracked , which i prefer to having a permanently dented or broken macbook pro so , in my situation , it <unk> as a & # # ; bumper , & # # ; or shock absorber
every time i take my computer out of its carrier , the top of the hard shell case has come off and it 's not that easy to snap it back on i feel like all this on and off will scratch my computer plus . what 's the point of a case that pops off every time i take the computer somewhere
beware : i have the asus zenbook model ux # <unk> # -lrb- the touch screen version -rrb- please note that while this case does fit the top portion of the laptop perfectly , the bottom part does not fit properly the molded nubs for the rear feet do not line up with the laptop -lrb- they are about a # inch off , and will not allow the bottom to snap on correctly i suppose i could drill holes in the bottom to allow the laptop 's feet to poke through , but i 'm just currently leaving the top on and using it without the bottom overall it 's ok , but just thought you should know
... the edge grips prevent the laptop from closing completely -lrb- one of my favorite things about the naked computer -rrb- then i realized that this is a unique product and i 'm an early <unk> , and it actually works to protect the machine ** hint , if you have the touchscreen version of the <unk> # a , you can remove the rubber feet from the laptop then , the bottom half will fit -lrb- top fits anyway -rrb-
fits well , protects <unk> the downside the case itself gets scratched very easily and does not look very sleek after this happens but this is not really a problem since it prevented those scratches from getting on my laptop
i am inclined towards # stars but held back the vent slots at the bottom of the cover do not align with the vents on the computer i am not sure if this is n issue but i am sure that if fewer slots were adequate asus would not have had so many
i received the laptop as a gift and want to protect it i decided that this mcover hard shell case was the best choice ; it seems to me that it is better than a `` skin `` would be it went on easy i also wanted to try to removing it to be sure i could and that was no problem i like the small feet it has and the ventilation it provides
its really just a glorified macbook sleeve with a strap i 've got a # unibody mac and if you put anything else in there it will be difficult to close might be a little different with a macbook air , but there is n't much room
first of all , there are n't many cases available for the small macbook airs secondly , i bought this for my boyfriend as a gift to rid of his old obnoxious <unk> backpack this does n't hold much at all , but i definitely like the look ; it 's unisex , sleek , and simple when he started using it more frequently , the strap would <unk> come off on one side without any indication that something is broken everything looks intact , but i will say the straps are n't reliable . . and it 's holding a freaking laptop i will buy new straps from somewhere else , but the fact that i have to do so has dropped my rating to a # -star product hopefully , this is unique to us
the bag is ok - super tight w/a # & # # ; macbook pro zero room for power cord or anything thicker than a cd case the bag itself is fine despite the limitations but the strap is something i have found to be annoying the material is similar to that of a seatbelt in a car it too easily slips from the length adjustment i prefer and becomes & # # ; long & # # ; in just a few sessions i resorted to <unk> a hole in the strap and <unk> it in place with a nicer strap , more compliant with the quality of the bag itself i 'd rate this item higher all this said - it 's a pretty good deal for the $ $
the case is nice -- subtle , good looking and high quality it feels good to the touch it does n't hold much beyond the ultrabook even a mouse is a bit of a stretch the magnet closer is quiet but not as secure as some other cases ; if the slipcase accidentally turns upside down your computer will quickly fly out -lrb- ! -rrb- not the most comforting moment when you hear your expensive ultrabook slam into the floor despite this flaw , i still like the case and would buy it again i 've just become more aware when picking up the case
anyone looking for a classy bag that just large enough for a small laptop or tablet , this is the one when i travel or attend conferences , i want to be able to carry my windows # -lrb- yoga # -rrb- without extra bulk it 's easy access flap and long , adjustable strap is exactly what i was looking for in addition , this bag is designed in such a way that it 's perfect for both casual and professional use
i gave this # stars because it is exactly as described , very minimal it fits my # inch macbook air perfectly along with the magic mouse in the front pocket i can also fit the power cord but i have to fold it a special way so it does not look bulky if you carry things with your macbook air -lrb- # inch -rrb- other than a magic mouse and power cord , this will not work for you if all you carry is your macbook air , this is perfect for you why by a & # # ; thin case & # # ; and want to fit everything in there
the rubberized , hard shell case does not fit my # `` macbook pro that i just bought i bought this bundle for the hard case and it does not fit it will not go on because it is too small i am very unhappy with this product because it did not fit my needs
seems like a deal when you buy it , but it 's basically the cheapest product you can get to protect your computer the case material looks cheap and poorly made and the mouse is a poor <unk> a mouse it barely functions , as soon as i got it i noticed that the buttons would stick the top case is a hard plastic cover , nothing special the only thing i was satisfied with was the keyboard cover overall not worth $ # bucks
i bought this package because it had the mouse , and the other one just like it did n't i looked at the reviews , and about half said mouse work and half did n't i decided i would give it a chance and just order it when it came in my mouse did not work like most of the people had described everything else was perfect in this order and i use it everyday i just do n't like it because the mouse did n't work , and that is why i basically purchase this package
all items were as expected and work great the only exception is that the mouse does n't connect and work properly to be useful on the laptop i purchased this bundle over others specifically to have a working mouse i thought this was a great bonus
everything about this is great perfect price , colors are nice , and it arrived very quickly however , i am a little disappointed in the picture of the product , you can see the apple logo , as if the case was semi-transparent that is not the case though the plastic is is <unk> and sadly , i can not see my new vinyl sticker all in all , great product , the pictures are just a little misleading
this is a great deal for what you pay i 've gotten compliment after compliment for it , and even recommended it to someone the only thing is , the mouse is kinda <unk> but other than that its awesome
seller provided the product stated i however did n't read all the way to the end and it was the wrong size for my macbook pro w / retina display -lrb- a little too big -rrb- all the other stuff i can use so i kept it
the keyboard cover is very nice i do n't use the mouse very often , because it is very <unk> and moves very easily the case was n't quite what i was expecting it is thicker so you ca n't see any decals , or stickers you put on your computer , but you can see the apple icon
this is a great set and a total value the case fits great and the sleeve is a lot nicer than i expected i have n't used the mouse yet , but it is cute only reason i did n't give # stars is because there was a small scratch on the case no big deal though super fast shipping
you get what u pay for and a bit more the quality is decent and the case and key sleeve fit fine the colors are represented properly . will buy from here
this product was a great bundle that matched in great price & quality <unk> speaking , i am a successfully satisfied customer and will definitely recommend to others as well as buy a similar bundle of products again
the color is exactly as shown in the pics i would describe it as a vibrant tiffany 's blue the case fits perfectly as does the screen protector , keyboard cover , and sleeve the mouse works great , not sure why some people have had issues the little usb <unk> for it stores under the battery cover of the mouse for when you 're not using it i thought that was pretty nifty the screen protector went on with minimal fussing and shows no bubbles anyways , i am totally satisfied with this product great deal !
it is simply perfect the color was exactly as <unk> one i chose anyway the case fits perfectly and slides right into the the soft sleeve bag i think as long as you know how to read and check if it matches your mac model and number , it should fit perfectly and you know how to put it on
very nice color and fit is perfect i really want to buy another color as well it was a great deal for all of the items that came with it only minor downfall is the mouse does n't always connect
everything functions very well , which i love the cover , screen protector , and case fit perfectly i absolutely love the feel of the keyboard protector and the mouse has a sleek feel
great deal and an awesome color set it was nice to see a set where you did not have # different shades of turquoise they all matched perfectly
i thought the price was too good to be true but the case is beautiful and fits my macbook pro perfectly fits into laptop sleeve perfectly as well even with the case on also , super fast shipping which was a huge bonus
this case is not a worthwhile purchase it looks cheap , sucks in the area of functionality and does n't offer very much protection additionally , it 's next to impossible to get on i will be returning it promptly and not buying from this company again
the speck covers that snap on are great , this one has # parts and will <unk> you for about # minutes before you just give up . at this price , do n't bother
i recently received an email from amazon to review my hardshell case so here is my experience so far i ordered the red hard shell case for my new # `` mbp retina on january # , # and i am still waiting for it my account was already charged for it i was aware i would have to wait for it to be shipped on january # on jan. # i emailed the company since i did n't see an update on the shipping status and i received a response on jan. # th from <unk> <unk> of <unk> cases stating it is shipping feb. # st i will cancel my order if it 's delayed any further as i 'm running out of patience having to be very careful with my computer i hope i do n't have to since i like the concept a lot better than other hard shell cases and i love the color my husband has one on his macbookpro and it 's <unk> but it has lasted for several years without a problem i will update my review after i receive the case
i was so excited to get something to protect my computer boy was i disappointed it does not stay together cuts your wrists i paid $ # dollars for this are you kidding me will look at reviews better for my next case
this case has a wonderful look and an unnecessary level of protection that gets you # stars practically , this design is just not well thought out the case adds over an inch of bulk , over a pound of weight , and no rubber feet without rubber feet , the elegant design of apple 's mag lock power cord now becomes a death trap for you macbook as you walk by your normal surface table and mistakenly pull the cord connected to your macbook , you will watch in horror as your computer slides right off the table onto floor below not to worry your macbook will survive there 's more than enough bulk in this case to save you a trip to apple 's genius <unk>
got this at a great price , and even if i had n't it 's well worth the money does n't add substantial bulk but does add exceptional protection , specifically around the corners great color and material too i take this back and forth to work all the time and it still looks great
have looked at a lot of cases out there & this one has the best design for keeping the case on the laptop no flimsy clips but a sturdy snap together design
love this case , fits my macbook pro # retina perfectly i tried the speck and had problems with the tabs coming off this case does n't scratch your macbook and was designed to protect it yeah , it gets minor scratches on the case like it was designed to do but the real reason i bought it was to protect my # k investment also , it wraps the edges very nicely and fits with a carbon skin installed on it a + for a well designed and very reasonably priced shell
i did have to wait a long time to receive it , but it was worth the wait while i was at the apple store on my <unk> training one of the employees <unk> the session to ask what type of case i had and where i got it
it was a speedy shipping process but the overall product was awful there is so much extra room you can fit two macbooks and and ipad and still have room you pay for what you get
the cover is ok to use , but does n't fit perfectly around my macbook pro # inch retina display -lrb- late # edition -rrb- the thickness is good enough , but the lenght and with are quite loose because the cover is slightly too big for the laptop what should also be mentioned is that the material smelled quite chemical when first opening the package this smell faded away after a while nevertheless it does the job , and for the price it is still worth it
it looks fine but nothing great it serves its purpose but it 's not amazing , just useful for protecting your laptop it has really strong plastic smell when you just open it , then it stays a bit but most of it goes away
did it 's job and is a great slip cover for my macbook pro would definitely recommend as a cheap case solution i use this case in conjunction with my messenger bag
this product is a bit bigger than my new macbookpro retina display i did n't realize that the sizes were different until i recieved it so just take that into account anyway , the sleeve gets the job done more or less
i really want a refund and to send this back -lrb- not sure how ... the strap broke off immediately tried <unk> - it just keeps breaking off no idea why otherwise , it looks nicer in the picture the white part is a canvas and not very professional looking it 's small and i have an extra long cord , so the flap ca n't close too bad because i was super excited about ordering this not happy with the product
it 's thin like it says i wish the magnet was stronger because it does n't stay closed very well and one side clasp keeps occasionally comes undone . wont fit more than your computer and a magazine it 's cute though
this case will carry your macbook air # `` perfectly ... and only the <unk> of additional items , like a usb cable or maybe a magic mouse it is too thin to carry a charger with you ; which is why i returned mine seller 's service was excellent
i purchased this item for my husband 's new idea pad the brown leather flap is made of the softest most beautiful leather the white fabric is a canvass like material inside there are compartments for your writing and data management needs honestly , i thought to keep it for myself so far it screams of quality
came earlier than the expected date and it 's a dream the faux leather is amazingly soft to the touch and it fits my # `` macbook pro w / retina display quite nicely it also fits my charger , contrary to popular <unk> , as long as you coil it nicely and put the coiled cord to the side of the charger i do n't usually carry around the extension for it , so it fit for me as for the handle for when you want to carry it like a briefcase , the tilt is not at all bothersome it 's barely a tilt , but it does go a little bit at an angle ; still not an issue also , it 's true that the shoulder strap has no padding , but i personally do n't need it since i 'll only carry my macbook and my charger in it , which are fairly light as it is overall an amazing buy
we purchased this for my wife 's lenovo helix tablet and she absolutely loves it it easily holds her # . # & # # ; screen and her files and other work she also gets lots of compliments on how it looks
product was shipped promptly it arrived as described it is well made attractive and many comment on how professional it looks my computer fits fine the magnetic flap is nice as opposed to a cheap zipper i would recommend this to anyone
i was searching for a case for my new # `` macbook for a long time i almost went with a michael <unk> designer case from the mac store for over # dollars i last minute decided to order this instead to see and i 'm so happy i did the material is wonderful and it fits my laptop perfectly , but if you have a laptop # inches bigger it could probably fit too i 'm # % happy with the purchase there 's even room for the power cords in the front pocket but it stays very thin even after putting them in the pocket definitely a good buy
this is a great bag does everything i hoped for easy to travel with not overly bulky my only complaint is that there is n't a seamless compartment for the charger
i previously ordered a case from gmyle that i love , it 's just frosted and not very see-through , and i have a decal on my laptop that i 'd like to be able to see i decided to go on and purchase this clear case , hoping it would be the bright blue , still somewhat transparent cover as pictured i opened it and it was very pale , then i put it on my laptop , and it was really no different than a clear cover , not at all what was pictured in the multiple images it also had a large scratch on the top cover that was noticeable as soon as i put it on my laptop , so i 'm able to return it for a refund i would 've been disappointed with it even without the scratch though , because it 's not at all as advertised i 'll keep my frosted cover , because it works very well , and just deal with the fact that i ca n't see my decal i 'm disappointed that for an item that shows such great pictures , they do n't at all reflect the reality of the item i 've purchased other things from gmyle that i 've loved -lrb- especially the keyboard cover -rrb- , so i like their products in general please update the pictures so that people know what they 're buying
it do n't fit to the macbook pro when you put it , it does not fit on the button part , do n't buy it because it 's cheap you get what you pay please consider this review
horrible & <unk> product not see through , so if you have a front sticker . . do n't get it still trying to find one that shows through the front & # # ; like thin frost . . not cheap breakable clear
i love the way it looks , and the top case fits fine however , the bottom case does not fit it is too small to snap in place i am sad i have to return it
you are all crazy do not buy this item if you own a macbook -lrb- # inches -rrb- this joke of a case will not fit and you just wasted $ $ $ $ $ $ like i just did if you do n't believe me go ahead and order it and it will be $ $ $ down the drain you are welcome to the people who are considering buying this crap
the case is a different color than what is pictured a shade or two lighter and has a cheap plastic look i sent it back but was not refunded a total waste !
difficult to give a rating really great value for money and delivered on time however , instead of turquoise being delivered we received pink we kept it anyway as did n't have the time to return it and gave it to a friends daughter as a gift
i got this case because it was <unk> to be see thru and it was my favorite color but when i got it it was n't see thru i was not very <unk> with that because i got a decal and you can see thru the cases to see it
bottom cover cracked into pieces within only a few months it didnt even last me a year -- i wouldnt bother buying this one it might be better to just pay more for one that will last a long
do n't be fooled this is not & # # ; clear crystal see thru & # # ; it is the color it says , but you can not see through it like as described the apple logo barely shows through as a blur
this case was great for awhile , but when i wanted to remove it , it broke it was way too difficult to take off , but i mean if you never want to clean your computer or change your case , i guess that 's a good thing .
the bottom piece does n't even fit on my laptop -lrb- macbook pro # & # # ; early # -rrb- that it was advertised to fit the top piece fits which is nice , but they are not at all see thru and are more blue than the picture will not be buying from this seller ever again
it does n't fit my macbook pro # . # & # # ; as advertised i had to return it its an ok product for the price you pay and i wish it was a good fit
the case is very thick , so do n't expect to see much of the apple through the case the bottom piece does not stay on at all , so every time i move my laptop , the bottom cover comes off it 's an annoyance there is nothing for the bottom piece to latch onto , unlike the top
i was looking for a cheaper case to try and prevent minor scratches and what not that also looked decent just a word of warning , the case is not see through by any means despite it 's description and pictures they said they would refund me my purchase but i had to pay for return shipping though , the case does fit my # `` macbook pro well and it would cost more paying return shipping than what i paid for it , so i 'm stuck with it maybe i 'll find a way to decorate it , but i will not be ordering this again from <unk> due to their misleading descriptions and pictures oh well , what can i expect for $ # ... plus shipping
this product is cheap ... so therefore its not the best quality the case for the bottom does its job , but the one for the top of the laptop does not fit on properly it is constantly snapping off and coming undone the color is nice , but the quality could use some improvement
this is not crystal clear at all it makes the laptop a lot heavier than with an incase or speck case the color was all right , but as i said it was not what i expected at all
i ordered this product expecting it to look as it did in the pictures well do n't get your hopes up , because it does n't it is not clear at all i have a <unk> on the back of my laptop and you ca n't see it even a little bit the case does fit well though , hence why the product did not receive one star , but it simply is n't what it said it was , and it is n't what i wanted
it was not robin egg blue , it said that on the sticker but is clearly pink ... it works fine so i am not returning it but it is not robin egg
the cover is a very pretty tiffany , <unk> blue , which is why i was disappointed when it did not fit my mid- # macbook , even though the description said it would i will be returning it
the color is not what i expected -lrb- blue color with a touch of green feeling -rrb- and the case looks cheap comparing to speck 's cases the only thing i like is that it fits perfectly with my macbook pro
i know laptop cases are n't supposed to be big and bulky , but this is almost ridiculous the bottom part is so brittle the sides just randomly start chipping off at random little places it 's getting annoying but other than that , the color is nice and it 's smooth and does n't overheat my computer
this seems rather flimsy and since beginning use about two weeks ago , has developed strange marks on it , not scuffs or scratches does fit the computer though and comes with a keyboard protector
i bought this case thinking it was see <unk> like the description i was disappointed when i opened the package and it was not at all see through it fit 's well though so for $ # i ca n't complain
i bought this for my daughter and i was amazed by the quality of the product , good price and looks durable and very presentable , my daughter likes it very
so i 've seen few bad reviews on this product but i was looking for a cheap case for my mac so i decided to just go with it maybe cuz i did n't expect so much <unk> it i found this case totally acceptable , fits my mac well , not to mention great color only the keyboard cover is a total joke : -rrb- -rrb- i did n't even know it was a cover , very cheap material but well it 's $ # for the whole set so i 'd recommend this if u ' r just looking for something cheap but able to do the job -lrb- cover ur laptop
the cover is plastic but i was under the impression it was rubbery it 's not just plain plastic other than that it has kept my laptop safe and clean the keyboard cover moves a lot but once you get used to it it 's fine
