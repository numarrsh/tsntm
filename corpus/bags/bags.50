i do n't like the latch securing the flap part of the bag it 's a metal hook that must go through a cloth loop fastening it is difficult if you have a fair amount of items to secure
the bag has no problem fitting my # . # inch computer there is ample room on the side for putting in a binder and other papers , to make it useful for carrying other items as well the only very minor negative is that the zippered pocket that has a slot for pens & <unk> does n't fit the pen or pencil
i have a # . # laptop and the bag is able accommodate the size of my laptop , the power cord , a mouse and my sketchbook and a folder with little room to spare the bag is definitely meant for those who travel light i love the contemporary style of the bag the minimalist aesthetic was what i was looking for in a bag however , the durability of bag is questionable i have had the bag for a month and the nylon strap that messenger flap clips on to is already beginning to tear away from the bag and the zipper for the speed pocket is not functioning properly i will be definitely be taken advantage of the warranty once i figure out how to
this bag was bought to replace a laptop sleeve for my # `` dv # laptop the laptop fits snuggly into the bag and has a very easy to access computer compartment the other compartment are nicely laid out but need a little more room to be fully functional if you are going to be carrying pen , pencils , notepads and your cellphone -lrb- along with your laptop -rrb- you will be in love with this bag if you need to carry text books you may need to look for something with more size
this messenger bag was made well with the right compartments , including the section that keeps my laptop tucked away from papers and books the exterior material is very protective from light rain weather and also sturdy enough to hold a bulky laptop but with holding a # `` it 's ideal
this is a very nice bag we used it for our family vacation and felt very good about the protection it provided for our laptop it would have been nice if there was just a little more storage for example it held extra reading material but was too thin for my day planner -lrb- if you are not a <unk> person like me it will be just fine ! overall it is a very good bag and a great value for the price
this provides plenty of room for my # -inch laptop , and room for much more like any laptop bag , it bulges when you add items to the pockets it feels like it protects the laptop rather well , but i 'm not dropping it everywhere my only complaints are the material is a bit noisy when you move the flap also , the flap secures with a hook and strap , which is relatively difficult to connect when the bag is at one 's side velcro would have been better , though perhaps less stable in addition , the usb pocket on the inside is very convenient the outside pocket on the flap is definitely a plus , though the zipper is a little tricky to tuck away
i bought this bag along with the microsoft # . # inch neoprene laptop sleeve -lrb- # -rrb- http / / www.amazon.com/gp/product/b # <unk> # <unk> the sleeve purchased fits comfortably in the bag even with a # cell battery and # . # screen the styling and durability of the bag have stood up so far in my opinion i believe this to be a solid product and would recommend it to a friend
i like it it 's perfect for placing the laptop -lrb- i have # . # inch sony f series -rrb- , power adapter and couple # page magazines and fits easily the material used in & out is good also place for your mobile phone infront for easy access
this bag is great its perfect for carying my <unk> on the go and has plenty of space for extra stuff worth buying if you need a fun and easy to carry laptop bag
the bag is nicely designed i am able to fit my # & # # ; laptop in it easily , and still lots of room left for other documents , or may be a book in general i am pleased with
i bought this bag for my new laptop it is reasonably sturdy and well made for the price it has pockets for your mouse or power supply or whatever
i own an asus g # <unk> # and i needed a bag desperately i thought this would have been a good choice , but my laptop would not fit at all it claims that it could fit a # . # inch laptop , but the asus g # jh did not fit the look and feel of the bag was really nice though only reason why i give this # stars is because it could n't fit i submitted an rma and will be looking around for a new bag people who own a g # do n't get this bag because it will not fit but people who do n't have that type of laptop , please do because this bag does get the job done with it 's multiple compartments and style
this bag will fit a # inch laptop just fine however it 's <unk> for fastening the messenger flap is very strange it consists of a band of fabric with a metal clip that slips around the fabric the pockets in this bag are also strange there is a pocket with pen and pencil holders , but if you use them , you can not close the pocket containing the holders there is also a strange sideways pocket on the front flap despite the comments , it 's still a decent bag for the price
alright so here 's the case logic for a big # inch laptop after receiving the bag i tried it out and i looked pretty fine with the messenger bag all the items fitted and the laptop charger had made it look <unk> bulging for a messenger bag the laptop i have is a pavillion dv # cl i love the usb pocket holder the only problem i ever encountered was while walking with the bag after # seconds of my route , i noticed the annoying sound of it twisting of the plastic this messenger bag is one of the with all the attributes , but the only downsides are the bulging laptop charger and the annoying sound i 'd maybe buy another one if they replaced the plastic with some leather or something else that would n't make the noise
got this for a # . # inch dell fits well , has a little extra padding on the bottom corners in case of a fall , and the side pockets are ample for the power adapter , disks , etc . ca n't speak about durability yet -lrb- only had it a month -rrb- but so far it is exactly what i wanted
i purchased this laptop bag along with the laptop i purchased it is great looking bag and very strong with enough compartments to hold everything i carry with me i am very happy with this bag and it is the best priced one i have seen for the money worth every penny
i do love this case for my laptop i love how much storage it has in the case i feel like my laptop is very protected in this case i also love the price of it lol
i bought this bag because i know the quality of the case logic line it is attractive , strong and well made it has a lot of useful compartments i highly recommend it
have always liked case logic and was not disappointed with this purchase my # `` laptop fits in perfectly and i can also get my mouse , power cord and even my speakers in the case highly recommend this item
this bag is light , my # inch acer fits perfectly with a little bit of space left , nice pockets , nice inside color -lrb- not that shade of blue but something like turquoise -rrb- it 's stylish with a very useful back strap for attaching it to the hand luggage a little bit strange as the laptop goes into a pocket that opens in the back of the bag and not under the flap as you would expect feels sturdy with probably a good price for a little bit under thirty as i got it
bought it a little over sized for a reason i have a # inch laptop i wanted extra space for my tablet and tablet accessories and this case delivered holds my laptop , laptop cooler , all cables and accessories , as well as my # . # inch <unk> xoom tablet , it 's case , it 's stand and it 's keyboard could n't of asked for a better laptop case
i am very pleased with this purchase i am able to fit my # inch hp laptop and my ipad including all relevant cords i also have my wireless mouse and my adapters for the ipad in the bag
i 'm just absolutely amazed at how well <unk> out this bag is and how cheap it is there are tons of compartments for all of your laptop accessories -lrb- keyboard , mouse , flash drive , external drives -rrb- , all of which are well padded and separate to prevent any contact with one another the double stitched seams on everything just shows how durable this bag is all of the zippers and other metal bits and pieces are well covered to prevent any scratching of your laptop plenty of room for even the largest # `` laptop and all of it 's accessories and it looks good holding all of it too is it sad that i 'm impressed with a bag tons of space in a well thought out and designed bag very durable and well built
i have to say i am very pleased with this product it is lightweight , but well-made and well-designed with the storage you need for the accessory items i did n't like the case i had , and this one fits the bill nicely highly recommended if you 're looking for a carrying case this is an extremely well-designed and sturdy item !
this is a great bag i do n't use it to carry a laptop but use it as my daily commute bag lots of good size pockets , very nice case to carry computer this is a very useful and practical bag
i 'm pleased with this product my # inch laptop fits nicely and the bag itself is light , not adding much extra weight which is exactly why i chose it it has just enough space for other items , too
i actually carry a # . # `` laptop in this bag i needed the extra space for my adapter , portable mouse , external hard drive , # usb drives , # pens , # disks , phone charger , and miscellaneous documents they all fit well in this bag with all of this , i can fit a # . # `` full binder and it will still zip up the shoulder strap is comfortable and i can adjust the plastic piece on the strap does n't dig into my shoulder the padding on the inside of the bag holds my laptop well , even though my laptop is smaller than the bag is meant for there are plenty of pockets and everything zips up , so i 'm not paranoid that i dropped a pen or cable on a side note , i was able to fit a huge hp <unk> # `` laptop and it 's giant # watt adapter into this bag just fine the weight did bother my shoulder , but it was probable less an issue with the strap , and more of an issue of the laptop and adapter <unk> # lbs together
this is an inexpensive yet high quality case it is nice looking in a utilitarian sort of way , and is well thought out i work in the it field and i 've seen lots of laptop cases come and go throughout the years and this one seems to offer the best bang for the buck well done case logic
this bag looks great and is very functional lots of pockets to hold cables , tablet , phone , accessories and even a special neoprene holder for your usb stick things are securely hidden by the flap which secures to the bag with a metal <unk> and eye kind of setup this is much better than the clamshell version of this bag -lrb- <unk> # -rrb- which is much thinner and has fewer pockets to store things love the detachable shoulder strap too this fits a # . # & # # ; laptop with ease , although it says it fits up to # & # # ;
i 'm really glad i ordered this laptop bag i bought a # in laptop without really thinking about a bag that would be able to carry it this bag is n't too bulky , provides good protection , and is well made it also has space for cables , a few documents , and pencils/pens i love it
i was n't hoping for much for a $ # bag , but was very happy to see how sturdy it looked when i unpacked the box it is big enough for my gigantic laptop -lrb- # inch wide -rrb- , with lots of space left for paper and other accessories lots of compartments looks slim from the outside and very tidy in the inside great everyday bag great price
like many other reviewers have noted , i have to echo that this case would be terrible for anything but a netbook it 's far too bulky for an ipad , unless you wanted to carry books , papers , and other small material with it , then it might work it is rather bulky though if you 're looking for a case that would fit in a backpack or messenger bag man purse <unk> are appropriate here , though on the whole it does offer decent padding and looks
i 've posted a couple of photos for my thousand words this case , which seems well assembled , is simply too thick for an ipad does n't make sense to stick a thin , stylish ipad into this bulky , <unk> bag -lrb- when the ipad is itself in a flip case , the fit is tight around the edges - with tons of air space above it . someone with a thick netbook would probably like this though a family member 's thick hp netbook fit well the expandable outside zip pocket easily accomodates power cords , etc . , and the velcro used to convert the shoulder strap to a hand strap is clever if you have pets , note that the fabric really attracts cat and dog hair and it does n't easily brush off
this is a very simple case , with a side zipper pocket and minimal padding the strap can be used over the shoulder or shortened and be more of a handle there is plenty of space , about # `` in width , inside the bag for a netbook , that might be fine , but for a kindle or ipad , it 's not a great fit nor is there any decent padding i can see this as an alternative to carrying by hand , but i would n't recommend this as a travel case i just do n't think it would provide enough protection it does appear to be well made , but i think that case logic tried to cover too many uses in this product i 'd rather see a more snug fit and more padding
that 's right , this guy is just a * shade * too narrow for an ipad in a case you can jam it in there , but it does n't fit quite right if you take the case off , the ipad fits -- but the <unk> is far too large , and you would n't dare put anything in there with it because -- your ipad is naked the <unk> is a tad too narrow for the apple charger was well , so i <unk> this case to be a failure for an ipad clearly some marketing <unk> decided to call a netbook case an ipad case , and i imagine it would be fine for a netbook , but this is no ipad case
i 've used this for two purposes : to hold a netbook and some pencils and such for a quick trip , and as a general <unk> bag for a tour around the city it worked great for both purposes , but keep in mind , yes , this is definitely a murse the shoulder strap , etc . , - it 's much more suited as a handbag than an attache case - the inside is nicely padded and not a material that will scratch a screen - the strap is plenty big - it is big enough to hold a netbook , easily - there 's room for other stuff in addition to an <unk>
i love that the handles on this netbook case can be switched around you can have the handles be short , so the case is a bit like a lunch box , or long and carry the case over your shoulder like a purse or satchel plus it has a front pocket that can expand a bit , which is nice for carrying around little things like pens , papers , and such i can see how this would be a bad product for ipads , but for netbooks it is excellent i have given it four stars just because i have not had it for very long , so i can not say much about its durability
this case logic <unk> ' is a nice case for traveling with a # `` netbook it is well padded , and the easy to carry there is a decent amount of room for accessories but be advised though , unlike most # `` netbook cases , this one will not fit an # `` <unk> my # `` inch acer fits in several different cases i own , but not this one it is just too small as others have pointed out too , i probably would not use it for an ipad either the interior is just too big for it
i just love this bag . . <unk> it is very bright green , but it works perfect for my kindle fire i ordered it thru amazon and it was delivered next day , at no extra cost , well packed i get lots of compliments on my bag case logic <unk> # . # -inch netbook/ipad attache ' -lrb- green
fits my toshiba nb # perfectly just enough room in the front pouch for the power cable and a few other things the little <unk> for a flash <unk> card is a nice touch -lrb- and one i do n't remember from the product description -rrb-
i red lots of reviews which in my opinion are very misleading and out of context why ? because this product clearly states the size and what can fit in it my ipad # which has a front and back cover fits perfectly fine and i have enough room to put a a small notebook inside of it also the front pocket is very useful and it has room for a small external hard drive , couple of pencils and sticky notes the bag has a very good finishing and for the price you ca n't find better than that
this case is so sturdy and has lots of space to carry items i just took it on our beach trip i felt that my new ipad was definitely safe and secure now some of my friends plan to buy one of them great item on amazon
i am returning this item and think it 's really not made to safely or securely carry a computer the bag looks quite attractive and has nice little compartments for extras but is not padded at <unk> other reviewers have noted wish i 'd read the reviews do not get this if protective cushioning is an issue , which for most of us it likely is
the case logic laptop bag for a # inch is okay the bag is stiff the zipper is a little hard to fully zip you really have to tug on it to zip up all the way the bag does fit my # inch macbook pro perfectly when i put my wall charger and extension cord in the front compartment , its kind of small , it would have been better if it was a little bigger but in all honestly , the bag did its job i just wish it was a little bigger and that the zipper was n't such a pain
i am really looking for a snug fit case for my macbook pro # since my mac has a shell <unk> products see thru satin case for macbook pro # -inch aluminum unibody only , peacock -lrb- <unk> # -rrb- , i was afraid that it would not fit into the bag surprisingly , it did the side pockets truly can fit in the charger and some other stuff that i need whenever i need to bring my mac on the go the adjustable strap is clever . but i am not so fond of the material and the color i hope that they could come off with more exciting colors next time do n't expect that it could protect your mac from shock
i ordered this case because i needed a way to transport my macbook pro # safely but also needed to carry my wacom tablet with me the pouch where the macbook is stored is more than roomy enough maybe a little too roomy the zippered accessory pocket has a decent amount of room without making the case too thick my wacom tab fits in perfectly and there is still room for a usb drive and probably the charger .
its only big enough to fit the laptop and a few <unk> in the pocket its very tightly made it does n't have space for anything else you do have space for a mouse , pad , charger , obviously your laptop and a few other little things i bought this like a year ago but i do n't use it much because it does n't fit anything else its very pretty too i like it
initially when i received this bag i was worried that the computer pocket was a little too big for my macbook pro , but it has n't bothered me in use the front of the bag is a perfect place for wires , mice , usbs , and so forth it is such a compact and stylish case that i have taken to using this as my everyday bag , sadly leaving my computer naked i think i may have to get another bag just for the computer so that i can use the other as a day bag
the bag is nice and it looks good ~ but with my macbook # `` , it fits in but then its a little tight when trying to zip up i still love it though !
i had a case for my # inch mac , but the sides were not cushioned i ordered this case and it is perfect sides are cushioned -lrb- more than the old case -rrb- and i can keep the plug in charger and the two adaptors i have for my system in the zipper pocket product arrived in time for me to use it on my vacation , worked out great
love this product just what i need it it is very compact and perfect if you just need to carry a small laptop , notepad , cell phone , keys , <unk> and few other small items strongly recommended and very stylish as well
my macbook fits like a glove in this i love the front zipper area , it 's perfect for holding the charger , earphones , usb cords or anything else there 's also a flap on the back that 's great for papers , or anything else i will say , the color was a little bit brighter than i expected , but i still love it anyway
my girlfriend got me this bag about a month ago it fits my # inch macbook just perfectly the front pockets have enough room for the dongles i usually carry around , i.e hdmi and vga adapter , ethernet cable , power cord and other small accessories notice that the bag is designed exclusively for your laptop , it 'll be really uncomfortable to try to fit extra stuff it has a nice design , which looks professional and modern i actually carry my computer around very little , and the bag is n't meant for heavy duty use it has little padding and it wo n't cushion your device if it free falls overall though , considering my needs i 'd recommend this bag to any macbook user
we recently purchased a mini computer and were searching for a carrying case saw the add for the case logic laptop attache and decided to order we ordered in gray it fit our mini computer <unk> and even has extra zip space to carry the usb mouse and adapter <unk> there is even an outside pocket to carry small books and papers the strap is adjustable , but we like to carry it over the shoulder it is light weight but softly padded just what we were looking for
this case allows us to <unk> all the macbook stuff that we use in a single case for travel no more leaving the mouse or power cord home again when we travel ! !
this case is absolutely perfect for my new # . # inch laptop also the front zippered area carries my mouse , ac charger and even an external hard drive , without unsightly bulges i highly recommend it , for ease of use and its quality construction
this case fits my tablet perfectly , it is compact with just <unk> room to carry the tablet and external key board along with power cord it is very good
thank you my friend , this is what i need for my macbook pro case logic is the best of all thank you very much and god <unk> you for ever ! !
i choose this bag for the surprise of orange that <unk> out and because it was not black it is light weight with a big zipper pocket on the front to hold the cord for my laptop the back has a full length open pouch that can hold books , mp # , cell phone , or boarding passes , or even a water bottle there is room in the main compartment for an # book along with my laptop . and even an external drive the strap converts easily into a shoulder strap so your hand is free there could be a bit more padding for the computer i think that if took a hard knock what padding is there may not be sufficient i am not sure if that is absolutely right so i stuck with my # stars since # is not an option
the <unk> # is comfortable and well-designed for a laptop and cords , and not too much more i could have used just a little more room , but overall i think it 's great -- light , compact , and comfortable for someone who needs to carry more , this backpack will probably not meet their needs there is a horizontal strap that keeps the two back straps closer together , and makes a big difference in comfort there are elastic pockets to keep cords in place without a size limit for them to be zipped in there are also zipper pockets to keep smaller items in place the front pocket makes it easy to keep a pad of paper or similar items easily accessible most importantly , it protects my laptop pretty well protected for day-to-day use it ca n't be thrown around , but there 's padding where it 's needed , without being bulky if i was worried about the backpack getting some abuse , i might look for a bulkier backpack with more padding
i bought this backpack for college because an over-the-shoulder bag was just not cutting it with all of the books i had i wanted a backpack that would keep my laptop -lsb- a # inch mac -rsb- safe while also having room for notebooks , folders and other school supplies without being too bulky i really think i got what i wanted the pocket is perfect for my laptop and i have plenty of room for all of my school supplies , and it is not bulky at all i would not recommend this bag if you want to pack a bunch of stuff , like # notebooks and # textbooks and a laptop etc . it 's a relatively small bag , so unless you do n't mind carrying your textbook by hand -lsb- which i do n't -rsb- , i would skip this one for a larger one there are plenty of other case logic bags that will work great this bag is perfect for a college student that just wants a simple bag that wo n't cause back pains and will keep their laptop safe
the case logic <unk> # -inch laptop backpack is another of the company 's functional hits much attention has been given to detail in its design the <unk> shoulder straps make it easy to wear like a regular backpack or to sling over one shoulder the <unk> underneath of the shoulder strap allows the backpack to <unk> securely when used over a single shoulder the extra strap material for adjusting the length of the shoulder straps has the convenient feature of providing a velcro loop to secure the extra length <unk> the product has several well-designed and constructed pockets and pouches for additional cords , connectors , and devices the person on-the-go will find necessary and useful there is a strap carrying handle between the shoulder straps so your computer and electronics may be carried like a briefcase in the main computer compartment , there is ample room for paper files or thin books this computer backpack is very attractively and functionally designed by people who have dealt with and solved the problems of the busy person at work or school
i like it a lot i love the red interior , the straps are wide and comfortable , and it has enough space to hold what i need without being bulky the interior mesh pockets are very handy for all sorts of accessories , business cards , etc .
i have put this bag through its paces and i am very impressed i have owned many different mountain climbing backpacks that are ready for anything you throw at them this bag can handle just about the same load i use the bag when i go on photo trips and it holds my dslr and mac with no problems this is a very good backpack that looks amazing and i would recommend it to anyone
if i had seen this in person , i would have never chosen it it looks cheap the handle is cheap and uncomfortable -lrb- not padded -rrb- the orange detail showing is not done well so it looks bad the strap is not padded and uncomfortable the laptop compartment , while padded , does n't seem to protect the laptop if you drop the bag -lrb- it is not a hanging compartment -rrb- in a professional or student setting , i 'd be embarrassed to use this
i had high hopes for this bag simply because of the brand : caselogic typically makes lightweight , well constructed items to protect your electronics case in point , my little camera case is five years old and still looks great and protects from bumps , scratches , etc . however , this laptop bag is disappointing fits plenty with lots of zippers and padding yes easy to carry no the single top handle makes for very uneasy carrying if you are not using the shoulder straps had they put a double top handle on this , i would give it four stars the top of the case folds over and to secure the closure you are stuck with two oddly positioned , sideways clips , both very hard to pinch and open other laptop cases have smooth and easy to operate clips , this one is really uncomfortable i would not use this as an everyday laptop case , maybe just for business travel since it expands to hold enough paperwork , pens , etc . to double as a briefcase
if you like to carry your laptop with all sorts of other items on the bag -lrb- books , a spare set of clothing , and other miscellaneous items , then you 'll probably be happy with this case if on the other hand , you like to keep the bag thin and just use it for your laptop + <unk> , you might be a little overwhelmed pros - construction is fine - decent padding for laptop , though bottom padding seems a bit lacking - layout is pretty good , with various pockets that are well organized cons - way too big it can probably easily fit three # inch laptops and still have room for books and other items - handle feels flimsy - strap lacks padding -lrb- and since bag is so big and you can make it quite heavy , it makes it even more <unk> , this bag is hard to recommend for the money there seem to be several better ones available , that are not only more comfortable and slimmer , but also less expensive a tough sell , unless you need a lot of room for your laptop and things , in which case this might work for you
this is a messenger bag meant to be slung on your shoulder to be carried it has great padding , enough pockets for those loose items and looks good the flimsy handle is just that flimsy sometimes i need to hold this type of bag instead of having it around my neck/shoulder this handle while it will let you hold it , feels as if it will tear apart after some use i have had that happen in the past other than that complaint it is a great bag that does a good job at protecting whatever you place in it
i love the colours in the inside and the out side is spacious enough for me after almost two years of heavy use carrying books and # . # laptop there 's no sign of frayed seams , damaged zipper or broken buckles the only down side in the design is the outside pocket which is very large and has a very long zipper , and sometimes is hard to find things there also if you ever forget to close that zipper and you try to reach your laptop or whatever in the inside of the bag , because the size of the pocket a lot of things will fly out
i purchased this item for my wife 's laptop she wanted a simple case that would protect her laptop from scratches when she placed it in her bag overall , this product fit perfectly , and was true to its advertisement one comment i have to make , is that the `` kickstand `` style <unk> as seen in the sample picture are extremely flimsy to the point that they are not useable other than that , great fit , works well as a scratch protector , and i believe it was worth the price for what i intended it for
other than the little plastic components that hold the laptop up that are rather flimsy , this cover fulfills its <unk> duties i hate having the laptop at an angle anyway , so the flimsy plastic components did n't deter me from purchasing this item another thing is , when i received the cover through the mail , i was disappointed to see that the cover was a bit more transparent than in the picture i thought in contrast to my white laptop , the cover would appear lighter than in the picture when i fitted the cover onto the laptop , it looked just like the picture -lrb- hot pink in color -rrb- overall , i <unk> happy with my purchase , for this was the only pink laptop cover i found on amazon -lrb- unless i did n't search thoroughly -rrb- it was a little pricey for just a cover , but other than the flimsy plastic components in the bottom , the rest of the cover is of a strong plastic that appears to be durable
i am not sure if this will fit my laptop i have an hp pavilion entertainment pc dv # will this case fit that i ca n't tell with the snazzy name in the title if someone could help me out , that would be great
this cover separates my macbook from my husband 's and daughter-in-law 's and my son 's otherwise we would n't be able to tell them apart it 's very sturdy and keeps my laptop looking good
this item is the best i could find for the price and fits just like my friends apple brand i would recommened this to anyone and you can buy # for the price of one when you are feeling like a new color
i bought this cover -lrb- # nd one i 've bought -rrb- this one was for my regular laptop , i also have one for my netbook , i absolutely love them not only are they cute ; they protect my computer and also let it have some legs which is great for the heat , my fan does n't run nearly as much as it used to i love this product and have recommended it to everyone that sees it
this product was reasonably priced and i received it within # days it was very easy to fit onto my macbook pro and so far is working as an excellent hard shell cover
i recently purchased this case along with a new macbook and i was thinking this would be a great product to help protect my investment it would help prevent scratches and what not . well was i wrong i put this case on my macbook and then took it off this was the hardest case to get off but wait that 's not all that was wrong with it i then noticed it took <unk> out of the top part and the sides of a brand new computer .
worst experience with seller , after # days this is what they responded : <unk> <unk> king jr was a holiday but we will have to refund the entire order . we have sold out be careful with amazon and their sellers , they 're not reliable and amazon , could n't care less
i order this and was excited i 'm owned speck products in the past and was very happy there is n't a lot of cases for the macbook white and i was happy that speck had one for such a good price it does not fit ! ! unless the one i purchased is mislabeled then do n't buy it sadly sending it back , because the one i have looks like its made to fit a macbook pro # ``
far different from what is shown in images , the material when you buy from apple and this one is far too different though the images look alike had to return them would suggest spending a few extra and buy from apple website or just go to near by apple store just to get a feel of what they have in store compared to what you are getting with this one though both are pricey for a product such as laptop case but then , they expect you to shell out money as an apple customer . :
when i first bought this case i was very happy with it it covered the macbook very nicely , looked great , and felt nice however , after some use the satin starts to scratch off this leaves the case looking horrible once the satin first scratches off it becomes very easy for the surrounding areas to peel off as well also , the clips that hold the case to the macbook broke this happened before a year went by which i do n't believe is a long enough life for the product i love speck but i just could not recommend this product
very low quality product first , i doubt that the one i received was new , because it looked so old and was filled with scratches i have used it for more than a week now and the matt finish of the product is peeling off the case is very hard and heavy the apple symbol is not visible because the case is so opaque ! worst experience
i ordered this case about a year ago and i just wanted to say it has n't lasted very long at all the <unk> is chipping everywhere and # out of the # tabs on the lower case are broken i always take care of my belongings and like to treat my possessions well i ordered the clear <unk> case and it 's much better
the cover feels really nice , but the `` soft `` coating is easily nicked and scraped off to reveal the plain plastic underneath i carry my laptop around in my backpack , and in several places there are large patches missing
it fits perfectly with my mac and it looks great it 's pretty difficult to clean though i have fingerprints all over the case and i ca n't ever get fingerprints fully off the case i would n't purchase this case again
the hard shell case is a good product but it adds much to the bulkiness of the macbook the top section does n't hug the plastic as tightly as i had expected , and it is thinner than expected making me feel an impact would still damage the screen on the opposite side so besides the supposed protection of blunt contact , which the case still most likely wo n't save the computer from damage , i ca n't think of any thing it can protect from besides scratches a liquid would still seep down into the many open holes left unprotected if you 're worried about scratches , just get a thin plastic cover my only possible judgement is it adds bulkiness to the computer that you still have to be just as careful with in the end
good product , keeps my mac fully protected on the outside the plastic is somewhat durable as well , and is able to withstand small shocks also , helps that it actually looks nice and sleek however , wish that it came with something that could protect the inside of the mac from scratches as well
this case works ok as far as protection , it does protect from minor scratches , but i do n't know about hard impacts it smells funny when first opened as well , i 'd recommend giving it a good alcohol rinse before using
bought the speck hard shell case after i tried the <unk> fits my white post may macbook very nicely has a great feel and you feel better knowing that when you carry around your beloved macbook , it is n't going to get badly banged up
i purchased this case with the <unk> that this was for the aluminum macbook pro but it was not thankfully i was able to resell this to friend thus i did not need to send this back to amazon i <unk> a red colored case for my macbook pro and i 'm pretty satisfied with it i 'd like the case much more if the case was not so susceptible to attracting fingerprints and discolored marks
one of my <unk> 's schools uses a specific size and model laptop as a standard , but different <unk> size and model handled by most retail or <unk> outlets the school makes the laptop purchase <unk> students , but not the protective jacket that fits it we were happy to find this available after <unk> <unk> stores it worked perfectly as far as any recommendation , we are sorry but can not recall the make or model of thelaptop it fits
i was n't really sure if this product was going to work and appear like i had hoped i <unk> a lot of products at a variety of sites when i got it i was really impressed by the quality , installation , and ease of <unk>
everyone should have one of these covers it makes grabbing your laptop out of your bag so much easier and provides a slimline protective covering i and my daughter have them and will always keep our laptops in them
it was exactly what i was looking for soft touch no sharp edges and very sleek and stylish , not as heavy as i expected fits perfectly on the newer # -inch macbook unibody price was cheaper than the speck website . # % satisfied
this cover is a wonderful product it has protected my mac countless times i would definitely recommend it only bad thing about it is taking it off once its on it has to be done carefully
works perfectly , fit 's like a glove bought two of these for my kids laptops -lrb- white macbooks -rrb- note , that this is not for the latest unibody version , but for the models before that kids love it because it gives their laptop a unique look , and i love it because it protects the laptops from getting torn up
this case is perfect for me it looks great , and protects my computer from everything i wish it was easier to come off b/c i want to purchase a new color , but i not complain great item to have ! !
i really wanted to love this sleeve i was looking for something sleek for my son 's laptop to use in conjunction with his backpack within a week of light use , the zipper came off the track and i have never been able to zip it up again
it is ok it fits my laptop , but i do n't feel that it offers very much protection the padding is thin it came with some foam in it as part of the packaging to help it keep it 's shape i actually keep it in there with my laptop for extra protection since the sleeve is not very padded
