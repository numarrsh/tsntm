i get many compliments on this bag i 'm able to carry my laptop , extra monitor , all my misc tech crap , and even a couple files ~ no problem since i 'm a <unk> & # # ; over <unk> & # # ; , i tend to load it to the max , and i 'm pretty rough on straps after <unk> several expensive bags , i decided to try something new ~ and more fun than the usual boring black bag even after a couple months of use , it still looks brand new , and the straps have held tight they 're the perfect length , so even loaded down , it 's still comfortable to carry this is probably my favorite laptop bag to date
i took on vacation as a carry <unk> it was easy to organize so i could get to needed items like ink pens , passport , ipad -lrb- perfect pocket for it -rrb- , computer , book , wallet etc . it held up well to the weight of all those items also like that it will stand up without falling over or being in a puddle
the white stripes were not as bright as i believe it would be i have a toshiba satellite c # and it did n't fit in the laptop compartment but i was able to put it in the bag with a couple of books and zip it close
this computer bag is great my computer is safe and sound in the padded compartment , and there is plenty of room for all of my cords , charger and lots of room for files and books
i do n't like how the circle cut does not really fit my apple logo also it was chipped from a corner when i received it on the mail : -lrb- but other than that it 's ok
i received my mac case cover today came before delivery date which is great the case fits perfect tight and secure , only problem is that the circle is a bit off but if you do n't mind things like that than you 'll love this product it also did n't come with the mouse pad the color is beautiful though , and i can deal with the circle being a bit off overall its a <unk> product for the
this case does cover my macbook air but it is far from hot pink the cover is more like a ruby red i wont be returning the case but figured you get what you pay for
this cover has worked out well for my daughter 's computer the only complaint she has is that the cut out for the apple symbol on the top of the mac book does n't quite line up with the apple it 's not centered
so cute , does the job i 've had it one my macbook for like a year now and its just now wearing out the corners are chipping off definetly lived out its life and i get lots of compliments on it when i take the cpu in public i got a matching pink keyboard cover too that looks awesome
love love love it this is the perfect color it arrived fast i have gotten quite a few compliments on it already obsessed with pink and now everyone knows it if you are looking at this online and you are not sure go ahead a buy it you will love it too i even bought the matching keyboard cover
a great case to protect your macbook air it fits perfectly i use it for school and home and even stuff it into my purse sometimes and the case does a great job of protecting the macbook totally worth the price of the case and i love having a pink macbook
i was very excited for this product to arrive in the mail , but when i received it , i was very disappointed it looked very cheap and the velcro was <unk> placed it did not live up to my expectations and to the great reviews that this product had ended up returning it
as many other reviewers point out , this sleeve is <unk> thin you 'll need something else to put it in if you want to protect it from impacts otherwise it 's great for keeping your mba protected from scratches and dirt
the pictures make the quality of leather look a little more authentic than it really is also , i dont like that it says macbook air on the front i bought this as a way to & # # ; hide & # # ; it in my laptop bag so it didnt stand out - lol otherwise its a great product and i would buy it again , might actually another one just to have
bought this for an acer v # p- # did n't even come close to fitting using it instead as a sleeve for an ipad air - fits nicely with the ipad air 's trent <unk> # . # clamshell case note : if the string bothers you , you can take it off and just let the velcro do its velcro thing . =
i was looking for a laptop sleeve for my new acer s # . # inches ultrabook knowing that my laptop is slimmer than the mac air , i purchased this sleeve i had <unk> about its looks i did not want something that was cheap looking or called out `` fake leather `` , but the sleeve rose above my expectations it looks nice for its price and i love pulling out my ultrabook from an envelope
this is a great sleeve for the macbook air i even have a very thin cover on my late # mac air , and it still fits -lrb- just a bit more snug -rrb- definitely is great for putting in your bag and not working about it getting scratched i am going to be adding more velcro to the top as the little circle and string just do n't cut it for me and are too much work -lrb- yes i am lazy ! -rrb- definitely recommend to protect your mac air from scratches and adds no weight it wo n't protect from drops , but not too much will without defeating the slimness of the air
have not had a scratch yet the plastic dot thing to wrap string around is cute but fell off on second day velcro holds flap closed fine anyway soft lining protects finish very well would be nicer if it had a carry handle or strap it 's a good buy
this is n't the perfect pouch for my asus transformer , but it is really nice i like the feel of the pouch about the only <unk> i dislike are that its a little longer than i expected , so it can be awkward
this item comes in time and it is very nice , its conditions is good i like this bag so much finally , i can find a pretty bag hold my mac everything works well
since buying my # `` macbook air , i 've been looking for some sort of case or sleeve i found this one finally , and it 's just right when taking my computer out of the home , it 's safely in my backpack , so i do n't worry about drops , but i do worry about mystery particles getting into my usb ports minimal look , maximum <unk> <unk> with a minimal price tag - perfect
this sleeve fits my # `` macbook air perfectly it is important to note that this sleeve offers virtually no padding it is simply an attractive cover which works for me i generally transport my macbook in my purse or backpack and this sleeves keeps it safe from all the junk in my bag the sleeve is attractive and slimline it is just as sleek as the macbook air i just got it in the mail so i am not able to tell you how durable it is but i do n't expect to be disappointed considering the price i paid $ # . # and amazon now has it listed at $
this little envelope snugly fits my macbook air and allows me to slip it into my briefcase without worry about the laptop being scratched a nice produce for a price that ca n't be beat fast <unk> to thank you very much
this is a great little case for the mac air # . # computer the fit is prefect ; there is no bulk this is for those who want to protect their mac air from scratches ; it offers no protection from impact i purchase this because , i believe , that the aluminum shell of the mac air is protection enough for the computer this case -lrb- and computer -rrb- can fit inside a regular bag or briefcase without fear of being scratched from other items within
long story short , the build quality and materials are pretty poor the string is very flimsy and cheap the red buttons are very loosely stitched on and do n't inspire any confidence the case is too large : there 's a lot of wiggle room for the computer the faux leather smells really weird and has a <unk> feel to it honestly , it is really cheap , so you are getting what you pay for however , if you 're gon na spend so much on the computer , it seems silly to go super cheap on the case i ended up buying the acme made sleeve less than a week after this case it 's a lot more expensive , but the quality is fantastic
the case does not fit a # inch laptop very well if you have a smaller laptop , it would probably fit better , but my # inch macbook pro does not fit well into this case
i like the interior fabric , it soft and protects i did n't like the exterior that much it 's got macbook pro engraved on the front which i did n't like at all -lrb- looks cheap -rrb- specially that i bought it for my air not pro otherwise it 's good for the price you pay
it was kind of not what i really expected , but it is good for those who like to encase their laptop and put it on their book bag it is not at all drop proof , and it is very thin and light
i got one that looks like a # yr old made in school for some reason an second one was sent that looks a little better but still not great people have actually <unk> at it when i took out my macair does n't bother me it was cheap and its job is to protect the laptop when in my backpack not a flashy laptop holder
i will be using this product for my macbook air it will be inside my backpack along with # or # other books the case could use some extra padding along the very bottom so i put some spare cloth at the bottom to compensate for it the inside smells funky at first too but it 's a cheap case that will get me by without taking up too much backpack space if it does n't work out good , it will at least hold me over til i find a better case
i like the looks of it , but i was surprised by how thin the material is almost no padding or protection at all if i 'd known i would not have bought it besides looking cool , it 's pretty pointless
the best thing about this is the price i expected my mba to be exact fit but it leaves lots of empty spaces around the edges internal cushions could have been better
ca n't say i was looking for a premium case so i got what i paid for just something simple enough for me to store my air -lrb- mid- # model -rrb- in while it 's in my backpack to prevent it from being scratched on something else bottom line : do n't spend more than $ # and do n't expect anything fancy
i bought this as an alternative case for a previous order i like the padding for the laptop and i enjoy that its easy to carry i put it in with my bag of other items quality is good
this laptop case was such a great and stylish way to haul around a thinner laptop like the macbook air it is thinner than other cases which i do n't mind since i can fit it easily in a larger bag such as a backpack or tote
this case does exactly what i wanted it to do it 's slim - i can drop my macair in it and slide the whole thing in my purse or backpack without worrying about scratches i did n't want a bulky case and this is not bulky at all some people may say ` why put your $ # computer in a $ # sleeve ? ' , but - for the number of times i transport my laptop - this bag makes total sense
this product is just what i was looking for my small notebook fits perfectly inside and is kept hidden on my <unk> or in my work bag when not in use
very different than the traditional case do n't buy this expecting a ton of padding it has a nice , felt like feel on the inside of this i use it to carry around my # & # # ; mba to and from class
purchased this in hopes that it would fit my # . # inch toshiba chromebook , it fits perfectly i would recommend this to anyone looking for a simple sleeve for their toshiba chromebook it is n't overly protective but it keeps it safe from everyday wear and tear and a great price
this is a cute litte case for the macbook air while it does not give a whole lot of protection , it definitely gives some and will prevent scratches and small dings it 's like putting your mac air in a manilla envelope - how unique is that this has a leathery look and a plastic feel and overall a decent appearance for the price it is cute and well made and is exactly as it appears i am sure you could pay a ton more for genuine leather but it 's a cute case nonetheless
this device does what you think it will do it is more of a fun device as opposed to one that will provide max protection to you laptop it is cute and does offer a bit of protection
i had hopes my series # would fit well in this but not so much sleeve is rather large i have since went the way of neoprene to fit the bill i do n't regret taking a shot on this , it 'll be <unk> to hold paperwork
i love this sleek , simple sleeve goes well with my elegant macbook air the interior is soft and slides in pretty smooth the leather outlook looks and feels great love carrying it out to school with my books the little red tag appears flimsy though , but is re-enforced by the velcro which holds the flap in place i 'm yet to figure out the purpose of the extra cosmos velcro strip that came with it a great product for # bucks even if i were to use it for a few months only , i 'd say this is certainly worth the buck !
feel like a real leather , soft with good quality . prefect fit for macbook air . you can bring it to anywhere you want and still have a good protection on your
everyone -lrb- and i -rrb- love this laptop case so clever and chic good if you are generally pretty <unk> about not dropping your laptop left and right as the cushioning is minimal
i needed a case for my work computer everyone i know has a <unk> neopreme case and i wanted to be different this did the trick it is <unk> and just different enough to do the job product arrived early and was exactly as described i had my concerns about the build quality with the price being low no need for concern build quality is great
this is exactly what i wanted , a slim case/sleeve that does n't scream that a macbook is inside there was no smell to the material , and the velcro and string closures have both held up so far during use inside messenger bags especially for the price , i would recommend buying this case/sleeve in the future
it looks as it should and fits the mac air <unk> with the lack of padding : i stuck a sock down there for the cushion for the occasional <unk> smell nicer too , with that new new smell , it 'll go away in time
this case will protect your macbook air from scratches , but not if you drop it from a # story building i use it when i put my computer in my
quality is pretty good , though not exceptional -lrb- i can tell by the single stitch seams that it will not last forever -rrb- however it looks good , it fits my macbook air # & # # ; very well , and it has just enough padding that the macbook is protected in my satchel i have actually gotten two compliments on it from apple genius bar employees , they think it looks snazzy
this is the perfect protector for my macbook air although it is n't a hardcase , it does protect my laptop from scratches , water , and dust it 's a great and cute product
they missed the mark in describing this product it is also a security device not because you can lock it up -lrb- you ca n't -rrb- , but because it looks just like any other manila <unk> you 'd see in an office you could leave your mbair in plain view and no one would take a second look , let alone think to steal it other than that missed & # # ; feature & # # ; , this is a great product as well it is lined with a soft felt also , there 's a velcro closure so it stays closed even if you do n't wrap the red string around the tabs size is perfect for my # & # # ; mb air price was right , product is great
i got my case without shoulder strap almost # weeks ago and i still without my strap yet , because ac customer service does not want to send me my strap i asked them may i resend them my case because i got not completed stuff but they told me they will send my strap as soon as possible i have no idea for what i have to pay money and carry my laptop on the hands ? ? ? ? i have been disappointed with my case would not reccomend
excellent case with various pockets the case is n't going to protect your laptop from large impacts , but it does a great job if you are already a careful person it also has several pockets for pens , your charger , a mouse , etc . for me , it is perfect i would recommend it for sure
i bought this bag for someone else in it , and he loves this bag he made a point to stop by mo office to tell me how great it is good job , amazon
it does what a laptop case is supposed to do without falling apart i was pleased that my # -inch lenovo fit snugly in the case without a lot of free space to rattle around in sufficient pockets to carry power supply , ethernet cable , etc . i 've had this product for more than a year , and i recommend it
if you need something light and want to fit your school supplies in it should be just what you 're looking for it might look big on images but it 's actually a little bit smaller than the average messenger bags i definitely recommend this to students and for people that need to carry their laptop and books just be sure you 're laptop/notebook can fit into this and i guarantee that this is worth the money normally , on the hp web store this would coast $ # plus s & h so buying this would save you some money
i was looking for an hp bag to go with my brand new hp laptop surprisingly , there were n't as many hp bag options out there as i would have thought there were a lot of & # # ; sleeves & # # ; but not many bags like this but i 'm so happy i found this one it 's very professional looking and it seems to be very well made -lrb- i just got it , so only time will tell -rrb- but all the zippers and stitching seem to be very well done and i hope to have this bag for a long time
i have only had it a short while but i really like it so far it holds everything i need to carry with me plus having an hp laptop the fix is perfect
i bought this bag to use with my # & # # ; hp laptop and it is perfect it looks sharp , has plenty of storage for charger , cords , mouse , cell phone , pens , notebook etc . the area for your laptop is lightly padded so i would caution this is a light weight solution to protecting your pc do n't expect the the protection you would get with the & # # ; suitcase type & # # ; i was <unk> with the low price but was delighted when it arrived i 've been using it for weeks now and it is perfect
top sticker is about # mm too large so some of it hangs off of the edge i had to trim it with a razor blade also the apple logo is cut about # mm too big around the entire logo would be nice if it were cut more to the exact size of the logo the bottom sticker fits pretty well i previously bought a set of carbon stickers from <unk> which fit better i got these because <unk> no longer cuts out the apple logo
not ecstatic over this purchase as it does n't fit perfectly over my laptop i had to really pull on it to get the apple centered and then there is a more space on one side vs the other i was hoping it would be a better fit , but overall it 's fine and will do for now
received my <unk> carbon fiber kit for my macbook air , and it is amazing the quality is <unk> , and the fit and finish wonderful it was very easy to apply the reason for # stars is that it does not come with a piece for the screen bezel , which throws off the over all look of the product slightly
this is an awesome product and is worth the money i really do like it it looks real it feels real i would definitely recommend this product to anyone that wants a carbon fiber skin for their mac
this product allows my macbook to stay slim and have some protection , plus it 's easier to grip -lrb- an issue i 've always had with the aluminum cases -rrb- the side mounted vinyl -lrb- minus # star -rrb- is starting to come off now , but the rest is holding up nicely it 's easy to put on
after only three months of dealing with mobileedge and hp i once again have a working laptop and a new bag i would n't have had to deal with hp if my laptop did n't break partly due to the poor construction of the bag i had no idea how poorly their laptop bag was constructed until after comparing it to some other name brands , and other quite cheap bags the problem is not the quality of the materials but failure of design on the various points which will carry the weight such as the shoulder strap connections , shoulder-strap and from what i read the handle itself i would be less upset if this had occurred after # - # months , but less than four weeks if you do much travel or have an # `` laptop then the current m # x is not for you or to put it another way , it is like a high performance sports car with safety belts made of string cheese
this bag is horrible the handles broke after a month of use the shoulder strap is still in tact -- but barely i was led to believe that this bag was made for the alienware # -inch laptop , but clearly the quality is not up to par do not buy this bag i am very disappointed to learn that i will only get a partial refund when i return this bag . : -lrb- <unk> !
the bag arrived in a timely fashion from the seller at an excellent price i would recommend this seller to anyone looking for a new laptop bag that fits a # & # # ; laptop the bag has plenty of room for all your peripherals and anything else you might want to carry , possibly even an extra set of clothes if you 're going someplace for just one night the bag <unk> is rather sturdy although i did notice a tear in the inside of the bag inbetween the laptop sleeve and the outer edge also the straps wo n't stay at the length i set it too but i think it 's because the laptop itself is rather heavy in the future i think i will go with a back pack style carrying case
the construction was good , and definitely fits my large # & # # ; asus computer i would liked to have seen more padding on the back panel to protect the computer a little better , there is a thin layer of padding , but not much anyone who is purchasing this bag obviously has a large laptop , and most of them are heavy , which would warrant more padding on the back overall it is a nice bag , roomier than most with adequate room in from pocket for small stuff , but i ca n't give it # stars because of what i think is <unk> protection
i honestly got this bag because of the tsa feature , i hate taking my laptop out and all that on the airports ... still it is pretty big , and sturdy i would recommend for #
i have the first m # x and this case is pretty good at keeping it secure and holding lots of extra gear if you load this thing up , you 'll find yourself lugging a good # lbs of gear , so do n't fill it up unless you are part <unk>
i have had this bag now for a few months now and its the best one i ever had . . so much room for everything . makes it nice and easy to pack up and
i love this bag it fits my m # x perfectly and has plenty of room for my accessories and documents i have gone through tsa inspection points at several airports both in the us and abroad and have only had to zip open the case and lay it flat on the inspection belt it also has a great pass through pocket that lets me place it on my roller bag , that laptop is heavy approx # lbs with the power supply , i rather roll it than carry it
i have a asus republic of games laptop , # . # & # # ; this # & # # ; messenger bag is everything i had been looking for it has a good quality , it is strong and fit my large laptop in very well it is a airport scan fast , it means , the bag opens # degrees the bag has a good amount of space and partitions inside i recommend it
i bought this bag # months ago with my alienware m # x , and it held up great with daily travel and # <unk> -lrb- nyc to seattle , and nyc to <unk> -rrb- bag is a little big to fit under the seat in front of you if you do n't want to put in overhead storage , but i was able to manage shoulder strap broke today on the way to work , but a call to the company and they said they will mail a new strap out for free the bag otherwise is holding up great and fits the computer perfectly -lrb- not sure if it fits the new m # -rrb- but is a great bag , strap weakness aside
i bought this cover a few weeks ago and the quality was terrible because it cracked and broke at the corner i am very careful with my stuff and rarely did i ever take my laptop to class so i do n't understand how it happened but hey , at least it was n't my laptop do not buy the rubberized cases were so much better
this is a very good looking case that fits the computer very very well but the bottom portion latches to the computer right where you wrists rest when you type and the plastic pieces scratch and cut the wrist when typing it is so incredibly uncomfortable so , i 'm going to have to send this one back :
bought this for my daughter for christmas i liked the price , but should have done more research before purchasing she has only had this for # weeks and it has numerous scratches on it this has to be a knock-off of the real apple product lesson learned , stick with quality you know -lrb- apple -rrb- and pay the extra money worth it in the long run
gave this to my wife to help protect her macbook but it did n't last more than two or three months of being carried around everyday plus lots of gunk built up under it which looked disgusting
so i wanted a cover for my macbook pro and i found this one i put the pictures up , but with the pictures i did not mention that it was already scratched when i received it i was n't too concerned since you do n't see the scratch when the case is on i bought this product on august # , # and now i am buying a new case the corners have chipped and the case is starting to scratch my laptop as long as you do n't take the cover off then it will stay clean i was considering buying this case again since the price was good and i used it for a whole school year , i think i 'm going to look around a bit though if i do buy this cover again then i would also be buying a soft bag/case to carry it in
the cosmos case is pretty `` meh `` ... it fits right on the macbook and protects it from scratches and dents , but i have noticed a few problems for instance , i 've only had the case for a few months , but two of the little round pads that are supposed to keep the mac from sliding on tables have already fallen off also , the part of the case that covers the bottom and faces towards the user has begun to crack i believe this is because i have to remove the case every once in a while to clean out any dirt that gets in the bottom part of the case yes , the case `` does its job `` but i do n't think it 's worth the $ # . #
this laptop case is ok , but it has some problems that bother me the case is kinda cheaply made with some sharp edges and corners the finish is not very smooth this makes me feel that it will easily scratch my macbook and even make some finger cuts another problem is that the bottom design does n't provide good ventilation and ca n't help the laptop from overheating overall , this case is a fine product but i would not recommend it
overall i thought this was a good buy , -lrb- pro -rrb- after installing the cover i was very satisfied and love the color ! my biggest worry is that it wo n't look like the picture but it does and i am extremely happy that my expectations were met -lrb- con -rrb- does have a little sharp edges on the wrist area but not too bad
i love the color of the case it fits the macbook pro # good , but it could be a bit sturdier th clips that snap into place can be easily <unk>
i just recently bough my # inch macbook pro , and i wanted a simple and cute skin for it so when i found this , i ordered it immediately , it shipped really fast the color is just like the picture i was kind of worried that it was n't going to be that see-through but it is , so i will be purchasing a decal sticker as well it is easy to put on ! the only part i did n't really like is that it is fairly loose at the bottom . but other than that i am extremely happy
bought it , liked it but dust kept getting trapped under it so when i would occasionally take it off to dust underneath it it would fit perfectly till one day the bottom half of it broke because the tab things must of popped off when i kept taking it off
love the case it makes my mb look so pretty and unique the only complaint i would have is that the # rubber grips on the bottom fell off after only a few days i would recommend though
the case is made of plastic , so it 's prone to have cracks and scratches when not handled properly i am quite a picky person and the tiny little scratches on it kind of bother me however , they are barely even noticeable it was kind of difficult to pop the case onto my macbook pro , but after putting it on , it looks great this is a great buy for only $ # in comparison to the $ # ones they sell at the apple store in addition , the two-day shipping was accurate i got mine delivered to me the morning of the second day
this product came within # days and i am very satisfied the color is very nice and no cracks i was kind of worried about purchasing this product due to the reviews but i really wanted something to protect my macbook pro and i did n't want to pay $ # there are some edges that are n't as smooth but it is great for the price and the bottom has little circular tabs for non slip protection the picture is pretty true to color and i really love it i would definitely buy another one and recommend it to a friend
it definitely does the job and looks nice it 's not very bulky either it 's a little hard to put on , but other than that no complaints looks incredible with the purple keyboard
i am not extremely gentle or rough with my laptop , but after # months of use this thing is falling apart it is cracking all over and breaking apart i will likely need to get a new case within the next month if you are looking for a case that will last the long haul i would not advise getting this thing
does n't fit right the product is flimsy and the edges are sharp i thought about sanding the tabs down but i just ended up returning the product go with incase costs more but you pay for what you get
the product feels nice in your hand and it fits macbook pro nicely however , there are # problems the case does not cover the lower back corners of the macbook pro ; # the edges of the case have uneven sharp leftovers from the cutting process at the factory # . the case has cracked at one corner on the second day , <unk> any sign that it was hit or <unk> anyway so , overall , looks nice , low quality
great case for my mac it is a dark charcoal gray/black color as some others have said my only complaint is that the little rubber `` feet `` on the bottom peeled off and left little pieces of rubber all over the place wherever i had set the computer -lrb- desk , couch , my lap -rrb- i would buy this case again if something happens to this one
the item is exactly what was stated it has a smooth , grippy feel as well i know i needed something to protect my macbook at the house or in my case when going places , and this product does what i need this will help out , since i have very little wear n tear , lol it even shows the logo when its on , and the ports are accessible decent price too i would recommend
this is a pretty good case i was really picky about what i wanted since there are limited covers in stores this is a good color and the apple shows clear just in case you want to <unk> it fits better than more expensive cases but i probably get a different one eventually since this one always looks dirty for no reason i would recommend it since it 's a great deal for the price and fits better than some of the # dollar models another review said it was hard to take off but i disagree just my two cents
so disappointed to find out that this case does not fit certain mac 's as advertised i bought this for an older model i use as a back-up according to the specifications it should accommodate the following apple computers apple macbook air , macbook pro # , macbook # , ibook g # superdrive , macbook core # duo # . # inch case does not zip closed on an <unk> # otherwise it 's a decent and pretty cool sleeve for the price wish the manufacturer would have been more honest and accurate saving myself and others the time and trouble to return and now shop for another
put my laptop in , which is a # in macbook pro and the stitches ripped i now use it for my ipad it was n't a lot of money , but the quality is lacking
this is a great cover i have a # inch macbook pro , and it fits well not as snug as some of the covers , but it works also , it 's way cheaper than the covers sold at the mac or apple stores i love <unk> things , so i love this my only complaint would be that it has a few frayed strings around the seams , but it 's nothing major not in danger of falling apart or anything
i had hoped the jacket would have a little more padding , the padding it came with seems smaller than the actual case and leaves corners unprotected the material also is n't very stretchy , nor is it neoprene i had to carry it through a light rain and was very happy that the jacket seemed water resistant if it was neoprene the water would have soaked in , not beaded off it fits my # inch well overall , i am pleased with this product
