spend the money using for grad school and work not a biking bag , so if that 's what you want check out another line in this company the medium size fits my # . # inch laptop
i love this messenger bag because it is lightweight and easy to carry my imac and ipad fits well in the computer section and other necessary items fit will in the other section would highly recommend it
this bag is awesome it holds all my gear for work , and them some there are plenty of pockets and compartments that make it easy to stay organized it is comfortable , even when completely filled i go through security checks quite often , and the security guards appreciate the separate laptop compartment it was a great purchase
this bag was a gift from me for my husband about two and a half years ago after learning of timbuk # 's reputation for long-lasting and durable bags , i knew this would be a great pick for my husband that would be a a rugged an durable bag plus hold all of his stuff the bag is huge for a girl , but since my husband is the one carrying it , he absolutely loves it he loves that he can carry so much in this messenger bag and that it still looks cool regardless he carries it about twice a week when needed to different events , classes , or church , and it enables him to carry all of those extras that he needs as essentials on those days this is a beautiful bag in all red and very durable and excellent in material and construction i would especially recommend it to men needing something to carry a computer , books , a change of clothes and lots of other things in whether during each week or for extended trips wives , your husband would probably love this bag in the larger sizes
love this messenger bag i wanted something a little more appealing than a backpack this fit the bill it has enough compartments to carry almost anything . # things i really like are the tsa friendly compartment -lrb- just unzip it and lay it flat -rrb- , and the lower compartment for the power cord it comes in different sizes , so depending on the size of your laptop , you can choose the size that best fits your needs
hold # & # # ; laptops and accessories with ease also able to hold many others despite it 's size works well over the shoulder if on a motorcycle as well blue is different than the black i am always seeing everywhere very happy to have found this
item was described as like new , but when i got it , it had all the new tags on it , win win for a # dollar savings love the bag tsa hasnt given me any problems , works like a charm with traveling for work , no more having to take out my laptop ... :
i really like the laptop + kindle pocket in the rear there are enough pockets in the front without being excessive it 's large enough to carry # or # notebooks , my edc , but not so large as to encourage <unk> . the exterior seems rugged , the strap is comfortable i have n't come to a conclusion on the & # # ; buckles & # # ; i certainly like them more than the generic plastic buckles but they can be <unk> to hook up and unhook overall , i am really pleased with this bag and will be using it for a long time i would buy it again
what else can i say great all around bag i bought the small i carry a surface pro , nexus # , power cables , portable charger , extra mice there is a spot for everything , with tons of room to spare
about nine months i made probably the best purchase i have ever made , i bought this fantastic bag and have used it every day since i used to take backpacks everywhere i went totally destroying them after about six months this holds more , is more convenient , and looks better if you need to take a laptop , tablet , external hard drives , and a variety of cords everywhere you go buy this bag
awesome bag , everything where you need it and construction is obviously top notch i would highly recommend it - student or business use alike the only thing missing is a dedicated media pocket with headphone <unk>
i 'm using this bag for school and so far it has been great the design is awesome and keeps all my <unk> organized neatly the bag feels nice it does not look or feel cheep i 'm sure this bag will last me a long time one thing i will note is that if you will be using this bag 's main compartment for anything more than a couple notebooks and # large textbooks , then get a large bag
this bag is fantastic air travel with a laptop is a breeze with the zip out lay flat compartment watch the video and you should be sold just like i was
i 'm a third year dental student and have finally finished getting through the heavy <unk> portion of school which requires me carrying around lots of heavy books i wanted a bag which would easily hold my ipad and # & # # ; macbook air along with my cables and chargers this bag is everything i wanted - light weight , durable , sturdy and easily organizes all my gadgets i love that i can easily access my ipad without having to open the main buckles - just need to unzip the back pocket also air travel is super simple - just unzip the bag in half and throw it on the conveyor belt no need to remove your gadgets since its tsa compliant i would highly <unk> this bag to someone who does n't want an overly large messenger and just wants to carry around some gadgets and light paperwork also , love that the water bottle holder actually holds a standard water bottle as well as my <unk> coffee <unk> huge plus in my opinion
very disappointed in that it can only be worn over the left shoulder i have <unk> my shoulder and was looking for a one sided bag for that reason otherwise no fault found
overall , the bag itself is great and seems to be well put together , and i ca n't really add any more than other positive reviews have said like the title says , i have one very minor complaint : the padded portion that acts as the laptop sleeve is pink it makes no sense why in a black and charcoal bag the inside has a pink portion , but it 's not that big of a deal as it 's not <unk> obvious my one gripe with the bag is that the way it 's put together makes it lean forward when it 's sitting on a flat surface all the pockets are in the front , and it 's very difficult to get stuff out , because you 're constantly fighting the books and anything else that are leaning on the stuff you 're trying to get out the only way to easily put stuff in and get it out requires picking up the bag and leaning it back
just received this bag as a christmas gift and it is exactly as i had imagined it the size is just right and the materials seem tough and durable just been using for a # days now and <unk> i am love with it the materials are tough and strong , very thick and seem extremely durable the interior is full of great organization , including a great padded and soft little slot for like a cellphone the interior also contains great compartments for both a laptop and an adjacent slot for a tablet that perfect fits my nexus #
it 's durable , it 's been relatively weather resistant , looks good , and is comfortable -lrb- can be adjusted to wear in several configurations -rrb- my only complaint is that there are no feet for stability on the bottom if you want set up upright , but the more stuff you have in it the easier it is to stand it up
i have this bad and pretty happy with <unk> # -rrb- waterproof # -rrb- laptop zipper is handy # -rrb- lots of padding around laptop and <unk> # -rrb- no water bottle holder i have to put my water bottle inside the bag , which if it <unk> everywhere would ruin the laptop # -rrb- bulky i actually use the side strap fasteners as a way to lock down the front hard to explain , but the bag is wide enough i can put shoes in it i do n't need all this extra space and bulk on the sides are two loop rings i use the strap that came down with it across the front and compress the bulk some
i like this bag a lot its basically water proof in rain and is very comfortable there are a lot of options to customize it with other timbuk # products and in how you can organize your stuff in a perfect world the bag would be more light but the material is the way it is to be sturdy and to provide protection against rain my biggest criticism is that the laptop compartment does not work as i imagined when i put my # inch macbook air in the bag i can really feel it against my side when i have the bag on and it fits very snugly which is good but bad in that the stress between your body and the bag all rests on the laptop also the included strap is very stiff and is not very comfortable you will be better off buying the deluxe strap from timbuk # and using it instead of the included strap , it makes a huge difference this is still the best messenger bag i have found so it does receive my recommendation
this bag is pretty much as i expected based on the other reviews here i 'm looking forward to wearing it in a bit as the strap is rather stiff and uncomfortable , but it 's loosening up as i use it it 's really versatile and i find myself using this bag for everything , every day
this bag is awesome the materials , design and construction are top quality this bag is also huge -lrb- size medium -rrb- i only carry my mbp # `` and a few other items each day this bag was overkill and returned for that reason i ordered a small size <unk> # bag
in regards to the bag , i loved the bag , the color , and design i made the mistake of looking at the <unk> listed and assuming my # inch laptop would fit which it did not according to timbuk # 's website i needed a large bag when i received the large <unk> it said for # inch laptops in the end , i ended up returning this bag # times due to incorrect information and specifications
my timbuk # bag is wonderful in many ways , high quality , many storage pockets , a nice padded sleeve for a laptop my only problems is that i find it a little large according to the timbuk # website , the small would fit my # & # # ; laptop , but it did n't so i traded it in for this medium bag it fits the laptop but is a little too big for my shoulders -lrb- i am # ' # & # # ; -rrb- however , it holds everything i could need - ideal for an overnight bag or carry on
this bag is the perfect size for me to use at work whether i 'm just carrying my computer back and forth , or i have a load of papers to grade , this bag fits the bill excellent quality and construction and plenty of room for all of my stuff the only reason it did n't get # stars from me is because i found the constant noise of velcro incredibly annoying and distracting to my students every time i opened the bag some people appreciate the extra & # # ; seal & # # ; the velcro provides i just found the noise <unk> this was simply solved by getting some velcro at the craft store and cutting it to fit over the parts on the bag , now it 's nice and quiet and plenty secure using the plastic clasps
the bag is the perfect size for my mba it also fits a # & # # ; hp elitebook -lrb- barely -rrb- and a # & # # ; vaio -lrb- even more barely -rrb- i did n't buy the bag for the two bigger laptops , so i was n't expecting them to fit at all the strap is comfortable and easy to adjust it has a buckle that allows you to release all the extra slack to remove the bag easier , then snap it back in to easily get the proper carrying length the only downside , and i do n't feel i can knock a star , is that it has a lot of velcro that can be annoying the opening flap has # velcro pieces in addition to the clasps the laptop compartment itself has a velcro strap the external sides of the laptop compartment velcro to the inside of the bag great product - i 'm sure i 'll get used to the velcro
i would recommend you to get this bag if your a person that works and goes to school full time i have this bag and i am organized it is the best commuter / messenger bag i ever had , i bought so many over the year but nothing ever came close
we bought this bag to store our dvd players and dvds for a recent car trip after purchasing a timbuk backpack for work it worked perfectly it was very roomy and allowed us to compartmentalize all of the things we needed to store we 've only had it for a short time , but ca n't wait to try it again
slim shape holds everything has separate compartment for ipad and laptop and room for tall coffee container , notebook , lunch , and incidentals i bought it on sale so
this has done everything i need it to do and more . i was n't sure what to expect but everything i have read pointed to timbuk # and i can confirm this . defiantly a good choice
i really really loved this messenger back it was the best bag that i 've ever owned very well built and only quality materials went into the bag you can tell it was carefully designed and manufactured
this bag is even better than i thought it would be holds both my # & # # ; laptop and my ipad mini padded pockets provide excellent protection for both originally i ordered the same bag in the & # # ; medium & # # ; size thinking the extra space would hold my gym clothes this was too just large so i exchanged it for the & # # ; small & # # ; and now could n't be happier
waterproof , slight padding , well made one of the best bags to use in a million ways computer and tablet pockets , room for books , lunch , thermos and the daily necessities , and maybe a change of clothes put your camera bag inside and do n't look too much like tourist commute by bike and the empty bag sits flush against your back and can hold your helmet , shoes , and gloves while at work or school
i seem to go through laptop bags every # months , someone mentioned the timbuk # brand to me , did some research and loved the colour of this bag more than happy with the bag , it has numerous pouches and pockets to hold virtually everything i cart around with me strength seems good , will <unk> this report if it drops below my standards in the future
i have a # . # & # # ; laptop that i 've often found is tough to fit into backpacks or other cases in this bag i 've got enough room for a much larger laptop as well as room to carry everything i could possibly need to haul to the office
i was looking for a messenger bag to hold my ipad and # & # # ; hp laptop i was looking at tons of bags and read lots of reviews i settled on the timbuk # line of bags and then had to decide which model to buy i looked at the specs of the bags and measured my laptop and decided on the <unk> model when it arrived i was impressed by the quality of the material and craftsmanship both are top notch my laptop fit snug and secure and the ipad pouch fit my ipad with smart cover perfectly there is enough room for a couple of magazines as well as other assorted cables and items my only complaint is the the shoulder strap is not removable and is sewn into the bag if the shoulder strap is twisted i have to <unk> the strap rather than other models that mount using swivel clips that allow the strap to spin freely and <unk> much faster
two years ago i switched over from my regular backpack to messenger bags when biking to and from work i 've tried a variety of bags , including chrome bags , and fell in love with timbuk # the bag is super durable , and completely waterproof this was a big concern of mine , because of the rapid changes of weather in northern utah the shoulder strap is comfortable , and the side pocket allows me to quickly reach my house keys or cell phone without opening the entire bag
i bought this for my international traveling son , and it has survived trips to england , italy , <unk> , <unk> and switzerland it still looks brand new and it is functionally a great bag do n't hesitate to buy this messenger bag timbuk # creates great products
this is an awesome messenger bag it feels heavier and has more form than our other <unk> osprey messenger bag although the osprey is # years old and maybe it is because of age we think the osprey is more refined and ergonomic it has the little touches that the timbuk # does not , waist belt , padded side , ergonomic handle the timbuk # is heavier duty the size is larger -lrb- med -rrb- , the material heavier whether the timbuk # lasts as long and well or better than the osprey remains to be seen we would buy again the material of the timbuk # is heavier , but the osprey has a stiffer back panel than the timbuk
the construction is great timbuk # does what they do well comfortable , expandable , efficient laptop sleeve it would be nice to have an easier to access outer pocket for a <unk> , but it 's not a big deal
the true test will come after our european vacation hubby will use this as his & # # ; man purse & # # ; for our day trips to <unk> , <unk> , etc . otherwise , the quality is excellent -- we expect it to be quite durable and will last for many adventures -- and the sizing seems to be just right for its intended use
i commute on foot , transit and bicycle year round and this bag is really nice i like having seperate laptop and tablet pouches quality is typical timbuk # which is of course very good but as per usual timbuk # practice the shoulder pad is not very good if you want a good pad you have to buy an <unk> one they are only too happy to sell you i find this size too small for me in the winter when i need to carry around additional cold weather gear -lrb- hat , gloves etc . . so i do n't use it in the winter instead i use a size large of the same model
great size , functional for my daily traveling needs ; the medium was too large for daily activities but good to use as a carry on flight bag weekend bag ; have both
i should have bought this years ago instead of being cheap and bought other brands which are cheaper the material is super strong - this bag is going to last years after years tons of inside pocket . . and the best part is zipper on the back - i can reach into the bag without opening up the
i am so glad i got this bag , it 's great for my daily commute to work at first i felt like it was too big , because i was upgrading from the small size , but once i started to use it it was fine
i really like this bag my # . # macbook pro fits in it just fine could use some more pockets with easier access to pens and small things that you use on a regular basis it is dark inside the bag and sometimes hard to see what you are looking for in the pockets
ordered this bag on a colleague 's recommendation when my laptop bag of # years tore in a place i could not repair received in the mail within # days of ordering at first , thought that the bag may be too big for me , but after using the last # days , i am completely satisfied the bag is big enough to haul all of my essential gear and junk from home office to my university office i commute on foot strap , once adjusted , <unk> the weight in the bag for good balance across my back and shoulder compartments allow for separate storage and the bag is roomy enough to bring lunch , reference books , sweater , laptop , wallet , and keys without any issue really dig the napoleon pocket as it keeps my keys and wallet in one place i can readily access can not say enough about how great this bag is for organizing my things , convenience in my commute , and comfort
i think the best part about this bag is that it 's waterproof it has separate compartments for a laptop and an ipad , a plethora of pockets for smaller items inside and out and it 's very comfortable to carry around i highly recommend this bag
i must say that this bag was much larger than i had expected i bought for school and when i saw it , i thought it was overkill however , i find it to be a good size for me if you are a bean stock , then bag will be a tent for you it is a well made bag and i look forward to using it for the the <unk> future i have two qualms : first is that the laptop pouch is huge , my # & # # ; laptop is swimming in the pouch , not a bad thing , just a not of caution second , there are no dividers in the bag , so if you have a bunch of small book or such , they tend to swim around
excellent quality , waterproof , feels good on my back the medium size was a little larger than i was thinking it 's a little large for general daily carrying around -lrb- though i do it anyway -rrb- , but it makes an excellent commuter size ... and it also makes an excellent overnight bag being a guy , i do n't need much so this actually would have plenty of room for me to take on a three day long weekend
i rate tis case about # inch short on all dimensions it fits but i worry about the corners quality is quite good i found another use so i 'm going to keep
before buying this bag , make sure to visit timbuk # <unk> and look at their size guide for laptops amazon is listing this bag in # and # inch sizes , but that is somewhat misleading the external dimensions of the bag are approximately # `` but internally -lrb- because of the padding -rrb- it is smaller as a result it will not fit any of the # `` macbook pros this only applies to the # edition of quickie the # edition has a medium size which is perfect for a # `` mbp i wish the # could house a # because the position of the straps is more ergonomic -lrb- on the # version it is a little annoying to open the bag while wearing it -rrb- overall though the build quality is high like all timbuk # products and has just the right amount of pockets
after reading another person 's review , i realize now that my bag must be a # because it houses my macbook pro # inch perfectly i really feel my computer is protected , with the red <unk> <unk> kind of interior lining it is a small , streamlined bag , something i was looking for , as i already have a few messenger type bags that i tend to put too much stuff in and gets extremely heavy there 's a flap on the outside that houses an additional # pockets ; perfect for putting a power source or other mbp accessories plus , i love the green color it looks great , is durable and protects my computer with minimal weight and space all in all , a very good well-made bag
i was in the market for the thinnest , lightest case with briefcase handles i ca n't stand those sleeves with elastic straps that you are supposed to grab underneath so this bag fit the bill i would prefer that they could hide away as with other competitors , but this bag was lighter and thinner than most of those also , the expanding pockets are a good size and can fit everything i might need ; however , i wish there were a few organizing features in them for pens , business cards , and travel cards the rear slash pocket should open at the top the opening # . # inches below the top is a pain because you need to fold # . # paper to tuck and get it into the pocket so i 'd say best in class , but # changes could make it perfect
perfect fit for my ipad + keyboard case , cords , and such i normally use this inside a larger bag or briefcase , but this is what i need to carry just the ipad inside my office or home
just bought the # `` quickie for my netbook it 's bigger than i need , but it gives me plenty of room for an external optical drive and the power cord like my other timbuk # bag , it 's very well made and should last forever i got mine at a discount store for about $ # , an absolute steal
my son had to have this one and it is not what we were expecting it is hard plastic , and has a very cheap feel the fit is such that it limits this monitor so it ca n't be completely opened -lrb- close to laying it flat ? -rrb- i would say it opens to the `` normal `` range , but my son likes to open it way open for some reason or for some applications i would not recommend this product to others
the fit was n't the greatest and the back of it where the the two pieces come together make a clicking noise every time you open up the computer not only that but the thing is constantly trying to come off and the rubber coating <unk> off as soon as you even look at it this cover in one word , garbage . spend your money <unk>
expensive junk . not impressed with the quality vs the price if it were n't such a <unk> to return it i would i also thought the apple would be cut out so that the illuminated apple would not be affected but the cover . . but it is covered . <unk>
the case began losing its rubberized sheen on day one the case is not rubberized as advertised . it is simply coated in a way that makes it appear rubberized i do not recommend this case and i am dissatisfied
the hard plastic case did n't fit right on my macbook and the front edge seemed to rise up too far to be annoying on your wrists while typing
as soon as removed the plastic wrap , i noticed that almost half of the case was rubbed off and looked as if it was used and old not transparent enough to see the apple not bad for the price , but i would rather spend a few extra dollars and get a good quality case
this is a very nice item to cover your laptop its just what i wanted , with a silk feel and its transparent enough to see the apple when its illuminated the one issue is that its starting to peel on the sides and i have had it for about # months overall , dont stress too much about that because it is n't too noticeable just irritating overall it is a good product and i would recommend it
my family is slowly <unk> to apple products i bought this for my wife and her # `` macbook pro , but when opening the lid it seems to slightly catch on the bottom piece it does open all the way , but barely rubs the top and bottom pieces the one that i purchased in the apple store for my macbook pro works perfectly and does not catch like this one , but they are made by different manufacturers she is ok with it slightly rubbing , but i would n't keep it
awesome i like how i can see the apple symbol through the case the only issue i he is it kills my battery fast , but i can deal with that i really like it and recommended it to my sister
does not state that this is a macbook air cover , does not fit my macbook pro complete waste of money the case was shipped very very slow and poor quality , when the case was received , it was placed in an envelop and the case itself was folded which left permanent marks , horrible
the sleeve was nice , even though synthetic it was a tight fit to my macbook , but worked as claimed however , it does n't offer much protection from bumps and bruises instead of a laptop sleeve , it is now used a permanent envelope that is carried in my bag for transporting documents and the like -lrb- two thin pieces of cardboard are used as reinforcement material for stiffness -rrb- i would buy again , but as a folder instead of a laptop sleeve
i am pretty well satisfied with this sleeve it gets the job done from protecting your macbook from scratches however , i wish that the buttons were real instead of circular pieces of fabric i have the # white unibody macbook and this fits just snugly another downside is that when i put my case onto my macbook , the sleeve is a really tight fit i know it 's not meant to be used with a case but it fits just barely anyways i would recommend it to anyone how does n't want to put a case on their macbook
i read the reviews , and want to point out that # it is not a protective case and # . the `` button `` is rather delicate that being said , i 'm not the type to throw a computer around , and my new macbook pro # `` laptop fits perfectly , and rests nicely in a <unk> interior it 's great for packing , but you have to keep in mind that it 's still delicate the <unk> tie is still intact , though the button is made of vinyl , so it needs to be dealt with <unk> i really like the case , the condition it keeps my computer in , and the way it looks if you 're looking for a case that will protect your computer through a natural disaster , this is not the case for you if you 're looking for a case that 's slim , fits the computer , and looks nice , it may be just right for you # out of # for it not having a more durable protective case , but being awesome anyway
a bit darker then i thought it was going to be ! but i still like it a lot my macbook pro fits nice and snug in this guy will definitely keep it from getting scratched but wont do much from getting squished . soft case not a hard one also make sure to keep inside clean anything hard -lrb- like sand -rrb- will still be able to get between your screen and keyboard if its inside the soft case already
i bought this to keep my macbook protected and stylish and it definitely did it is not insulated which would 've been great but it works great because i already have a cover on my laptop
i have a unibody aluminum macbook from early # the fit of this case was tight at first but it loosened but quickly and it fits my laptop quite nicely i love the look of it , too i wish the cord and buttons seemed less fragile , as i 'm a little worried they 'll rip off in my backpack , but otherwise it does just what it needs to it 's just a sleeve , so it 's not heavily padded , but it 's certainly sufficient to protect a laptop from scratches or dings in a backpack or other bag
i have to admit , the product image makes it look a bit yellow and more & # # ; <unk> & # # ; than it really is i was expecting a sleeve with a look very similar to the <unk> yellow packing envelopes , but nonetheless , it is the same product the inside leather felt is even better than i thought it would be and i can see myself using this for a good long while
gf got a new macbook and needed a sleeve for her bag . she 's vegan so wanted something non leather . just as durable as a leather one . looks exactly like the pictures
this cover fits my macbook pro -lrb- # inch -rrb- perfectly it does not provide as much protection as a padded sleeve , of course , but for carrying it around in my backpack it is nice i also wanted something i could wipe down now and then , which was not really possible with the padded covers i had before i have been getting a lot of compliments on this somewhat unusual cover , too very happy , especially for the price
i love the way this looks while also providing protection for my macbook pro it does n't add much bulk or weight at all so it 's great to put in a purse , briefcase , and etc . the only con is that i wish the velcro strip was wider and the string connect the lip to the base was made of a stronger material that did n't fray
this case is so ridiculously funny and cool it protects my laptop just fine and it 's a very unusual case i love it very very happy with my purchase . :
i love that this case looks , at first glance , like a plain office envelope it is understated enough not to draw attention to itself i feel more comfortable carrying it around or leaving it in my car than i would a bright neon case that screams `` i 'm a really cool computer steal me ! `` the thick vinyl material provides some protection from wear and tear , dust , and gentle falls the macbook fits perfectly inside it comes with a velcro strap for the power cord , but there 's no place for the power supply i wish the red `` buttons `` were really buttons , instead of vinyl cut-outs they would be easier to use but that 's a minor issue this case suits my needs perfectly
i use this case when i have a non-laptop bag that i wan na bring and this gets the job done of protecting your laptop no , it does not protect it from drops or big damages but it does protect it from getting scratched from your other things in your bag plus , you can leave your laptop on the table and nobody would even realize it is a laptop so somewhat this is a thief deterrent
unfortunately , my acer did not work out of the box i turned it on and immediately the acer <unk> management application came on and started a ` recovery ' process this is not what i expected and it made me think that something was wrong . # minutes later , i got a ` reading the <unk> error ' , and the recovery stopped at # % restored this further confirmed for me that something was wrong , and since i 'm not very technical and would n't even know how to fix this , i am returning this asap i am rating it at least a # , since it looks pretty and is very light i 'm sure it 's great when it works
great netbook with large hard drive and small size the built-in web cam is not the greatest but gets the job done great netbook for travel or for people on the go
i bought this mostly because i wanted something lightweight and with a long battery life and in that regard it 's great i do find it a little slow , but i 'm used to my sony vaio and the benefits are much greater than any complaints i have
i was looking for something small , light , and portable to take around with me during my grad school <unk> this netbook is exactly what i was looking for the color is amazing -lrb- one of my <unk> -rrb- and the features are great one issues that i have noticed is with the skype feature while using <unk> , the video tends to be kind of choppy and the audio is ahead of the video not sure if that is something with the computer , or something with the way that it is connected to the internet i 'm not very tech savvy , so i 'm not entirely sure overall though , i think this is a great product
powerful hardware for a netbook , at a good price screen is above average , though not as nice as a vaio screen battery life is very good i get # hours , but of course this depends on your use case you might get more and it 's very portable i 'm so tired of mobile <unk> on phones and tablets that just do n't cut it it 's nice to have a real full featured web <unk> and a keyboard
this is a great computer ! ! it 's very light , but it has a nice big screen the <unk> pattern on the cover is very pretty it makes a awesome school computer well worth the price
this mini pc is meant to claw back market share from tablets it is <unk> configured as compared to the other five star rated acer # . # with only # gb of ram and a smaller hard drive i 'm buying from a warehouse club for a huge discount rather than paying over <unk> that just me
this computer is just the right size for carrying around in a backpack or having next to you on the couch -lrb- wifi <unk> -rrb- the processor with # gb ram gives fast response time when moving around the internet and gets you where you want to go with no problems having # gb memory for this size computer comes in handy for all your needs whether it is for itunes purchases or anything else although it has no bluetooth that is easily remedied by the purchase of a <unk> adapter for about $ # . # and it works just fine the screen is excellent i have a desktop and an ipad so this is just something to <unk> what i have and not my main computer i like it very much
have taken this backpack on two trips , first trip the chest strap came off , next trip the laptop section zipper came apart the manufacturer -lrb- asus -rrb- would not warranty
the bag has lovely features , great pockets for all of the gadgets you 'd want to have on hand , and a generous main pocket i have a g # <unk> # , and the laptop pocket is too small for this laptop it does fit in the main pocket , but who wants to waste that much functionality also -- the zipper for the main pocket is light-duty ; the brand new backpack already had a <unk> around the corner i would n't recommend it for a heavy traveler so -- great features , but the intended laptop does n't fit , and it is n't that durable
this backpack looks really cool and it 's huge and there are lots of small rooms to put other stuff but there is big problem i have asus g # sx # inch i bought this laptop backpack to put my laptop in but my laptop didn & # # ; t fit in ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! if i push it , it will go in but still i can & # # ; t close em ... .
comfortably carries all of my equipment has way more storage space then it appears the backpack appears sturdy enough though i have only had it a few short weeks the bag itself is comfortable to carry
got this bookbag for my son 's asus <unk> # x # . # inch laptop and it fits perfectly also holds a ton of other gear lots of pockets there 's a <unk> of this bag on youtube that shows how much stuff it holds in addition to the laptop that sold me
purchased # . # for my g # jh and this backpack is great note that the laptop pocket is a very tight fit but if you jam the laptop into the bottom correctly the zippers close without stress -lrb- few ! -rrb- the main pocket is absolutely huge with room for a # textbook that is # pages plus other stuff including your power brick and cables and a lunch bag <unk> you could put in a multimedia projector and a <unk> the top pocket has room for you mouse and a dvd box set two side pockets -lrb- one left and one right -rrb- can each fit a # ml water bottle i have no regrets a bag that matches your laptop is a must and will impress the security dude at the airport oh - btw after a week on my g # jh - i just could not take it anymore - i downgraded from win # to win # happy as a <unk>
this is a no-nonsense laptop bag for the asus g # h it fits perfectly in it has cushions on the back to enable airflow between your back and the bag the two side pockets are large enough for the brick power adapter that comes with the g # it also has a back pocket which i use for cables the top compartment is large enough to hold a pair of bose or beats headphones inside the bag there are two pouches that can hold small items like pens , notepads etc . i carry a number of books to school in this bag it is well built and sturdy had it so far for about # months - no issues
i have had this bag for about # months and it seems to have held up rather well it is on the large side though , which is fine as long as you 're tall enough to not be <unk> by it it fits the asus g series laptops -lrb- the ones with the hump in the back -rrb- however the fit is a bit tight if the front compartment has a lot of stuff in it overall it 's a decent bag , and among the limited laptop backpacks available for # inch asus g series laptops , it does the job well the main problem with fitting the g series into an ordinary # inch laptop bag is that they do not account for the large hump at the back , but this does , so you 'll be good to go comfort is okay , will give it a # . # , but then again carrying around a # inch hunk of <unk> was never meant to be comfortable few notes -- it 's only water resistant in the front where the logo is the area around the top where the zippers is quite <unk> unfortunately -lrb- got some notebooks wet in the rain : s -rrb- solved this problem by keeping a small umbrella in one of the side pockets - cellphone pocket in front is too small for larger smartphones -lrb- galaxy s # does not fit .
small size with lots of room fits a dell latitude # in computer well if there was more padding around the computer it would have gotten # stars inside felt protects scratching but not from drops and bangs
i love this bag i was looking for a slim vertical messenger style bag for my # & # # ; macbook , but i still needed room for the occasional documents , folders , books , textbook , etc . i did not want a big bulky bag or backpack this bag seemed like a good option , as opposed to a super slim laptop bag with no extra room this bag is very well made and tough the inner pockets have plenty of room for anything , and the bag stays very slim when not full the inner pockets for electronics are soft felt material i ca n't imagine would scratch anything it is very comfortable and balanced to wear as well i am very happy with this purchase
this case is huge , much bigger than my laptop the foam is really cheap and stains easily lastly , the foam padding is not dense so it really does n't protect my laptop , it just makes it feel soft definitely would not recommend this case
the thing is huge , but it 's not # . # inches , its more like # `` my hp slides around in it i wish it was snugger , but it gets the job done
received this sleeve in the mail today i give three stars for the following reasons : the box that the sleeve was placed in for shipping was smaller than the sleeve because of this , the velcro end of the sleeve was folded and subsequently -lrb- perhaps permanently -rrb- wrinkled along the folding side while this does n't impact it functionally , it looks as if i 've used the sleeve for months when it just arrived in addition , there is also a <unk> in the fabric on one side i do not doubt that the product is new , just that it has been handled without care if i had seen these defects in a store product i would not have bought it for the cost , i expected a better appearance the sleeve does fit my # inch computer i have no doubts about its functionality
