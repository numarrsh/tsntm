needed a case to hold my new hp with # . # & # # ; screen this seems to be one of the best reviewed cases on the market for the price shipping was <unk> to my house in # days odd that <unk> did not provide an e-mail that they had delivered item , as i was away from home at the time case is nicely padded case has several extra pockets for storage amazon got my business because of the price + free shipping ca n't go wrong for the price
lately , case logic has been producing some new -lrb- for them -rrb- types of cases , and they 're doing a wonderful job this case is meant for carrying a # or # inch ` laptop ' . if you have one of these enormous machines , this is a good case to look at it 's well padded but not so thickly that it adds bulk to something which is already big enough there is ample room for your monster pc plus its charger , mouse , etc . and outside pockets let you carry smaller items too , . the shoulder strap is also nicely padded and removable i 'd say this is an excellent case
bought it for my dell # and it works fine and has adequate padding i probably should have bought the more expensive leather targus bag , but i did n't want to spend that much money at the time this bag is just fine if you do n't plan to carry too much along with your computer fits my power adapter , mouse & pad , some pens , a notepad and all of the paperwork and software discs that came with the computer
plenty big enough for the workstation , without <unk> the corners room enough for the # watt powersupply room enough for the # tb portable backup drive i shifted the velcro padding used for smaller laptops around so that it helps hold the computer in the velcro strap holds only one side - now the padding holds the other side , so the computer does n't fall out i would like more pockets , for passport , calculator , other stuff the messenger bag might do it if it came in the # inch size
i bought this for my dell xps # this laptop is smaller and thinner than the case is designed for , so i added a couple of thin sheets of <unk> to create a snug fit overall , the case meets my expectations and i feel it 's a good value
very high quality case the only problem i have with it is that the foam strip that they give you to help hold the laptop in place could be a little sturdier
plenty of space , which i like a lot as a student i can carry my # . # inch laptop , ipad , two thick notebooks too a good buy i had to replace the shoulder strap because it would squeak every time i took a step , so that was annoying but overall , a great bag
i had the case in my <unk> seat and i had to slam on my breaks and my clip on the shoulder pad broke but , other than that its nice there is lots of room in many compartments and the strap to put over my luggage is convienent
the case what just what i needed fits my laptop perfectly and was priced right amazon got it to me within the week and i am very satisfied pleased with the ease of use and the quality would recommend to anyone needing a carrying case for their # inch
this case is really nice and big i use it for my portable # `` lcd tv and there is plenty of space for a very small dvd player in the front pocket i also have space for the ac adapters , cables and remotes for both devices
i bought this for my son to use at college with his # `` laptop it seems to be working well for him and he likes it however , one of the metal loops that attaches the strap to the case broke i think it was poor design & cheap metal we replaced the loops with more sturdy ones we had on the <unk> and it is now back a college with him even with this small problem , i would buy this item again way better price that at other outlets for the same item !
i purchased this case for my husband who travels a lot and is also in school first i thought i would never find a case large enough for his laptop without loosing quality he has a # . # `` computer that fit extremely nice in this case and still has room in the front pocket for his tablet it is very well made and looks nice for travel
this item has many compartments which i really appreciate i would definitely recommend this laptop case to any laptop user who needs an # & # # ; a laptop case it also holds all of many of my additional items , such as my wireless mouse and the battery charger
it came earlier than i expected and was everything i expected i had a terrible time finding a bag large enough to take the new machine and this one does that easily without a lot of <unk> bulk
this laptop case is not only sleek and attractive , but super roomy inside , with separate compartments for everything from pens to flash drives to paperwork users can choose between a short handle or a long shoulder strap for their convenience , and the case itself is very well-padded , protecting the laptop against any possible damage this is a superior product
although the case itself has ample amount of storage and protection for the laptop , i found it is really big for me there is just extra weight that i have to carry for no reason also , when i put my files and folders in the case , the weight becomes almost unbearable other than that though , it is perfect to store all the necessities and protect laptop
a little small , but i knew that going in the only gripe is the carrying strap since it is an s style metal hook with no closure , i worry about it slipping while traveling room enough for a <unk> power supply and mouse , but not much else happy so far with it
cases for # inch laptops are still not plentiful , although the selection is getting better this case is a good choice for the money seems sturdy , with extra room for files padding is sufficient for normal use if you travel a lot and subject your computer to rough handling - well , you might want something a little heavier however , for trips to and from the office or school , or just storage for your computer , charger , etc . , this case is just fine also , good price , fast delivery
i do have a # . # inches lap top and it was little difficult to find the perfect fitted case for the computer this product is good enough to carrying my computer and few more stuff
affordable protection for your notebook , but it can only carry the basics this is not a notebook case to impress anyone with , but it is well constructed the outside pockets are where you must store any cards , cords , or discs and the power adapter the outside pockets have good zippers and do expand enough to carry the <unk> items an adjustable shoulder strap is included
i love case logic stuff and i am really happy with this laptop bag but i hate when amazon ships via <unk> it seems the postman can not walk the extra # steps to my front porch , like the ups driver does the postman can only lean the package up against my garage door , where everyone <unk> by can see it not that i live in a high <unk> area it 's just tacky i know amazon has no control over my postman and the item did arrive on time but <unk> , anyway - amazon needs to save a dime on my shipment
i was a little nervous about ordering this bag because of some of the reviews stating that is was slightly too big i am not disappointed it does have some room in it with the divider that is included , i was able to adjust as necessary for my wife 's laptop which is a # inch now , the reason i only gave # stars is because the bag feels flimsy i would not go as far as saying poorly constructed as the bag seems to be very well made however , i was hoping for less & # # ; give & # # ; in the <unk> and a little more weight i know that saying i wish the bag was heavier does n't make sense , however , the best way to describe it is that it weighs as much as a child 's empty backpack it is very light-weight and that adds to the feel of flimsiness that i am trying to describe
my last bag was leather and was uncertain if i would like this bag i have now used it for a month and am happy with my purchase bag seems to be well made and should stand up to regular use
i have another <unk> laptop case that cost me about $ # , but was looking for one with a little more padding to protect my # `` laptop this does have a little more padding -lrb- very little -rrb- but i 'm not convinced it offers three times as much protection as my other case there are plenty of pockets to store all the accessories i need for mobile computing , which is nice it is light , which i appreciate while carrying a heavy # `` laptop in it it has also held up well under moderate usage
took the case on a trip recently , which is the reason i purchased it in the first place it worked fine , with plenty of space for the laptop , power cord and mouse additional pockets held an sd card and some papers my only quibble : although there is a padded velcro divider to make the computer fit snugly width wise , there is nothing similar height wise - just a strap to hold it in place this set up seemed to work fine , but i would have preferred another divider to snug against the laptop height wise that keeps this from being a five star rating otherwise , the case seems well made and has plenty of pockets for additional items it worked fine for the six days of the trip i ca n't comment on how it will hold up long term , although as mentioned it appears well made and solid and i expect it to last for quite some time there is n't a big selection of cases for larger laptops ; this one looks like it will work fine and last
fit my # inch asus g # vw laptop perfectly i immediately replaced carrying strap with a strap with metal clips it did have weak plastic clips there is plenty of room in the bag to carry my # watt power brick , a mouse and my external backup drive i have only had it for a day so i ca n't comment on how well it will wear
everything is padded fine , lot 's of roomy space -lrb- i have a # . # in laptop -rrb- compartments are nice and plentiful only gripe i have is the handle , it looks like it could break over time
very nice case as expected from case logic products very hard to find a case that will fit my asus g # s computer , but this case fits and provides a little extra space of other items very good buy ! !
nice light case with enough compartments to make me happy some compartments a little small for all the accessories like the charger and the mouse and cables , but not <unk>
the case is well made the central compartment has ample room for my toshiba # . # `` laptop there are numerous other pockets in the additional large pocket to store the power supply cable and desired accessories for the laptop the zippered exterior pocket helps to keep items organized and protected from the weather and loss the carry straps are substantial and comfortable in your hand overall , a very functional laptop case which provides great protection and storage for your laptop and other items
the styling is pretty conservative , but there is n't a lot of choice in this price range when you have a # `` laptop it 's soft-sided and sturdy , it retains its shape it 's made of a durable fabric and has plenty of room for the power cord , a small mouse plus file folders and note pads in the other section the strap does detach , but if your laptop is heavy it 's more comfortable using that than the carrying handle alone
a lot of # inch laptop bags will not accommodate asus g # series due to its air vent protrusion in the back this bag does but it wo n't carry much more stuff once you stuff that huge power supply brick i do n't like to lug the asus around too much but if i have to , this bag is pretty much my only option it is reasonably well-built and light weight but not sure if it will hold up to rigorous daily use the zippers and shoulder clips , while not heavy duty looking , is not too flimsy the padding is adequate the main compartment will open up <unk> style with padded divider to the side the bag profile is fairly slim and look understated and none too flashy looking , which i prefer
does exactly what you expect good solid case with plenty of room for accessories strap can be a bit uncomfortable when the bag is full , which is why it only gets # stars
my laptop is not # & # # ; but # & # # ; gaming however , it being super wide , i had to get a bigger case that being said , this one works , but they do n't really allow it much room to expand outward in holding headphones and power cable and <unk> the <unk> might be pushing it , but closing the accessories compartment of the case makes it feel a little tight , though i have not had any problems with failure of the zipper
this lap top case is exactly what i was looking for great storage for power cord , mouse , pads of paper , etc . delivery was much faster than anticipated and it was an all around great experience i would not hesitate to order from this outfit again
i looked everywhere for just the right case for my # `` laptop this fits my needs perfectly when i started looking for one i did not find a very large selection for the size , or for that matter a decent price i should have checked amazon.com first , it would have saved me quite a bit of time this item fits on both accounts it is perfectly priced and has more than enough room for all the extras i carry around
i had a terrible time trying to find a case for my asus g # x with a # . # & # # ; screen this case is quality from a reputable company , case logic , and fits my accessories product arrived quickly and in great shape and at a great price my previous notebook bag from inland pro would not zip with the computer inside and could not fit the charging brick
i was looking for a bag that would house my asus p # . # & # # ; android tablet -lrb- yes # . # & # # ; android tablet is correct -rrb- most of the # & # # ; and # & # # ; laptop bags and sleeves were still too small for the p # this bag is perfect and also fits the stock keyboard in one of the pouches there are plenty of other pockets and zippers to store things too for me and my p # , this was a perfect fit
i bot this as i needed a messenger case with laptop access i have n't carried a laptop yet but the case has a great deal of useful room it 's well constructed , i have room for a book , pens , phone and pads the laptop compartment is roomy and i can carry large files and even an umbrella easily i have to say i am impressed with the price and quality of the
just got my case logic laptop case for my hp # . # laptop very happy with case logic - the case is sturdy , appears well made nice smooth zippers very well padded and organized compartments the <unk> strap and shoulder strap are both very well padded - which is very important as i carry my laptop all around campus all day - and this one stays comfortable it is also extremely light weight will update on durability review on amazon 's service - laptop case arrived with <unk> prints all over it there was quite a delay to ship the order another product on the same order and same shipping method but from <unk> direct arrived a couple days before amazon even sent out their products for shipping
i was pleasantly surprised at how great this bag is it has plenty of space for flash drives , cds , notepads , pens , etc . the one thing i do n't like it that it has green trim on parts of it i wish you could choose what color you get -lrb- it kinda <unk> with my mouse & laptop skin as they are both purple -rrb- that is the only drawback to this case it is padded to protect the laptop , there is plenty of room for the cords and even room for the cooling fans
i purchased this case in november # and it is sturdy and large enough for a # . # `` laptop computer it is well padded for protection of my computer and has ample storage space for additional cords , chargers and other smaller devices
i tried several cases that stated they would accommodate a # . # `` monitor none of them did very frustrating and irritating i finally got smart and ordered this case for an # `` monitor it works great , looks great , and has been comfortable to use so far
this laptop case is great it was just what we were looking for it fit our new # . # & # # ; laptop perfectly , and all the little areas it has to put things is great , it has lots of room you can carry extra files , small notebooks , extra accesories for your laptop it has places for pens , pencils , all the little extras that you need to stick in your case to carry with you if you are taking your computer with you somewhere we were worried about <unk> a laptop case by mail without seeing it first , but this case exceeded our expectation it is awesome i will definitely recommend it to my friends that are shopping for a laptop case they wo n't be disappointed , i was n't
my husband needed a new case for his laptop and this one is huge it fits not only his large laptop , but also a lot of college textbooks it is attractive and very functional for a college student and seems durable and comfortable so far
i bought this for my grandson 's new dell laptop which measures nearly # & # # ; wide it 's a great case , fits perfectly and has the best features for his use best of all , the price beat every other source i found
i can put my asus g # sx # . # `` , macbook pro # `` , and power supplies in this bag i mean i can put # laptops and its power supplies in this bag although this bag looks not `` fashion `` , this bag is good for large laptop if you 're looking for a `` fashion `` bag , do not buy this bag if you 're looking for a bag to put your asus g # sx , buy it
i took a chance on this bag , having accepted the recommendation without doing any research it turned out to be a great bag it 's big enough for the monster laptop that i bought and has sufficient padding for normal use it also has plenty of space to carry around the many little things i need with my laptop . headphones , mouse , checkbooks , the charger , etc , etc , etc .
i 've been using this for several months to lug my # . # `` laptop to and from work daily it has room for the laptop , and the front zippered component has room for my ipad and the power supply with room to spare it manages to do this without being overly bulky it is well made and is n't showing any visible signs of wear at this point if you have a # . # laptop , this will fit perfectly i would like a little more cushion , but that would probably make it more bulky , which i would n't want i 'd give this # stars because it is exactly what it says it is , does exactly what it is designed to do , and is exactly what i need for what i use it for i would n't recommend it for heavy use such as airline travel since you really need a more robust solution , but this is perfect for carrying around in the car for short trips
i have a new # inch acer aspire laptop and this bag holds the laptop perfectly with just a little additional room for extras its a <unk> but is solid enough to do the job
i wo n't have to buy another one . i bought the # `` for my # `` laptop . . everything fits and room for more misc . . was a great purchase .
my asus laptop fits inside perfect . # . # was not cutting it -lrb- damaging the corners -rrb- this one is great you can adjust the velcro inside to fit any laptop also has another velcro strap to keep in place looks like a good bag i 'm pleased
this case is just what i was looking for it is large enough to hold an # -inch laptop along with it 's accessories it has additional compartments that can be used securely hold other items such as documents , books , checkbooks , etc . even though it is larger than previous cases i have owned its dimensions should allow it to fit under the seat of most airplanes i have n't tested this yet but will do so in the near future and will modify this post with the results
i absolutely like this case it is durable , sturdy and has plenty of room for my # & # # ; asus laptop and power supply to fit in one section the middle section open <unk> and has more storage space for my paperwork , some cd 's / dvd 's , mouse , usb cables , and flash drives , and smaller cables the outside pocket also has plenty of room for external hard drives and other small devices , adapters , and cables it is bigger than i expected but i needed the room so ca n't complain about that i recommend getting a size bigger if you have extra stuff you like to carry in your case like i do i have # external hard drives , portable speakers , headphones , backup usb charger , flash drives , and other cables and such very nice case and very pleased
this is a really great laptop bag i 've used it for a few weeks now , and can really say that this is my favorite laptop bag ever it 's got a place for everything i need for my laptop , plus more pockets for my personal belongings it also does n't hurt that i 've gotten compliments from people on my way to/from work the bag is sleek and strong and i have no worries that my laptop will get damaged , even if i dropped the bag
i love this case it holds the laptop in place it has an adjustable padded divider to customize to your own laptop . a velcro strap to hold it in place securely also it has lots of pockets for papers , notes , accessories , pens , & pads in a seperate section it also has a handle , shoulder strap , and a strap on the back that holds it on luggage with a pull up handle it was a great deal then there is another smaller , zippered pocket in front for other things lightweight , but still sturdy
excellent carry case for larger screen laptops it has very good storage space and compartment pockets that should give most people what they need quality zippers and nice finger tabs for easy operation the shoulder strap is average web nylon with plastic <unk> tabs good padding inside and adjustable velcro strap for extra security was the best for the price in # inch size
i 've owned a lot of laptop cases that cost a lot more than this one and was never thrilled with them this case cost less than any of the others and is much nicer i love all the storage pockets for storing accessories it 's made well too
amazon never fails to have what the customer needs this laptop case is perfect for my laptop if you are looking for a case that has everything , this is the purchase for you
i was very pleased with the size and construction of this case . i do not have to use it <unk> it is perfect when i do need it for putting all my supplies in ... my camera , notebooks , pens , and cords all fit perfect with room to spare it is very comfortable on the shoulder strap andi find it works better with the strap shorter . very good purchase and yes i would purchase <unk> hope this helps you decide , perfect if you have a large laptop , like me , # . # fits perfect
the case is the perfect size for the # inch computer it makes the computer seem very light when carrying it in the case there are plenty of pockets for all the extras i love it
this case logic # inch laptop case was an exceptional purchase it has lots of storage space and is well padded to protect my laptop i recently took it on a # week trip and it was life saving to have all my work with me and i felt secure in knowing it was well protected i love it and highly recommend it
bought for a new hp # . # inch computer room for computer and charger in the main compartment nice storage area in the additional pocket could have done without the green accents , but really only shows when the extra storage area is open great medium sized bag larger and more storage than a sleeve , but not a big bulky case either
this i would recommend this laptop case to anyone looking for an inexpensive case for a large laptop it arrived in good condition and so far is doing its job well and without problem i do wish it had a little quicker means of sliding in and taking out the laptop ... but that has more to do with the style of the bag instead of any problem with it good low cost notebook case
if you want an affordable case that is good quality and fits up to # `` then you 're in luck i would n't try anything beyond # . # `` max for widescreen laptops zippers seem above average and the strap is what you would expect but with nice hardware -lrb- metal and pretty easy to remove . i use it without the strap because the handle is sturdy and has nice foam padding the various pockets hold things pretty well and the front opens nicely it has good structure but that also means you ca n't overfill it if you filled all the pockets you would n't get it to close properly ... but having so many pockets allows you to utilize the space very efficiently i paid $ # and i would have been willing to pay $ # if i had seen it at target good it guy
i got this for my wife 's # in widescreen laptop and its perfect lotsa room and very well made if you got a # in laptop this case is perfect
case logic is an excellent brand this holds the ipad air even with the smart cover and protective cover on the back it also holds your charger , and has handles
i paid $ # for this , and it does everything i needed it to do i 've seen better quality carrying bags , but not for $ # the paddings are sufficient , i 've dropped it with my laptop in it a few times and nothing broke , although i 'm not recommending doing that over and over again the feature i liked the most is the amount of space in this bag there 's enough space to fit a # . # gaming laptop , cooling pad , huge ass brick <unk> , a # ft # outlet extension cord , and a wired mouse in this thing did not expect that
this actually was everything they said it was and was perfect for my # . # toshiba i use it in real estate work and i just love that it gets protected until i am ready to use it got it in # . # days with free shipping great deal at # . # and change it was exactly the deal i wanted
perfect to carry a hp entertainment laptop -lrb- <unk> -rrb- along with power supply , mouse and a few papers it is not a briefcase . but a very good case for a # `` laptop
i was searching for a carrying case to carry my # inch macbook pro and to add extra protection to it , at a reasonable price but just could not find one i then <unk> upon this carrying case the moment i received this case i fell in love with it , it is the right case for any macbook pro since the sides are reinforced a bit to avoid your precious investment from being crushed the green color to it gives it a professional look and the bag itself is not bulky it has enough room to carry extra stuff , example : cell phones , tablets , chargers , pens , calculators , etc .
there are n't many laptop cases the will fit an # & # # ; laptop this one does so , with room to spare i wish they had more styles and color options , but oh well ... does what it 's supposed to
as expected and looks great i certainly recommend this product for my # . # inch laptop it is a bit large but the adjustable mechanism inside the laptop is extremely flexible and can accommodate # . # inch to # inch laptops there are two extra sections for notebooks , cellphone and other devices very comfortable and mark my word this is one of the best purchases i made on amazon . kudos to shipper for shipping it within a week and for the condition of the product
i am very , very pleased with this purchase i recently purchased a # inch pc and went looking for a laptop case in the most popular stores found a few i like , but they were <unk> i went searching on amazon and found this case logic laptop case read the reviews and did some research ordered it and i love it highly recommend anyone searching for an oversize case , to check this one out you will not be disappointed
i purchased this bag for my asus g # <unk> i have heard that the asus g # wo n't fit in many bags for # inch laptops the bag has some protective padding there is a strap that will keep the laptop from shifting inside the bag this is nice as there is an extra couple of inches length and an extra inch depth and height there is also an adjustable pad that will allow you to shrink down the extra width i 'll be able to easily fit some extra items such as a mouse , trackball , and touch pad into the pockets there was n't anything wrong with this bag
since i ordered it during the christmas buying season , it was a little slow in getting here it seems to be a well-made and reasonably priced case only time will tell how well it will hold up with use by a teenager

this is a good basic case for larger laptops well built and sturdy enough to do the job it is n't real thick so it is n't real bulky but has adequate storage for power supplies , mice , etc .
i tried to find a case for my wife , but i had no luck my oldest daughter said go to amazon there were plenty of choices my wife was very happy
i have a # in hp laptop and this fits perfectly there 's a strap on the inside that keeps it secure and the material is very sturdy i also like the fact that the main compartment zips all the way open just in case i 'd like to work within the bag the price was the icing on the cake
i like everything about this case the area where the laptop is stored is very secure and well protected i liked the other compartment where you can store papers , books , passport , etc . it 's easy to get to i also like the wide elastic strap on the back , if you have <unk> with a pull out handle you can slip it around the handle and it 's very secure finally , i like that even if you did n't put anything in it , it still holds its form it 's well worth the price
this was a exceptional product it was a little bigger than i expected , but i love it it has enough space for the lap top and its cords it has a zipped <unk> ment and sleeves to insert items
great laptop case fits a # & # # ; laptop like a glove had case logic cases in the past they look like new after # years of use i expect the same out of this case
this bag is fantastic i have tried so many that would fit my # . # `` laptop and files but nothing else works i finally received this bag and i am truly satisfied -lrb- finally -rrb- great job designing and manufacturing this bag
exactly as advertised i bought this to use with a wireless microphone controller i needed something big and this is it i can get the controller , # wireless mics and cables with room left over
i love this computer bag i have a # inch screen toshiba laptop i could n't take it anywhere cause could never find a bag for it i love the bag , definitly helps since i 'm in college and work so can transport my computer easily anywhere its pretty durable for general everyday wear and tear
the case looks a bit bulky in the pictures that i 've seen but in person it 's not bulky at all in my opinion it 's kind of slim , which is what i wanted it 's definitely a quality made bag that has a lot of pockets and openings in order to accommodate all the things i need to carry around i have a hp pavilion touchsmart # -n # us # . # & # # ; laptop and it fits perfectly with a lot of room for other items as well
i have both a # inch and # . # inch laptop that i may put into this case , obviously not at the same time both fit well , although the # inch has room for the power supply in the primary compartment , with a velcro attached padded divider -lrb- included with the case -rrb- between the laptop and power supply for the # . # inch , i move the divider to the far side of the case , and it makes the laptop fit very nicely , putting the power supply into the big zippered pocket above the laptop there is also a small zippered pocket in the front after nearly a year , it does n't have any issues with the zippers or any real signs of wear
i have a # . # -inch laptop that does not fit into a backpack it 's actually probably larger than most # . # -in laptops because it extends <unk> than an inch past the screen when folded down this laptop case provides the protection it needs along with sufficient space for any accessories it carries and looks more like a brief-case than other case logic laptop cases and seems to provide a little more structure as well
i have had case logic products before and have always been happy with them i got this one for a # . # inch hp and it has room for a wireless key board as well
it is a great laptop case i use it specially when i travel abroad as it has lots of compartments and space for other peripherals and accesories , books , receipts , office supplies , etc . the strap is very comfortable and with this case is very easy to pass tsa security reviews at the airports you can accommodate any size of laptop in this case -lrb- for instance i use it even if i 'm traveling with a light weight laptop -rrb- i recommend this product to everybody
