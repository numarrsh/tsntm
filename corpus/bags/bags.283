it was advertised as fitting a macbook air , but it does n't fit not that it cost much - a few dollars i really wish the description had been accurate do n't always believe with you read
this item got dirty and i wanted to wash it separately so i tried to remove it from the macbook it does not come off in one pice the top cracked it protects your macbook well but there is not a really safe way to clean it -lrb- and it gets dirty easily -rrb- because you can not take it off without breaking it i could not return it because the return period had ended
flimsy plastic that barely made it out of the wrapping ! when i read rubberized im thinking it would have some give . almost scratched my new mac . just bought a replacement case
although you get what you pay for this the second one of these that has n't held up to very light use the plastic just seems very brittle especially the bottom piece
there 's not much i can add to the title this shell is cheap both in terms of price and in terms of quality it 's pretty enough -lrb- for a while at least -rrb- and has decent fit , but under even light impacts it will crack the problem is this thing is made of polycarbonate that 's the same stuff they make cds out of , and it is very prone to cracking it actually does n't even take an impact to crack this case , especially since the thing has a really tight fit - just letting it sit around , one corner developed <unk> cracks after about a month of use the feel of the case is nice , and it 's a nice color and yeah , it 's not expensive - but you really get what you pay for
+ + i will just say this case only can give you a basic protection from scratching unfortunately , it will smash in your bag when crash on the air 's charger , bad quality and cheap plastic + + moreover , this case will block the heat dissipation while playing games your air will get really hot when this case is on . + + it is cheap , and everything is cheap try something else
it 's cheap ... but so is the price it does what it needs to do ... protect my computer from scratches , and i like that it was cheap enough i can replace it whenever i want
it was a great price but i do n't like how if your fingers are n't exactly clean -lrb- kids fingers -rrb- it marks up the case so it looks greasy and then i 'm always cleaning it
i believe the case is a good product the shipping and handling is quite expensive in addition , the casing covering the the back of the screen should secure abit better
bought this for a # . # macbook air it is made of cheap plastic -lrb- hence the price -rrb- and cracks / chips <unk> without anything happening to it it also requires some fitting the back part of the lower case sticks out a bit and <unk> the screen from folding back all the way this is n't a big deal if you trim the area -lrb- a dremel or file will work -rrb- the top case fits very snug and i used a small file to take off some of the plastic clip part so it would go on easier the case works , its just not top quality you get what you pay for
granted this was only $ # , but the bottom piece has many slats so if you were to put the laptop on water , it would not be proctected the speck clear case is a lot more expensive but is better designed , having no slats on the bottom so you will never have to worry about water being on the area you are using it
<unk> you use something like a debit card to slide in between the air laptop and the green case , you will break it when you try to remove it mine was broken in a week boo ! ! !
i 'm not a mac person but my girlfriend does people really value their macs so i bought this cheap case to protect it for her it does its job but it does n't make your mac look better , especially when dirt gets inside it is not so easy to snap on but eventually , everything will stay in place
nice little case , especially for the price compared to other more expensive models . the glossy was a little to shiny for me . i also have the flat black finish , which rocks
i really like the color of the mint green case , but it was difficult to get on , it took a while to snap into place i adore the color and and it is a good product
love the color and the fit a little confusing on which way to attach without damaging the computer a nice slim fit for a slim computer so surprised to finally find a cover for this size computer and the color was perfect for my daughter i have not yet removed the cover from the computer as of yet , so i am unable to determine if it will leave marks on the computer i hope not
came in fast and good quality . i got two and loved them even though they were n't for me . i got them as gifts for my friends and they were very pleased
love , love , love it ! ! ! it protects my apple laptop and it 's thin kind , not so bulky kind of look , you know my hubby likes not the keyboard protector but my cover too it 's pretty color as well ! ! i am very satisfied buy it ! ! ! ! !
this air mac cover stands out from the rest and the aqua green is a warm stylist color the rubberized cover can protect the computer from liquid spills and falls
the seller shipped this product super fast from california all the way to ny it looks flawless and i 'm quite frankly shocked for the price i 've bought snap-on cases from upwards of $ # and they 're junk this one is incredible , looks great , feels great , and really seems to protect my # `` macbook air
i love this case for my air it 's a vibrant blue and covers in all the places i like to have coverage it 's very well worth the money i spent on it i 'll definitely be back for more if my daughter breaks another -lrb- this one is replacing the pink one she broke -rrb-
wonderful ! ! ! so glad i did n't spend $ # on a case i ca n't imagine being much better than this one love the color , stays on tight and i think it looks high quality and it is working wonderfully -lrb- had it for almost # months -rrb- if i want a different color in the future , i 'm definitely ordering this same
i just got this item a couple days ago and its great i thought that the product was a rubber case not a hard shell but thats my fault and does n't affect my opinion on this product i should have read the product description more carefully definately worth the money i recommend this product and considering its purple and i love that color makes it even better
the material is not as good as i expect it does n't feel very well , and looks too cheap for a <unk> gaming laptop the only reason i bought it is because this is the only # `` case i could find
very good product it is what u pay for . they could maybe do a better job to do it more protective but o well its only # <unk> good job still : -rrb- still missing where to put ur charger . so u still need a bag for that
it is good and fits with ease the g # vw that i have ... first one that does thank goodness ! : -rrb- but i want it to be a little thicker ... but out of the three i have bought this is the only one that works lol so take what you can get :
it was more than enough room to fit my sager np # , which is a very thick laptop material will not scratch the rubberized surface have not tested the splash resistance and i do n't plan on it i would still prevent dropping the laptop , simply for ease of mind protection against scratches and dust no shipping problems , arrived quickly and well before estimated delivery date
the sleeve it self is great just not a snug fit to the g # as i would have wanted if you have a carry on bag that is big enough to fit a laptop as big as mine you can use this instead of a back pack
i ordered this sleeve for my wife 's # `` mbp , expecting it to provide the same type of durability and protection that has made case logic a household name over the years while it provides some basic protection from scuffs and scratches while in a bag with other stuff like books , keys , etc , the case itself is not very durable while i have n't <unk> drop tests , i know that it will at least function as intended , but i do n't expect it to last long the textured pattern is already beginning to fray in some places , and the stitching is not holding up very well it 's also more pink than the picture would lead you to believe i was expecting it to be a bit <unk>
i was pleasantly surprised with this laptop sleeve i 've had a lot of similar products in the past , but most of them were cheap , thin , floppy neoprene things that were really just a protective sleeve to prevent scratches to my pretty aluminum macbook this case logic sleeve is in a different category the material is quite thick and heavy-duty and the protective padding seems very much better than any sleeve i 've had in the past it feels almost like canvas and is so thick it could almost function as a stand-alone bag , if , say , you wanted to throw your laptop in the back seat of the car by itself the fit is also very good for a # . # -inch macbook : not too tight , not too loose the zippers are heavy-duty and slide with ease and my wife loved the color overall i highly recommend this product as one of the best macbook sleeves i 've yet seen
this sleeve fits my # . # macbook like a glove it looks good , offers some solid protection , and feels like it 'll stand the test of time my wife loves the pink stripes , and the cool screen printed design on the side the case is fairly solid , would really protect against the normal bumps and scuffs should keep the minor damages at bay , but is n't indestructible it does offer a good amount of protection considering how thin and light it is the zipper seems solid , which has been a problem in the past for me and cases i love this case , and will be using it daily for a while
this is more than just a sleeve it is # / # `` thick and made of hard , yet flexible material the outer dimensions are # `` x # `` it comes with a easy and accessible zipper i would say that a macbook -lrb- or any other # `` laptop -rrb- could withstand a # feet drop and i 'm sure there are other colors
i have used this backpack every day for the last # months carrying my laptop , mouse , lunch , etc . to work and i have had zero problems with it no rips , no tears no <unk> or anything i fill it pretty full so the to handle and straps take a lot of weight and it shows no signs of breaking down it 's not the perfect backpack for me as i 've been using it i 've found that i wish the compartment configuration were different , however that 's why they have different styles with different configurations ! if this ever breaks down , then i will purchase another wenger back pack with a more suitable design for me so if you are in the market for a computer backpack then i would suggest going to a store and getting hands on with them figure out how you want to use it if one of the wenger pack packs fits your needs , then i would wholeheartedly recommend you buy it as they appear to be very well made
love this backpack it 's my first ever and i love it i 've not used it to travel yet so i do n't know if the scanner function works yet but it seems it does based on other reviews i walk # . # miles to and from work and and carry # laptops and it works great and is very comfortable
i found no quality issues with this there bag is slightly heavier than i am used to , but is still not noticeable , especially after packing it with books it fits my # . # `` thinkpad with an extended battery easily the pouches on the side are wide and deep enough to fit a large thermos there is decent airflow for the back , but i still get hot you will not find much better airflow if the backpack does not have a significant <unk> , which will cost much more , to keep the surface area in contact with the body minimal the fabric and zippers are of respectable quality and i see this lasting quite a while excellent choice for a backpack
its a great looking bag and durable i only buy swiss gear backpacks and once again , they did not disappoint the bag is really comfortable on my shoulders , and you hardly feel the weight of the items in the bag , which usually includes at least # hardcover books and my laptop
bought in september yesterday the strap broke . # months and poof . & # # ; <unk> & # # ; <unk> computer case <unk> to the concrete survived , but only by my feeling the strap disintegrate off my shoulder and grabbing it en route to disaster and slowed the impact
i used this strap on my metro <unk> guitar case , replacing an ancient eagle creek strap the materials are top drawer and the design attractive however the padding is painfully hard and <unk> up my shoulder i greatly prefer the softer padding of the old eagle creek travel strap
this is very comfortable and wo n't slip my satellite computer bag is so heavy now that i 'm on the <unk> of getting one with wheels even if i do , this strap is staying i 'm not sure if the bungee is helping because i ca n't see it , but somehow the rock seems a little lighter i 'd re-order this one even if there are some less expensive
this is the most comfortable strap i have ever used takes a load off the upper back and makes it easy to support heavy loads fast shipping by the seller
this is a very cheap looking bag it is not solid but rather more like a high quality gym bag the padding is a joke if you are looking for something sturdy that will protect your computer look elsewhere this is just a <unk> bag with zippers
this is a nice light bag that will accommodate a small size laptop this is not a large bag which is good for me since i am short i travel by plane quite a lot and this easily fits under the seat
holds all of my work stuff with room to spare and light-weight too would highly recommend i have been searching for about a year for the right bag for my work this bag is perfect , the quality is excellent , and i could not be more pleased
this is an amazing bag for business travel i was able to fit my work laptop , mac , ipad , as well as several note books love the way it can attached to your luggage for easy airport maneuvering
i had this for one week now , and it had already made my computer fell down three times it tears like a piece of napkin i fell in love with it when i saw the image online , the image and the foolish comments people made on it made me buy it i 'm still in the period to return it , but how can i return something that has already torn apart like a piece of crash you may think that i put something in it other than my beautiful and lovely hp envy # inch , but not ; this is the useless bag i have ever have in my entirely life right now i have to look for another bag for my computer just after one week of using this useless bag -lrb- all that <unk> is not gold -rrb- i would have given it # star but as you can see , the system can not allow it i highly recommend you run away every time you see a bag similar to this
i really like the color and design and i 'm fairly confident my # ' laptop will fit fine , but the neoprene smell is really atrocious luckily i do n't have <unk> , because i 'm fairly confident the smell would give many an <unk> a serious attack anybody have some good advice on what to do for the smell i 'd like to keep it and find a remedy that wo n't damage the sleeve
... but the power cord does not it 's this laptop : http / / <unk> # <unk> # <unk> _ <unk> = utf # & <unk> ; = # <unk> # <unk> # <unk> # & <unk> ; = i # <unk> # <unk> # the computer just barely fits in the main compartment the power cord is gigantic , and it will not fit in the accessory pocket a mouse might fit , if it was a little <unk> one my computer is thicker , and there 's only so much stretch to the neoprene i will probably keep this for use inside another bag or backpack as extra padding , but otherwise , i think i 'm going to have to find a different bag i do n't think the strap is sturdy enough to stand up to repeated use , either ... those clips are not terribly sturdy dr - cute , but if you 're looking for something to act as a <unk> for a bigger gaming laptop , this is probably not the best choice
material a little flimsy but do fit my # . # laptop perfectly it is hard to find a sleeve or laptop bag to fit a # . # laptop perfectly have not used yet but do serves the purpose intended
this laptop bag fits my # & # # ; <unk> pro perfectly i bought it to replace the black , bulky laptop case i had it 's light weight , sturdy enough to protect my computer it could have a little more padding but great item for the money
i just love this case the extra side folder really comes in handy it fits my dell # & # # ; laptop perfect you can zip it tight and have the handles to use , also i have seen some others you do not zip it closed completely and have the top opened about # inches it is light but has enough padding to protect the laptop i am truly happy i chose this model
it fits my new # . # laptop with plenty of room if you happen to have an older thicker one it should still be okay the pocketed version really makes the fully functional for me , i tend to always carry the power brick , mouse and external drive , i do n't want to just dump those in an open bag with the computer the durability seems okay for now
i 've been using this laptop sleeve for a few months now it was purchased for my samsung # . # & # # ; laptop the laptop easily fits into the sleeve and there 's still room to add papers , pens , etc . the pocket on the outside holds all the cables , a full size wireless mouse , and a bulky surge protector with more room to spare the material / fabric is padded but still stretchy so i can jam additional things in both compartments , yet the sleeve retains it 's shape when i remove the items , and the zippers are strong also , the pattern on both sides of the sleeve has retained it 's bright , beautiful colors
i would love it if it were a little more rigid to give me complete worry free protection of my laptop beautiful scroll design and <unk> will use as a dust cover , around the home , local travelling for long trips , or air travel i will have to purchase something else
nice design and good quality material something i do not like is that the laptop i have # inches smaller than the high case so for screens of # . # & # # ; is not set , but a little larger , also can be used and is very cute
it 's a nice sleeve , fits a little tight with something in the pocket , pocket is ok but slightly small , snug fit with charger in it i 'm using mine as extra protection for my computer , i put my computer in the sleeve and then into the case , nice fit well protected .
this is the second bag i get for my # . # `` acer ... the first from a local store was too small <unk> it stated it was for # `` range laptops although the # `` one <unk> the right size , i aired on the side of caution and got the # `` bag i 'm glad because i 'm able to carry my kindle fire , plugs and other goodies in this bag i also purchased the <unk> decal for my laptop and case for my phone -lrb- <unk> vendor -rrb- . very happy with this product !
i love this laptop case it 's stylish with a nice design without it being too girly it is a soft case so do n't expect much protection for your laptop if you do a lot of traveling , do not buy this case it is basically a sleeve with handles and a shoulder strap i use it as a way of protecting my laptop from dust and for extremely light traveling it does the trick for me and the price was right i also appreciate the side pocket in the front for my mouse and wires
i ordered this bag to use when i travel with my laptop my laptop fits well with extra space and it also has a large front zippered pocket for extra storage the shoulder strap makes it easier to carry as well great bag for the money
on the manufacturer 's web site , the picture shows a dvd drive inserted in one of the side pockets this is not a <unk> for the apple # . # air one will not fit
... except , theres not enough room to put the laptop charger in with the laptop , and thats a deal breaker for me this is a very nice well constructed bag and it looks great i got the one for the # `` macbook air the laptop fits snugly in the fur lined pocket and there is room to put a few papers and maybe some pens and possibly your cell phone but there isnt enough room to put the charger in with it there is an outside pocket , but its just too snug when the laptop is in the main pocket i hated to do it , but i had to send this back if you dont need to carry the charger , this will certainly get your laptop from home to office in style i ended up with thecase logic <unk> # -inch laptop and ipad slim case -lrb- black -rrb- and it seems to hold everything without any noticeable increase in size
if you purchase a macbook # `` air for the size and weight , this is a great little case that is compact yet does a good job of protecting the computer it is also important to me to have the padded , removable shoulder strap very pleased with purchase
my husband ordered this and it 's great keep in mind it is very tight and secure around the computer the only downside is that we can not even fit the computer charger into one of the front pockets , that 's how tight it is
the product is flawless excellent build and materials specially fit for macbook air # & # # ; - i was tired of my huge backpack for such a small computer now i carry my mab , its charger , a small notebook and a pen -lrb- everything fit tight but i really do n't need that more space -rrb- it was a great buy
this is the perfect size for my macbook air # -inch computer it 's lightweight and the strap can be removed i can even bring it on the airplane without taking it out of the case i 'm really pleased with it
this was exactly what i was looking for the # inch macbook air fits inside like a glove and outside pockets can hold ear buds , sd card reader , even a small phone or camera seems well constructed , with quality materials nothing here not to like
cases are always a very personal decision , it depends on what you are looking for i wanted something small and not bulky , that would protect my macair , and also allow me to carry a few items -lrb- i carry the power adapter , and a couple of dongles -rrb- this case is just perfect for my needs
i bought two of these for each side of the bed when the box arrived one was snapped off at the lower bend the other lasted about a month it only had magazines and a ipad it also broke at the lower bend i think the product idea is awesome but the <unk> should be stronger i have worked with that material before so i know the manufacturing process used needs to be reviewed i ca n't recommend this version for purchase
the quality is good , but there are holes in the back of it where the remotes can fall out since i was mainly getting it to hold the tv remote and the bed remote , this is not a good thing
it 's slimmer than i thought it does n't stick out on the side of the bed holds my heavy gamer keyboard , mouse , remote , glasses , phone and ipad without ever falling totally worth buying
i 've had my bed <unk> for about a week now must say i could n't go back to life without one i keep my ipad , cell , universal remote and reading <unk> all in the sturdy compartment def a must have
it was nice ... until it broke i <unk> up and half of it was laying on the floor the only things in it was a book and an ipad after my initial poor review , i was contacted by the company and sent a replacement i have actually had a chance to really knock this one around and it is still going strong i am very impressed with this version and i 'm thrilled they contacted me to set things right now i have exactly what i wanted
this product is wrongly advertised as it does not fit the # inch macbook pro it would probably fit the # . # `` , and it would be a great case , but it 's useless for me
great quality , but too small for macbook pro # inch with retina it 's a great color on outside , and very nice fabric inside too bad my macbook did n't fit into it also , the outside pocket is perfect for a tablet -lrb- nexus # in my case
i saw <unk> both ways , but can confirm , as of # dec # that it was designed for and labeled as # & # # ; macbook pro , not the retina model my retina is very loose in the case , both side to side and especially top to bottom for the price , i 'm keeping it , but be advised that your retina will bounce around inside of it additionally , the interior is a smooth quilted fabric , it does n't ` hold onto or grip ' the laptop at all , so it really does move around in there , fyi
i 've been on the hunt for a dark cushioned sleeve for my hp pavilion dm # it 's a strange # `` size , one that does n't fit well in either # `` or # `` sleeves , generally , but this one was perfect i actually purchased this sleeve at $ # . # at <unk> 's <unk> , an <unk> store that tends to get goods that are <unk> this sleeve was released by incase in spring # it 's still perfect visually attractive , simple and effective my only wish is that it was a bit more cushioned , the cushion is about half of an inch , but it 's still protective excellent purchase and i 'd recommend this to anyone
i 'm not sure i understand the issues people are having with size because of other reviews , i was pretty wary of ordering what was otherwise exactly what i was hoping for in a sleeve for my new macbook as it turns out , the laptop -lrb- model a # , <unk> # -rrb- fits perfectly inside the sleeve
i was looking for a sleeve that was not neoprene or black finally i came across this case it 's a little thicker than the average laptop sleeve , but it gives better protection when going through airports which was my main concern the front has an additional pocket for your ipad , paperwork or something similarly flat the inner lining is bright orange and goes with the denim color well the zipper is smooth and has an inner lining behind the zipper to prevent scratching metal on metal i am very happy with this case
this case has the ruggedness of a pair of blue jeans on the outside , and the warmth of an orange , quilted jacket on the inside it fits my macbook pro # & # # ; with retina display perfectly there really is n't any room for anything else , although the outer pocket could hold a few flat items like a checkbook or wallet , papers , spiral notebook , etc . for my work , i travel often and do n't especially need access to my laptop while en route , so i put my laptop in my luggage rather than my shoulder bag this case protects it perfectly while it jostles around in my suitcase note that as i said in the first <unk> , the interior is <unk> orange this is not noted in the product description , but it 's a color that i find works well with the dark blue and brown leather of the outer case
- thick padding actually gives protection agains bumps and drops , unlike a lot of neoprene sleeves - notepad compartment is incredibly useful , and with a notebook inside adds another layer of protection - zipper closes securely and easily - not # % snug on my macbook pro # , though the little bit of wiggle room it provides does make it a lot easier to get the macbook in and out than some other cases i 've used
i needed a <unk> yet <unk> but definitely more protective than a silicone cover for my new -lrb- # -rrb- macbook air # inch i am very happy with this case and get lots of compliments it is very very functional and the price was reasonable
i bought this for my school-issued macbok # `` , and this case is perfect very portable , cute , and people tell me it looks like a sock monkey holds its shape , pocket is nice and deep , zipper rubs against but does not harm laptop
it 's so nice ! i love the color so much ! i already had one for my macbook pro i ordered it at sat . night and i got it on monday ! that was fast ! ! love it !
this sleeve fits my macbook air like a glove i have no doubts that it is providing the protection that i need , and it looks good too have no doubts when buying this
fits perfectly with my mac air i would recommend this product to someone who wants a stylish and durable case yes , this case is durable spilled water over the top and it never touched the laptop did n't even seep into the case very slim case so if you do n't want something bulky , definitely go for this
my macbook air fits perfectly in the sleeve , and i can also fit the charger and a pair of earbuds in the smaller pocket at the same time the material makes it impossible for it to slip out of your hands i 've also received several compliments on the case
good fit for my # & # # ; samsung chromebook nice front pockets for extras putting the charging cord in the front makes it a little bulky , but it works good quality and padding for protection
this product is better suited for a tablet or mini laptop i have a # & # # ; macbook air and it does not fit in this sleeve there 's another company selling the same brand for a # & # # ; macbook air but unfortunately it is way too big for the # & # # ; model not sure why these sizes are so off but it was such a frustrating experience for me that i thought i 'd share my experience with anyone looking at this product hope this helps
i loved this case and used it for a few months before noticing that the clear rubber feet and corners of my clear macbook air cover as well as the corners of my charger were pink it 's been sitting empty ever since
cute and functional -lrb- protects computer with a little cushioning -rrb- , but it left pink <unk> stains on my hardshell case someone also told me it looked like a <unk> frank product , but i do n't mind that i think it looks sophisticated and gender neutral
love the durable outer material , much better than the nylon cases and i love that it has a pocket on the front the inner lining is still very soft , so keeps your computer from getting scratched
the case is both adorable and very safe the thick sleeve provides protection , while also allowing you to keep your headphones or charger in the front pouch i love the durability and the texture i always get compliments on campus with people asking me where i got my case
very good cover this was the exact cover i ever wanted really great deal when i bought it online instead of heading to the apple store which is very expensive i do not regret at all from buying this product it has a nice great look and feel definitely recommend this product
i really like the professional looking quality in this case the only problem with it , is that because the inside fabric is red , the stickers on the outside of my computer have been slowly turning pink from the dye in the fabric other than that , it 's a perfect case
great product , looks just like the picture fits the mbp retina , not an extremely snug fit , but it does n't bother me the only issue i have is the red dye from the fabric inside has started <unk> onto the white zipper turning it slightly pink overall a good case otherwise
i am the lucky new owner of a # `` macbook pro with retina display while the laptop itself does n't have much in the way of ... a place to lock it , an ethernet cable , or dvd/cd drives . . it does now have a lot of <unk> this slim profile sleeve fits over my macbook pro , even with the fancy bottom clear case lock thing i 've attached to it my goodies -lrb- laser pointer , adapters , and power cord -rrb- fit into the outer sleeve and the no-slip lining keeps it in place i might 've liked a little button or velcro closure to keep those goods extra safe otherwise , i encourage you not to get this product , so i can be the only person with such a dope looking sleeve
was worried the red leather tab would be too red , and it is , but love it the pocket is too tight for a charger but fine for earbuds feels much nicer to walk out the door with this in hand than with a bigger case on a shoulder strap
i got this case over a year ago and it still looks brand new it fits my # inch macbook pro perfectly and looks great i definitely recommend this case
size is perfect look is perfect love the color sorry to the dudes who find polka dots entirely too feminine i love that little surprise when you open it up to me , that 's clever design
i had purchased a neoprene computer cover elsewhere , but was disappointed because it did n't fit my mac well , was n't completely padded and the label had a warning about <unk> materials so , i researched and found this terra collection computer sleeve the terra model fits my computer exactly , and it has padding on all side and edges it 's well-made of natural materials i also like it because the zipper is on the short side , so i can just leave it in my top-loading pack and slip the computer in & out of the sleeve the pocket on the side works perfectly for a manilla folder which is how i carry my notes about clients
i purchased this case for my motorola lapdock , and it was exactly what i needed cute , well-made , and it has much more room in it than it appeared to have at first although it does look dark brown in some lighting situations , the case is actually black - i like the color , however the only drawback that this case has is that it lacks a shoulder strap if it had a strap , i would not have hesitated to give it a five also , at the risk of being picky -lrb- but i am a teacher ! -rrb- , the word & # # ; briefcase & # # ; is <unk> in the product 's title that being said , i 'd definitely recommend this for someone with a small laptop or tablet that needs protection
