i purchased this backpack about a year ago and it continues to be as good as new i have dropped it before with my macbook inside and there was zero damage to the laptop there are so many pockets and they are in just the right places this is the only backpack i will use now !
this backpack was perfect i 've been using it to carry my laptop and books for uni , and it even has shock absorption which feels <unk> when i walk ... a good thing it does n't hang low and hurt my back like my old backpack love this backpack , it has lots of space , very roomy and the shoulder padding is nice :
very happy just purchased this item it 's a very attractive piece i 'm going on a cruise soon and wanted a carry on knapsack for bringing my # & # # ; laptop or just about anything i may need to bring with me daily , vacation
i have used multiple swiss army brand bags this one is absolutely the best one i have a # & # # ; screen dell precision notebook workstation that is big and heavy this bag works great with it
right amount of smaller pockets but larger items have room as well ; abundant storage possibilities in my opinion ; pack did n't come with a carabiner on the out side which was quickly remedied with a trip to the hardware store and some <unk>
i switched from a <unk> computer bag because i was fed up with it slipping off my shoulder and knew this was a great quality back pack since i bought my son one last year the pockets are even pretty well insulated and will keep a drink fairly cool if its not in the sun or something
i purchased this for a dell vostro # widescreen # `` laptop , the laptop fit with about a # `` to spare the zippers zipped with no strain at all , this is my second swiss gear notebook backpack and my next one will be a swiss gear also ! ! ! ! !
i went on an adventure i got horribly lost it almost took me a full day find my way back home in the end , i had been inside this backpack the whole time it 's big , but if that 's what you 're into , i recommend it highly
this is a great bag i just got it for my new hp dv # . # `` laptop i was worried that the laptop would n't fit in the padded pocket , but it fits in it with a bit to spare i do prefer the design of my old wenger maxxum model , but that is the only thing i do n't like about it it 's got plenty of room for everything but the kitchen sink i did find it a couple dollars cheaper at <unk> , though , so i bought it there instead of here
i love this bag i ca n't find any flaws with it it 's comfortable , spacious , durable , and so on the same amount of items from my old bag seems to be lighter in this bag i highly recommend this backpack
after two weeks of traveling thru south america it has held up extremely well and proven reliable in protecting my assets -lrb- including my laptop -rrb- thanks for getting it to me when you stated it would arrive and in great condition
i needed something that fit my sager # that i got from <unk> this does it well with tons of room to spare for textbooks and has plenty of pockets even with # lbs of stuff in there it 's comfortable if you use both straps -lrb- which you should for the sake of your back if you carry that much ! -rrb-
this backpack is amazing it fits my laptop perfectly , and has been great for the past few months that i 've had it i would definitely reccomend this to my friends it 's so comfortable and spacious , buy this
i 've had this backpack for more than two years now i use it for a variety of things : lugging my laptop around , carrying clothes when traveling , carrying books and lots more it has never failed me looks great and great storage capacity beware though : this is no small backpack
this is the backpack that google gives their new <unk> i 've <unk> after one since i had a client bring hers to our session it 's <unk> and extremely sturdy all the seams and closures are rock solid i got their messenger bag also but it hurts my shoulder if there 's to much in it
this is the best backpack design i have ever seen perfect for # day trips where i can bring a change of clothes as well as all my computer gear
my # inch laptop really fits in this bag - it is not tight and i dont have to struggle to get it zipped there is plenty of storage space in the other compartments as well for folders etc . the backpack is very comfortable when it is on your back as well i highly <unk> this product
this backpack is priced right , holds a # & # # ; laptop -lrb- as well as an additional # & # # ; laptop -rrb- and looks good too it 's got enough storage to hall just about anything you might need i especially like the pouch for my <unk> that has an earphone <unk> so you can stow your player in the backpack and still be able to use it
there 's really nothing to day other than that i really like this backpack it 's durable , it has a lot of space , and it looks nice i have had it for about a month now and nothing 's wrong with it i would recommend buying it
this must be the most versatile and sturdy backpack i 've ever come across it has almost <unk> room and i can keep everything well organized within i can only recommend it
this back pack is very comfortable to carry either with the handle , or over the shoulder i prefer the handle it stands up by itself which makes it easy to load and unload items from the separate pockets it has many pockets to separate and organize items it easily handles my laptop and has plenty of padding the quality of the bag is exceptional , right down to the well crafted zippers it looks great too
it 's the perfect backpack for <unk> schoolers it 's really well built ; it survived a whole school year of heavy use without any wear and tear its <unk> compartments are capable of holding text books , folders , tablet , calculators , and bottled water the zippers are strong and easy to slide
great value , well built fits # `` laptop no problem , lots of pockets , perhaps too many if your like me and ca n't remember where you put things my only criticism is the zippers could be a little beefier and perhaps have flaps to keep water out in general i am very happy with it it is comfortable with heavy loads the price makes it a great value you 'd have to pay at least twice as much to get something significantly
i really like this backpack for laptops , and got a great deal buying it through amazon instead of a local buy unfortunately this backpack is too small for my laptop i have a # . # `` laptop and it is just a little too big for this bag . : -
the swiss gear ibex # -inch backpack was the perfect fit for my laptop albeit snugly ; it has plenty of other compartments to fit other necessities and manages to make a heavy carrying load seem as effortless as possible
i looked at # bags this has the most pockets , zips and places to hide things it is also comfortable to wear most of the colleagues at work have them too
this is my # nd time purchasing one of these backpacks ; the first time was # years ago i am pretty tough on backpacks so i was surprised how long it lasted , i can not believe a backpack lasted for # years my coworkers noticed , so they bought the back too i highly recommend this product ; it 's spacious and and very durable
i bought this backpack to carry my macbook pro along with my school stuff to work and school on a daily basis i have had this for over a year and would n't trade it for anything the padding is great , capacity for books , headphones and miscellaneous items that i use on a day to day basis i bought a swiss because of their reputation , reliability and history for anyone looking to take care of their laptop and personal belongings and do it with style and confidence , this bag is for you i would only buy a new one just for a change
i have a dell xps laptop and have had trouble finding backpacks that it would fit in it fits nicely in this bag which also has a good number of other pockets for its battery pack and other accessories
i love this bag i bought it because my old backpack was coming apart at the seams and i wanted <unk> that was of good quality and provided adequate for my laptop which i take with me all the time this bag not only looks great but it is extremely functional with lots of pockets and capacity for everything you might need to carry it does not have a removable pouch as other comments have probably noted but it is a great laptop back pack anyway my friends really like the bag too and have complimented me on its <unk>
this backpack has been on many flights with me since i got it # months ago my apple macbook pro -lrb- the bigger one -rrb- fits with no problem it fits under the seat on the plane with no problem plus i can fit a pair of shoes and extra clothes for longer trips all at the same time extra pocket with the laptop compartment for wires and <unk> super efficient and comfortable to wear i highly recommend it
this is one of the best notebook backpacks out there it 's everything the other -lrb- good -rrb- reviews say and more the back of the bag has extra padding so when it 's on your back it feels very comfortable i would recommend this bag to anyone that carries around a heavy load in their backpack it fits any and everything , so many different compartments it 's a very well designed backpack
very good quality backpack i 've had this for years now before i finally wore it down completely buying another one to replace my old beat down backpack the compartments and pockets in the backpack are perfect i can comfortably store both my mac air and my work laptop in this and have plenty of space for other items i use the side mesh <unk> for a bottle of water when i go hiking could n't do without this backpack , love it
lots of room and very well made fits a # `` toshiba with room to spare the zippers glide so smoothly too i wish there was a variety of colors to choose from though , because they only offer black/blue would be great if there was an all black option other than that , this is a great , well constructed backpack
i have a ton of these rugged drives and saw the advantage of having different color to organize - but they offer way too much play when placed on the drive quite a bit larger than the orange - so they move around not at all what i thought <unk> would be - and i ca n't use them as they just do n't fit i feel as though the fit would be key in protecting the device , so i do n't feel as if the colors protect
these sleeves do not fit either of my lacie rugged hard drives i tried the sleeves on both of the hard drives i own , and on each the sleeves were too big it was n't so big that it fell off , but loose enough that it could easily come off if in a briefcase or laptop bag they are not nearly as snug of a fit as the orange sleeve that came with the drives i wanted different colors so that i could tell the drives apart , but these are completely useless
i chose # stars because it does n't say in the description of the product -lrb- as far as i saw -rrb- that it does n't fit the lacie rugged mini if it did i would n't have sent the money and time to return it
i purchased this for my lacie thunderbolt rugged # tb drive unfortunately they are too loose and do not fit properly i wish it had mentioned that in the description be sure to double check that your drive will fit before buying
i have a couple of lacie portable hard drives which i have been using for over a year these drives are rugged and my family and i have tested its ruggedness <unk> a number of times all said and done , the drives function are okay though i have some minor complaints now , the sleeves are an addition to my hard drives it prevents scratches and makes the drive instantly <unk> i have each drive assigned with a particular task document and i do n't want to connect each one of them to find out if they are the right ones lacie should allow color choices for the customers the pack comes with three sleeves and not all colors are <unk> this could be unnecessary <unk> if you have only one hard drive and do n't move it around often
since i have more lacie rugged hard drives the sleeves in different colors make it easy to recognize which one is which the color selection of the sleeve should be an option when you order the hard drive or at least one more sleeve should be included in the package since the rugged series has premium pricing anyway the sleeves are ok the # star rating is because of the extra money that you have to pay to get them
these are great for color <unk> and keeping your drives a little more organized but be warned , if you have the rugged thunderbolt drives , these do not fit they fit on top of the original orange but not as a replacement sleeve
these are super helpful for easy <unk> of drives they area made just as well and to the same specifications as the original sleeve that comes with the drive the sleeves are very easy to replace and stay on securely like the original sleeves , they add extra protection to the drive when bumping or dropping the drive i wish they offered additional color sets i also wish they allowed one to purchase a <unk> drive , so the user can <unk> old sleeves when upgrading a drive or purchasing extra sleeves this would be better for the environment as well :
i love the lacie drives this fits on anyhow i have two one for my wife and one for me how can i tell the difference with these sleeves i can now tell the difference now i need to buy two more drives to use with the two extra sleeves
i have purchased several of <unk> rugged <unk> # gb firewire # <unk> # <unk> # . # portable hard <unk> my business for system backups these sleeves are great so i know which backup drive is for which internal drive -lrb- i have # internal drives -rrb- they fit and feel exactly like the orange sleeve that comes with these drives they are very easy to fit onto the drive you just stretch it over it the only slight negative , for myself , is the <unk> colored one i 'm just not all that fond of that color but that is my personal preference
a bit of a <unk> purchase , but i have a few of these hard drives , and they always come with the orange cover color <unk> them makes it simple to remember what stuff is on which drive one i use for digital audio , another for financial stuff , another for pics , i <unk> , etc .
these do exactly what they say they do you take the orange bumper cover off of your lacie hard drive and put one of these -lrb- black , gray , or <unk> -rrb- on instead it 's great if you have multiple lacie rugged hard drives and want to be able to tell them apart without plugging them in to your computer or even from across the room we are a media production company and we send one of our drives to another company that uses the lacie rugged series the different colors really help our drives stand out and remain separate , ensuring we get the right drive back every time the bumpers are just as good as the original orange one that comes on the drive they 're the same material and size , just in different colors if you have multiple drives or do n't like orange , i would recommend this product
used for about a week just going to and from my car and to meetings i noticed that a corner started to come apart then each time i used it , it tore apart more
the product is heavy and the telescopic handle is very bad ... it 's very hard to take them down . . because of those reason they just put in my closet it was bad decision to buy this product
i was excited when i first received this bag because it was big enough to hold everything i need for work but three days after using it the inside liner where you put your computer ripped apart from the seams it 's still usable so i did n't want to go through the hassel of returning it
size and material okay as i will not use it often but , handle malfunctioned first use could not get it to engage shorter than all out disappointed as i had <unk> hard and read reviews on several before purchasing this one amazon nice that it allowed me to return without paying shipping
after two years the outer layer of both wheels came apart ... most is now off it still rolls but makes noise ... wheels do n't turn easily i was browsing to purchase a new case and found this ... it looked great ... yes this is the one i already have ... the compartments are just right for me but the wheels make this a bad choice i 'm looking for one with actual roller skate wheels ... or better
for various purposes , i was looking to not spend too much to replace a # year old case its handle had broken and the manufacture could not supply me with a replacement while disappointed , what more could i have expected from a # year old case that i had provided excellent service the solo does not have a locking handle it only telescopes and retracts to click points and collapses with a slight push the wheels are <unk> mounted and do not roll easily on the good side it provides ample <unk> storage for my business files and laptop i would not purchase this case if i had a better idea of its faults and cheap <unk> i just hope the construction lasts the brief period i need it to function before i will no longer need it
the bag is very light weight and the pull out handle wobbles when i roll it ... so far it is holding up but i do n't think it will last a year
after looking at many pictures of rolling cases , i chose this one for the spacious compartments when it arrived , i <unk> removed it from its packaging and immediately extended the handle to try it out after a few minutes , i tried to return the handle to its stowed position - it would n't go one `` joint `` away from full <unk> , it stopped i could not make it fully retract i contacted e-bags ; they said it must be defective , and they were very cooperative about returning it , even offering me an opportunity to purchase another case at a discount however , i just did n't want to be bothered worrying about it happening again instead , i found another bag -lrb- different brand -rrb- in a local store pricier , but bigger , nicer , better
it 's a good case for the price the wheels should be a bit larger to avoid dragging the bottom of the case when rolling the telescoping handle does not always collapse completely and can be difficult to fit into small spaces
i really like this bag it has lots of compartments -lrb- which i was looking for -rrb- however , after dragging it around it looks like the fabric covering the <unk> on the back is starting to wear already not really sure , but it looks like it a little -lrb- for the price compared to other bags though i 'll take it -rrb-
this was a great price for a rolling laptop case the computer fits in there perfectly unfortunately not much else does if i have to buy another case , i would get one with more room inside
this is nice case : it 's sturdy and has enough pockets for me to put files that i carry back and forth from home to work daily i would n't use it for an overnight trip to put clothes in , it 's not roomy enough for that
small enough to go in the overhead bin of the small commuter airplanes and durable enough to stand up to the <unk> and gravel of the parking lot i 've had several solo briefcases that served me well that is why when it was time to replace the old one i choose something as close as what i had
hello everybody ! i ordered this rolling laptop backpack so i could use it for college and i love it i am a tall women and i needed a rolling backpack that had a long handle and that can hold my laptop and my college books and stuff and this backpack is great for all those things i am # ' # and the handle is perfect for tall people !
us luggage <unk> nylon rolling computer <unk> this rolling briefcase prior to this , i had a very nice briefcase with handles that i <unk> atop a rolling backpack this one not only rolls , it has space for just about everything i was carrying in the backpack its separated compartments are roomy enough for not only the laptop and its accessories , but files , pads , book or electronic reading device the outer zip pocket keeps pens and other small items well organized and easy to find the nylon fabric is sturdy , and the price is very reasonable
i was surprised and disappointed when i received this product one of the outside zippers was broken and one of the inside zippers did not work as well the inside was poorly constructed and i found part of what looked like a candy wrapper inside the front zippered compartment it did not seem like the product others had written about so <unk> i love amazon and have never had a problem with anything i have bought through them - and they e-mailed a return label promptly it was the first item i have ever returned
within the first week of using it , the bag broke the handle stopped retracting so i have to return it the construction of the bag was quite poor i will not get a solo bag again
this is the worst purchase i have made , the handle broke with in a month and the company went out of business so now i have a bag for my laptop that i can not use
i like the overall size of the bag and individual <unk> , but the construction and quality is subpar after using it for one day on the washington metro , one wheel guard broke off this is cheaply made and i should have <unk> this based on the low price i will have to increase my budget for a replacement bag this one is going back another <unk> in horrible chinese made products
this seems like a good bag but it does not fit # inch computers i never really got to try it so i do not know the quality of the product i am giving it one star because i could not fit my computer in it
one of the disadvantages with ordering online is that i have trouble remembering the possible problems such as zippers the zippers on this item are definitely low quality and do n't zip as smoothly as those on <unk> items if i had seen it in a store , i would have eliminated it as an option after just a couple of zips the file spaces are difficult to use because there is not enough opening room the handle feels `` floppy `` and i worry about likely longevity of it i would return it , but it is too much trouble to pack it up and send it back from now on , i will buy this kind of item in person it is not a good deal at any price if it does n't meet expectations
this bag came and looked ok but the material was thinner than i expected then when i started to pack it , i discovered they missed sewing the zipper on part of the bag so it had a hole when closed the design looked efficient but after seeing the poor quality assurance , i returned it rather than replaced it as i do n't think it would last very long
this is an okay product , nothing special but also relatively inexpensive and i probably would n't have written a review except the handle broke i 've had it about # months and i do n't think i can return it but i 'll follow through with the company to see if they have any options for me i used this every day ; to and from work - most of the time it had very little in it - i actually only take my laptop home every other week i used it because my office is quite a distance from the parking garage and i wanted something easy for carrying lunches and other odds ' n ends to and fro the last time i pulled up on the handle one of the sides broke and completely separated from the handle i would n't recommend this at all but definitely want to warn you if you travel and need something you can depend on to get through airports , etc .
i liked -lrb- past <unk> -rrb- this bag - it was helpful to keep organized as i travel a lot i liked the different pockets to put my airline items -lrb- liquids , headphones , ipad -rrb- where i could get to them quickly - it can hold two laptops and a good bit of paperwork my biggest disappointment is how it just has n't held up the handle now will not easily extend fully - it gets stuck at one position down form the top , making it a real pain in <unk> when i am rushing through an airport the front of the bag has worn through so that the metal is showing through the wheels now wobble making it really a bother i want something that will last more than # months - this is not the bag
i really loved this bag but i have not had it for that long and one of the wheels is already worn on one side making it very loud rolling through the office i will not purchase this product again because of this defect in the wheels
i am really disappointed with this product the rear wheel has failed under normal usage conditions only # of the four wheels are <unk> which makes it difficult to navigate and it leaves a black mark as a result of the <unk> wheel i would not recommend this product it is roomy however , the inability to <unk> to normal usage when i have owned it for a year is unacceptable
this bag has many compartments for accessories only draw back , is the bag is heavy when it is empty , once you add the laptop , etc . , i am just glad you can roll it
overall , the case serves the purpose however , one of the zippers malfunctioned very soon after first use it now only operates <unk> ; but because the <unk> zipper still works , i chose to keep the case it was a gift for a college-age <unk> , and will be used as a rolling book bag now that the case has been used , if other zippers or components fail , i figure i wo n't be able to get any money back on this purchase thus , i would probably not order another similar item online ; rather i would want to inspect one in a store before purchasing
this bag is just the right size handle a little wobbly one of the zippers separated only after a couple of uses which is a little frustrating but all in all not a bad buy
i 've enjoyed using this bag for several months it apparently improved my appearance significantly as i received a number of compliments about how much more professional i look without my old backpack the only drawback is that the wheels seems to have worn down and the rubber on one has completely disappeared so that the bag now drags and jumps on that side this bag had a lifetime of about # months for me
attractive bag fits my # inch laptop however , i got caught in the rain and the bag did not completely protect the laptop items inside my bag did not get wet but were damp
i have a # . # laptop which <unk> fits in the bag and is hard to zip up because it 's tight as long as i 'm careful , the bag did the job i needed
i use a rolling bag daily for work they all seem the same i was hoping for better but the wheels are freezing up and making noises i know its going soon the handle has needed the screws tightened no big deal but its not built for long term use looks solid , but its not bag is used in doors to bring my computer throughout a hospital its not going up and down off curbs
i bought this exact same bag on # - # and the handle just came apart the life cycle is about one and <unk> years but it is a great set up with plenty of storage and utility to bad quality was not built into the hardware the case looks like new zippers and all the handle began to hang up at about one year old and finally came off in my hand in the middle of the airport in <unk> <unk> china
the zippers are weak and they pull apart seemingly all of the time the bag is sturdy though , and it has more than enough pouches and storage areas for my needs fits the airplane overhead bins , and under seat storage areas easily
i researched a lot of bags because i have a very large laptop for work - # . # x # which is considered a # . # `` laptop on the solo website , the specs for this bag indicate a laptop pocket size of # . # x # . # but that is not the case my laptop does not fit into the laptop compartment i could put it in the main compartment , but then it 's missing the padding that it needs
a well designed sturdy case although not described anywhere the outside is a reinforced durable black fabric heavy duty zippers , and is good looking it has a generous amount of storage capacity not only for a laptop but for other goods or a small change of clothes and a bathroom kit for an overnight stay the only improvement would be to have the fabric a bit more water repellent , but you can take care of that yourself with some scotchguard
this case is tough and well made i travel # % for <unk> and having a laptop bag that holds a lot of office and travel supplies is a & # # ; must have & # # ; item this laptop case has much more room than it appears when you look at the bag this bag has two large pockets in the front but does not have small pockets inside for pens , phones , chargers , etc . this is a well made bag and i would have given <unk> solid # stars if it had smaller interior pockets
fits my hp pavilion dv # just right lots of space for your accessories i would have given # stars if it had a few more small pouches in the front compartments that would make it better to organize things like <unk> , business cards , receipts , nail <unk> , eye drops , instant coffee packs , etc .
this case is what i expected given the product description and reviews i need a larger bag to hold two laptops the # & # # ; goes in the padded laptop sleeve , and a # & # # ; goes in one of sections meant for files there is still enough room for a binder , several file folders , the power adapters for both laptops , an extra mouse and other small , misc stuff my only criticism is that the wheels and zippers should be a little more substantial i have n't had any problems with them yet , and maybe i wo n't , but i would n't be shocked if they became an issue overall , a great case i 've had it for about a month and so far i am happy i got it
professional style without looking pretentious each of the compartments are very logical in their <unk> and location smooth operating handle nice quality wheels and construction absolutely no complaints
i like this bag , a little bulky for what i need but it secures my laptop and has extra room for books or as overnight bag i have not had any trouble with the wheels , it rolls smoothly
i purchased this case as a christmas gift for my wife who needed something other than a backpack to transport her laptop to/from work and on her long walk through the parking garage at work each day we were both impressed with the style as well as the quality and sturdiness of the bag itself there is lots of room on the inside for items in addition to her lap top unfortunately the handle stopped functioning correctly less than # months after purchasing it no longer collapsed completely without manually forcing it down by pressing the little knobs on the sides of the handle and even still , the handle would n't collapse all the way into the compartment where you zip the flap to <unk> it this was a big hassle to deal with it was beyond the return window for amazon , so i contacted solo directly and found on their website that they have a # year limited warranty on the bag after providing them some pictures of the bag that they requested , they <unk> us a new one at no charge <unk> that the issue was covered under the warranty new case arrived today and hoping the handle holds up better than last time
this case is a great value for the money the laptop compartment is near the back so it does n't fall forward like my old one it has plenty of organizational possibilities and rolls very nicely a great deal
this case serves my needs very well i needed something for class that would carry about # pounds of books without breaking a wheel or falling apart on me the only complaint i have is minor i wish the straps to pick it up with were more sturdy instead of just flopping to the side and i think they could have been placed better on the bag but , everything else is great
this is perfect for any work laptop or personal computer there is more than enough room for files or manuals etc . looks like it would make a great overnight bag if you had to do a work out of town stay
this travel case met all of my needs , plus my # `` hp laptop fits into it very easily it is well constructed and has plenty of room for all my stuff it also fits underneath the seat on a plane so does n't have to be put into the overhead it is just wide enough to be able to be pulled up the center aisle if a plane , but if # `` wider would have to be carried aboard
it works fine so far i 'm concerned about the durability of the handle when fully extended it seems too light for the load i use it almost everyday either in my car or on a plane the case seems to be durable materials
i love this rolling case it has lots of pockets and sleeves that are helpful for business and for school the only thing i would change is the way it is made because i do n't think it is going to last very long it could be that i overload the case , but i do need something that can withstand lots of weighted items however , i use this all the time and it has been almost a year , so i still consider this a great purchase
it gets the job done in transporting my laptop and paperwork easier it is a little heavy than it should but i guess the mechanism requires it i will use it to my next business trip again
had to return the first one for defective zippers that separated once zipped up replacement came right away as i followed the return policy instructions it was also easy to return the defective case been using it for about a month now and all is well , so far i keep it pretty full , so we will see will update review as time goes by
my back bothers me quite abit and this helps tremendously it holds my # `` laptop safe and comfortably the handle frequently is reluctant to reach its full length with a somewhat <unk> telescoping system , but always gets there with a few repeated efforts it was easily worth the money
i bought this to help lug my laptop back and forth to work i work in san francisco , and carrying heavy bag on the train and up/down <unk> was killing my back this makes life much easier , and it is very sturdy - but a bit bigger and heavier than i anticipated makes it difficult to maneuver on the train and it can be heavy to drag <unk> quality construction though
in my job where i travel every single day i am a rolling office . able to fit laptop / printer / paper / power cords / folders / office supplies etc . . fits in overhead bin for air travel for anyone on the go
