i bought the canvas bag so replace a laptop backpack i had been using i love this bag over all shape and pockets/compartments what i really like is the compartment that stays next to your <unk> so when i am traveling i feel that my stuff is more secure in that pocket and i like the padded aspect of the pocket as well over all i love the bag - it suits me just fine my only complaint is that it picks up allot of lint from <unk>
bag is over a year old and has held up remarkably handle should be placed better however also , it is possible for the clips for the straps to come off the bag i have always caught it and it only happens when the strap is all twisted up and i go to pick it up not a big deal , but be aware that it could happen other than that the bag is great it fits a # inch laptop with no issues and a lot of storage to spare
this bag fits my huge dell # perfectly it also has the almost the right amount of storage for everything else that i would want to carry with me the only disappointing piece is the lack of a <unk> for a water bottle
this model does okay and is of sturdy construction with plenty of <unk> , features with pockets but i think it would have done more like it should with twice the padding one topple or drop may be the end if one is not lucky
> > very solid construction > > seems to provide good protection for my laptop > > more than enough storage space for work documents , laptop accessories , pens , etc . > > design is casual , yet very professional > > has a strange handle that feels like it is always twisted around would like to have seen a better design > > clips on shoulder strap do not rotate # degrees which can lead to it getting twisted > > very nice bag use it everyday commuting to work i would buy this bag again and would recommend it to friends
this messenger bag is worth every penny and a great value my # & # # ; laptop fits with plenty of space i can also carry a cooling fan , power supply and mouse the shoulder strap pad works great i can slide the strap pad by the strap adjustment just fine if needed the handle does seem a bit awkward , but i only use it when setting the bag down , so i do not see it as an issue the bag is made well and appears to be very durable i can see getting many years of use from this bag i am sure that it will <unk> the usefulness of the laptop
well made bag i do n't suspect it will ware easily good amount of room inside i use the inside pouch for my ipad and the larger pouch for files i 'd say the strap is n't super long i 'm average height and its barely long enough with the strap fully extended
this bag has plenty of padding and pockets for folders , laptop , and other items it could use a little rigidity to keep it 's form , but for the price , this is a fantastic laptop bag
i 've had this bag for a few months now , and i like it it 's not the best bag i 've ever had , but it 's one of the few out there that can handle a # & # # ; laptop the shoulder straps are plenty long , and it holds what i need it to for work but , when we go on vacation , i have to be very picky about what i pack in there my biggest complaint is the carry handle on the back ... it 's already tore loose on the inside now , i just have to carry it by the shoulder straps not happy about the handle ... but the bag is n't a bad one
one major flaw and i do n't understand the positioning of it : there is a row for pens to be inserted that <unk> below the flap it does ' t seem like a big deal ... at first
pros : well made ; well designed ; looks good cons : advertised on manufacture 's web site to hold # . # `` notebook it holds my dell xps # , but barely -- inside securing straps are strained to make it work bottom line : i like the bag i use it i 'm glad i got it
my laptop and all its accessories fit in it perfectly and my laptop is # . # inches so i was worried about that . works great for what its intended for and looks great as
i bought this to use for a carry on bag when flying my # & # # ; laptop fits perfectly -lrb- it would probably take a # & # # ; -rrb- along with notebooks and earbuds and other stuff it has plenty of pockets and even slots for pens and mechanical pencils very nice looking and is comfortable to carry with shoulder strap it is very well made and i would rate it as heavy duty , so should hold up well for my uses
good quality bag but like others have said , the handle on top is not well positioned and the plastic hardware should have been metal for more durability it does fit my hp # . # very well and there is plenty of room for my # . # in tablet as well
really nice bag lots of space for a gamer republic asus # . # inch . . laptop ... plus # notebooks n charger n still space good deal ... cons it hang a lil weird wen carrying using shoulder
nothing special about this messenger bag , but it is great for what it is very simple and convenient , but also provides sufficient space for belongings as well as sufficient protection for your laptop for the price , i highly recommend it
solid bag , all reports of & # # ; off putting handle & # # ; are greatly exaggerated the handle is not dead center and some ppl ca n't handle that all that aside , the bag is sturdy , comfortable , affordable , and roomy
good easy to carry bag hold a lot like the safety straps on the inside it needs a <unk> pocket that you can access <unk> out side without opening the bag though
i agree with <unk> who note that without a laptop in the bag to stiffen it the bag carries a little off for my use this is more than offset by the number and variety of pockets and pouches to keep all my & # # ; stuff & # # ; organized it has served as brief case , computer case , man bag , overnight bag and once as a <unk> bag
personally i was expecting something sturdier , but its whatever its pretty much just thin fabric and <unk> plastic i use it as a school bag i personally would go for something else if given another chance but in all honestly it 's not a horrible bag
like this bag a lot , my toshiba x # . # & # # ; laptop fits perfectly the bag has plenty of pockets and compartments for different items needed when travelling the bag also does not look so formal so when i use it when i 'm not working i do n't feel like i am carrying a briefcase high build quality and would recommend to anyone
the padded compartment securely holds a # . # & # # ; laptop with no problem , even with a <unk> battery it has ample storage for cords , adapters , and other peripherals the only drawbacks are that i 'd prefer a longer shoulder strap and the pen compartment could have been better designed , but these are minor quibbles
this bag is roomy enough to hold my laptop and the stuff i need for travel the handle is great and fits nicely over my carry on handle , with out pulling
the bag is much larger than i expected so my intended use is up in smoke that is not a negative it is a very well made bag ideal for students and professionals who do n't require formal looking laptop cases i have found the bag very useful for my writing , gaming and having all i need to quickly pack and organize ant information required by the <unk> and <unk> offices for my family the only downside is the handle is badly placed for the design , the shoulder strap is the only way to comfortably and securely carry it because it is such a sturdy meant for hard use bag , it is heavier than others , keep that in mind it 's not a substitute fir a handbag , but it makes a fair diaper bag if you pack it right yes , i will recommend this as a good buy
this was a gift for a busy guy and it suited his purposes and needs perfectly good size and with pockets for pens and being able to divide the interior into computer space and space for books and papers is a bonus
bag is well constructed , lots of pockets for peripherals and cables , quite robust with good protection for laptop shoulder strap is nice and wide with a good pad overall i 'm very happy with it
this bag seems sturdy , has plenty of pockets , and accommodates larger laptops than many other bags can my main complaint is that the largest compartments do not have zippers or anything else that would let them close fully this probably is n't a big deal for your computer , but if you 're storing smaller objects in there , they could easily fall out when the bag is held at an angle
you get what you pay for this bag is n't flashy , does n't look like anything special , and does n't hold its shape very well if it is n't packed full of stuff but , the shoulder strap is comfortable and distributes weight well , the material is very durable and it has tons of pockets and lots of space inside altogether , i got what i paid for it 's certainly useful
not too sure why people say the straps fail this bag has gone through two semesters at university without a problem the handle is a bit awkward , but functional plenty of pockets . no tears as of yet
the bag is not too big and not too small it 's just right for my # in laptop , a couple of notebooks , a book , pens , and miscellaneous stuff it 's sturdy and looks good that 's all i care about if you need to haul large things around , this is not the bag for you if you have a laptop , it 's connectors , and a few notebooks , then you 're good to go with this and you ca n't beat the price
we found the bag to be very well made it does meet description as seller has given one other person commented how it does not lay properly when using the carry handle the shoulder strap works much better if you are looking for more of a briefcase style , this may not be your choice product is good
the bag shipped quickly , arrived just as fast and it was <unk> what i was looking for plenty of room , multiple compartments and easy to carry all i need back and forth from work
i found it difficult to find a great bag for my # . # & # # ; hp envy that matched style with a decent price this bag works great and holds everthing i am pleased with this purchase
the messenger bag is great , it has enough space for everything you might need and also has an extra spaces to place your laptop and secure it just great , very satisfied
i have had my case for a couple of months now and i love the velcro idea of being able to describe me on a computer bag i also love the protection it gives my laptop finding a bag like that is kind of hard to find that is durable and great in quality yes i would buy this bag again keep up the good work
first it actually holds a laptop with a # inch screen -- others claim or <unk> they do and do n't many more pockets and spaces than i had expected and construction seems solid comes with & # # ; lifetime replacement warranty & # # ; for defects in materials and workmanship handle and strap are sturdy and strap is nicely padded as is the side of the bag that faces the owner did n't think it would hold all the stuff i had been carrying around in a bag related to my laptop -- but it easily did snaps are sturdy and adjustable as is removable carrying strap ca n't think of anything else i would have wanted from a laptop carrier
i bought this bag to my boyfriend as a birthday gift and he loved it very much i gave him the green one because he likes this color he 's a electric engineering student so his stuffs are many including a # -inch laptop he said it would be so heavy to hold books with laptop by this bag maybe he can use it when he has no classes anyway , it 's a good gift
i ordered the green - a very nice quality product for the price sturdy and well built a little larger than i anticipated - i should have measured it out before ordering but i still like this product
this <unk> has all the options that you would desire in a schoolbag , <unk> , or whatever you may choose it to be amazon has them in red , blue , green , and maybe other colors as well it has several storage compartments and even comes with a detachable id holder -lrb- if you need one -rrb- to be placed on the velcro spot just above the buckle straps i would highly recommend this bag to anyone
i 've been looking for a practical messenger bag -lrb- man bag -rrb- for several months everything i found at stores like <unk> and <unk> cost anywhere from $ # - # for a canvas bag this bag exceeds my expectations the seller got it to me sooner than expected thank you !
is not rigid so it kind of takes on a shape of its own depending on what is put in it , has plenty of slots to put stuff , more pockets would be good for
no problems here , enough compartments but not so many that there are just random pouches for nothing . its hard to find a good bag for a big computer i would buy again and recommend to anyone who needs a large computer bag
i was a little concerned about purchasing a bag that was so cheap , but i was absolutely not disappointed when i received the bag it has a lot of pockets for organization and even with quite a few pounds inside , it was still easy to carry thanks to the shoulder strap pad and the pad on the back of the bag would absolutely recommend this product to anyone
i now commute to work by bike the majority of the year and would keep my home work in a backpack with a light change of clothes i went through several backpacks and my home work would get crushed and my clothes wrinkled i believe it was the body heat from my back during the ride not too bad in winter but a <unk> in late spring , summer and fall i made the switch to this messenger bag a few months ago and my home work stays flat and my change of clothes , which fits nicely into the laptop compartment , are in far better shape the bag sits lower on my back and does n't swing around front and so i stay cooler on my ride into work as well
this bag is great , it is very durable canvass , but super light compared to my old bag the strap extends to quite a long length i originally had a solo and swiss gear bag and to me there is no comparison for the build quality , number of pockets and functionally and price , my previous bags do n't compare there are so many pockets in this bag that i actually lost a book in it it was a very small book and easy to lose , but i searched and searched until i finally held the bag upside down and <unk> it until out it fell this bag is amazing i will buy another one
i just got the bag about a week ago , and i love it one of the most important thing for me was to get a bag with straps that did n't cause <unk> of my injured shoulder the pad is n't overly thick , but has enough to it that it <unk> the weight out and keeps the strap from sliding around on my shoulder , and it 's awesome i have a # inch laptop , and it fits in the laptop section and has a bit of breathing room to boot my tablet , which i use mostly as an e-reader , fits in the front compartment easily and is handy to get to when i just want to check email or read a book i like the velcro patches just inside the cover and on the outside of the cover handy to put a school id in , or add other items with velcro it comes with an <unk> holder , but it would be super simple to add anything you can put velcro tape on the color is good , and i do n't see it showing stains and such too much as i use it
this bag does n't have a lot of padding , but it is light weight and has tons of pockets my toshiba # `` laptop fits with ease it would probably fit well with an extra protective sleeve , also i use this when i 'm only carrying my laptop in the car i use a more rigid , more padded case when traveling via other means
this messenger bag is the best bag it has so many storage compartments and is perfect for carrying your laptop in i absolutely love it transaction was great too ; delivered right on time
sturdy , and carries a lot of space , and it 's eco-friendly , what more can i ask for i 've used i it too and from work countless times and i must say i 'm enjoying it
it may have bad reviews but i think i fixed the problem i put super gorilla glue on the clips and i think its never going to unclip and drop my laptop <unk> for glue ! i may never be able to remove the strap but i do n't care i would not use the handle anyways
this carrier bag is excellent it has multiple compartments that are great for storage i use it everyday for work my laptop feels protected without adding too much bulk i would recommend this bag to everyone its inexpensive , looks great , and is very functional
i bought this bag to have on hand should i need to travel with my # . # & # # ; laptop , which is rare i do however use this bag daily while commuting back and forth to work and i am impressed with the quality as others have posted , this bag has plenty of pockets for storage which is nice i switched to this from a daypack designed for similar use and i find the layout of this bag to be far more convenient
nice bag , good quality plastic <unk> may be not so strong enough , if you load this bag with # inch gamer 's laptop and accessories , but may be i 'm wrong and they are good , just feelings i recommend it to
i walk a couple of miles each way to work this bag is easy to pack a couple things i need to transport and a light change of clothes if the weather 's bad
perfect for my needs got a laptop i need to carry round everywhere with me - and this bag was just what i was looking for i did n't want anything too business like or school like this was cool looking and perfect
i love this bag i mean , i really really love it the only suggestion i have is to make the front flap a little longer to cover the pen holder in front other than that this bag is my fave on
this is my first and only messenger bag so you may want to give my comment little credibility the bag easily fits most of the things i need i regularly have # textbooks in it along with gum , <unk> , glasses , and a couple other things i just always keep in my bag so there is a decent amount of `` random crap i carry around `` space
i have a # . # & # # ; laptop and an ipad along with notebooks and school stuff that i use this bag for it is perfect and is made well i even can use it while riding my bike to school this has become my new favorite bag i would recommend
it was just what our granddaughter wanted seems to be a bit on the heavy side but it is the type of material and should hold up well through her college
i just received this as an anniversary gift and already love it the canvas is very strong and sturdy the clasps and closures are well built the design is excellent and the layout is great i imagine this bag will last me for years where others have let me down after a few months i 'm currently using this as a daily carry-all between home and office no worries about scuffs or tears with this kind of durability
this bag is lightweight but has plenty of room i can put my laptop inside along with all of my work materials it is easy to carry , it comes in great colors i recommend this to anyone wanting a briefcase
this bag is great , especially considering it 's much cheaper than a lot of bags of the same quality a great buy for anyone who has a large screen laptop , and who has to carry lots of additional accessories
this messenger bag is awesome it fits my macbook pro , sketch pad , wacom intuos # and so much more i do n't know how i got around without it very durable and protects all my stuff very well oh ... and its not girly looking
this is a great bag , and would work very well for most electronics it has several pockets and spaces to carry cables , usb drives , and things like that inside the bag are # separate pouches , i carry my xoom in one of them , a binder that holds my paperwork in the middle , and the bluetooth wireless keyboard for the xoom in the remaining slot this bag has everything i could need for transporting and maintaining my xoom when i travel to and from my college classes
it is a gift to my niece as she <unk> this year and it looked perfect for college i could not believe all the pockets and set up of this bag , hoping to be user friendly and convenient because it is a gift , can not give details further on the product other than the fact that it was more than i expected and looks better in person
i needed a new `` field briefcase `` for traveling and working . i have a # `` work laptop and this bag was the best value option i could find for the larger computer plenty of storage well made i look forward to using it for years to come
this can fit my giant laptop that is # & # # ; i needed something for my hp but all of the other laptop bags might have well been called suit cases this one has the needed space for the power pack , my notebook , ipad , phone and other cables and still is pretty _ flat _ and carries nice i would recommend it
all of the complaints about the strap in the reviews must have been listened to by mobile edge , the clips latch and lock in now really like the bag , the cotton strap is quite make it a comfort to carry .
i used the same backpack since i was in middle school - but now as a teacher , i figured it was time to get a new bag this fit well for my
forget any negative comments on this bag it 's a winner ! great size , lotsa ' pockets , durable material , practical i 'm gon na ' use it to <unk> my <unk> , music and eventually laptop it 's great for all this & more handle is a little off-center ... who cares ?
i have to admit , buying something that is designed to protect items <unk> laptops & tablets must be good this item is very good if not great very well made !
i ordered this bag as a gift for my fianc & eacute ; e and was pleasantly surprised to see how large and roomy it is there are plenty of pockets and storage compartments for anyone who totes around peripherals and other laptop accessories , and it will easily accommodate a # & # # ; screen the stitching is top notch and the canvas is heavy duty and ready to take a beating i am getting ready to order one for myself now :
i 've owned this bag for three years i love it and will buy another if this ever wears out - which it does n't appear to be close it 's true the handle is not positioned <unk> it 's true that the back laptop pouch is not padded on the outside panel the black strip that protects the pens will wear through in spots after a couple years of heavy use but this back is tons of convenient storage compartments features are very practical it 's very durable overall it protects everything in the bag very well can fit quite a large load if you need to
durable looks great , definitely designed for the long haul , breaks out of the old traditional look along with a smart design on the inside to secure lap top
i love this bag it fits my laptop perfectly i got it to replace an older bag i got before the inclusion of the handle is really nice and i love that i 've got space for things like my books and binders
this bag is great and i feel very secure with my laptop inside it also has a lot of pockets and holds a lot i really love that i can strap my laptop in with the velcro and then snap a button on a different part to make it extra secure only downside is that the handle is not centered -lrb- i had read the reviews on that part so i was prepared -rrb- really not a huge deal since i carry by the strap
this bag is perfect for my needs i carry my laptop , the charge cord , a # ring binder , pens and on and on i love that it is made of canvas it is very well made and there is nothing <unk> about it i highly recommend this bag to anyone who needs a great bag
very useful - plenty of pockets & compartments very functional and well worth the price velcro strips on exterior are great for putting id tags , unit patches , etc . on the bag to personalize it
i needed a lightweight yet large capacity bag for school and this messenger bag fit the bill perfectly it 's got pockets upon pockets , opens and closes easily and the olive drab color goes with anything i wear it 's also very durable and cleans up easily the bag it replaced cost three times as much and was n't nearly as functional
plenty of pockets and places for organizing documents , pens , accessories , and ... oh yeah ... laptops it has several straps that secure your items in place so they are n't dislodged or stolen or whatnot i often carry # laptops , # chargers , a removable hdd , wireless usb mouse , folders , pens , small paperback books , headphones , and other accessories all at the same time with room to spare i really like this bag my only complaint is the handle at the top - it is not centered and causes the items in the bag to pull the bag away from the handle it 's not really a problem for me , as i usually use the shoulder strap
positive : it 's roomy there are tons of pockets there are so many that i only use a few i love the way it looks and feels it 's easy to carry and always looks great negative : i 've pinched my fingers a couple of times when i 'm buckling it up and , i 'm no <unk> i mean , they get caught in the buckle when i 'm snapping it , and it causes blood i 'm more careful now but , be forewarned
there are a lot of little things that go into the design of this bag and they are all very well thought out there is a cushion built into the back where the case would normally & # # ; bump & # # ; into when you walk so it cushions you from the laptop even the bottom is reinforced and overall the bag looks like it would survive a tug of war between <unk> <unk> and a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> ! -lrb- though we all know the truck would n't survive . there are plenty of storage pockets and a nice pen/pencil holder row it even has a little <unk> id pocket with a strong velcro backing that can be put on multiple places the strap is very comfortable and the handle is comfortable as well i use it for my dell studio and simply could n't be happier i would consider this bag a hell of a bargain at $ # more than i paid for it
this bag is pretty durable and has a lot of storage space even with an oversized laptop inside of it there is still room for a few notebooks and a textbook
clips on the strap swivel everything works great love how much room it has holds my laptop , <unk> power , tablet , some folders and books , all the cords i need and i still have some room for stuff
first off , there are some reviews that talk about how the strap is does not swivel since those reviews were submitted , mobile edge update the strap to be a swivel strap and the clips no longer are purely plastic the bag is very durable and really seems like it will hold up for a quiet some time the large clips that hold the flap are strong and really hold the bag closed there are a good amount of compartments and more then enough room for everything you need the only cons are the back side of the laptop compartment only has padding where the laptop bag hits your hip / leg also , i do agree the handle should have been centered instead of being placed to the back side of the bag also , the green version is brown all in all , this bag is great and i would strongly suggest getting it for the price , this is a steal
i do n't often leave the house with my laptop , but bought this bag for times that i will there is plenty of space inside , and my # . # & # # ; toshiba fits comfortably in the bag
it fits my # & # # ; laptop and my air <unk> lap stand plus it has plenty of space for cables and mouse i don & # # ; t use the pockets though ; they & # # ; re kind of lame , but i don & # # ; t need them
i bought a dell # inch notebook and it fit into this bag perfectly the second compartment of this well made bag is very useful and contains three velcro pockets to store accessories -- plus much more room for other things the back of the bag has a compartment to store folders or papers for easy access this is a good , solid bag and i am very pleased with the construction
have purchased targus cases before the quality was excellent , as expected i would buy this product again and i do recommend it to everyone , to protect and carry a large # & # # ; laptop , with room for large charger and plenty of accessories my fitment - dell precision workstation m #
i love the bag i have a # . # `` -lrb- acer aspire # <unk> # -rrb- laptop , so the case is big , but the foam divider helps keep the laptop secure , and in place with the divider , it also lets me put the charger beside the laptop the compartments on the outside and the <unk> compartment on the inside have plenty of rooms to put flash drives , a portable hdd , mouse , mouse pad , etc . you could also fit your charger in there as well , but i just chose to utilize the extra space it 's very durable , but of course , not as much as the high-end targus cases , but you usually do n't get that type of quality until you spend upwards of $ # or $ # i believe this case is now $ # , but when i bought it about a month or so ago , i got it for around $ # for that price , it 's surely a deal at $ # i 'm sure it has more competitors , but at a ~ $ # price point , it wins , hands down
i am very happy with this case great product that i could n't find locally sometimes i wonder why i even bother trying to buy locally since more often than not i spend a lot of time searching and ca n't find what i need
product info states that it will fit a # `` laptop i have a # `` laptop and it still stuck out a good # `` over the zipper field i really like the handle and the extra pouch feature , which led me to purchase the item i figured if it fit # `` the case would have no problem with my # `` laptop i would only purchase this case if your laptop is # `` or smaller i saw it was made by hp and had my doubts about actually purchasing it i should have listened to my gut
i think that this is a good quality case , but it will not fit my # & # # ; asus laptop it will fit any laptop under # & # # ; but it will not fit # & # # ; laptops as it
the shipping for the product was fast fit my hp dm # laptop perfectly my only complaint is that the laptop sleeve was dirty there was an red mark on it that was clearly visible and there was an overall <unk> stain marks that were visible when you look closely i expected it to be in perfect condition since it was new the price was cheap though the company needs to handle the product more carefully and not stain it
the product is fit my # & # # ; hp laptop but a little bit tide the colour is darker than i thought ; it 's gray , not silver colour like i thought it 's still a good product
this case was just as i thought it would be with one minor issue the handle elastic stretches beyond its cover when used and only on one side , which leads me to believe there is a defect in this case otherwise i like it very much my computer is white so it was a perfect match all around
i purchased this item thinking it would match the hp <unk> notebook exactly when i received it , i was slightly disappointed at it 's color it looks much <unk> than in the photo the interior is <unk> -lrb- a nice feature -rrb- either way , i am satisfied with this sleeve & it arrived quicker than i anticipated
this sleeve fits perfectly in my # inch hp laptop i carry it with me in my backpack for more safety there is also a handle to carry from too the zipper opens at one side of the sleeve , so its easy access i also like how there is an outside pocket with zipper to carry my pens or charger in . this is my first laptop sleeve that matches great with my silver laptop i recommend this notebook sleeve to anyone who has a # & # # ; laptop ! soft and cushioned on the outside , in
it just not a nice sleeve , but it also matches the laptop of my wife perfectly i guess this is a must for <unk> kind of laptops -lrb- in the sense of image -rrb- and the pouches that this sleeve has are really usefull
very nice sleeve as it has ample padding on both sides especially the side with the pocket zippers are well place the laptop compartment only opens from one side so it wo n't allow the laptop to slip out easily the accessories pocket opens all the way allowing you to remove items with ease if you needed to search for something it is not a problem as well if you just wanted to bring the laptop alone , it 's a very nice feature to have the handle as well i would recommend it for anyone looking for an inexpensive sleeve the only down side is it would get dirty easily due to the color , but that does n't matter to me
