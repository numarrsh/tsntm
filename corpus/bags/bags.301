i 'm still airing this out on a pole outside a snug fit for the sam chromebook i really do n't see any ` slop ' in the fit the top flap is sort of a ` pain ' since it ` tucks in ' on the sides guess that 's necessary to eliminate velcro
i can slide my # . # & # # ; # mba in the case , but it 's nearly impossible to get the flap closed as far as quality goes , it 's fine ; i just think the flap design is stupid
the macbook air fits perfectly inside the case i thought that the case would be a bit thicker , providing more cushion in order to protect my laptop , but i find it to be a bit thin it is a good buy if the reason why you purchased it is to keep the laptop free from scratches
was too perfect to fit laptop had to return it these cases run small so keep that in mind this is great if you wanted to keep your laptop in a bookbag it will protect it while case is in it very slim form factor so it will not take up additional space in the bookbag great product for that use if your case does n't have enough padding to protect it
i purchased this for my macbook air i wanted something that i could just place in my backpack and slide my laptop down into it works well for that purpose but the red dye that is trimmed on the item has brushed off onto my laptop case and other things it has not <unk> the use of the product
nice , padded sleeve i purchased for a samsung chromebook case fit perfectly , and did its job perfectly fine for a few months after about # weeks , the stitching around one of the corners came loose and unraveled quickly , leaving one of the corners of my computer relatively unprotected it still covers most of it just fine , but i did n't buy a case for & # # ; most & # # ; of my computer that said , for # bucks , i ca n't complain * too *
this is just a <unk> soft <unk> case for your # . # & # # ; laptop i use it -lrb- until my thule gauntlet sleve comes in -rrb- for my samsung chromebook the fit is perfect , the protection sucks , and its nothing to look at and another thing the little emblem in the corner they brag about in the description ... it doesnt have that either its not waterproof it will keep your device from getting a little scratch , but nothing more than that if money is a key factor ... its better than nothing ; but if you can , spend a little more and get something better you owe it to yourself , and your device
the case fits very snug and tight , which is what i wanted , and protects the unit from getting scratches it 's just a little bit difficult to flip the cover flap over , but i am used to it now simple and effective
fits the # . # samsung chromebook perfectly protects it from <unk> well after several months , the area near the edging , where the & # # ; hinge point & # # ; is starting to separate still works fine , but eventually that is where it will fail i still think it is a good product for the price i like that there is no zipper or velcro to mess with , its just a simple & # # ; envelope & # # ;
i use this on an asus sleeve vivobook x # e , the only model that was dressed perfectly with no gaps the material is of good quality , seems durable and has good workmanship in sewing has honest price single point of not liked but would not prevent buying again is a detail in the red fabric that you may also have placed or sewn into the tip to not get loose recommend buying if your notebook is the asus or x # e has the same measures
it is inexpensive , practical good protection of my macair even thought it smell like hell when delivered , but after put in open air place under the sun the smell disappear almost completely
bought to use on # & # # ; mac book air my mac has a hard plastic cover and this fits fine the flap takes some stretching to close it this is fine and should add that extra protection when the mac is in my bookbag
this nice neoprene case really would fit an # -inch laptop it would fit our ipad if we took it out of the otterbox case , but what 's the point the only use for this size case is for our kindle fire hd # -inch tables in their cases it 's perfect for travel we have some odd kid tablets that also fit nicely in these cases i really like this for travel and recommend these for a tight fit
although it came late , i got mad , i <unk> case star because # they made it up , # the case is great it fit my school laptop <unk> and keeps it safe
the price is right for this it is not a fancy sleeve but it does protect my # & # # ; macair from scratches while transporting it the fit is good this is not a protective case , if you want something that will protect your laptop if you drop it this is not what you want
i love it personally though i 'd prefer for the top flap to not overlap , that extra bump gets annoying when you 're looking to <unk> as much space as possible fits my chromebook somewhat perfectly , it 's a bit tight width-wise but length-wise there 's a little extra space
the # inch fit is good . use it as a protective layer before tucking it away in backpack , briefcase or computer bag , so it 's just # of # layers of protection just # quibbles this sleeve smells very very strong and you have to air it out a long time second is that the flip over flap is not easiest to cover and <unk> without some muscle , so wonder how long it will last or will take to flip over and close before it gets easier product came in time stated for the price , it 's a good layer of protection for situations requiring light protection , or as a first of # layers of protection recommend it , if you can deal with the smell in first weeks
it really looks great , strong black color with red border it smells a lot if you do n't like the neoprene smell -lrb- kind of plastic smell -rrb- stay away it comes with a small <unk> bag made of fine soft cloth for securing the mouse .
macbook air is very quick to take in and out i can put my usb cable in there also so i always have it to charge my iphone with i had to keep it outside for a few days for the strong ink smell to dissipate
i bought two of these sleeves for my parents for their chromebooks it fits well , offers good protection , and seems like it 'll hold up well decent price for what it is too
this item was shipped in a very timely manner it was a great item i was just expecting more and i will be sure to research the product a little better before my final purchase it works well for the intended purpose and overall i am happy with it
i use this for my new samsung chromebook -lrb- # . # -rrb- and say it fits almost perfectly i 'm a bit of a <unk> when it comes to cases and i like sleeves to fit nice and snug all around this is almost prefect the sides are snug as is the overall fit the only place where there is a bit of play is on the top and bottom . - there is about a good # inch of room for it to slide up and down a bit being that this case has a nice fold over design that is not a huge issue because there is at least no zipper to scratch the laptop the padding itself is nice and thick similar to case logic for $ # it 's a solid value overall , i would recommend this to any new samsung chromebook -lrb- arm -rrb- owners
got this for an acer chromebook and it does the job i think several posters mentioned the strong rubber smell it <unk> when first unwrapped , but that dissipates after a couple of days the pouch is nicely fitted and seems well-made the zipperless construction does n't pose a usability problem and probably helps reduce the cost a nice case very good value
i bought this for an asus # . # & # # ; notebook with a maximum height of # . # inches because of its height the flap of the sleeve does not close fully like in the picture however the material is still good and yes , it does have that rubbery smell but just let it air out and it 'll be fine overall , # . # stars for the quality and material fits well except for the flap not closing fully
i was worried that the & # # ; industrial & # # ; smell would be overwhelming , it was n't that bad i plan on washing it in the washer and a air dry , i hope that will get rid of the smell as for the case , it 's a solid case that does it 's job a little thinner than i would have hoped but , overall good
perfect for my samsung chromebook or macbook air both fit in snug and securely , while keeping my notebook safe from scratches when stored great quality , and nice design too
my # inch asus touchscreen notebook fits in this sleeve quite snugly perfect for just throwing in your bag and not worrying about getting any scratches it had a weird new plastic smell when i got it , but it went away after a couple of days looks really neat
all i wanted was a nice , compact , snug-fitting sleeve for a new # . # `` macbook air so that it could be carried in a briefcase with a few other things that 's all i needed , that 's all i got , it fits perfectly great price too , and free amazon prime shipping to round out a simple product for a simple need
i purchased this to bring my # `` macbook air with me on a recent trip across the country via air so i did n't have to travel with a laptop <unk> i have a neoprene sleeve for my work computer so i knew what i was looking for in a sleeve for my # `` mac it 's a nice sleeve and gets the job done especially when i 've seen the same thing go for a higher price in retail stores it is exactly what i was looking for
quite happy with this case it fits my # . # `` samsung chromebook snugly , with just a little wiggle room at the top the fold-over cover is awesome ; i 've had computers get scratched up by cases with zippers before , and this case avoids any chance of that altogether i travel with the chromebook quite a lot , which is why i bought it in the first place having a sturdy case to keep it from getting dinged up too badly is a huge boon strongly recommend this product it 's a light case , mind - it 's not designed to soak up heavy blows or drops from high places but it 's a good layer of general purpose protection for day to day bumps and scrapes
i bought this on an impulse i am pleasantly surprised on how well this case works i bought two of them for my twin sons for their # & # # ; macbook airs they are in a laptop program in middle school and need to bring a computer back and forth to school each day i bought them each a topcase rubberized plastic cover and then this case they fit snug , but not so tight it is difficult to get the computer in and out of the case they then put the computer into their backpacks protects the computers well i am very happy
this case fits my lenovo ideapad yoga # s perfectly when i first received it , it was a little tight but after only # uses , it fits perfectly every time i 'm actually glad it was tight initially , since now there is no extra room for it to wiggle around in there great for sliding it into a backpack or tote and getting some piece of mind that it wo n't get scratched seems very durable and stylish
i bought this for my new asus x # <unk> # t if fits wonderfully i was concerned about the smell as well but it 's not a chemical smell , it just smells like neoprene and unless you put it right up to your face and <unk> you do n't smell it and after # days you can barely smell it then it 's a great sleeve and this is exactly what i was looking for the red inside is super cool
easy to use i bought it for my samsung chromebook and it fits like a glove there was a plastic-y smell in the beginning when i unpackaged it but it has long since gone away i 've been using it for the past few months and it 's holding up great
so happy to have purchased this to protect the macbook air that my daughter uses makes me feel much better when she totes it around as accidents do happen : -
i bought this for my husband to use for his samsung chromebook it looks great and does a great job of protecting the chromebook when it is not in use the fit is snug which is great , but a little hard for kids to get in and out of -lrb- which was actually our goal -rrb- we have had it in constant use for several months now and there is no wear and tear at all
i bought this for my chromebook -lrb- hp # -rrb- and it fits it beautifully it 's mostly for keeping the scratches at bay while it 's in my backpack and it 's done just that it 's not flashy or anything , but the design is clean and it feels well made
i have acer w # p tablet and even with a translucent case wrapped around the tablet for general use , it fits well inside this neoprene case good purchase to protect my tablet for travel
says it fits macbook air but one of the reviews said it fits their samsung chromebook perfectly i do n't usually buy things on & # # ; hope & # # ; but i did and i was <unk> it fits my chromebook snugly and just how i 'd want , though a little stretching is required , but it 's great
this case is great i traveled through south america with it and it protected my macbook air from getting scratched did not add any extra weight to my suitcase or carry on worked out really well
the long and short is that it 's a shockingly nice sleeve for $ # -lrb- and prime shipping -rrb- to be frank , i was n't expecting much due to the price and <unk> amazon pictures , but it actually looks very decent in person it fits my samsung ativ smart pc pro -lrb- # . # `` -rrb- snugly i 'm very happy with it it did have a bit of a strong ` industrial ' scent upon opening , but i 'm not too worried as i do n't make a habit of regularly <unk> my electronics
i thought it is small before i opening the plastic bag however , it is about the right size for my # . # `` chrome book love the price and now i have protection for my notebook thanks for a wonderful transaction
i bought this for my # inch macbook air it fits perfect and is great case i use this to transfer my mba between home and work and it works great
i purchased this to cover a sony # . # & # # ; android tablet and have found it be a great general use case that keeps my tablet safe from wear and tear for a fantastic price
the case is designed for # . # inch laptops and my samsung chromebook is in this category in terms of width , it fits perfectly but in terms of length , there is still a small space of about # cm that is <unk> however , i tried spinning , flipping the case with my chromebook in it and the chromebook will not move back and forth inside the case it is perfectly secured in the case
this case works great for my chromebook ! good quality and offers excellent protection for a samsung chromebook this case is slightly larger than a case for a netbook but smaller than cases for full size laptops i found my netbook case did n't fit the chromebook as well as i liked which lead me to purchase this case very very happy with the fit <unk> a side note , it is listed for macbook air my roommates macbook air was very tight in this case he tried it because he liked it on my chromebook . fits chromebook great but he felt like it was tight on his macbook *** please note , i do not own a macbook air and did n't see what the case looked like on his macbook i am just <unk> what he stated . : -- rrb-
i think the design on this case is adorable , and the color is great , however , there is really no padding whatsoever it 's just # pieces of fabric sewn together the case i have for my old pc is way more padded and even though it 's # inches bigger , i 'm just going to use that i really wanted to love this , but i did n't it 's going back
another kuzy product that i love the look of but it arrived with the hook part already coming out and fraying it 's made of a polyester rope so all that needed to be done was that it be heat sealed to prevent fraying after it would be sewn in also it 's just about # too short ; again the <unk> did n't take into account the ease needed to fit the computer the <unk> from this brand are great ; they are aesthetically pleasing but they the designs need some <unk> let 's see how they do with a replacement
ordered this case two months ago great protection against scratches , that is the only thing i would count on this case for i have not dropped my macbook -lrb- yet -rrb- , but this case would offer no protection against a drop this is fine - i knew that going into it i carry my laptop with me everywhere and noticed that the string to loop around the button is starting to fray i 'm worried about it breaking within the month or two if that happens , i will still by another it 's a great case to protect the mac 's metal exterior
sleeve looks nice and feels good , very good fit over my # in macbook pro the only drawback is that it is not as well-cushioned as i had hoped for but will protect from scratches nonetheless
this sleeve is very cute , it 's got a good amount of padding so it keeps your laptop protected i just got it two days ago and have already gotten plenty of compliments i chose the purple chevron and it looks brighter in the picture than in person it 's more like a soft lavender it 's still very cute though
this is an adorable sleeve for your macbook pro it fits a # & # # ; perfectly -lrb- even with a hard case on your macbook -rrb- if you want a unique <unk> case , this is a great choice
its a very nice quality i do n't think it would protect it from drops but if you just want a sleeve it 's very well made and good quality and looks really stylish
this is a really cute chevron stripe sleeve for my daughter 's macbook air # `` it fits her laptop perfectly even with a hard case shell , however , i thought it had a better closure this closes using a button which is cute but i think it needs something more secure also , it is not as thick as i anticipated all in all it 's cute and will do the job !
i love this cover but it does n't fit over the skin i had on my computer i loved it so much i stopped using the skin on my computer so i could use the cover
i needed a basic sleeve to protect my macbook air when i carry it in a bag without a dedicated laptop sleeve this case is soft and lightweight , and squishy enough that it does n't take up too much extra room my only complaint is that it 's about a centimeter too short , so a little bit of my macbook sticks out it 's not enough to prevent the loop from going around the button and securing the sleeve , but it does make me worry about scuffs all that said , on balance this is a great sleeve , stylish and protective , and not boring like so many of the sleeves out there i recommend it to anyone who does n't want the <unk> <unk> to tote their <unk>
good quality , nice looking cover with moderate padding to prevent scratches wo n't prevent damage if dropped and is not waterproof , as it 's fabric cute button closure , and perfect fit for my macbook pro # & # #
i do , i love it it fits my # inch retina display with the speck cover perfectly , like a & # # ; glove . & # # ; it feels really sturdy and the button is super cute and closes it nicely the pattern is cool and the fabric is nice delivery was fast , and it came in a nice package i highly recommend it
i really love this laptop cozy , it 's a little big for my macbook air , but i love the design the button closure with the <unk> loop is nicely done this cozy fits in my bag and totally protects the laptop and when i 'm working the cozy makes a very nice pad to rest the computer on
i have a macbook air and this case is perfect for it it 's really cute and it protects my computer it fits really well too obviously this wo n't do much if you were to drop your computer on the floor , but it 's better than having nothing at all on your computer
fits my wife 's # & # # ; mb air absolutely perfectly we like the cloth texture a lot more than the neoprene of the other macbook sleeves well worth the buy , i highly recommend
this is just the cutest thing ever i have a big green michael <unk> tote that i use for work which compliments this pouch well i use this for my work laptop which is a # & # # ; lenovo with the big battery that we 've <unk> as a & # # ; diaper & # # ; due to the size this fits it well and i 'm thinking about ordering the gray chevron design too the design is great and it has lots of padding
i bought this for my macbook air # & # # ; and it slid in perfectly yes , it does n't have all that much protection but i think its worth it i use it to keep it protected when its in my backpack or bag , and around the house and it is very efficient i have absolutely no complaints
i love this sleeve cover it has such a unique look too it , and it 's made of pretty soft material on the inside so it wo n't scratch your laptop the only thing about it is that it is not too thick , so i would advise buying a hard case for the mba if you buy this sleeve just to give it a little extra protection if you will be carrying it in a backpack with books and such
this sleeve seems to be well made , and i like the fabric material , color , and pattern i use it with my # -inch macbook pro , and it fits well it is lightly padded and will protect my computer from scratches in my backpack and desk drawer , which is what i need you should know what to expect , though this sleeve will not protect your computer from banging around or falling if you need that , you 'll have to get something more heavy duty however , if you need something low profile , light weight , and stylish , this is for you
i love that this cover is different it fits my air perfectly and is bright and colorful you can not tell in the picture but the fabric is quilted on the inside providing great protection
this product arrived in a timely manner it 's very light-weight , and easy to carry around whenever i leave my messenger bag at home everyone likes this product , and i <unk> other to order it would def . recommend this to others
i love the teal and white combo i have a white # & # # ; macbook and travel to school with my laptop four days a week this sleeve protects it from debris and scratches , it 's perfect
this case fits my apple laptop perfectly it is very soft and stylish while providing plenty of protection it fits into any bag and is great for setting your laptop on while working i would definitely recommend buying this
the sleeve is perfect i fit in on my macbook air # & # # ; with no issues the air sticks out a little -lrb- maybe # & # # ; -rrb- out of the sleeve so not completely flush it still buttons right up and is very snug it is a nice vacation away from the standard black sleeves and cases and great for those seeking to add some flare w/o stickers on the mba
i love this cover because it keeps my mac book really protected i love the fact that if i do n't have my bookbag i can just keep it in the kozy to protect it when moving around the house
i love the sleeve i recently purchased for my laptop i love the color and the ease of taking my laptop in and out of the sleeve it is soft and easy to find in my backpack it is a great product , well made and i love the button detail to secure the laptop
i ordered this case and it came so quickly it was in my mailbox with in two days it is also such a good price and i love the way it fits my laptop the quality is great , and if it gets dirty i can just throw it in the washer which is nice
just got this yesterday and it fits my new computer perfectly i have a case on the computer itself so it fits nice and securely with no problems love the design as well
it 's hard to find a snug fit for the # in retina , and this sleeve almost made it however , no matter how careful or how slowly i closed it up , the zippers would scuff up the aluminium in the front corners of the notebook the scuffs would be easily wiped off , but the longer i used it the harder it was to wipe them off i 'm certain with time , they would permanently damage my machine perhaps this was a bit too tight a fit by a couple of millimeters , which i feel could be shaved off if they removed the permanent cloth tag on the inside of the sleeve shame , it was a nice sleeve my search continues
i like that this sleeve was very slim and fit my retina perfectly -lrb- perhaps a tiny bit snug should have come with a slight lip on one side to protect the case from the zipper but the zipper started breaking after about six months and is now completely broken it 's been less than a year and i 'm careful with my sleeve this is a ridiculous amount of money to spend on a sleeve if it has to be replaced every # months
yes , the zipper does scuff up the corner of my macbook pro with retina display just being honest here but no -- it 's not a big deal the case material is nice -lrb- a more rough , <unk> material than what you may be used to if you 've ever used a neoprene case -rrb- i 'd buy it again
not only does it fit perfectly , but the style is attractive yet understated if you 're the type of person who wants a functional case for gentle transportation -lrb- in my case , a backpack -rrb- that is n't covered in logos and gaudy colors , this case if for you i would emphasize that this case obviously is n't designed to provide protection against rough handling
this sleeve is exactly what i needed to protect my macbook while transporting it from place to place it fits nice and snug , and has enough padding to withstand some minor bumps the two zipper closure is nice because it can accommodate the power cord you can zip it from both sides and still leave it plugged in if you 're looking for a hard-shell type case , then this sleeve is n't going to be for you but if you 're in the market for a quality sleeve that is n't made of <unk> neoprene , this should work nicely
finally a case that fits the macbook pro retina # -inch perfectly case offers great protections and a place to put your mac on top of when sitting at a table i would buy this again if i had to
i bought it for my # `` retina laptop you can put # or maybe even # retina laptops in a storage case but there almost no room in other sections i like it anyway for its ruggedness i have to carry some of my music stuff with me and now i am sure that this backpack can give me more assurance of its safety
this is a great backpack for electronics and work documents i used to carry my laptop and tablet overseas and pretty rough conditions and everything held up with no problems
absolutely fantastic backpack easy to use in airports and plenty of room for other things i was concerned when i first bought it that it would n't fit much else in the other pockets , but there is plenty of room since i bought one , two of my friends have also purchased one
ca n't say enough about this pack i 'm a court <unk> and am able to fit my <unk> , laptop and everything else i need in it love the big zippered pocket in the back too for keeping documents this pack makes the most use out of every possible storage space it has and feels durable and well built
the best backpack i have ever owned , sadly i had to return it though when closed , the pelican case was just slightly too small for my # & # # ; gaming laptop it was very <unk> for me to return this , i even <unk> using a smaller laptop , that should tell you how awsome this backpack is - real pelican case , tought and <unk> function over <unk> quality <unk> - pelican case was too narrow for my # & # # ; gaming laptop , make you you guys inspect the dimensions closely before ordering
as a professional traveller having good luggage is a must if you need a bomb - and bulletproof backpack that can withstand the <unk> on a bad day , here it is it 's pricey yes , but it 'll keep your laptop safe and also your tablet
i like this thing it 's solid and compact i carry a # & # # ; macbook pro and a <unk> # hd in it with cables , hard drives and accessories this pack has saved my back
very cool backpack will most certainly protect your laptop ideal for a # inch laptop but will fit a # inch after installing the supplied padded inserts not the most spacious backpack but i do n't think that it was meant to be excellent build quality , top notch materials , feels very sold
i m traveling a lot and my laptop always got damaged and it takes too long to go thru security put my pelican u # in use no more damaged to laptop and thru security as lightning speed . thank you pelican for the great products
exactly what i was looking for : a light but cute carrying just enough to carry computer , charger and <unk> note pad not much padding , but that 's not what i was looking for
i recieved this as a birthday present to house my new chromebook it seems very sturdy and has lovely colors , however i think the padding should have been made a bit thicker i do think the laptop would survive , unharmed in this bag with a small tumble , but not much more still it 's a beautiful , well made bag and i am very happy with it
we were looking for a lightweight bag for our # & # # ; macbook pro that had both handles and a shoulder strap the one has it all , plus a separate zippered pocket to keeps cords secure please note , this is a soft foam case which probably wo n't keep out severe weather
bought this for my daughter as a christmas present and it works so well not too big and has compartments for other items you will not go wrong with this
this bag is perfect for carrying my # & # # ; macbook pro it 's not too bulky , and i love that you can carry it as a cross-body bag the extra pocket is big enough to carry my charger and a few extra 's the quality of the material is great , and the colors are very vibrant i would definitely recommend this bag to others
love the color love the bright , happy flowers lightweight , easy to carry , can hardly wait to take this on an airplane it will make customs easier because the laptop will slide out quickly
i absolutely love it it fits my ipad air & macbook air perfectly totally worth every single cent & is great for people who want something sleek and not bulky
this case is like all those neoprene cases you see in the store but so much more colorful i love the colors and i love the extra pockets inside for my stuff there is a big zipped pocket outside for cables but the inside one is good for pens , business cards and other stuff like mouse
bag material is excellent , styling very nice , good space and strap but plastic clasp broke immediately upon use did n't want to put up with potential return hassles 'cause needed the bag so made my own repair
the body strap does is so different from other timbuk # bags i 've purchased and simply is not good enough quality to handle any weighted laptop the strap lacks reinforcement at the end , which is poor planning by the manufacturer when carrying my dell # & # # ; laptop , the weight of the laptop causes the strap to shift naturally with the increased weight unfortunately , there is no reinforcement at the end of the strap to keep it from falling through the loop , sending your bag to the ground along with your laptop it 's great for lightweight items but do n't put any weight in it looks good but not good enough to deal with the <unk> <unk> needed to keep the strap from becoming loose and falling apart from the plastic hook why does this one not <unk> to ensure the strap never separates from the track
i did not like the way the bag kept sliding off my shoulder and twisting around not very comfortable to carry using shoulder strap once bag was weighted down with books i did love the color
