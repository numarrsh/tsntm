i 'm a big fan of the built ny <unk> - the # `` sleeve is a perfect fit for my asus eee pc # ha the stiff insert gives an added <unk> of protection and the netbook 's safe and secure in my daypack , camera bag or carryon the asus eeepc comes with a nice soft sleeve that 'll keep the netbook clean and scratch-free , but if you 're a long distance traveler you 'll probably prefer the built ny <unk> my ipod touch rides in a smaller version of the same sleeve and it 's very happy
i found this product to be truly terrible for starters , every time i opened my macbook with this case on , it would squeak and make a clicking sound secondly , the little feet at the bottom kept closing every so often also , i found that the cover was a tad bit loose i am returning this cover asap
i ordered what i though was a red one , it was orange when i got it i did n't get the free keyboard cover and one of the grips on the bottom was missing
this case arrived quickly , and in brand-new condition it is more <unk> and shiny than the product photo shows -lrb- looks cheap -rrb- , and did not fit my laptop as snug as i wished it had also , due to the fitting , when i opened/closed my laptop , it made a minor squeaking noise - not a big deal , but also not entirely reliable i sold the case after testing it out for a few days and invested in a $ # incase
it 's ok , but you do get what you pay for it 's not as good as the incase shells this one is slippery and the rubber & # # ; feet & # # ; that come off way too easily it 's not a horrible product , but i 'd rather pay a little more money for a better quality shell
i would 've given this case # stars if i could its a great case the feet in the back are a great addition and the case gives the laptop room to breathe so it does n't overheat my only issue was that when it arrived at my house it had a slight crack on the top and one of the rubber pads on the bottom had been put on incorrectly it was n't glued dead center it was sitting half outside of the circle so it came off almost immediately so other then that it 's definitely worth buying
at the beginning i was extremely satisfied with this case not only was it colorful and different from most other cases , it was for a good price however , three months into owning this case , the plastic stops located at the cover for the bottom of the laptop came off , and left a sticky mess , now covered by dust and dirt particles this is a minor issue , however it was a bit disappointing to see
the case itself is good i drop things a lot and am a <unk> so , my laptop 's safe and sound but , the keyboard cover is <unk> like the dye or something rubs off onto your hands i could n't figure out why my hands were so red until i say how much the keyboard was faded
the color is nice , but the fit is not as precise as i 'd like , and the texture of the plastic feels a little cheap it does protect the computer fairly well though
i like this cover it provides much protection and i love the concept of the little stands on the bottom but i feel it 's a little bulky compared to some of the other covers i see but i like it
i love the case however , you need too keep an eye on the amount of dirt that accumulated under the case it does leave scratches on the mac out shell my case is broken however i will be ordering another case
my son is very happy with this case -- it fits well , makes the computer easily identifiable as his and appears to offer additional protection it also shows off his love of <unk> and <unk> <unk> red : -rrb- very reasonably priced
the shell fits perfectly , easy to put on and take off my only possible complaint would be that the screen only goes back a little bit , like a # degree angle , but it works fine , and the stand works great
the product was what i expected for the price the case color is actually rubbing off and on to my computer and the jelly stabilizer underneath actually came off the bottom causing my computer to rock back and forth
i love the case it 's such a cute red an it really protects it but it 's not exactly the same as the picture it has almost a frame pattern around the outside , but that 's just me being picky
the case is great i love the pop out feet , and it looks so cute i was disappointed with the free keyboard cover , it is really annoying rubbery stuff that does n't seem to fit right , and is n't shown anywhere that i could see i thought it would be one of the nice keyboard covers like the ones shown working with ipearl to get a different keyboard cover
this fits my macbook pro nicely it 's kinda cheap and the little plastic bumpers on the bottom fall off to easily i like the color and the price though , ca n't be beat it is what it is
bought this and a red keyboard cover along with my sisters new macbook for her graduation looks sick on her mac as well as the stands which makes it look even cooler even though i wish it was a soft touch instead of the hard shell , it gets the job done also , i gave it # stars because there is one thing that seems `` iffy `` , the bottom rubber stoppers , i feel as if they will come off at anytime anyways , i 'm satisfied cause my sister loves it so thumbs up
this case is awesome for my macbook pro mostly due to the fact that it is pretty durable without the crazy <unk> i love the range of color that the company provides also the the vents on the bottom of great for long term use i highly suggest this product to both friends and family , and i guess the general public like yourself
this cover was just right for my new laptop protects well and very easy to put in place really like that there are feet for <unk> : does seem like they should be a little sturdier color -lrb- red -rrb- is good , would like a deeper red if i had my preference but , for the money , a good product
its an amazing case and fits my mac really well but only after a few months of having it one of the tabs on the bottom has broken off i see no real need to replace the case right away but if i do i will most defiantly order another one of these
so far i like this cover it is not as hard as i expected , but at least it didn & # # ; t break on the second day of use like the last one i bought the color is nice and i like the thingy on the bottom that raise the computer . so far so
the red hard shell mcover for the # inch unibody aluminum macbook is great just what i 've been looking for the item was easy to put on my laptop and looks great <unk> and from afar i especially love the pull out legs in order to get a bit of a tilt for better comfort and typing angle awesome price for an awesome product
the product is very durable and once it 's attached the macbook , it does n't take away from the quality and appearance of the macbook initially , i was annoyed with the fingerprints and scratches but i 'd rather have them on the cover instead of my macbook i 'm very satisfied with my purchase and highly recommend this product
i love it but the only thing i have complaint is the keyboard cover it did n't fit but other then that i love the case that 's the reason why i did n't give it # stars
while i love the case and i feel like my computer is very protected , the case fits a little loose on the bottom and can leave little scratches once dirt or something gets inside the case i feel it 's a small price to pay for the amount of protection offered overall
the hard shell case fits fine and stays on the laptop the keyboard cover fits better than a more expensive one i had previously purchased it also gives a better feel for the keyboard sadly , unlike the more expensive one , it is not removable i took it off once , and when i tried to replace it i found it had stretched upon removal , and now does not fit properly
only thing i do not like about it is that you ca n't open the screen all the way back it gets stuck at a certain point have n't put the case through `` combat `` yet , but so far the every day use doesnt <unk>
item arrived way before time and they even included a keyboard cover which was not mentioned in the description i love it this is exactly what i have been looking for and it is just as good , if not better , than its more expensive competitors if you are looking for a macbook case , this is the place to get it
this case fits nicely around the computer , is lightweight , and it props the keyboard up a bit so it 's much more comfortable for writing i have n't had any problems with overheating and it 's kept my computer clean and scratch free i recommend this case for those looking for something inexpensive but still decent quality
i just received my new case for my mac and its installation is easy as # - # you just take it out of the packaging and snap it on and you 're ready to use your protected mac i 'm a big fan of hardcover cases so that 's why i chose this product the colors are vibrant as well so it makes your plain silver colored mac more personal
the case is well designed i was impressed with the fold down tilt legs which provide the user with a more <unk> and ergonomic typing angle when using the macbook pro 's keys the color also dresses up the standard plain look of the macbook pro allowing the user to personalize their notebook also functionally protects the macbook from scuffs and scratches
pros : color is great protects the macbook pro well comes with keyboard cover ventilation on lower half of cover works lower half of cover comes with kick stand con : nothing conclusion : if your looking for a great protection and look for your # & # # ; macbook pro , this is it got this cover for my mothers laptop and if she loves it , so will you hope this helps reviewed by : @ <unk> on
i bought this for my sister as a gift for christmas and as soon as i got it , i had to order myself one very nice fit , and considering the price that you spend on macs , it would be stupid not to get something to cover it up with
i purchased a similar product at three times the price for my work mac i decided to try these for my kids ' computers very comparable in quality good fit to computer the kids love the keyboard cover i bought a red one and a black one love them both i think you will be pleased with this purchase
delivery did n't take long it is well packaged and nicely wrapped once it has been snapped in place , it stays on the legs in the back come in handy for <unk> the laptop the cover is exactly what i expected i definitely recommend this product ! -lrb-
it is still protecting my macbook pro i waited before writing a review , just in case i have had this item for almost a year and it is still protecting my computer i have removed it multiple times and it still snaps back on securely i did not know it had a stand until i saw the picture while writing this review i guess i will be writing another review about that
i love it , i now have a sexy red # `` macbook pro i love the fact that this shell case has those little things at the bottom to put the laptop at a slant i forgot what they are called , but i love this case very pretty bright red it 's super easy to snap it on too i 've also heard of people having trouble putting their screen all the way back with some cases , but i have no problem with that , it still moves as if the case was n't on im very happy
this thing is just amazing i love it got the red keyboard cover to match and the little legs can pop out on the bottom which is nice for when i 'm running a million things and my computer needs to keep cool
this product is just what i 've been looking for for my macbook air it gives the ideal amount of perfection and style without adding <unk> the slim ergonomic design of the device itself this is by far a five <unk> for anyone with a mac i also could n't get over the easy <unk> the cover it just slides right on ! ! the keyboard cover is great to have <unk> at keeping dust out of your keys , and feels almost if nothing is there ! ! ! may i say <unk> perfection ! ! ! ! !
i had no problems with ordering and receiving this product it got to my house in perfect condition and it has been working perfectly for the last # / # month
bought this to protect my new mac from scratches and wear and tear i bought it almost # years ago and i still have the exact same hard case on my mac theres a few small scratches , but after # years i wold expect nothing less this case is durable and i am glad i did n't spend more money on a more expensive one
i love this case the color is beautiful it fit <unk> i got it for a great price it looks really natural , like it was made exactly for my mac i am positive it will do a great job protecting my laptop it looks so nice on my new mac it was really simple to put on i did n't have to read the instructions the cover came fast
i had this clipped on my mac air pro in seconds the red looks fantastic with the kuzy circles keyboard silicone key cover would highly recommend thanks for a great inexpensive way to dress up my laptop
the cover looks really good and it does a great job protecting my mac seller shipped this really quickly so i got it within a few days definitely would recommend this product to anyone
i would recommend this hard shell case to anyone with an aluminum unibody mac laptop -lrb- you have to make sure you have a compatible mac model first . i looked extensively online before i bought an ipearl shell for my macbook pro and was so pleased with it that i bought one for my wife 's that she uses in her business price is reasonable and quality is outstanding plus , my wife 's case came nicely packaged with a free keyboard skin that makes the keyboard feel like velvet our daughter bought a macbook pro but did n't buy a shell to go with it the aluminum ended up with dents in it the old white polycarbonate mac laptops never had that problem , although the plastic did degrade i would never purchase an aluminum unibody macbook pro without buying an ipearl shell to protect it as far as i 'm concerned , this is the best product of its kind on the market , and the free keyboard skin is an added bonus
i like to keep my electronics in good shape so when i got my <unk> out mac pro i wanted a case that would help prevent <unk> or worse if i <unk> to drop it this case fits very well and is easy to take on and off if needed seems very strudy and looks great the the mac . i get comments all the time on how awsome the machine
love this transparent red case on in a snap you ca n't tilt the screen back the same amount as if the case was not on , but this is only a tiny issue apple logo appears thru the case and it seems very protective i might buy others in additional colors to make a fashion statement
i got this for myself before going away to school and it 's a really nice case it fits my laptop perfectly and does not <unk> opening or closing it at all the bottom is really nice with the holes so my laptop does n't overheat overall great product and a great price
this is a great laptop & keyboard cover set - its a great value at less than $ # and people are always <unk> on it and asking where they can buy the same one i am very happy with it
i looked at other possibilities for a hard case for our new macbook pro and after reading reviews chose this one more than one person commented on the speck case cracking , and while of course a defective product is not common , you never know when you could get one from the same production run the ipearl case seemed like very good quality at a very good price we 've only had it a couple of weeks and no problems so far it fit perfectly , was easy to snap on , and has a clever venting system on the bottom with little feet for necessary cooling we also purchased the keyboard skin cover in red to match so the macbook is now <unk> out in style and my daughter is thrilled
i am so impressed with this cover for my apple macbook pro not only does it stay in place , it fits the product perfectly and comes with two leg stands on the bottom to keep your product cool i would highly recommend this product to all i intend to purchase at least one more for color variety
cover for both top and bottom not bulky and love the color snaps on pretty easy love that you can still see the apple logo i just got it today and received many compliments already ! love it !
wow arrived on time even earlier than expected ! ! ! ! ... product perfectly fits on my macbook aluminum # . # `` -lrb- # -rrb- a # model . although i have ve expected that the hardcase red cover would be a little darker but in general its perfectly fits
excellent case for my macbook pro it fit perfectly and the little pull out legs on the bottom are a great feature i ordered the red one and the color is red not pink or maroon delivery was real fast too
i ordered this for my college macbook pro and it is perfect usually i do n't like to dress laptops up , but this is a very unique and durable product the color is accurate too i love it also , it has stands in the back to angle up if you know you will be typing or on it for a while oh and very quick with shipping too
this case has a matte finish & clips easily on once on , it has stayed on & is not bulky it is now easy to see , a fun color , and protected when i bring my computer places it is priced so well , i might buy another color just for a change a good investment for my laptop
there were a large variety of colors the case was easy to put on a simple cover that changed the look of my laptop and was n't expensive i really did n't like the keyboard cover but it came free with the cover so ca n't complain i would recommend this product
and the color is good too the cover came quickly , was priced extremely well , and keeps my sticky hands off of that stainless steel case the red makes it easy to see too when i leave my mac somewhere other than the desk you 'll like it
so excited about my new red case for my recently purchased laptop i was leaving on a trip and wanted to take the laptop with me but was concerned about protecting my new baby not a great selection of covers in the store and knowing amazon never fails me , got online red is my favorite color , so when i saw this ipearl mcover that included a free keyboard cover , i could n't resist reviews showed the keyboard cover was clear , so i was pleasantly surprised when it came with a red one the flip out kick stands on the bottom are great too i also ordered a red carrying case and everything was delivered to me overnight -lrb- shipping costs were no ridiculous -rrb- just in time for my trip could n't be happier !
this is a must have ... after spending a lot of time searching for a product to protect my macbook from the everyday use i found this case and decided to give a try so far it has met all my needs and more it protects the computer without getting in the way i had the case on the computer well within # seconds as i was headed out the door
i purchased this for my new -lrb- # -rrb- macbook pro it fits great and looks awesome people ask how did you get a red laptop from apple i love it keeps my macbook looking new deff prefer this over a skin that only covers the top being a picky person i like everything looking perfect worth the money for sure here is a hint when putting it on there are two tabs that need to go on first other then that it was easy install nice feel to it as well does not get hot after hours of use
my electronics all take a beating , so when i got a new computer i needed a case too my friend had a blue mcover ipearl case and i loved it so i ordered this red one it came the day it said it would i really like that its easy to take off and put on i also love that its see thru so you can still see the apple logo
i love my new <unk> , and my gf loves hers too we both bought the # inch macbook pro , and to distinguish them apart i got the red case , and she got the <unk> case also there is cut outs on the bottom so it does not cover up where there is heat , unlike other cases i also love it has the little feet now only if we could order matching keyboard and arm rest protectors it would complete the protection that these computers need
love the look feel and everything about this case i actually got a big scuff on it the other day and <unk> i was glad it was on the case and not <unk> i was sad it had made i big mark on the case i took a <unk> clean magic eraser to it , you ca n't even tell it was ever there - feels great to <unk> <unk> <unk> have a <unk> sticker design around the apple light and you can still see it thought the case if i had one thing that bugs me slightly it is if you put your hand weight on the front where <unk> it slides it off slightly seems a tab there would help but not a big deal
i love it i also have had so many postive comments on the case and everybody just loves it i told them where i got it so hopefully some more will come your way
it arrived very quickly after i purchased the seller had a good package for the case some of my friends are also looking for hard shell case for mac pro , they like the color and the design . it is easy to put on and suit my mac pro well the price is great , really worth it
great little item , fits well , looks good , not a fan that the back part is n't open -lrb- apple logo -rrb- but hey i did n't look at the pic still a good buy not bulky at all
the case was just as i expected and more i love the feet that flip out at the bottom even the cases at the apple store do n't rise up very good product , love it
i needed a protective cover for my new macbook pro # -in -lrb- i tend to eat while i compute , which caused the demise of the last computer -rrb- this fit perfectly , and looks like hard candy it does not make the computer look bulky
i had bought this same cover in orange which lasted me for over a year after i finally got bored with that one , i purchased a different brand of case which broke within a month of having it i decided to purchase this brand again and am so happy that i did the case is great , but the keyboard is even better it is n't sticky at all and is so easy to type on i will probably eventually get one case in every color
i was a little skeptical to buy this case at first , because other buyers had stated that it scratched their macbooks after one rough semester on my laptop using this case , it looks as good as new ! i absolutely love this product and am actually browsing for different colors since this one worked out so well :
this is an awesome shell fits perfect and offers the level of protection needed all while adding some color and flare to my laptop i would recommend this product and buy another one if needed
this hard <unk> is a perfect fit for the new , brushed aluminum body macbook pro with the l-shaped power wire it covers everything it needs to to protect the body but leaves all the ports open it will keep your macbook in good shape
the case looked just like the pic i would buy from the company again i got the pink for my cousin and the keyboard cover was n't good it did n't have the white letters like my red one good investment overall
i have had many mac book cases but the one feature i like about this case is that it has adjustable stands on the bottom and it came with a free keyboard case
i love red all my office and business items are red but my new laptop was silver : -- <unk> then i spotted this cover , and bought it right away it is gorgeous wherever i take it , i get compliments and <unk> it is amazingly easy to install ; does a fine job protecting my laptop ; and it has <unk> feet to allow better air circulation i love this item
love this cover for my new mac it 's beautiful and actually looks like the computer was made with that beautiful cover also like the fact that it comes in a variety of colors would make a great gift for a mac user
you spend a couple grand on a nice apple computer why not spend another few bucks to make sure it does n't get scratched this case was really easy to install it took me about a minute the colors are nice , because we have <unk> students who use their macbooks pros around the house the case is very durable , and once it 's on you do n't really notice that it 's there the case has a nice shape , and it is very easy to access all of the ports on the computer the case is also well ventilated on the bottom overall , the case is reliable , and an easy purchase
my favorite color is red online you can not tell if it is red , looks more like orange red when i received it in the mail i was very happy , it was red it was easy to put on i like the way it looks friends commented , they thought i got a new computer i also got the cover for my keyboard red , so now it really does look like i got a new computer
beautiful rich red color also came with a keyboard cover that was not mentioned in the description -lrb- unless i overlooked it -rrb- love it and have already received compliments
i purchased this item for my cousin who lives in new <unk> she love the color red the case was for all mac book pro , but it works on macbook air
i bought this case for my parents for christmas they absolutely love it the hard shell case wo n't scratch their macbook and it 's super easy to remove and clean plus , the feet are a nice bonus a really great case plus , you ca n't beat the price i 'd say it 's better than those more expensive cases many of my friends have the more satiny ones and they scratch up their macbooks and their are difficult to remove
just received the ipearl hardcase for the macbook pro and it fits perfectly shipping from amazon was quick and it was easy to snap on the # pieces great buy ! !
i got a red one , and the color is exactly what i through of , but it is a little <unk> for me i still can see my pro 's color under after i put it on i pretty much like it
i saw similar cases in my university bookstore , but they are $ # , i cant tell any difference between them and this one love it , red one is very gorgeous ! ! ! ! ! i may purchase other colors to my mac
i bought this case for two reasons i like the way it looks and to protect my macbook pro from scratches and dings snaps into place and is a perfect fit i recommend it
i got one of these last week , and it is a great deal at half the price i would have paid anywhere else i got a sturdy case for my macbook pro , that does n't get in the way of any of the ports , and looks good too could n't ask more for the price
i got this after looking at lots of cases online this one was affordable & really stays on it looks a bit more pink than red when on the laptop , but i can live with that
nice vibrant color and very good plastic quality it has a back stand that flips in & out that is not found in other cases sold with an affordable price , we like it
i bought this case about a week ago , it shipped very fast which i guess was good however when it came , only the bottom fit my macbook pro # inch the top did not fit do not buy it is a waste of shipping cost because you will just have to return it
the plastic was bent and did n't even snap onto my laptop properly every time i opened/closed the laptop , the covers would come off impossible to move i will be ordering a different case and returning this one
i would not recommend this product blocked off my lock slot rendering it unusable second negative -- the color is not like in the pictures , it looks too <unk> like i could not take my laptop in this case to work -lrb- provided i am a male and not working in a beauty <unk>
the little <unk> that are supposed to tilt the computer both eventually snapped off , and the little rubber grips on the bottom came off too the case is still protecting my computer , but it totally was n't built with a backpack in mind
even though it was n't expensive , i regret buying it after having it on for a few months , it had made marks on my # & # # ; mac pro and keeps snapping off i have decided to splurge and go for a more expensive , better quality case
i just received this product in the mail and the top and bottom cover fit quite well and snapped right on however , i am somewhat concerned because i did not receive the free keyboard cover as was promised in the description and there is no engraved window for the apple logo as the description also says this makes me question the credibility of the company , which makes me a little skeptical about the quality of this product i am worried that it will break easily or snap off after a few days of using my macbook or that it will leave scratches or marks on my laptop i will go out and spend extra money on a different case i would not recommend this product simply because some of the information given in the description is inaccurate , which is not something any reliable company would allow
i love the over all color and feel of the case -lrb- not ` sticky ' , like some -rrb- but i do n't know if it is the brand or this particular one but it does not fit very well over my mac there is a bubble on the front where the case just will not lie down
the case is decent quality , but mine did not come with the free keyboard cover as was stated in the product name this was one of the reasons i chose to buy this case as opposed to some of the others in the same price range i am not satisfied with this purchase and i feel like i 've been <unk> update : after jumping through several <unk> , namely contacting amazon customer service and ipearl customer service , i received the keyboard cover free of charge the cover is n't the highest quality it is made of pretty thin material ; however , it has been working fine for me thus far and was relatively easy to put on
i ordered two covers because i have a personal and school macbook pro i picked this particular one because i like the kickstand on it , and bonus it came with the keyboard cover but when i received my cases there was no keyboard covers for either one granted the case is n't very expensive , but i feel if you are going to advertise a free case you better really send it ! the material is not as sturdy as i thought it was going to be but the cases fit really nicely and it is still going to prevent my laptop from being scratched so the # stars is really because it was false advertising but the product is great so far ... minus the keyboard cover
if you 're going to buy this then i would recommend a laptop sleeve and make sure you keep it in there when you 're not using it ! the fit is great but i 've only had this for # / # and i can already see small scratches on the top case i have a sleeve and i use it but sometimes i get lazy and forget it ... it definitely shows a few scratches now . so be careful but honestly for the price i can deal with a few scratches oh also the free keyboard cover is crap . so many bubbles and it just wont stay but who cares . its
