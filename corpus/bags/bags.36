this case definitely does the job of protecting the computer and it 's easy to put on however , the case itself scratches very easily and gets dirty quickly and is hard to clean you can see fingerprints and scratches all over it and i 'm very careful with my computer i do travel around a lot , but treat it well overall , it does the job of protecting the computer but if you want something that will still look nice after a few weeks , you may want to look further
i really like this cover it does its job - it protects the laptop it does n't obstruct any ports and the apple logo looks pretty cool when it shows through the black cover however , the cover does look dirty since fingerprints , smudges , etc . . . show up on it easily besides the that , it is a good protective cover
as i bought my first mac book , i was bit cautious while handling it so i needed a good cover to protect my mac book i spent $ # for the cover and so far i am okay with the product i looked at the other cover which actually kill the feel of the apple ibook as those covers cover up the apple logo on the other side of the lcd screen but in this cover , apple logo is clearly visible so i would highly recommend this product to the people who want to project the mac book but at the same time show the pride as the glow sign of apple logo as the pride possession
i bought the pink satin cover even after reading some of the negative reviews the pink is more a day glow pink rather than a pastel and the material marks up very easily its quite annoying , so i will more than likely buy a regular pink hard case once this one gets too crappy for me to look at it also makes my macbook a lot heavier and my screen tends to close or go back a lot
i was so excited to receive this for my new pro it fit perfectly but it attracts dust i wanted another color but it was more expensive but i am still very happy i go it
this see-thru satin case was everything i expected it fits my # inch macbook pro like it should it has a feel of sturdiness and well built all of the ports are open , and i enjoy it the feeling on both sides help protect the laptop the inside is a hard shell that supports the actual lap-top the outside has a soft touch feel that supports opening , closing , and just protecting the laptop the only negative about this laptop is that at times the soft touch my <unk> with your finger prints , but do n't let that affect your choice this case is a great buy , and i found it for a great cheap price
overall , i 'm pleased with this purchase i was looking for something to keep my new macbook pro from slipping on my table and this does the trick -lrb- though it could have a little more grip on the feet -rrb- it 's a breeze to snap on and the black looks good with my computer the fingerprints are annoying and unattractive and nothing really wipes them off except that <unk> cloth that comes with it otherwise , it 's a fine cover the ports are exposed as they should be the case fits very well
i love the feel and the fit of the shell ... but i would describe it as more of an orange rather than a yellow i thought the picture looked more like a banana yellow but it is really <unk> in person
product shipped on time it came with a lint free cloth which i used to wipe down both the case and computer then , it snapped on tight , and i have n't had any problems i got the black one , and i love it because you can see the apple logo clearly shining through it adds very little <unk> i would definitely recommend this cover for your # `` macbook pro
i had this for a little while for my larger mbp i bought both within the same amount of time and liked it for a while until i noticed some issues with my # ' mbp since the metal of the mac series is used to keep the computer cooler , putting something like this on it does not help the ventilation i does protect the mbp from scratches , but the tradeoff is not worth it however , on my # ' mbp , i have had little issues of this problem i would assume because i do not game or do heavy <unk> on the smaller mac , but if you are looking to keep your portable school mbp in good condition , look no further
i 've had my macbook pro for about # months now and wanted to get one of these protective cases since i travel a lot and these computers are n't cheap when the case arrived , i was already a little concerned because of the other reviews i 've seen on here the case i received fit perfectly and was very easy to install my only problem with it was that there were some imperfections on the top of the case that look like stains i tried cleaning it off with various methods without damaging the case itself but was unable to get it all off it is pretty disappointing for spending this kind of money on a case to have it come out of the packaging looking like it did i think in the future i will go to a physical retail store so i can see what i 'm buying beforehand there is another minor issue with how the case sits around the power cord that makes the magsafe connection slightly looser it still connects and charges , but it gets knocked out easily one easy solution is to flip the connector around but that becomes problematic if you use the ethernet connection at all because it will interfere with the power cord
i bought this case used for $ # , probably the best investment besides the actual macbook the case holds on to the pro great and has kind of a grip to it with the black though , it seems to get fairly dirty quickly and shows finger prints all over i have n't dropped it yet with the case on , but i 'm sure it would protect with out leaving any marks
fits to my computer really nicely , helped protect it from inevitable scratches unfortunately after about # months its grip started to loosen on the computer as a piece of it broke , and scratches are visible on the case i think its worth the investment to get a case , and i really like the satin feel to it
this case fits so perfectly , i thought it will weigh my macbook and make it seem thicker but still looks sleek , thin and even prettier i 'm glad i did n't get the black shell since the <unk> finish often shows finger prints -lrb- especially if you touch it after eating a <unk> cookie or something -rrb- it also attracts little dust particles , the red one does n't show as much so i do n't really have a problem with that i was worried about over heating but that has not been an issue delivery was fast , better price point than the apple store this was a great purchase
one of the tabs securing the case to the computer broke off under normal use , probably just a defect the tabs are pretty thin as to allow the lid to close though like i said they are fragile
this fits my # -in macbook pro perfectly snapped right on when i first bought my macbook i bought a neoprene sleeve ... totally wish i would have spent my money on this first i waited like # months to buy this , because i did n't want to have to spend another $ # on protection for my macbook , but this is soooo worth it in that # months , my macbook has scratched from just various handling the speck protects my laptop against scratches , which the neoprene only does when you 're storing - not actively using - your macbook would buy this over again without hesitation no idea how anyone can not like this product for their macbook
background : i currently use the green hard shell case on my # yrs . old # mbp and have been very satisfied so when i purchased my wife her own # mbp i knew a shell case was a must since the current protects my # mbp very well for example - if i took off the case , you would think my mbp is new since there are little sign nicks or dings to the outside the mbp i got her the red satin shell case and she loves it it 's smooth to the touch and makes her mbp very personal with a `` girl `` look the only draw back is the satin is very dust prone and the dust is more <unk> than my hard case otherwise this is a good product with a slightly higher price tag one would expect but is worth the protection for any mac
recently purchased a # in macbook pro for my mobile repair business and wanted to protect the investment and so far so good cant ask for more fit perfect ! and protects for scratches
this shell is absolutely gorgeous it snaps on easily ; it 's held in place firmly ; and it protects my macbook pro from scratches -lrb- other than the one i put there before getting this shell -rrb- what more could you ask for from a cover makes me want to get more like a whole wardrobe for my mbp
this product protects so well my notebook from scratches , water or even if i am walking and have it my hands and i hit the wall or something else i really recommend this product the color is very nice and it looks exactly how you see in the picture
i got my yellow speck case at a great price compared to buying it out of the store i love the color , easy assembly , and wonderful price i would definitely recommend to anyone it came in at a reasonable time , but it seemed forever just because i was so anxious to get it . :
my favorite color is yellow so pretty much everything i have is yellow so glad i was able to find a yellow case and i get complements on it all the time
its a great clip on cover covers & protects the body , the inputs & such are clearly open , no hassel what so ever the case is a clip on case , snaps in place only thing is it 's hard to take off , i tried to take it off before & i felt like i was going to break it , so i just left it on the picture shows a soft pink case cover but its really more like a bubble gum pink over all its a good case , i love the feel of it and the look great product for the mac & money i would recommend others to get this case
i found the speck cover for my macbook pro easy to install and the protection is very high i really like it and will use more speck products in the future
speck 's macbook cases are perfect and as described it covers what it should , and does n't cover what it should n't . this is my second speck case for macbooks -lrb- i also have bought their <unk> touch cases -rrb- i 've been # % satisfied
just received my case today really love it i was thinking about the cheaper ones like `` mcover `` but the thin plastic did not look good at all this case is made out of hardened plastic , easy to snap on and take of , fits perfectly , well designed i 'm very pleased with it glad i spend the extra few dollars
added a red one to my amazon wish list on a whim , and so glad i did my boyfriend purchased it for me straight away , possibly knowing how much i take my laptop with me all over the place and ca n't be bothered with taking it in and out of my neoprene zip case it came with a little orange <unk> cloth to wipe it down and clipped in within # seconds - <unk> , my laptop is now protected from scratches and small bumps it even has a ` grippy ' feel to it , so i do n't worry about it sliding off anything i had no problem plugging in my power and usb cords or inserting a cd , openings are just perfect my boyfriend liked that fact that its not opaque , so my little apple still shines through , its just red now would highly recommend this product
i have had this shell on my macbook for over a year now and it looks as good as day one easy to snap on and off pretty easy to keep looking sharp it smudges and grabs dust , but wipes clean with the included cloth it has protected my computer from scratches , dings , dents like a champ
i have used this product for a couple of years now and my laptop looks as good as new the case itself tends to wear on the corners , but it is lightweight , easy to put on the computer & looks good
not only does this function exactly as wished , but it looks fantastic , too my -lrb- previously sleek -rrb- mac bookpro now looks super sleek , is protected from knocks and scratches and even runs cooler -lrb- does n't heat as much -rrb- it 's a fantastic product , and i 'm <unk> to have purchased it
i have the macbook pro , even though the computer is already stylish , i wanted to be a little different this case feels nice to the grip and snaps on perfectly i love the fact the apple still shines through the case and i got the black one all in all a must buy and for the price , its a good protective case for the already over # dollar laptop
i love this case snaps right on i mistakenly ordered the wrong size - no problem with these people took it right back , sent me the size i needed excellent customer service , great protection for my macbook are they mind readers ? it 's great if you own a macbook you need one of these
i used the cheapest delivery option , and the product came within a week of ordering it the case fits perfectly and looks sleek too i like the vent at the bottom of the case to allow the distribution of heat produced by the computer the vent area still protects the computer as well i have seen other cases with vents , but they seem like scratches could still get between them
i purchased the spec black satin soft touch hard shell case for my # `` unibody macbook after having had the opportunity to see it in person on a friend 's # `` unibody macbook pro i really like the look and feel of the material and it gives really solid protection to the computer while allowing for complete access to all of the ports on the side of the computer it was very easy to put on the notebook it literally snapped into place with no problems at all i 'm sorry that i did n't make this purchase months ago it 's a very affordable way to protect my macbook and it looks great as well
i am so glad i looked at this before i bought one of those neoprene sleeves it took about # seconds to install and fits my mbp perfectly , including all the port cutouts it gives an already sexy laptop a very subtle , sleek look i could n't be happier with this case
if you have a mac book pro , you have to buy this i am so protective of my computer - i treat it so <unk> , and this is a dream it works great my husband also has a mac book pro , so we can now tell who 's is who 's it does get dirty quickly , so clean it carefully and regularly
this case has a great fit and finish fits on very nicely texture is a rubberized yet smooth feel all ports and cd drive are accessible i would recommend this case to anyone looking for a hard case to protect there macbook pro
as other reviewers have commented , many of the other brands of `` skins `` are cheaper , but do n't work right the moshi skin is so much better than the rest very tight fitting , very <unk> looking easy to install i do n't like the red color , but it was way cheaper than the other colors all in all a very nicely built product
it was a great color and seems like great quality shipping was quick and arrived as described i have one in red and ordered this one for a friend because i like mine so much
this is an important product and a good gift idea for any college student or student in general it not only looks great on , but it protects the computer from any possible dents or scratches it snaps on very easily and stays firmly on the laptop i would highly suggest buying one because after my brother dented my $ # brand new macbookpro i was very upset and if i would have had this hardy case on it would not have happened invest in this case it is definitely worth it
amazing , it shipped fast and i love the way it looks and feels . a little tricky to take off but other then that i would completely suggest u get it for yourself
arrived quickly , was easy to assemble this is a deal compared to what you have to pay at the apple store or any other retailer the satin case is smooth and nice i 've eaten on top of my case it is very easy to clean it 's really durable and the texture is non-slippery perfect for people on the go
this product has great protection and is pretty sexy it leaves all the ports and the cd drive open , which is nice it was a little difficult to put on , and is a little difficult to take off because i do n't want to scratch my laptop overall , it is an awesome product
this case offers perfect protection for grandson 's new macbook <unk> he loves the sleek look , plus the fact that it protects against scratches while looking really cool his friends are always surprised when he turns the computer on and the apple logo shines through the cover
i had seen this case for laptops so i knew what i was getting it was easy to put on and keeps the laptop protected from scratches and grime it may or may not prolong the life of the computer but it will definitely keep it looking good speck products seethru hard plastic case for hp # series , in red -lrb- hp # <unk>
this sleeve is really cute but the material that it was made from had an odor so strong that it gave my husband a headache and i was extremely bothered by it too but amazon is wonderful , they let me return it
the product arrived smelling like flowers the odor is so strong i had to remove it to a spare bedroom because the smell <unk> the whole house i 'll use it if the smell ever dissipates
looks good , but smells awful - has that terrible chemical , petroleum smell put it on the porch for days with fabric <unk> sheets inside and still it 's awful ca n't even keep it in the house and definitely not in the car will try to return it
i ignored what everyone said about the smell , and boy am i sorry it is horrible , i like the looks and everything else , but the smell is beyond bad i have it sitting outside hoping the fresh air will take away the smell i even put it in the dryer with a dryer sheet , but that did n't work i really am sorry i bought this the smell remains even after you take it from the room
this sleeve actually fit my my asus n # j series # `` laptop and the design was cool , but it smelled the odor never dissipated and was absorbed by my laptop case and smelled up the room i tried leaving it out , the smell never left it it was awful i returned it thank you amazon for making returning it so easy i gave it one star because i had to but , unless they can fix the stench i would not buy it so it should really get no
i admit that it is a very pretty laptop case and it fit my big # `` laptop perfectly <unk> does n't come with a strap , which made bringing my laptop around difficult and ... it had no protection really it comes with one thin sheet of styrofoam , which does n't do you any good , because it only `` protects `` one side of the laptop also , the background is a much darker gray in person than the pictures i would n't reccommend this laptop to anyone who 's looking for a protective case that 's easy to transport around hands-free
its a super cute laptop sleeve , except it does n't fit my small macbook pro , so i had to return it another thing to mention is that the zipper scratches the sides of the laptop , so i really would n't recommend this product to anyone
the sleeve fit my laptop great and had a great look i was disappointed because the sleeve had a very strong chemical smell that made me sick i had to return
i 'm sure this product works just fine , but i am returning it the neoprene outside is very think and not of high quality neoprene the inside material is very cheap the entire sleeve is flimsy and the zipper is plastic , which was the main reason for returning the colors and design are exactly as advertised -lrb- yellow and orange butterfly print -rrb- , which is a plus , as well as the metal clips on the sides -lrb- strap not included -rrb- i also needed this bag for a # & # # ; mac book pro , and the base is too tall by a couple of inches returning and purchasing another incase neoprene sleeve , with metal zipper , which has held up for # years only downside there is that there is n't a handle or means of attaching a strap -lrb- and the same price as this bag .
i got this item for my mom 's laptop and it came with weird smell we thought it would go away but it took months before it went away and by then my mom did n't want it anymore
i love this case it has nice padding and is gorgeous it fits my # & # # ; lenovo yoga very snugly , but it does fit it was great until the zipper broke ! the zipper is tearing away from the fabric and the teeth are caught this is from normal use
this looks just as shown but the padding is a single piece of foam so no side padding and you have decide if you want to pad the front or back of the computer not <unk> practical
i purchased this for my daughter and it really smells i have had it on the porch since christmas and it still has a chemical smell i am hoping the fresh air will eventually rid it of the odor it is a nice laptop case but that does n't matter if it ca n't be used
the colors of the product were unexpected it looked different from screen view than in person also , the zipper part of the laptop sleeve was not even purple there should also be a picture or description of the laptop sleeve on the back being a faded white
well , it has been airing out for the past three weeks still smells but i can deal with it better now that 's just a shame what causes this also , had not even noticed the rings on the side and so when it arrived i tore the package apart looking for the strap it does not come with one that 's my fault for not paying better attention it is fine for what it is at the moment but i will be looking for another case for my computer i know i can do better than this and so can all of you
i was disappointed in the thickness of the cushioning in the sleeve the sleeve itself is very cute , but i do n't feel like my laptop is protected very well it also reeked of a chemical smell - still smells # hours later i will be purchasing something else - this just does n't cut it
it looks good it fits my # in hp with te battery very well zipper well made however , very annoying odor that just wo n't go away even after almost # years it makes me sick when i smell it i tried almost all the methods i can think of to try to get rid of the <unk> but they all failed me maybe it 's just that i have n't found the right one i 've put it away now because i ca n't stand the bad <unk>
arrived on time , just as it looks on picture however , there are rings on the side leading one to believe that one can use a strap to carry laptop do n't try this the first day i used the sleeve and nylon strip holding the ring on frayed and my # month old toshiba satellite p # -s # fell and broke so keep in mind this is a large sleeve , made for a large laptop do n't use the rings , just slip it into a tote or backpack so if you want a pretty cover for your laptop , this is for you but if you want to be able to carry your laptop with a strap , think twice
the cover does not look like the picture online the online version is bright but has some softness to it as well when i opened my box i actually thought they had sent me the wrong cover and had to compare it to my order to see what happened the one i received is shockingly bright and lacks all the soft qualities of the design i wanted the product quality is fine and what i expected but i am very disapointed in the art on the cover
loved the style , but it was way too big for my # `` laptop i was worried that it would n't offer any protection with the computer <unk> around in all that space bummed , but it had to be done
i 'm a college student & needed a case for my laptop my laptop is # . # inches & this did n't fit it very well it was loose & it did n't seem like it would really protect my computer i returned it & bought a laptop bag instead , which i love
it 's a great case , really cute , and fits my chrome book perfectly my only issue is that it has an incredibly strong plastic - smell that still has n't <unk> weeks later
i have yet to use it , i have it hanging outside as it smells so bad that its currently unusable i 'm not sure how i missed all of the reviews on how smelly it is i might send it back
i just received my order today and it fits my # . # inch laptop perfectly the picture on the fabric does n't look fake or like it 's going to peel off , so that 's great the only <unk> to this is that there 's no way to hold it except to carry the bag on your arm there are no handles , and although the bag has little holders on the side for a strap , the strap is not provided with it so basically you have to buy the case and find a matching strap elsewhere i guess it seems a little silly to me because my last laptop case had at least a handle on the base that <unk> you to carry the bag with your hands instead of propping it against your <unk>
the product was very cute and exactly what i wanted , but it had a very pungent chemical smell i tried airing it out for a couple days but it did n't get better i ended up returning it , but the seller was good about <unk> the return and <unk> me in a timely manner if not for the smell , i would have been satisfied with the product
i bought this for my toshiba l # . # `` screen laptop i knew it was going to be a tight fit before i bought this ; i liked the design too much to pass it up it 's a tight fit , but it does fit this case only holds my laptop though : there is no room for the power cord but i 'm not complaining i eventually got a bigger laptop bag from my mother and have no need for this case anymore
i am not too impressed with this laptop cover i was somehow thinking it would look really awesome in person , but it really is just a flat , flat image printed on foam if you 're looking for something unique and quality , i would check out etsy i suppose it did do its job as a laptop cover , though it protected my laptop
this laptop sleeve is great for my # . # `` gateway computer and it is super cute however , it smelled horrible when i opened it i washed it several times and it still is kinda stinky a couple days later honestly , if i could go back in time , id buy a different one because the smell was so bad it <unk> my entire house and i had to leave it outside the smell even gave me a headache but other than the smell it is cute and fits perfectly
if i actually dropped my laptop i 'm not sure it would actually protect it very much it 's annoying that i have to find a strap for it even though it was obviously made for one , but the real problem i had with this laptop case was the smell it had the most horrible smell when i received it it made my hands smell when i touched it my boyfriend thought it smelled like strong perfume , but it was very strong and would have made me sick had i stayed in a room with it for more than a few seconds i left the case inside out in my office with a window open right next to it and the door shut for last week the smell seems to be dissipating , but i 'm in no hurry to put my laptop in it and try to carry it around with me
this case is scented like <unk> flowers it was a little overwhelming and unexpected at first luckily , it dies down after a week or two otherwise , the product is fine , but a strap would be nice fits my toshiba portege well
i ordered this with my granddaughter for her new first computer for nearly # dollars , it came with no strap and did not have information to say it would not have a strap . mediocre quality . lovely outside
this cute laptop cover was very useful , but it did n't take long for the smell that came with it to spread onto everything it touched i tried everything to get rid of it , and seriously , it was there for good i kept the product because i liked it with the hope that the smell will fade with time
after reading the other reviews for this product , i was a little hesitant to buy this sleeve i was concerned about the whole `` smell issue `` when i did get the case , it did have a very strong chemical smell i simply turned the case inside out and placed it outside overnight to air out it serves it purpose just fine plus it 's nicer to look at than other laptop sleeves that i 've seen it does have loops so it can be carried with a carrying strap ; however , a carrying strap is not included
i bought this one several months ago . and i 'm still using it well . but at first , my gosh , the smell was sooooo bad i could n't use it for # week it smelled so bad , seriously you can not bring it at all everybody could smell it so i needed to put it next to the window more than # week . and i 'm quite not sure if the padding is as good as others i mean , it 's not bad at all , but i can not say the padding is great -lrb- but no problem to use it i bought it for my new mac book air # . # but yeah of course kind of bigger than mac book air overall i like it but compared to the price , i do n't want to recommend this one to my friends
in general i like this case , its cute and my laptop fit nicely however , the smell coming from it is gross it 's very strong and made my computer smell after i had it in there for just a short period of time i tried using a dryer sheet but that did n't help either all in all , not worth the price
the description read that this cover was for an # . # laptop notebook but it does n't even come close to fitting my # . # asus laptop it is cute so i 'll see if there is a larger size but now i have the hassle of returning it to amazon at my own expense
my initial response to this sleeve is that it what i expected and it should keep my computer safe it fits my vaio nearly perfect and will keep it relatively safe the only think i think i will be bummed about is that it did n't come with straps -lrb- or handles -rrb- so i can carry it without <unk> it i am unsure where to get straps for this i suppose i am off to another <unk> hunt
i should 've listened to the previous reviewer who said this sleeve is colored a shade of green and not sepia as pictured because sure enough it 's true if you do n't mind a dark , olive drab like green then go ahead and pick this up - it fit my # . # `` asus just fine and the zippers appeared sturdy
this case looks exactly like the picture it 's pretty and has the d rings on the side to put a strap on it -lrb- does n't come with a strap it comes with absolutely no instructions to wash it and it smells terrible before i even opened the box , the smell was overwhelming it smells like formaldehyde ! ! ! ! i 'm planning on letting it sit outside for a couple days , using febreeze on it , and whatever it takes to get this darn chemical smell out of it <unk> ! !
this is a beautiful sleeve and fits a # . # -in laptop well , and it works well to protect my computer , but ... it has a very strong , <unk> sort of odor it does seem like it will wear off eventually , though , so all in all it was still a good buy
the zipper pulls fall off of this thing constantly i 've used pliers to put them back on , but they just fall off again design is cute but the quality is lacking for the price
it 's a pretty design , functional sleeve it smelled heavily like plastic when i first unwrapped it and needed to air out before i could use it overall , it 's alright i was hoping that there would be a nicer , smoother inside instead of just neoprene but it still does its job i use it for my # `` macbook pro , it 's a little big for it there is about an inch of extra space at the top it 's not as snug as it could be
i just got this # minutes ago it is just as attractive as the picture online , and the material is <unk> i expected it does n't come with a strap though -- annoying but not a big deal the biggest problem is the odor i 'm hoping that a good spray of <unk> will knock this chemical odor out , but if it does n't i 'll probably return it becuase this odor is really strong too bad though b/c the price and bag itself are very nice
i bought my laptop thinking asus republic of the game , but not working properly as it comes out and fails to close properly should indicate to what type of laptop is working properly to avoid having to buy something that ends after one giving away because it did not work
it really smells its so cute and i love it but i do n't know if i can handle the smell its not a dirty smell just whatever its made out of i would send it back if i had n't already thrown everything away and taken off the tags but i do n't know if i will be able to use it i 've been spraying it with febreeze for days
i saw this case online , thought it was a wonderful design ... which it is , but after two washes , a bottle of febreeze and accidently being left out in the rain , it finally doesnt stink anymore
it shipped on time and was exactly what i expected except it was too big for my laptop -lrb- my fault -rrb- but the part that i did n't know was that it smells terrible like <unk> manufactured leather the smell wo n't go away and <unk> everywhere but the design is beautiful . and i love the colors together
love the design of the sleeve , however it has an oder must be from the dye they use to color it and the smell is over powering and toxic we left it outside for # wks and that helped but it still has a slight smell if i did n't love it so much i would have sent it back not sure i would recommend getting it ... better to pick something that does n't literally stink
i bought this case this past week . i like everything about it , except that it smells completely <unk> anything it touches instantly smells like it whatever room its in will smell like it too . i 'm going to leave it outside and try to air it out i dunno what else to do
this seems to be a well made sleeve it is made of a durable neoprene , with dual zippers , and rings on either side so you can attach a handle my # . # inch toshiba laptop fit well and snug in this sleeve i will be returning this item , as the color in true light is much more green than sepia , and is only printed on one side , the opposite side is black overall it is a nice sleeve , i was just looking for something specific
its cool but not for traveling no security or support thought it came with straps to wear over shoulder but doesnt basically a sleeve to keep it from collecting dust and scratches
i love the design the selections for a # inch laptop in the stores are <unk> amazon has a huge selection my laptop easily slides into and out of the case a suggestion for usefulness would be to add a slip pocket for a few papers or a pen
nice case for the price ; however , there is a definite & # # ; plastic/rubber & # # ; smell to the case needed to air outside for a few days before use smell gone after about # days
i bought this laptop sleeve for my # `` hp and it fits perfectly there is a little room between the laptop and zipper which i rather have then the zipper digging into my laptop overall very happy with this product
i was hoping it was the kind that opens up and stays on the labtop while you work but instead you have to slip it out of it oh well i love love the zebra print
