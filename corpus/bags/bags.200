very smart looking and a well made backpack , one of the best i ever owned its worth every penny like most samsonite product i owned at least # backpacks and this is my
this is my third bag from samsonite in # years and it is my first backpack type everything fits in this bag out of my old one without sacrifice i really like the build of this bag and the quality of the stitching it should definitely last with my daily use for a long time
i was looking for an everyday laptop backpack to help support all the heavy stuff i 'm always carrying this is so comfortable and has so many organized compartments so i can easily find my office supplies , paperwork , laptop , tablet , phone and even drink pockets on the side i absolutely love the padding on the back and straps and the blue lining is visually appealing
quite nice backpack my previous backpack was broken in a few years , so i bought it it is so durable has nice plastic air protector for laptop a little heavy , but no problem
i bought this for an upcoming trip to thailand spent a couple hours looking at different backpacks and finally decided on this one so glad i did it is a great size -lrb- roomy enough for everything i need , but still compact -rrb- and excellent quality the materials and everything about it screams quality i love the separate compartments for laptop -lrb- it says fits # . # inch on the tag , not # -rrb- and phone , tablet , whatever it seems like whoever designed this really though about the most convenient spot for everything the padded cushions on the back are really nice , it allows for more airflow so your back does n't get super hot and adds more padding for your laptop at the same time i 'm not one to usually write reviews , but i ca n't say enough good things about it ca n't wait to travel with it
i just got this backpack for college and it is awesome for heavy books , my laptop , tablet , and everything else i need the quality is amazing i would highly suggest this to any student looking for a laptop backpack
i bought this backpack for my husband , and he really loves it it 's good quality and design but it would be perfect if it 's a little larger . coz it 's a little tight for # . # laptop with a case . anyway it 's a good backpack
it 's a little heavier than expected but there 's tons of cushion and many little compartments to hold things i 'm not afraid of dropping my bag with my laptop in it
i needed to replace my # year old tumi and wanted something that would n't put a big strain on my back or budget ... this samsonite fit the bill perfectly there is a ton of pocket / storage space and i have not had any issues carrying around my laptops , chargers , etc . students should consider this pack for sure i 'm thinking of buying one for my young kids
i 'm a medical student and my backpack is my <unk> this is hands down the best i have ever owned after going through # backpacks last year i was determined to find one that would last and so far this one is living up to the expectation
it has enough space and it is pretty it is the only bag that stands in a good shape even if it is empty i would recommend it to friends
this bag is very elegant it is perfect for a laptop . and has many stowing pockets . well constructed and of course it is samsonite ... ... . we will use it for carry on when we fly i highly recommend this
highly recommend this backpack . it looks so good , color is fresh like very suitable for high school and college girls . what 's more , it 's very light . light material reduces your burden i purchase it at $ # , much cheaper than $ # from outlet
got it earlier than expected and it was really well packaged i really like this backpack , it has a lot of room for books in addition to the separate laptop compartment sturdy stitching and material
love the color , it looks very nice and expensive , the straps offer allot of support when carrying allot of things it has allot of pockets for pencils and <unk> , a tablet pocket and cell phone pocket this <unk> is not small but not huge it is perfect for a female frame i use it for college
this backpack is a must have it has a very modern look and it has so many compartments in it that you will be surprised cause it looks thin from the outside laptop protection is perfect
i bought this for my girlfriend to use in college and she has been extremely delighted with it she is a dental hygiene student , so there is no shortage of books in her classes and this backpack has been more than accomodating for all of these items
superb and outstanding thank you so much to samsonite who made this beautiful , good quality backpack and thank you to amazon who sold this backpack to me -lrb- yes the second one reached me safe and sound , thank you ! to both of you , keep up the good job cheers , -
this case begins to break apart about # weeks after you receive it making you unable to return it for being defective the tabs begin to break then chunks start to come off of it pass on this one
i love the color and idea of the case protecting my laptop from dirt and scratches however , this case does not fit the new macbook pro # inch i just bought my laptop at the end of june # and this case does not fit it
i have only had this product for # months and it is very scratched and beaten up , despite the fact that i only store it in my bag with textbooks i appreciate the fact that the scratches are not on my mac ; however , i have friends who have purchased far cheaper cases that are lasting much longer i bought into the hype and unfortunately threw away $ # unnecessarily the scratches are very noticeable , and classmates have even pointed them out as they realize i have not had the case very long i would recommend saving money and simply buying one of the less expensive options available - that is what i will ultimately have to do so essentially i could have purchased several less expensive cases for what i will ultimately end up paying , and saved the money and headache
my case just arrived in the mail for # bucks , this is just # pieces of colored clear plastic and it seems overpriced if you ask me also , i do n't know why the description calls the case `` velvety `` . it is plastic and when i think of velvet , i think of soft and fuzzy i will update this review once i have had the chance to use the case
i wanted to give this a # but two of these have already broken they break at the corner -lrb- s -rrb- where the base latches around the laptop my laptop stays at home and is handled with great care , so why the case is breaking i do n't know other than that area is where all the pressure is so i 'm ordering yet a third pink one and if it breaks i 'll have to find some other brand
it seems to work well , and it looks good , but already one of the tabs broke off it stays on ok , and actually does n't seem to be affecting its functionality , but i kinda wonder how long the other # are going to last still better than no shell at all , by far
i ordered this as i already have another macbook where i am using the speck 's hard cover the cover i received already had some scratches on the top and bottom which might have happened during shipping and handling and that 's why a # * but otherwise it serves its purpose
this is a great way to protect my computer the only drawback is that the case <unk> the charger from facing away from the computer and it blocks the ethernet jack when i plug my computer in to charge i would not recommend this case for anyone who does not have wireless capability at their workplace or home office because you could n't charge your computer and connect to the internet using a cable
i bought this product to protect my computer , but the first one broke within the first day the clip on the bottom on the right rear -lrb- near the screen -rrb- broke almost immediately second one has been great , love amazon 's return policy
i chose to give them four stars because the quality and craftsmanship of the case is not what i would expect for the price some edges of the case are rough and not smooth as they should be the case fits perfect , feels great , and looks awesome maybe if it were cheaper like $ # i would be going crazy over how happy i am with this product but alas , too expensive
the case is very easy to put on and remove all ports are accessible so far it has protected my laptop for # months , even after being jumped on and run across by my dog i purchased this in <unk> blue and it is a pretty , soothing color very happy with this case , worth the money to protect your computer
the case is really nice , although the <unk> color is more of a red than anything i am a huge pink fan and was expecting it to look more pink -lrb- like in the picture -rrb- it 's still very pretty also , the fit is not as snug as my last case , however i will still keep it because i think it will be just fine
before this case i had one with a `` satin `` finish it was nice as it was n't slippery and did n't scratch , but it soaked up any greasy residue that came near it i opted for this one purely for the color and am surprised at how well it has lasted it really has n't scratched that bad , and though its not in pristine condition anymore i would n't say that it scratches easily or noticeably i certainly have n't been babying it at all my only beef is that the bottom portion that is supposed to connect on the corner behind your charging port does n't hook on well oh and it does add a noticeable amount of weight , so if you haul your computer all over the place this might be something to consider
this case is perfect for my macbook pro it fits the macbook perfectly and provides protection , as promised oh , and it looks great ! ! i love love love this case ! i definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a new case
i am very happy with my speck case for my macbook pro i like the way that it looks and the fact that it provides protection to the computer from scratches , dents , etc . i have a couple of friends that have a satin speck case and they enjoy their cases as well i think that either are a good purchase and both are high quality it was exactly what i was looking for
i bought this for my daughters macbook pro the color looks very nice on it , and it 's sturdy to i would recommend this cover to prevent <unk> bumps and scratches
i 'm so glad that i got a speck rather than other brands on amazon worth the price : no marks on the laptop , beautiful color , and is still comfortable to type on -- no digging into wrists !
i think this is a great case glad that i could get the hot pink again i get a new one probably every year . . it keeps my laptop from getting hit at the corners
i was very happy with my purchase this case was exactly what i hoped for the color is very pretty and <unk> the same time it does not look cheap like other cases i would definitely make another purchase through speck the case was delivered in a timely manner and was packed very well
this is a shiny see-thru case in wild salmon the color on the item is pretty close to the picture it truly is a salmon color and it 's beautiful it fits my # & # # ; macbook pro perfectly i have no complaints about this case
product is a lot <unk> than advertised & i love it makes my comp look expensive the plastic used to make the case is thick & product was easy to assemble and remove
i love the color it 's perfect and i have no complaints so far it was more expensive than the other brands but like my dad used to say cheap is expensive so i decided to pay a little bit more and be satisfied
really great color , nearly red although called raspberry hard , and clear like a candy apple , protects case on line price better than in store and more color selection fits the mac book pro perfectly
product just came in today and the moment i took it out of the package , it lived up to it 's specs snaps on easily color is great great product quality this is the first time i bought a case for my macbook and im glad this is the first case i bought thumbs up ! * will be adding more reviews after a month to see how the case lives up to usage and durability
easy to install & has gotten compliments from many computer got accidentally bumped & on its way to the ground , the cover shut & the computer was fine ! ! recommend if <unk> computer with kids
i purchased this sleeve for my macbook air more than a year ago the quality is great and the protection is slim , so it does n't take up much room in my bag i 've always loved the quality of crumpler products -lrb- this is my fourth crumpler purchase -rrb- , but i have been seriously disappointed with the open side of the sleeve the sleeve does n't quite fit the size of the macbook air so the computer hangs out the side by about a centimeter i have started using another fabric sleeve over this one to protect the open side
i own a # `` retina macbook pro and i was lately looking for a sleeve i had read that this one was slightly small for the macbook air , so i was worried that this was going to be the case for my rmbp as well -lrb- if not worse ! however , after trying the `` regular `` crumpler sleeve -lrb- for the macbook pro -rrb- , which turned out to be way too big , i finally received this one and have to admit it 's a great fit unlike what i had read for the macbook air , the rmbp does not stick out of the sleeve at all other than that , it seems to be exactly what i wanted : thin but sufficiently protective
very nice sleeve i liked the idea of this sleeve because it is vertical , so i can charge my macbook while it is still in the case i wanted this sleeve so i would have a little bit of extra protection against scratches and small dings while my laptop is in my backpack 's laptop slot i also wanted something to keep it closed a note : i have the new macbook pro retina , the late- # model , # -inch , and this sleeve fits very well the new pro 's are as thick as the thickest point of the air , so this sleeve is ideal it might even be a little loose on the new airs it wo n't hold the pro in if you flip it upside down and do n't squeeze it tightly , but it holds it in well enough to use in a backpack like i 've been doing
i quite liked this bag when i got it and ended up getting one for my so , but neither of them lasted an entire year before becoming unusable all of the zippers eventually broke or came loose , and we both had strap problems and <unk> a good design that efficiently holds everything that a modern <unk> <unk> tends to carry around , but the build quality sucks
. lots of thinking went into this <unk> case , and if it happens to fit your needs you might give it # stars it might be perfect for a train or subway commute however , its lack of handle -lrb- it only has a shoulder strap -rrb- might annoy you most people will keep their phone in a pocket or purse ... out of habit , and because the phone pocket on this case is too <unk> -lrb- especially with iphone # -rrb- how often do you carry a tablet and a laptop if you do , the tablet pocket is too small for an ipad in a <unk> # degrees rotating folio case this could be your # -star case right here , but more likely its <unk> will not line up with your needs you might be happier with a <unk> briefcase - - - alternatives - - -- case logic <unk> # <unk> classic two gusset <unk> classic three gusset briefcase ~ ~ ~ comments & questions welcome ~ ~
do n't choose to buy the white one it gets dirty really quick also the zip is black , and it kind of dye the color on to the leather near the zip
this appears to be a well thought out <unk> case nice cushioning in the compartments , and each is marked for the device it would hold our laptop is not a macbook , so it is too large for that sleeve , too bad i might use it for the ipad , but seems large to carry that one thing , and i would never put the phone and the ipad in the same case it just seems like it screams , `` here , all of my devices are easy to steal all at once . a little paranoid , i admit , but it does seem like it would be heavy to carry if it were full it is nice looking , and eventually i will figure out how to make it work for me
if you are looking for a laptop case that will carry your computer cords , phone , and ipad , then this is your best choice the design is perfect for what it does there is no wasted space and it will do everything it promises the only problem is that it wo n't do much else ... i usually carry around more than just my laptop between various books and papers , hard to make this bag make sense for me on a daily basis i will be using it when traveling out of town to protect my computer and make things easier , but not much else it is very well made , will last you a long time , and if you need something like this on a daily basis it is worth the money if you need it daily , highly recommended otherwise it is a little pricey for what it does , and limited to a very specific function
this nice travel case will fit the ipad and # inch imac it has compartments for the cords and chargers there is a small pocket for your iphone , however it is too small for the new iphone # my only concern are the magnetic snaps which are in all the plush padded compartments the plastic case should be easy to clean it comes with a shoulder strap
i am really happy with this case you can tell there was a lot of thought put into it and it fits all of my devices it was a nice surprise to see the pocket for the iphone fit my note # the only thing i was disappointed about was the color on the amazon photo , it looks like a dark gray color but it is actually a very light gray if it was possible , i would have given this a # . # it has been great so far
i purchased this bag to carry my lenovo yoga # and it fits perfectly i like all the little pockets they have which fits all my gear the one thing i would have liked to see is maybe a handle on top when i do n't want to throw it over my shoulder
it 's great ... many pockets , very well made , would n't protect against a <unk> ball dropped on it , but still , lots of padding i do n't need the pockets telling me what to put in there , but it could be helpful my only gripe is the color i ca n't buy white , i get white dirty just by looking at it but other than that , it 's like a suitcase for the mac
i fly several times a month and am always looking for a better bag for my macbook i want one bag that holds not only my laptop but some power cords , my travel docs etc . this sleeve protects my laptop and my ipad and still has plenty of room for the other essentials the storage is pretty limited -- a cord or two but i would n't try to carry a lot of work papers , files etc . so this is n't going to substitute for a briefcase or messenger bag the real glaring problem with this sleeve is that it does n't have handles -- only a shoulder strap hardly the end of the world but as you 're <unk> through an airport -- having the choice between a shoulder strap or a handle would be ideal despite that missing element , the bag is incredibly sturdy and designed in a way that really makes it the perfect travel companion
this is a great little bag i got it in the other day and just went to use it this morning for the first time i feel it is very well made and has the compartments set up perfectly i loaded up my macbookpro # & # # ; , mouse , charger , a few cables , phone and temp hard drive and it just felt tight and secure
this computer carried is very well made the padding is thick and soft and the zippers are sturdy however , how many ways to we need to access different sections of a bag there is an open pocket on the outside top of the bag , which can also be accessed at the bottom of the pocket with a zipper who needs that extra feature and the pocket in the back of the bag , that is meant for an iphone is too deep i do n't have an iphone -- not everyone who has a mac does -- and my phone is difficult to retrieve from that pocket but there is plenty of room for a phone , computer and ipad in this bag , and will travel safely
for those of us with everything apple , this is a great solution for a decent price now i can carry my macbook pro , ipad and all my cables securely in one case i 'd say my iphone too , but the sleeve for iphones is a bit small for an iphone # and i do n't like how easy it 'd be for a <unk> to reach over and grab it i 'd rather keep my iphone closer to me , in my pocket i 'll probably use the pouch for my headphones instead , for easy access it 's a light-weight design with many compartments that are <unk> it also comes with a handy carrying strap that most will want to use though , i could n't find the eyelets right away and at first thought the straps were supposed to hook onto the zippers - which was n't so secure overall , it 's a great product - <unk> and sleek
this case is very well made , looks elegant and has room for everything - laptop , ipad , iphone , # chargers and some sundry papers etc . there is padded protective layer but i am not sure how much impact it can withstand the compartments are <unk> well and easily identifiable it is very infrequent that i have to take everything together - macbook , ipad and iphone and their chargers most days i take macbook air in a sleeve and iphone is in my pocket macbook air fits in well but it is very snug for # inch macbook pro this is one of the most expensive cases out there for macbook or macbook air if you carry , all # items together and if you do not mind spending money , then you may like the ihome bag
i wonder i must rate # star , it is really & # # ; versatile & # # ; i would had hold it the moment received it . unfortunately , i need black colour , but the guys mail out light gray ones
this sleeve turned out to be quite versatile i have a mac air # `` and everything has a place in this sleeve it provides another pocket for one 's i phone , -lrb- if you have one it does provide some protection from dropping , en climate weather , etc . personally i kinda like the novelty and <unk> thinking to those that designed it
i was a pc guy for so many years and then i switched to mac when it comes to properly fitting all of my mac gear , my old laptop <unk> did n't really cut it i was very <unk> by the ihome smart sleeve , because it had a special pouch or pocket for my # `` macbook pro , ipad , iphone and all their accessories i like that many of the pockets have magnetic closures to keep them shut in addition to the compartments designated for the macbook , ipad , and iphone , there 's also a large zippered compartment in the center that 'd work well for notebooks , papers , folders , etc . on the outside of the bag , there 's also a pocket that has a zipper on the bottom and a magnetic closure on the top this one <unk> me as a bit strange , but i 'm sure they must have had a reason for it all in all , this is a great laptop bag for the apple <unk> with a # `` macbook pro my overall rating is # stars
this is the bag to get if you want to safely carry your # `` computer without lugging a larger messenger bag or backpack there 's plenty of space for laptop gadgets like chargers , cables and other accessories they fit neatly into their own section this bag is lightweight , fits easily under your arm and provides great protection while moving its precious cargo bag stitching seems very sturdy , should wear the daily grind well
this is <unk> a `` sleeve `` when it is actually roomy enough to be called a `` bag . its synthetic leather looks , and feels , like real leather ; who knew the interior , lined with a soft touch , plush fabric , can handle my # inch mac air with room in the same compartment for some files side pockets are plentiful and <unk> the more you look ; for your cell phone , for your cords , for your chargers and note pad the carrying strap is about # inches wide and connects to the bag with metal <unk> and is thankfully fully adjustable for a snug , tight shoulder carry i can not vouch for the durability but this looks and feel like a top quality snappy carrying bag for the traveler
so thrilled to receive this ihome smart sleeve for all of my electronics this case has made traveling so much easier there 's a spot for my # `` laptop , ipad , iphone and all the necessary charging cords the padding gives me the comfort of knowing my electronics are safe and sound the best part to me is each zipper is labeled as to which product goes in which compartment and it is such easy access to each that you just ca n't go wrong there is even a specific compartment for your headphones and stylus seriously going online right now to order a few more as gifts
this is a very nicely made laptop sleeve i 'd call it more of a briefcase that will also carry your laptop since it has many pockets for other items the outside is a nice gray fabric and the inside pockets are often lined with a super soft , fuzzy , velvety fabric that is bound to cuddle your ipad , mac , or laptop no scratches allowed there is a super soft slot for your laptop or mac , a middle slot for folders , notebooks , or whatever and another slot for your ipod , cables , chargers , etc . -- all with pockets for <unk> on the outside is a nice pocket for your iphone or smartphone additionally there is a silky strap with a padded shoulder rest that is optional for use a beautifully made product , nicely finished , well padded , and very professional
the name `` sleeve `` might be a misleading for some users as sleeves generally make one think of small compact rather tight fitting cover that allows your tablet/laptop to go through security without having to be opened the name aside , i love this product it is well-designed and provides great storage and protecting for all of your gadgets and their <unk> it even provides labels for each pocket in case you were not sure what went where my husband liked this so much he <unk> it i guess i 'll have to buy another one so we can both have one
i got this bag for my wife as a xmas present it is very convenient for her to travel all day long with it it makes things more compact and lighter than other bags she also liked the pink color too !
greatest laptop bag i 've owned i 've been using this laptop bag daily for over # months now this laptop bag is very nice looking , extremely durable , and capable of holding a lot items i currently carry my lenovo yoga , laptop power cable , spare phone charger and battery , headphones , wireless mouse and mouse pad as well as an hdmi cable and a couple dozen pieces of paper it has various labeled sleeves and pockets to hold separate items and keep everything organized the strap included is very comfortable and fully adjustable the inside of a few of the sleeves has a very soft plushy fabric and are great for protecting electronics
i bought this same case in gray for my husband 's macbook air , but in a local office supply store when i bought an ultrabook i went back to the same store but they no longer carried it , so the first place i looked for one was at amazon not only was it available but they had it in a white faux leather , which i really liked i find it perfect for everything i need for my ultrabook with a compartment for all
this `` bag `` is wonderful i can put my laptop and my tablet in and it still has some room for pens and other small stuff the material is top notch it feels solid and durable there is a lot of cushion inside for protection purposes i think it will last me a long time it also has a shoulder strap which is very convenient however , the price tag is a little too high overall , high quality laptop bag
my grey ihome is sharp and sleek the zippered middle section will hold my # `` imac with padded protection on the very front , a deep furry pocket will hold an iphone or ipod one of the side front zippered panels is designed to hold <unk> , and other gear on the opposite side , it could fit an ipad mini or kindle the rear zippered compartment is for my ipad the padded strap provides comfort while carrying the bag , and the straps can be removed , also the quality zippers glide smoothly , and appear to be made to last highly recommended for those on the go , who want a safe , secure , and nice looking bag for their apple -lrb- or other -rrb- gear
this case is genius purchased for work which is a # & # # ; dell but i can use it for my # & # # ; mac for personal travel as well reviews complained about the shoulder strap but the strap is great
i really like this so far i loaded it up with my lap top , its power cord , an ipod , my phone , several books and a notebook the fit was a little tight , but i managed to zip it all in i carried it around and it was far more comfortable than my previous laptop bag the shoulder strap really stayed in place when i took my laptop in and out it was a really secure fit i feel very confident walking around with my electronics in this bag because the lining is so plush , the fits are snug but not forced i 'd be careful ordering the white because mine even came to me -lrb- wrapped in plastic -rrb- with a few little scuff marks on it just a fair warning i also like that the pockets that have outside access have magnetic closures , so things are n't going to just slip out
a place for all portable things apple and those who said the iphone # does n't fit , it fits perfectly with plenty of room for the magnetic closure to work only gripe is the slot for the macbook air -lrb- # version -rrb- power <unk> is a little small , but all fits with a little convincing it is all high quality and a wonderful design thank you ihome for coming up with this
this `` sleeve `` is an excellent little travel case that easily stores your mac book and all your other apple accessories it is sufficiently padded to keep them all safe from most travel events i find it also works well with other # inch laptops , smartphones and tablets
the quality and attention to the tiniest details and choice of materials suggests the designers are totally hip to the <unk> and <unk> standards of the apple design <unk> even the packaging is well thought , high quality , and worthy of its own <unk> i 'm actually saving the packaging for now , it is so <unk> the bag itself is the answer to all my wishes as far as a bag for all my apple devices i travel constantly in my job and this bag more than fits the bill with elements of design i had n't even dreamed up for an ultimate bag overall this product would easily win design awards big kudos to the designers at ihome
i love this laptop case , it 's beautiful and has a lot of great extra features as well i have an older mac laptop that i still use as it has some <unk> soft wear on it and it was in a very large and clunky case i was hoping this would fit and it does it has a compartment for your laptop and also for your <unk> phone , your <unk> and for charger as well i found the strap comfortable and i love the white with black trim colors of the bag , they look really nice it seem very sturdy as is functional and beautiful as well what more could you ask for
i purchased this bag for almost # bucks awesome idea for a backpack it is a one stop for <unk> you own problem is in the quality all my seems have started to rip out and in the worst places for that kind of money , i would expect a bag to last a year find something else that has better quality
love the concept of the various compartments and very happy with the bag except for its construction zippers are low quality and seams have started tearing at the stitching wish someone else made an identical bag only slightly better workmanship
this bag is perfect in every way except the zipper quality perfect design otherwise i hope they read these reviews and fix the problem i would gladly pay more for this bag for improved quality i blew out the ipad zipper within a week . : -lrb- the computer zipper is already weak -lrb- after a month -rrb- and i have only used it to go back and forth to work not even a plane trip yet i have even considered contacting a <unk> to see if they could replace all the zippers with high quality i still might the design is a # zippers are a #
i 've had this back pack for about a month now i have not experienced any issues with zippers or quality i like the layout of the compartments with the spaces for small power adapters that we need to carry now the laptop/tablet pocket provides a safe well padded area so that it 's not competing for space in the other compartments the only thing in my opinion that may rub some people is the headphone compartment with is a rigid area that takes up space in the front compartment it is designed to hold headphones but my panasonic <unk> camera fits nicely there and is well protected overall i am happy with the product and it meets my needs well
i 'm very disappointed about the way the color looks like other <unk> said about the color , it has a dingy and dirty look - not white at all i regret buying it i need it in a hurry for my laptop before my unexpected long trip out of town it serves well for the <unk> of protecting the laptop but the color is not what it looks like from the product details i wo n't recommend it to anyone
do n't waste your time purchasing this product the graphic 's on it are <unk> , and looks bad the white part is n't white , it is a dingy , nasty yellow color , and it has a horrendous odor ! ! horrible , horrible product
it will definitely serve the purpose for which it was purchased but the previous review was spot on about the way it looks dingy and dirty : not white at all i 'm disappointed
i bought it because i liked the design and i hated carrying my laptop in my backpack because it would always hurt my shoulders the description states that this will fit laptops of many brands -lrb- including the asus computer i have -rrb- but when i received it , it was too big the width was perfect but the height -lrb- as shown in the picture -rrb- was too long for my # . # & # # ; laptop it left a gap of about # & # # ; between my laptop and the zipper which sucked but otherwise this sleeve was great
i really like the design on this product it is very eye catching i think the only downside is its a bit bigger then described in the description , but other then that this is a good product i ordered this mainly so i can transport my laptop to and from <unk> ... without any damages to my laptop
this case is exactly what i ordered the quality is great and i would highly recommend buying it i even spilled some juice on it , washed it , and the stain came right out
i am very disappointed with this product and this seller this was a completely waste of money ! it says that it is for macbook air # & # # ; , however , it is not true it is <unk> for the macbook air # & # # ; ! i ca n't use it like this i would like my money back ! ! ! !
i noticed a strong odor when i opened this zippered cover so i hung it outdoors for about # weeks , half of that time it was turned inside out i was on a <unk> in an open but enclosed porch and we had plenty of breeze to help air it out i finally needed to take it down to use it and the odor was less i bought it because it says it is for a macbook pro # & # # ; but it is pretty large and says it fits a long list of laptops i really chose it for the design because i read the reviews and they said it had an odor and it is too big the reviews were right i still like the design and i put a magazine inside to snug it up and i 'm not real fussy about the fit if any of these minor issues is important to you , you wo n't be very happy i use it inside another case so it is n't a big deal
the <unk> sky print looks real nice , but the material is fairly thin compared to other laptop sleeves i 've had i feel like my macbook pro is not quite as well protected as i would prefer
this sleeve is stunning , and i was super happy with it , but unfortunately , after a few days , the zipper broke it had been zipped open and close only a few times
the stars are really pretty , but the colors are slightly more varied than in the picture the light <unk> tend more towards pale green than pale blue and the <unk> are a bit <unk> in color , but i like it very much the zipper seems fine to me despite others ' complaints . the foam is not as thick or cushy as i was hoping for
i work in an <unk> department , so everyone loves the look of this cover i 've had it for over a month now and it 's starting fray just the slightest on the outside still , for what i paid for it , i would buy this product again
i love anything <unk> and this was perfect except , my laptop was too large to fit in this but , i made it fit part of the laptop stuck out but it was good enough to get it through airport security without being scratched or bounced around
i bought this for my husband and he loves it it has enough room for him to carry a small pad of paper and pen with his pad and i like the picture on it it fits a man not to girly or plain
i love the new laptop cover i love the <unk> and seeing this makes my day it protects my macbook pro so well it does n't make a scratch on the laptop
other people complained about the smell of this case , but it did n't bother me at all -- it just smelled & # # ; new , & # # ; and it was n't overwhelming the fabric is fun , vibrant , and most importantly , durable the zipper glides very smoothly and it is very easy to slip your computer in and out of the case i have a # & # # ; macbook air , and this case is roomy enough to fit a notepad or book inside as well , which is handy but it 's not so big that the computer would slide around on its own , either the price is reasonable too -- all in all , i 'm very satisfied with this purchase
it fits my macbook pro model # at first i was nervous in purchasing this product because i was n't sure it was going to fit my laptop and it does love the color and the material best thing i ever purchased :
