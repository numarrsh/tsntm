snaps on easily , stays in place , lightweight and does n't make the chromebook feel bulky while still protecting it from dings and scratches the legs seem like they might be flimsy at first but are surprisingly sturdy and very useful - great to help the chromebook vent underneath when its <unk> up does n't block access to any ports the black color is semi translucent , but dark enough you ca n't really see the logos underneath it
this product was a very good purchase my chromebook received several scratches on the back which is why i chose to go with the black case the black color matches to the chromebooks colors although it might get a finger print now and again , the case is wonderful for my needs i no longer have to be embarrassed because the back is scratched up it also gives me less <unk> to carry my small laptop in my bag
it came just when they said it would , was in great shape but the wrong type of case i was going to send it back but a friend has the samsung so i gave it to him and he is thrilled
i have to say that i love this case it absolutely transforms the look of the chromebook to that of a much more expensive looking machine the pictures do n't do it justice ; it looks much better in person the case fits perfectly , and everything snaps into place overall , i 'm very pleased with my purchase
i received mine today and like the others i love it it makes the chromebook sturdier and i prefer this color i might get the blue one too just for a different <unk> i wo n't repeat what the others said just wanted to reiterate also , my shipping was quite fast and i did n't pay extra . # day i think
i always worry about scratching my chromebook and ruining the silver color and i am very happy that i bought this case it looks sleek , it fits my chromebook perfectly , and i do n't have to worry about scratching the outside while i have this cover on i would recommend this to
i have # chromebooks and purchased # of these covers it is similar to hard shell covers of many cellphones it provides all around protection from scratches and dirt -lrb- depending on where you use a chromebook -rrb- cleaning is easy with just a wet napkin
within the first week of getting my chromebook , it was starting to get scratches on it so i got this hard shell cover to protect it it does n't seem to fit # % correctly and sort of makes a & # # ; snapping & # # ; noise when i open or close the chromebook it does n't really bother me as it does a good job protecting it i 'd give # . # stars if that were an option . :
if you watch the company video first , the covers go on easy as <unk> skip the video and will take another # minutes to figure out how to install so , save your self some time - watch the video
i recently bought a chromebook and needed a light hard cover after searching many different retailers i decided to give amazon a try i came across the ipearl hard shell with its great reviews and price so i decided to give it a try after ordering the shipping said # days , which i thought was amazing for the small price of this unit and shipping after receiving it , it was exactly as the reviews said it would be some people rated it at four states because it was made of plastic , bought this is what they paid for i rated it at give stars because the plastic shell is a good hard perfect fit for my chromebook it fits perfectly around the chromebook without blocking any ports the shell also has two hinges in the bottom to allow the chromebook to elevate at an angle for ease of typing overall , i 'm truly satisfied and would suggest this item to anyone interested
this is very cheaply made and had i known where it came from i would not have bought it i 'm looking for another one now , because this does not fit very well it 's ok , but i would not buy it again or suggest anyone to
i made sure to order the correct size and it still does n't fit it also does n't attach in anyway it 's too large and it is not the color as advertised
i was disappointed in the way this cover fit it clipped snug to the bottom but the top part is loose and the clip has to be pushed in every time the computer is opened to avoid snapping off
the first week my daughter had this on her chromebook the corner was damaged the computer fell approximately # inches onto a <unk> floor off her lap from one of those lap study desk while she was sitting on the floor i really would have expected the `` hard shell `` to have been able to protect it from that short of a fall , but the corner of her computer was damaged edit ! ! wow , merchant did not like my honest review so i received this after we ship you a free neoprene sleeve case , would you please kindly edit or remove your review rating and comment on this product thank you very much so they wanted to <unk> me into removing my review btw i declined the free sleeve case
the case is ok , it could have had a better fit the case makes a snapping sound when you open and close the chromebook this seems to be a minor issue my teenager likes it and we <unk> the top or bottom of the cover with friends for other colors
little disappointed in material and workmanship quality hinges snap against each other when closing hard plastic would be better <unk> composite & # # ; <unk> & # # ; over all it does a decent job of protection
it 's kind of cheaply made then again , i should n't really have expected much my daughter likes the color better then the silver of the chromebook and i imagine that it keeps the chromebook from scratching , so i should n't really complain
it does n't fit on tightly like other people do which kinda irritates me that it does n't fit properly . other wise it is good at protecting the chromebook and i love the color
it was exactly as pictured however , i had to send it back because one of the ` snaps ' on the top cover was not flush with the machine it slightly <unk> with the opening of the chromebook and i was concerned that over time , it would break off did n't want to send it back , but had to did n't order another one because i decided to go with an adhesive cover -lrb- not as protective , but it 'll do -rrb-
it was as expected but after # weeks of gentle use , it has bent at the joint where it prohibits easy opening of the laptop it will break off if i do n't remove it i will be exchanging it , but for the same
i really am thankful for this case i have cracked -lrb- and replaced -rrb- my screen on the chromebook and this is just what i needed to make it a little more durable
we like the cover it is <unk> cool the way the cover fits over the computer it really protects the computer and we like that and this is what my wife wanted
love the purple hard case . the tabs could be stronger they broke on my last time but i love the color so much i thought i would give it another shot and be more careful putting it on
while the laptops of this world should probably remain shades of <unk> for classic longevity , this hard shell case in purple is so much fun for my mom who loves purple
helps protect the chromebook from getting scratched and i love the little legs that helps it to stand up which makes it easier to type on great buy and delivered very fast
this is an awesome case we bought a purple one and a pink one fits our two samsung chromebooks perfectly , they are lightweight and stylish i would definitely recommend purchasing one this seller provided a great price and fast shipping
i purchased this item to protect my daughter 's chrome book at school it fits great and snaps right on all the ports are still accessible i have recommended it to a number of her friends great colors too
i purchased two of these for my kids samsung chromebooks as i could not find a hard shell case to fit them any where else i hate buying stuff like that online because you never know if its going to fit and what not it fits perfectly and the kids love them because it allows them to personalize their ` laptops ' . i let them pick out some <unk> stickers and decorate the case now they each have their own color and they were able to put their names -lrb- with the stickers -rrb- on them without risking the surface of the chrome book great purchase ! !
it 's great to have very light to carry any where i can do home work on the train while riding to and from work it can even fit in my purse that 's just how <unk> it is
i 've been looking everywhere for a case for my new chromebook but i could n't find one that i liked until i came across the ipearl case it is a really beautiful purple and the case fits great i also love the little feet that come with the case which make typing a lot easier and more comfortable i would definitely recommend this case
i received this product and at first i thought oh it fits great well when i went to open it the right side that attaches to the computer sounded like it was cracking in order to open the computer i have to hold the back right down so that it does not <unk> with bottom case i am not happy
after reading all the positive reviews , i purchased this case attaching to the chromebook was easy and it was a perfect snug fit i am shocked that no one complained that once the case was on , the computer was top heavy after a few days of use , i returned this for the bargain price of over $ # to ship back overall , it was not a great transaction , but even after losing that much to ship back , i was good with my decision i 've actually never written a review before , so i felt strongly enough about this
bought as part of my mom 's gift ... did n't snap on perfectly she did n't seem to be bothered by it , but i def would have had to return it if it was mine
my daughter wanted a & # # ; pink laptop & # # ; for her birthday i got her a chrome book and this plastic cover she initially used it , but says one side does n't fit in right and took it off the plastic peice does n't seem to fit in like it should
fit perfectly on my samsung chromebook looks really nice for those who do n't know how they work , you just line it up and snap it on i am very pleased with the purchase so far
fits perfectly and snaps on as needed . protects outer layer of chrome book against scratches or cracks . only things you would need to further protect your chrome book would be a screen protector
fits snug looks cute and it does n't feel like you have a bulky cover on the chromebook nice and light weight too wish there were more <unk> i 'd buy them all
i have a samsung # . # & # # ; chromebook but the cover i received was way too big for it so i had to return it i would love one to fit my chromebook
this cover fits pretty well the color is not quite as pictured , but it is still pretty my daughter likes it for her chromebook it will protect the outside from scratches now if i can just find a keyboard cover for her
i really like that my computer is now nice and pink however , the case did not fit extremely well one of the back taps broke off , but now it fits really well it still is on the computer , and i have had it for over # months
love the fact that i can use the shell as a cover to protect my chromebook from bumps it fits perfectly and it does not add any more weight to the chromebook i love the pink color , it 's great and the bottom has openings to allow venting the shell is great for the price and the variety of colors is awesome will definitely consider purchasing another color
not too neon , yet noticeable i love it . would definitely order again arrived sooner than expected , package was marked & # # ; fragile & # # ; so it arrived damage free so happy with my purchase now i feel my wonderful chromebook has a wonderful protector to complete it easy too put on love the legs for when i 'm working at my desk
i love this case - i did remove the bottom panel since i was watching a lot of online videos and the chromebook was overheating i now use a cooling pad to prevent issues the case keeps the chromebook from getting scratched or dirty - perfect for it 's intended use
i totally love this case it fits perfectly and looks so cute i 've gotten quite a few compliments since i 've put it on my google chrome book and would definitely get this again
i really wanted this cover because it was so cute and it was my favorite color but unfortunatly it was n't for my computer i really wish it fit my computer i would of loved to purchase it
i love this case it 's super cute , light and easy to handle , it snaps right on the computer and i really like that my computer is still visible with the case on it 's definitely prettier than it shows on the picture and i 've been getting a lot of compliments on it from my friends since i use my chromebook as school tool i highly recommend it this case !
great quality for the price this case has saved my chromebook from every day dings the texture of the case also hides the scratches so it still looks like new
this shell is more for looks than protection but i love it if you are using your chrome book where there are others -lrb- such as a school setting -rrb- this is a great way to identify yours it is transparent and fits perfectly the two pieces snap easily into place
adds a cute touch to the chromebook has pegs to lift keyboard side for typing / better angle , which i did n't realize no complaints ~ i 've had it for about # months would definitely recommend
discovering the bottom piece had kickstands after purchasing was a great surprise highly recommended on silver finish as we put this on a netbook with a black finish and it looks ugly imo
its not an easy task to find a case/cover for your laptop or other electronic device that is both ergonomically sound and is n't <unk> or hard to put together . this product is great so easy to take on and off and with the `` feet `` , it makes it all the more comfortable to type on my chromebook the ventilation system on the bottom of the mcover is ingenious , as most other kinds of covers would cause the device to get hot i ca n't recommend this product enough in fact , a friend of mine who saw that i had an mcover actually went out and purchased one as well not only are they useful but there are so many variety 's and colors to chose from i had purchased a light pink laptop mouse and was able to color coordinate it with my ipearl mcover . this <unk> gets an a + + with shipping speed as well !
fits wonderfully and gives my laptop a little bit of personality as opposed to the bland silver i also am able to decorate my laptop without actually placing anything on the system the color -lsb- pink -rsb- is vibrant
finally i found what i was looking for there are n't many accessories available for the samsung chromebook and after searching all over the internet i found this mcover hard shell case i love the assortment of colors fits snuggly and perfectly to allow access to all chromebook features the built in stand allows for easy <unk> so the chromebook does n't overheat absolutely no complaints great seller as well
the pink is much prettier than pictured the case is not only pretty but i can put decals on the lap top and you will be able to see it through the case i love this case i recommend it
it 's great fits like a glove i actually dropped my laptop once and nothing happened the cover did n't break and it protected the laptop fine all my friends who see the laptop love the color , it actually looks like it 's the <unk> tops
i love this case for my chrome book it totally transformed my laptop and was so simple to put on i will shop with this seller again ! ! and i highly recommend anyone looking for cases for electronics and good customer service to go through them <unk> ! :
my daughter just snapped this onto her new chromebook at christmas it turned an ordinary gray chromebook into a pink delight looks like the chromebook has always been pink now i 'm going to order other colors so she can change anytime she wants very , very satisfied
every time i try to open my my laptop the plastic snags on the hinge and i can not flip the case open it is super annoying not at all what i wanted to experience when i purchased it save your money and do not get this this
unlike the other two i have -lrb- green & red -rrb- this one hangs on the corner seems to be a common <unk> with this color the others work great and serve the purpose returned this for a different color and all went well
i have bought # of these covers . # blue and # clear the hinge covering on the right side , on # of the clear ones , does not slip under with the hinge like it is supposed to do it catches and you have to guide it under every time you open the chromebook : -lrb- once it does this , there is no fixing it
the top does n't fit correctly , specifically the rounded right snap that is supposed to protect and guide the machine as it opens and closes - very disappointing <unk> , the & # # ; kickstands & # # ; on the back are nice , as is the coloring
husband and i got these for our girls ' chromebooks they work ok the clips that are apart of the top piece kinda interferes with the hinge and we were thinking of breaking that part off , but did not as that is the only way they stay on the device they do help prevent scratches and bumps
this does fit my chromebook but the top cover will not stay in place unless you push it down every time you open your laptop i got tired of holding it down everything i opened my laptop so i broke the like tabs off and now it open and closes with no issues
the cover is pretty and the blue is just as bright as it shows in the photo however , the top right corner catches everytime i open the computer i am afraid the hard shell will break one of these times so far it 's just really annoying
the cover fits my samsung chromebook perfectly and does not block any ports or speakers i honestly wanted it just <unk> on instead of the laptop itself , but it 's stylish enough on its own it also is very secure and for the price , it is well worth it i recommend this product for all samsung chromebook users
it adds just enough protection for carrying around the house it is n't a substitute for a computer bag but it comes in multiple colors & i am going to get a couple more
like the heading says , this cover fits my chromebook like a glove it went on very easy and i can see how smaller parts may snap like others here have reported , but if you take your time and pay attention to what you 're doing all goes well
i purchased this case for my daughter 's chromebook she specifically wanted a dark blue this blue is a bit darker than pictured , but she absolutely loved it so easy to assemble that she did it so quickly , without my help definitely worth the buy
the color was a deeper blue then pictured , but it was just fine for me it was easy to install , just make sure all access points snap and you are good to go love the & # # ; flippers & # # ; to raise the chromebook up for the cost and purpose i would highly recommend definitely check your model with the model listed as it truly only fits that model
nice little fun cover get what you pay for . offers very little to no protection of laptop but colors are bright and fun i had hoped for a little more protection but then realized for what it cost it was not going to be an otter box . works perfectly for kids to tell apart
pros -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - <unk> -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - # -rrb- price this thing is worth about $ # # -rrb- just a piece of a thin plastic the plastic is even more slippery than the macbook air aluminum body it will make you drop the thing more # -rrb- thin and flimsy this cover will not provide any drop protection that i can see it will protect your macbook from scratches and smears but that 's about it # -rrb- everything about it screams cheap and yet belkin wants $ # + for this not worth your time
my daughter got a new macbook air and it was already getting scratched from backpack life so i got her this hard shell case to protect it about one month later , a little piece of it broke off near the hinge , so it no longer stays on properly
i am not a fan of this computer cover it was difficult to put on to my computer correctly , and once i had it on , it felt like it prevented the computer from opening fully on top of that , it made it such that i could n't fit the computer into my case - which meant that i was throwing it in my bag without any protection the case is hard , but it almost feels like it would cause more damage rather than less to the computer should it fall
i ordered this product for my macbook air and it seems really cool - but it only fits the top half of my macbook it snaps on in two parts , -lrb- leaving the joint unprotected -rrb- but did n't fit half the computer the half it did fit looked pretty cool , and was a nice hard plastic , but even if it did fit i 'm not sure i 'd be happy with this because it does n't offer total protection if you want a cover , this is fine if you want something to protect your whole computer , get a computer sleeve
it 's ok i am glad i found it on amazon because even at $ # , i think it is overpriced -lrb- belkin website has it for $ # -rrb- considering it is just two pieces of plastic , a $ # <unk> would be easier to swallow i think my expectations were high after reading other reviews if you can find it for $ # , buy it otherwise keep shopping
i 'd been wanting to try a snap-on case for my # inch macbook air for a while now , so i jumped at the chance to try this one out unfortunately , i was very disappointed the case itself seems well-made and it snaps on easily enough the problem is that you can not open your laptop screen past a # degree angle , otherwise the top and bottom pieces ram into each other i use my laptop in all kinds of weird positions and usually have it open beyond # degrees , so the inability of the case to let the laptop open that far is a deal-breaker for me it 's a flaw in the design if you do n't open your laptop very wide , this is a nice protective case , but if you like it open farther than # degrees , skip this
the belkin shield edgeglow case is everything it advertises the colors are bright , and there is a glow around the edge that stands out personally , i 'd prefer something more understated that does n't draw so much attention , but if you want everyone to look at your macbook air , this is the case for you it comes in two pieces , and both fit my # `` macbook air perfectly the case is fairly easy to install , but requires some effort to remove it seems sturdy , and should provide some protection my biggest concern was a lack of vents , and my macbook air became very hot while i was using it in the case for that reason , i removed the case and i probably wo n't use it again
first , the pink is a really nice shade and it looks wonderful on the macbook air the case comes in two separate pieces that snap on the top and the bottom and they fit really well it 's a thin , hard , plastic cover that should protect well against scratches and the like but if you drop your macbook , or if it gets knocked around , do n't expect much protection here this has no padding whatsoever and will not absorb the <unk> and bumps that life can <unk> out to a laptop it 's pretty it 's adequate but it 's not as protective as it should be
the belkin shield edgeglow case is fairly easy to install , but requires some effort to remove though its been less then # days it seems sturdy for the time being , and feels as though it should provide some protection the color is spot on and pretty attractive it adds very , very little bulk which is a plus , and though i ca n't make any claim to its protective benefits , at least i know i 'm safe from scratches , dings , etc . i think i read about <unk> when opening up the laptop , but i have n't experienced that at all but i do agree with one reviewer in regards to the vents i believe that any electrical device need to breath and this cover does n't have much so i 'm hoping that next year they 'll come out with one mildly recommend the belkin shield edgeglow case for its lightweight protection
the color on the edges seem to glow when moved in the light it does not retain the glow in <unk> it 's a lightweight protective shield to prevent scratches but will not prevent any damage from impacts `` shield `` is more the appropriate term as it is <unk> the apple on the laptop cover does show through the cover
this case has a great color and i have received lots of compliments however , in terms of use , it is a little disappointing that you can not push back the screen more than # degrees i love it though it keeps my macbook air protected and fashionable
fits perfectly on the computer amazing neon pink color sleek & protective i have had one on my # ' for over # years and it has <unk> me so well this , is no different , get it
two years ago , i bought a similar product from speck that cost twice as much -lrb- $ # -rrb- and it was very similar in quality that cover was see-through after several months of usage and <unk> several scratches , it broke from normal <unk> & # # ; ve had it on my wife & # # ; s macbook air for at least a month now it looks beautiful & # # ; much better than the see-through one she had earlier although the list price is $ # which is outrageous , it is currently selling for under $ # for this price , i think it & # # ; s a great value and deserves all five stars i would not pay more than $ # for this
this case is perfect it fits perfectly and is easy to install and remove it protects the laptop well it barely lifts the mac air up off the table , but still provides a better typing position and keeps the mac air in place definitely recommend and love this color
disappointed - the item arrived and was cracked on the corners shows how easy this case can crack otherwise , it feels good and looks nice , but i 'm already nervous it 's going to keep breaking
i just received the case today , and i tried for a while to put it on , it 's impossible i bought this because it 's cheap , i am definitely returning it i am going back to the <unk> one
the bottom part of the case did n't fit very snug and it felt very cheap the keyboard sleeve was also very thin and mine came kind of crumpled from one side
poor quality but does the job i guess the keypad is very low quality and i only keep it on there when i 'm not using it , to keep it clean
the bottom part of the case fits very well however the top portion is sensitive if you do n't touch it at all it will stay on but if you are opening your mac and get too much of the case it will pop off fairly easily i wish the top part was more secure and latched on better
bought this for my new mac w/retina , which it fits it beautifully aside from not giving enough airflow , causing it to heat up a little quicker if you have a <unk> on big beef i have with this is that the keyboard cover has painted keys , not allowing the light to shine , so forget about typing at night , or knowing if your <unk> is on funny thing is that they even painted and indicator caps lock light on it
this product is okay , could 've been better ... the top cover is constantly falling off which gets pretty annoying after a while the keyboard cover is useless to me , i had to take it off overall it is worth its price
a little sad with this purchase i wad expecting the color to be clear , not frosted i wanted my computer to shine through , not be muted by the case the quality is good but color is not as expected
color is n't true green as indicated by picture , as keypad is brighter green cover also tends to snap off easily if bumped just right will do the job of protecting my computer but not quite what i had expected
for the money it 's okay the keyboard protector is n't properly printed to match with the keys at the top where the volume controls are , and the case is not so easy to snap on and off
quite cheap , the case is protecting well however the keyboard is not properly matched with the keys and difficult to write with could n't use the screen protector , had troubles putting on the screen , could n't avoid the bubbles
its good , not the greatest thing in the world , and keep it clean while i am eating near my laptop it will surely protect my laptop ... i still feel is kinda overpriced but oh well
would not say this case will provide much protection but it is super cute the case and keyboard fit perfectly definitely enhances the overall look of the laptop my # year old daughter loves it and is great value for the money
case fits exactly as expected and had no surprises with the case keyboard cover is great i got the case in red and my only problem with it is when i open the computer and the apple lights up the color of the apple is bright pink probably should have expected that
for the price i paid for a laptop case and a keyboard cover , it was well worth buying the case was n't too hard to put on , and the teal color is pretty my only complaint is the <unk> seemed a bit dirty , as there were <unk> of dirt in places that were hard to rinse off not very noticeable , though all in all , i 'm happy with my purchase
i ordered # items off amazon and this was the first one i got delivered the only reason i gave it a # is because the screen protector is a joke but other than that , the case and keyboard cover are wonderful and i love them the color is just like the picture and it fits my mac perfectly im very glad i bought it , totally worth it :
