i actually use this for my windows surface tablet and works great ! does n't fit snug on it but it does n't feel like my tablet just slides around in it ! -lrb- if that makes sense -rrb-
this cover is not really made for samsung ativ book # plus this cover has a circle cut out in the middle but the samsung logo is on the side my book # plus fits into the cover , however , the corner holder is too thick on each side that the computer ca n't be completely close the picture shows the corner holders are clear plastic pieces but on mine were # thick leather pieces i am somewhat disappointed i purchased this cover based on all the good reviews
fits the samsung ativ book # lite like a glove material looks very nice and expensive when new will update this review after a few months to comment on the condition the samsung ativ book # lite still looks slim and not bulky or unsightly with it on
i actually bought it for a new samsung laptop that i had purchased but then took the laptop back while this cover was being sent i ended up with a apple laptop , same size as the samsung , and kept the cover as it fit awesome love this cover because i can throw my laptop in my backpack and it 's off to school i do n't ever have to worry about my new , expensive laptop getting scratched
for the price , this is a great product the ativ # plus has a very nice <unk> finish that could show wear i did not want to lose the slim nature of the laptop , and was worried it actually made the laptop easier to use and place down no issues with the <unk> fitment is great ; and quality seems to be up to par will update with any issues , but if you want to protect your $ # laptop , this is a perfect investment fyi - shipping took # weeks , but that was told up front
fits my ultra laptop perfectly , does not add bulk and looked very professional happy with quality for the reasonable price provides good protection and eliminates the ugly fingerprint look ... my ultra book is a fingerprint magnet without this cover glad i bought it
the case fits my # inch xps with some room to spare so it met my requirements it also is pretty solid so it will not just compress under pressure
this hard sleeve is a good way to protect your macbook during transit i take my work with me everywhere which means i have to have my laptop with me everywhere this sleeve keeps it safe and secure so that when i place it <unk> carry bag i do not have to worry about it getting scratches on it or getting crushed by all of my other stuff i need - the material feel good - the magnet is strong and i dont have to worry about it opening us on me - the overall look is <unk> - and ther is the whole <unk> <unk> to be <unk> ! and slowly i will <unk> everything in that <unk> because i have grown to love runetz products finally a brand that will provide me with everything i need p.s the <unk> sleeve is sooo cute , definetly my next purchase
i do not review items very often -lrb- mostly because i do not do a whole lot of online shopping -rrb- this item was actually more pleasant than i had originally thought it would be the quality is really good and the case itself is a hard case but has a soft touch to it the magnet is cool and holds tight because it is really strong . the case itself has a neat look to it that does not <unk> unwanted attention i would recommend . i do recommend
there is just something so cool about this magnetic sleeve i love it . it keeps my macbook safe and is a <unk> of fun . has a good hard shell that i feel safe using ive had this since february and still love it they should make more colors i would buy all of them ! !
while this cover may appear nice , it will not stay on your laptop i have a # inch macbook air laptop , which is what the seller claims that this works with , however , the bottom portion of the cover will not snap onto it i have attempted to contact the seller and request a replacement with no avail
that about <unk> it up ; it did n't fit my macbook air # & # # ; yes , it 's the right model yes , i was putting it on in the right direction seems the manufacturing tolerances are sloppy enough that it wo n't fully <unk> onto the bottom -lrb- or top -rrb- of the laptop if it had fit , i guess the case is ok it 's just leather patterned tpu over <unk> plastic i suspect the packaging probably cost more than the product i 've returned this and gotten a speck ` see thru satin ' case instead , which fits very well
i do n't expect the case to look good very long , it has a very think layer of color . we scratched it just trying to put it looks ok otherwise and is very thin and light
so far i love the feel and looks just got it actually came scuffed on one corner but my main concern is it does add weight that perhaps is not intended on the hinge design i read someone had an issue with this i would hate for the screen to become loose has anyone had this on for a length of time and seen an issue anyways , it seems to be nice fitting little loose in one corner , but not enough to make it come off
i like it and would recommend it the fit has one minor problem area in that a <unk> sometimes comes loose when i close the computer it 's easy to snap back and is n't a major issue though i think the description of this item is clear , i 'll reiterate : this is a hard case with a <unk> it is not leather , and does not feel like leather still , it looks good and does the job
this product is actually nice , the reason that i can not rate it with # stars because the color is not exact lime green the actual color is darker than the <unk> shown on the website , i am really disappointed with the color when i received the item really fits my mac airbook perfectly and feels nice when you touch it
it 's nice and fits but sometimes the back cover pops off and is n't as secure as i want it to be it looks very nice , however and it makes me happy
granted , any cover will add a bit of bulk and weight to your air , this one seems particularly <unk> i will use it , but i can definitely feel the added weight when using the laptop in my lap , moving it from place to place , or -lrb- especially -rrb- carrying it in my bag for the money , it 's a good buy it 's solid it snaps on easily and looks great on my computer i 'm happy i have it , but i was a little surprised by the added weight of the case to both my screen and base if you 're not <unk> to -lrb- not <unk> measured , just going on gut feel here -rrb- nearly doubling the weight of your air , this is a stylish way to do it
fits perfectly . top and bottom i love the leather faux , i picked the white color . it does make the mac heavier ... but also protect from damages and scratches
i got this leather case for my air # <unk> looks very good and leather finish makes this case to look way better cut out for apple is what i was looking for
have had for a day now was concerned about fit at first as i was first installing , but i was in a hurry just take your time to go completely around the laptop to make sure all the small clips engage i had the expensive one purchased at the apple store before took me two of those before the fit was right this is more premium looking and # of the cost and fit right out of the box so far i 'd buy again in a heartbeat
excellent case for the macbook air snaps on easily , fits perfectly sturdy and durable has a great textured leather feel fast shipping with high-quality packaging exactly what i wanted could not be happier
arrived packaged nicely , clipped on securely with minimum effort , looks good , works as intended the round hole for the apple logo is unique , but fine for me looks good with the leather finish i 'd buy again
my previous cover did n't last long , but i love my new leather case the fit is perfect , the red color is great , and i like the feel of it i have no problems with it and will definitely buy again and recommend to friends
i really love this leather case , it is exactly what i wanted i highly recommend this to anyone who needs a macbook air cover and loves the look of leather like me
this case is a # star case for me i have not dropped my macbook air yet -lrb- thank the <unk> -rrb- but if i were to , it would be safe in this the turquoise case really is a turquoise , it is not a hot neon blue the case had some issues snapping on , but with that being said , you know that it wo n't come off because of how snug it fits i love this case
fastened easily and securely looking forward to having it for a long time the only minor thing is the cutout for the apple is n't true around it
i ordered kuzy leather hard case for my macbook air and i like it very much good quality and at great price what else can make shopper happy when you order things online it snaps on easily and stays strong
this case , is very well made and makes me feel , as if my macbook air will not get scratch at all also it give my macbook air , a stronger beauty i love it ... thank
kuzy leatherette cover for mac airbook # & # # ; this is an excellent cover for a mac airbook i got the black version it was easy to put on and solidly snaps into place it has a leather-like feel and appearance making your macbook look very elegant and <unk> pros -- provides good protection for macbook air and does not cover any ports that should be accessible cons - adds a little weight to your macbook -lrb- more than i would have guessed beforehand -rrb- as one reviewer put it earlier , i could see this added weight over time putting some strain on the top hinge however , if you treat it with care , i do n't think this will be much of a problem overall , i am very pleased with this purchase and would recommend it for any other macbook air owner looking to protect their system from scratches and minor bumps and drops
i read hundreds of reviews all of these cases , and could n't decide which one i wanted i wanted an inexpensive one but not a cheap one and it seems every case has something wrong with it i weighed all the pros and cons and decided this was the most hopeful one out of all of them and gave me the look i wanted it is awesome not a thing wrong with it , i have gotten so many compliments , and it fits on my macbook air # inch perfectly as other reviews say it weighs down the screen some so you have to make sure you have it secure , but have n't had any problems if you 're like me and have no <unk> which one to get , just get this one - you wont be sorry
the case works and fits but , do not get black -lrb- unless you have an all black laptop -rrb- i bought a brand new laptop and purchased this case shortly after after using it for about a week , it has left black residue along the edges of my silver laptop i am not happy it looks like the edges of my laptop have been burned i 've tried removing the residue from the surface of my laptop , without harming its finish , with little success basically , when making this case they did not rinse the dye completely and it rubs off on other materials i 'm currently soaking the case in hot water hoping to loosen some of the dye , and you can see the water turning dark i should n't have to do this
so this product does what i want : -lrb- the # inch -rrb- fits my samsung chromebook with a little wiggle room , and helps protect it from other books in my backpack the netting on the front seems durable it 's not a great material , but i think it will do the job however , upon opening it from the box i was displeased to find that it had a very strong chemical odor i mean strong enough that i could smell it from across the room i 've only had it a few days but the chemical smell is still very strong i 'm looking into ways to <unk> it if you 're looking for just a cheap little cover for your small laptop this will do the trick - just open a window before you take it out of the box -lrb- i purchased it in black
the sleeve is convenient when i 'm on the go , but it has been wearing down quite quickly than i expected the stitching has been coming off and i feel like it wo n't be long until this ends up in the trash ... but overall , an okay product that has temporary use
i am comparing this with the incase macbook air sleeve that i bought back in # -lrb- ~ $ # -rrb- , the incase is much more solid and you can feel your air will be protected this cosmos is too thin , i bought this for my friend and i like it because of the little pouch in the front , so he can keep the charger with it when he travels there is a smell , but that is the smell from the material , and incase does n't has this problem for $ # , i would keep this for my friend but i will still stick with my incase and i might get the grid-it then find a way to attach it on the incase sleeve
i bought this cover to protect a chromebook and it fits perfectly however the pocket in the front is pretty useless partly because the power adapter is too big to fit once the chromebook is in the sleeve this is n't a huge deal since i carry everything in a bag , but the pocket does work well for extra usb sticks or other accessories happy with the cover over all
the color brown looks great though it is a little tight for lenovo yoga # s , it still works because of the extension of neoprene and i can put my wireless mouse on the extra mesh pocket , which is so convenient for me
the only thing i do n't like about this product is that the quality is n't that great the brand name on the case is crooked if that sort of thing bothers you , then this might not be the item for you however , the pattern is quite cute and unique
overall i 'm happy with this sleeve it 's a little larger than i would like ; i have a # -in macbook pro and there 's maybe # to # inch of wiggle room in the length i 'd prefer it to be snug so that my laptop does n't slide around inside however , that extra room does allow enough space to stick the power adapter inside with the computer the little extra case is nice too , although i 'm not exactly sure what its intended purpose is it might be <unk> for accessories if there was some way to clip it to the sleeve or something , but there is n't
this case is amazing it has high protection from scratches and scrapes the only thing is it does n't come with the small bag that is pictured as well it is only the big bag its okay though
love it , love it , love it makes traveling a lot more easier with my laptop when i do n't want to carry it in my laptop bag it fits perfectly on my shoulder bag
i was so excited to start using this for my # macbook air but when i recieved this in the mail , and shipping took forever by the way , it 's a little big i could swear this would fit a # . # in . laptop perfectly but i ordered the size for a # & # # ; laptop there 's also a weird smell , kind of smells like gasoline i would recommend this if it were n't for the two <unk> bad smell , wrong size , my point save your money for something better and buy locally
i love the case but it did n't come with the little pouch it was supposed to , i even contacted the seller and they never got back to me i ordered the # in but i got the # in instead the gas smells like gasoline but it goes away after a couple of days
i needed a cover to hold my chromebook and wanted something simple and reasonably priced when this arrived i was surprised with the quality and looks better in person the case is very well padded and has two zippers to close the main computer what surprised me was the additional case it has to hold usb memory cards or whatever you choose to use it for i use it for my iphone and accessories as well the only thing bad about it is the smell , but it goes away in days i give it # -stars because of the price , quality , durability , style , and extra content this is great for the girl who wants something trendy as well
i love this bag . it fits perfect the bag smells like factor but its brand new it came with the bag but it does n't fit the charger . overall its perfect :
got this for my macbook and i love it ! the outside material is sturdy and the inside is very soft it arrived ahead of time which is always a plus i saw that other reviews mentioned that it does n't come with the pouch , so i took that into account before buying mine did but come with the pouch but since several people mentioned there 's did not i do n't know whether or not it 's a given that the pouch is included so if you want the pouch you may want to contact the seller directly
this is exactly what i wanted it has a beautiful print and a soft inside to keep my computer form being scratched the zipper is smooth and my computer fits snug
i love the pattern and get compliments on it often i put my charger in the little bag that accommodates it , and it keeps my laptop protected i am very happy with this purchase service was really good , no complaints
i 'm totally in love with it , and the little bag is just too adorable it has some strong chemical smell but i sprayed some febreze and it was ready to go totally worth the money
arrived within a couple of days after ordering my brand new # in macbook air fits perfectly , even came with the little bag that fits my charger the color is a little faded so looks more like brown then black , but that is just a minor set back overall i 'm very satisfied with my purchase
i ordered this product tuesday night and t arrived thursday night it looks exactly like the photo its durable and soft this is a great product and great buy ! the laptop case even came with the small pouch as shown in the picture i love it . thank you amazon and seller !
i received this with the over # $ shipping deal and it fits my # inch <unk> laptop perfectly i can believe i found such a lovely bag for a really nice price as for the plastic smell , people were just over exaggerating it overall it smelled new and all you really had to do was leave it out for a few hours and the plastic smell went away the little bag fits my mouse and charger stuff nicely absolutely adore this bag ! & # # ;
this case is crap the bottom on the case kinda stays but not really the top wo n't stay if i wanted it to then i would have to tape it the keyboard case does n't match the case at all i would never buy this again this cheap quality which is n't right when you pay quite a bit do n't buy this read the rates and do n't buy it
i expected to receive a matte purple case , and the one i received was a shiny pearl - looking purple case , very cheap looking and not at all what is pictured tried to return it and i am not able to because the return section says that it is a hazardous item that can not be returned to amazon this is the first time i have dealt with something i can not return for this reason , and i am not happy about it or my product be careful when ordering this product , as you may just be throwing out money
i was not happy with the case because it does not fit at all the bottom does better than the top because the top does not even stay on the computer
received this with a crack on the side , the material is very flimsy and the packing was not good enough to protect it tried to return to amazon but apparently this item is considered hazardous material and can not be returned not sure how it was shipped to me if it 's hazardous or why it is even sold on amazon bottom line - stay away
it was awful it was broken it did not work so i now need to go buy a new one the only way i could get it to stay on was to tape it to my
it does not fit properly , it slides back and forth , the top piece wont even connect , it covers the drop down port for your usb and earbuds , can not return do not buy waste of money
the hard shell case that i received did not clip properly at each point that it was meant to which led to the top piece handing off a bit if there were n't any manufacturing problems i would have rated it higher however , hard shell cases are hard to take off and that is something i experienced as well
looks a bit cheap but over all i like it you get what you pay for i really like the keyboard protector i would buy it again and recommend
the color is a great frosted purple , but the bottom case does not match up exactly one side is not the right shape so it does not snap on correctly
it came in the wrong color but i do n't mind the color that came in it fits very snugly , meaning its a pain to get on in the first place but if you plan to keep it on all the time you only have to do it once , so it is n't a big deal
the product is good it fits my # inch macbook air i had to <unk> and <unk> with it a few times before it snagged on , but it works the keyboard skin does feel a little weird when typing with it -lrb- right now is my first time -rrb- but i actually like it and that part fits perfectly i bought it on june # th and i received it july # th , not too bad these type of cases are n't meant to & # # ; protect & # # ; the laptop but more so for a stylish look / feel it was worth the money , i would recommend and will most likely buy another color when i get tired of the pink
i really like the case the only problem that has occurred is that one of the bottom foot pads has already come off other than that it has really been a great accessory
the case snapped right on and fits my macbook air # & # # ; -lrb- model a # -rrb- perfectly it is not loose or falling off like other reviewers have mentioned the pink color is pretty close to the picture and the keyboard cover is as pictured -lrb- does n't match case -rrb-
my covers arrived <unk> # days , and that was because it was over a weekend it fits perfectly -lrb- especially if you put the bottom piece on correctly , not backwards -rrb- the keyboard cover fits nicely just a little weird getting used to the feel of the keys overall , i like it a lot good thing , because i ordered in # colors
this case does a good job protecting my macbook air , and it looks sleek i do n't use the keyboard cover - i put it on and left it there for a few days , but it did n't seem like it stays on very well i bought the gray color , and i 'm happy with it
nice texture , clean lines form follows function and a bit of protection in case of a drop i 've seen the blue , and it 's quite nice and i 've ordered the <unk> for my # inch
the case fits perfectly for my macbook air -lrb- # inch -rrb- it came quickly in the mail and there are no problems with it the plastic of the case is very light and thin - probably not the most durable but better than nothing
my wife loves this product but unfortunately they shipped the wrong color they sent light blue instead of the teal by the time she informed me , it was too late to send it back her coworkers liked it so much that we are planning to purchase more
considering the cheap amount of money i paid for it , i thought the product is good i ordered a pink cover and it fits well the keyboard does n't really line up perfectly and it makes typing a little harder but overall my computer looks cute enough so i say it was meeting my expectations
the product arrived prior to the promised date which was pretty awesome the top and bottom snapped very easily onto my macbook air the cover for the keyboard is good but does take a little time to get used to , because it 's rubberized i would recommend this product
i have purchased this product to protect my macbook air # . # inch from dust and any other possible liquids while i study the case is a perfect fit and has a nice frost effect i would recommend this product to others
the case was an exact fit for my macbook air # . # & # # ; -lrb- # -rrb- the actual color of the case matches the color shown in the picture -lrb- pale baby blue with matte finish , no <unk> sheen -rrb- if the case is placed on correctly , it should snap easily into place the keyboard cover also fits great when i type , the silicone cover does not slide around or poof up too much everything on the keyboard cover matches the actual computer keys , all except for the power button the power button looks like an eject button on the keyboard cover -lrb- not a big deal -rrb- it does take some time to get adjusted to typing with the keyboard cover the color of the keyboard cover is a nice <unk> blue and matches the color as shown in the picture overall , this is an excellent deal and investment if you are looking to purchase a bundle
my wife is very satisfied with the hardshell cover for her laptop she especially loves the cover for the keyboard when she 's eating <unk> she does n't have to worry about <unk> dropping between the keys she is very satisfied with the color of the shell she chose ; purple she will probably order a few more colors to coordinate with her outfits
this case is so nice i got the pink and it matched the picture perfectly it fits great just make sure you put it on all the way the keyboard cover is cool ; but a little difficult to type with if i was doing a paper i would take it off but its great to have on for protection i would definitely recommend this case
i received this case yesterday in the mail i purchased the orange one and it is exactly the color if not a little lighter . the keyboard cover is a little darker but looks wonderful even with it being darker for the price it is amazing definitely with be purchasing # more colors ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
this is a very nice looking bag however there is not enough space in it after putting in a macbook pro # retina , # composition notebooks , and # folders , there is hardly enough space for my charger and my graphing calculator there also does n't seem to be a very great place to put pens and pencils or water bottles the bag is also not very sturdy the strap broke after a week of use so i returned it
good bag overall as i am still using it after # months however , i am # ' # and # lbs and i feel like it is very large for a person of my size it does hold everything i need for my work day though the strap slips a little so i have to adjust the length every so often its functional and sturdy , just wish it was smaller
great bag that is worth the price unfortunately i had to return it as it does not fit an hp envy # inch the laptop compartment is well padded and there is ample space for anything like charger , accessories or notebooks if you are college student i highly recommend it one less star as it does not fit all # inch laptops as
ive been on the lookout for a messanger back to hold my <unk> macbook while i <unk> to school i am very pleased with my purchse my macbook is safe and <unk> is room for my text book and even my ipad and other gadgets i carry with me everywhere thank you runetz for an amazing product you have made me a lifetime customer i think ill buy the soft sleeve next
excellent choice , i use it every day not too big , not too small , just the right size fits everything i need and more , lots of different places to keep your stuff . comfortable to carry and holds up nicely what more could you ask for .
it looks great , and seems to be quite well constructed i 've got a # & # # ; alienware laptop and it fits in this thing easily , along with it 's charger , a mouse , mouse pad , and my ipad does n't feel & # # ; overstuffed & # # ; , just right yet it 's also normal sized enough to use as a regular messenger bag , which just rocks stylish , durable , and with well designed pockets , i ca n't ask for much more
i carry a lot of stuff with me and this backpack sure knows how to handle the load very strong and most important my macbook is safe i like the professional look to it
i was using this messenger bag for # months now and i can tell that it 's well made with many pockets and zippers so i can carry all my belongings with me all day long i commute every <unk> and this bag do it <unk> recommend this bag to all
this messenger back is a durable and comfortable bag to carry . it is perfectly sized for my macbook and keeps it safe , this is the only laptop bag i will ever take into an airport so easy and convenient to use in the bag check great purchase at a great price did not <unk> in the least bit
i bough this bag in january this year it 's a great bag for traveling and to commute all day long has # sections for books and macbook also i like that this bag have so many pockets with zippers shoulder strap holds good and very comfy for me front pocket is great place to keep my phone for easy to reach i like this bag
i have a toshiba satellite c # <unk> # , and this case fits perfectly the color is pretty ; it 's a translucent aqua color i 'd say the photos are fairly accurate to what it looks like in person i like that the case adds protection & style without a lot of extra weight or bulk there is a top portion & a bottom portion to the case the bottom portion contains two round rubber <unk> , two rear legs that can be folded up or down , and a cutout where the laptop 's battery is located the bottom sides are largely cutouts for the usb ports & other areas that need to be accessible i 'm pleased with this product due to its fit , style , & the protection it provides
my mom got me a new laptop for christmas so i could have something new to type all my student documents on , etc . i realized if i planned on traveling i needed a case so i purchased this one it 's great ! very lightweight but it does its intended
i ordered this with amazon prime so i was able to return it for free it says that is specific for c # d but actually fits amazing in my c # <unk> , i 'm extremely satisfied
greatest case ever <unk> the bad <unk> 's my laptop is great with it who ever wrote the nasty one must not have the right one it 's a toshiba satellite c # a <unk> and
when i took the bag out of the box it arrived in i was impressed by the size , but when i examined the bag i was disappointed the handle was <unk> to one side and poorly aligned with the space that the handle retracts into the plastic around the wheel <unk> was buckling and not flush the bag just looked flimsy , cheap , and unreliable it has been returned
wheels are terrible i 'm # weeks into a # week business trip to japan and the wheels are worn out the size of the briefcase is great and it holds everything i need but the poor quality of the wheels is extremely disappointing
the wheels were out of alignment i 'm sure once i loaded it up , the weight would eventually render it unusable a high price to pay for something that may not last long aside from that , the fabric seemed durable and i liked how the compartments were arranged sorry i had to return it
i absolutely loved this bag it had plenty of room for my computer and for my school books as well as some additional notebooks this was a big deal because i have an asus # inch computer and this was the only bag that it fit ' i had it about # months and the handle broke i was so disappointed because the case itself is very sturdy how ever the handle is very flimsy now the only thing i can do is carry it around which does me no good at all
it 's ok i just got a wider laptop and needed a bigger briefcase i 'll keep this one for a while , but next time i 'm getting one with a removable shoulder bag
great bag ... right up until the telescoping handle broke and i just read that i ca n't return it my wheels are fine unlike other reviews i read i 'm just getting another bag but not this brand
i have owned approximately three months and i will soon have to either purchase a new bag or change the wheels one wheel barely spins now so it drags and is wearing away
i am a full time college student , with two jobs on campus computer , textbook , work materials , this is why i picked up this bag after less than a month the wheels were almost non-existant so , here i am stuck trying to find wheels for the bag i already spent # dollars on the bag itself is great , however you may want to pick up some high quality inline skate wheels as well
i bought this roller to replace my backpack too much stuff to carry on my back now i can get around pain free and still carry the necessary items i need
