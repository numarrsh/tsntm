allows me to consolidate two bags into one for travel my pc and accessories and my nikon d # and accessories rugged construction with thoughtful features that make it very useful and a great acquisition i would n't have chosen this color but then i got it at <unk> so i am just pleased as punch with the color
while this is described as a daypack with photography equipment as the main function , it really is great for many other uses i bought it for travel it has a spot for my ipad to travel safely and the compartment inserts are removable so you can safely divide your items or fill it with clothing , books , etc . very sturdy and attractive
i bought this for my mother - she has acquired a ton of photography equipment and needed something larger yet with padded straps this thing is perfect very well-padded shoulder straps and they 're molded for a woman 's body the color is really catching , too very pleased and so is she
i searched for several weeks for a backpack the color is a little different , but it is n't black and that was what i wanted . there is plenty of room for my camera and lenses with plenty of cushion to protect everything including the ipad there is enough space on top for the accessories as well the cost was fair as well
the backpack is a downsize from a much larger one it does not hold a # inch laptop but my smaller ipad and laptop both fit fine i really like the compartments and shoulder straps . the color definitely stands out from the other boring black backpacks around if you like compact and efficient you will like this
not only is this backpack very easy on the eyes , it is beyond convenient you can carry your laptop , at least # lenses and <unk> camera very <unk> without risking the bag to even look bulky i can also wear it in uniform -lrb- olive green , i am in the air force -rrb- which is a major plus one of my personal best buys on amazon
in the description it did not say if the pack had a laptop compartment and it was not <unk> in the <unk> video , but i took a risk and got it any way hoping that it did it has a padded laptop section and the camera part is great the removable middle section also makes the backpack usefull for large objects as
i bought this case for my toshiba thrive , which it does n't fit very well it safely zip closes at the top but has an <unk> with magnetic closures that do n't attach very firmly , so you rely on the top zipper closure there is some , but not much room for accessories but , it 's vertical , one of few , i like that , and it is well constructed i still have it , but a newer larger case has it collecting dust until it finds a new purpose
kind of hard to get in and out of for the smaller things definitely not for the fashion conscious could be a little easier to get in and out of
apart from the flap magnets being far too weak , the bag is very well made and designed there is more than enough space to hold tablet , peripherals , and to empty your pockets besides all in all , a quite satisfactory purchase
just as a note : this bag comes up under a search for asus eee transformer tablet , however the laptop sleeve is too short for that tablet it 's a lovely bag , though high quality , good material it definitely does n't feel or look cheap , despite how lightweight it is , and that strap is a great quality
the bag was everything it was described as , i love the quality for the price , also it was delivered soooo fast i can wait to try it out on my travels hope to give it a # after traveling with it
this case fits an ipad if you are using a minimalist cover but i find i use it the most when running errands on the weekend to hold my wallet , smart phone , and kindle i also use it when taking kids to lessons as it will hold a few treats or small toys the zip closure is very helpful the exterior is sturdy and has held up well , showing little wear this gets four instead of five stars because if what you put in it causes the sides to bulge at all the flip over top will not hang correctly
i like the bag for my i-pad and the phone pocket is nicely located on th front flap the only problem now . is that the new i-phone # . will not fit wish they had it in other colors
i wanted a bag that would fit my ipad in it 's case and all the things i usually carry in my purse everyday to work it all fits i feel better about transporting my ipad now that it is in a padded bag along with my roo case/stand thanks for the prompt shipment too
very sturdy and hight quality material i used it a few times but found out i can carry my ipad in my purses i gave it to a friend and she loves it i would recommend this seller and product
i use this almost every day i carry my wallet , acer tablet , phone , digital camera , coupon clutch , note pad and alot of misc things there is enough pockets for everything it is so nice to have room for every thing in a easy to carry shoulder bag
this is a tailored , well constructed messenger bag it is , however , smaller than i expected it holds my ipad & a few other necessities but does not replace having a handbag
i am enjoying the bag quite a bit it was larger that i was expecting , but not too large it is quite sturdy and will stand up on its own -- which is handy i 've had other bags in the past that look great but are n't very sturdy and that becomes inconvenient i do n't see myself changing from it soon
i bought this backpack to safely transport my # inch laptop and a few other items such as wallet makeup bag my walk to work is about five minutes so the small size of the backpack is great cause i do n't have in it advertisement says it will hold a # inch and it does not i have to really work it in the space provided which is nice and padded like i wanted , maybe too much . but the worst thing is the back has now begun to tare & # # ; badly & # # ; its ripping wide open at the zipper for laptop compartment
the zippers -lrb- the <unk> part and the zipper its self -rrb- broke within the first week need i say more i would have understood if i had a bunch of stuff in it and was putting a lot of strain on it but i had my laptop , # dvds , a notebook , and a water bottle in it plus it was n't all that comfortable and i did n't feel like it was protecting my laptop
backpack as described looks great , many and convenient pockets it is comfortable however , after i wore it for less than # month , it is already torn around the zipper with the other backpacks i have had this happen after many years of wear
this looks cute but it completely fell apart -lrb- two , separate large tears -rrb- with two months use and i am not talking heavy use most the time all that is in it is my laptop , a few pens , a calculator and two cans of soda i suspect if you filled it up with textbooks it would fall apart with in a week
bought this for my girlfriend because she really liked the design the laptop pocket was really nice but once he bag started getting <unk> in it it was time to retire it not good for a college student barely lasted a
i spent a lot of time researching the perfect laptop bag for work then i ordered this inexpensive backpack to have for <unk> trips as a back-up i 've completely switched over to this bag so much for the gorgeous professional ones the overall small , slim size is perfect for a women the main compartment fits my laptop and about # inches worth of <unk> perfectly the front packet holds a zip up pouch with all of my cables - power , headset , lan cable , etc . the side pockets are one of my favorite features - one holds my mouse and the other my take everywhere water bottle
i love this backpack it is comfortable to wear , is a good size , has lots of storage and is fairly compact the style with the colors and flowers make this backpack unique
the laptop compartment on this bag is really only padded on the outer side i expected a <unk> compartment it 's a pretty and sturdy bag with lots of room and useful compartments
i bought it for college this year , and it 's of good quality it can handle all the books i stuff into it , plus my laptop there 's a lot of room and it 's pretty sturdy definitely a good buy compared to other bookbags i saw in the stores for like $ # this one is like the same quality , but cheaper
this is a well made laptop backpack , with a neat look to it so far there is nothing that i dislike about it it works perfectly for carrying around my # . # inch laptop and all my accessories , and i do n't have to worry about it tearing or wearing any time soon
just got ta say i love this backpack great size , roomy for books , padded pocket for a laptop , and the front pockets are <unk> for those quick grab items great value , too
well made but unfortunately does not fit the macbook air # . # - it 's too wide by about an inch and a half the misleading product description needs to be changed , asap !
maybe the one i received was a fluke - it was way too small for my macbook air ! it was a nice case and would have been perfect if it was large enough for my air ! i returned it
if you 're looking for something to keep your computer protected and that has padding do not get this if you already have a cover for your computer and would just like something else to protect it in your backpack or something , then this is good for you
i bought this as a protective sleeve for my asus vivobook <unk> # <unk> , so i could put the labtop into my backpack it fits well and is well constructed with a secure velcro closure however its not really heavy padding , just thin neoprene i 'm sure it will protect from scratches or abrasions , but i would want to drop my laptop with only this protecting it
the case is decent but my # `` macbook air kind of swims in it i was hoping for a nice snug fit it also comes with a velcro strap i never figured out what that was for or how to use it other than that it is what i expected looks nice and nicely padded
it obviously fits nice and snug , although that does mean nothing else fits in we use a wireless mouse with our cb even though it is n't necessary -lrb- once you get used to the excellent trackpad -rrb- , and the fact that does n't fit is ok would be nice to have a way to carry around the power cable though not with this sleeve , but then again it really is just a sleeve
i am very happy with this laptop case it was inexpensive but well-made enough for someone like me i rarely bring my chromebook around but when i do this case does a great job
i purchased the # . # -inch hp pavilion dm # nr and was looking for a nice sleeve for it the ones specifically made for this netbook did n't interest me much , so when i saw this line of standard # . # `` sleeves i decided to take a chance i am so glad i bought this -- it fits my hp netbook perfectly i 've read reviews about the velcro coming unglued , but i 'm not sure how that would happen , since both the top and bottom are sewn on overall stitching on the product is good , and the material has a nice <unk> feel to it i can safely slide my machine in and do n't have to worry about zippers scratching up the sides what a great item
i was looking for a way to carry my asus # . # laptop in a recently purchased `` man bag `` that has zero padding this item was a perfect fit ; not only for my laptop , but my needs very snug -lrb- laptop # . # `` x # `` x # `` -rrb- and a velcro closure flap that is secure no pockets , loops , straps , or other frills here , just a <unk> sleeve for your device
this is a padded attractive case for my asus x # e touch screen laptop seems to offer bump protection and accommodates the laptop perfectly in my purse adding practically no additional weight
just what i was looking for to protect my acer # . # inch i place it in another brief with everything else and this unlike others , has no handles and gadgets to take up room not necessary or catch on surrounding items good value too
i bought this bag to use with my acer # . # `` laptop when i traveled because it would fit easily into my suitcase if you want a bag with no extra straps to get caught on things , this is it it 's well padded and the laptop fits perfectly the price was great and it was shipped and received very quickly
well , this bag just does not have the appearance of being very sturdy we decided to keep it and use it until it wears out the price was not bad
the bag is attractive and sturdy enough , but was too tight of a fit for my hp # & # # ; laptop i repeatedly scraped my <unk> on the rough velcro while attempting to place the laptop in and out of the bag after a few tries , i gave it to my <unk> for her # & # # ;
i did n't care for the bumpy polyester texture of the case the inside padding was noisy , it sounded like the padding used was <unk> wrapping the handles were plastic-y looking & would n't hold up very long the strap was better quality i was roomy enough for my # . # ' laptop and had inside & outside storage
this bag is slightly flimsy but will work fine for traveling i like the design though and my laptop fits good in it i do like the extra pocket for a cord
this bag fits my # inch laptop perfectly and i am happy with the bag however when it arrived the bag was covered in spots of mould as i live in <unk> i did n't want to send it all the way back to the states , and after a good wash it is as good as new
my hp laptop measures # . # & # # ; x # . # & # # ; and i can barely zip the bag that is the only reason i gave this a # star rating , otherwise it is a nice case
it fits my # . # lap top in just fine . it doesnt give you much <unk> on the <unk> for mouse & <unk> plug ins i normal keep in beside that is if great
it was everything i thought it should be the picture does n't do it much justice but the bag is made out of durable material it came in a timely manner , and it is a perfect fit for my # . # inch hp pavilion
i have been using my bag for almost a month now the bag itself is holding up pretty well thus far , but the smaller handles are starting to break from the bag overall , i am pretty satisfied
i needed a new laptop bag for my # & # # ; laptop , and finding something other than basic black , and not spending $ # - $ # was a challenge i found this one , and i really love it my only concern with it is , i wish it was a little bit deeper with my laptop and a notebook , there is not that much more room unfortunately , my laptop has a larger than normal power cord/pack , and if i need to take it with me , it 's a struggle if your laptop has a normal size cord/pack , it should not be an issue i like that there is a shoulder strap as well as handles i do n't use it daily , but when i go to the office or travel , it has been quite durable , and the little rubber feet on the bottom are a nice benefit attractive and durable for the price
i have a # . # & # # ; macbook pro and it fit easily in this bag along with the charger i was surprised that i could also fit several of my smaller textbooks and notebooks inside as well everyone at my office commented on how cute it is i 'm # ' # & # # ; and the strap is still long enough i would buy it again
great , slim bag for the laptop we just purchased it has a durable fabric on the outside and pockets for organization it 's a great price for the bag , great color selection
this is just what i was looking for and a great price it has plenty of room with many compartments my laptop is heavy and so far the handles are holding up just fine will probably get the red one too
the bag is as described , but it is not holding up like we hoped my wife uses it heavily and within a few weeks the small handles began to separate looking at the stitching revealed no <unk> or poor workmanship , it is just a light duty bag if you need something to carry a laptop and notebook , this is fine if you are going to add more weight , then you will need something different overall it is a nice bag , just lightweight
i 'm very happy that i managed to get this in quite a short amount of time my room 's been very messy , mostly thanks to my computer stuff laying around across my floor having this bag now definitely helps me keep my behemoth of a laptop in an actual place now the material it 's made out of is very nice too , and it definitely is really sturdy , especially with the amount of stuff i carry for my art and video editing it came with a few unknown stains on it , but i think it was powder or something dried i 'm not too picky about it though since that bag 's probably going to be <unk> in dust and things whenever i drag it around now overall , this was a great product just wish it was a bit more clean upon receiving it
i was looking for a lightweight but durable bag for my macbook air mygift # inch bag is perfect for my needs it has plenty of room for my macbook , even when it 's in its own case ; plus there is room for notebooks and binders there is a zipper pocket on the front with pockets for pens and gadgets and more space to hide other items such as power cords for your devices the back side has another pocket , without a zipper for quick access to reach things you need quickly , like your phone or boarding pass there 's also a handy little strap that goes neatly over your carry-on handle you can carry it briefcase style or use the long strap as a satchel if your hands are full great price , too
i read all the reviews for this bag and was convinced to buy i 'm soooo glad i did the bag is awesome , it has many compartments i love the zipper becasue i hat the bag that flap over and i hate velcro this bag is chic , great for a woman becasue it has the floral detail inside the zipper part it has pen holder , business card , etc . the bag is light-weight but very sturdy i 'm really happy with it oh not to mention my laptop is # . # and i still have a lot of room to hold other items
i wanted a basic bag for my giant laptop , mainly just a storage space , but with handles for times when i want to take it somewhere my hp # . # `` fits in this bag snugly , with the micro usb installed if i took that out it would be easier to get the computer in the bag , but i am happy with the fit the bag adds maybe a pound to the weight of computer & accessories -lrb- i was apprehensive because shipping weight says # lb . the construction and fabric are perhaps not high end but absolutely not shoddy the decorated side is a shinier material and the white floral design is silk screened i recommend this bag if you want a feminine , lightweight carrying case for your large laptop and its charger , mouse , and even a book or a folder you might fit a keyboard in too there is a padded divider and both front and back of the bag are padded
i bought this for my daughter who has a # & # # ; hp computer this is perfect for her needs there is even extra room for a book if she needs it this is built well very durable and has beautiful design i am glad i found this product
the bag is even more durable looking then the pictures show ca n't beat it for the price , my wife thinks its cute we 'll see how it holds up but thus far extremely happy
not a lot of frills but all i really needed was a padded bag to put a # inch notebook and a place to put the power supply this has that plus a couple of slots to put papers in -lrb- one on the back and one inside -rrb- looks great -lrb- just like the photo -rrb-
i 've had this bag for a year now and it works great when i purchased it , i was concerned that it might break -- i read a few reviews that it could n't hold heavy books but i 've used this for a year , everyday , and it 's held up amazingly well in addition to my laptop , i can carry a couple light books and a stack of paperwork for my office it 's been great for business travel too definitely recommend this product
works well with my # inch laptop good protections and i can also add a charger and mouse and folders for the paper work i carry also a cute design but not too silly
i pack so much in this thin functional bag i am so happy with the way it allows me to take along all of the different parts to my computer i love this bag because it is not bulky
i use this bag to <unk> all my electric <unk> when i travel , my laptop , kindle , cellphone , and chargers and work folder all fit with bulking up the bag
absolutely love this bag i 've been using it every day since i got it and it 's been holding up well lots of space to hold all of my cords and accessories , plus the red color and floral pattern is so fun
i ordered this after checking out & # # ; <unk> & # # ; bag prices -- they are very popular where i 'm from , but i just could n't bring myself to spend that kind of money this bag is attractive , well-made , and has a comfortable carrying strap i needed a bag large enough to fit my <unk> <unk> laptop , and this fits the bill nicely
i bought this bag for my # `` laptop and i have to say that i love it i can fit the laptop , a folder , notebook and a few textbooks in there too very impressed with it and it 's cute too
no complaints about this bag it has worked out very well so far if you have a smaller laptop like i do , the bag will have plenty of room to hold items other than a laptop , which has been very useful
i love the color and the design on the one side of the case it 's sturdy and still nice to look at the side zipper compartment provides easy access to papers and other items placed inside there were other colors if you 're not a purple nut like me
laptop fit perfectly inside and has room on the ends and in the front also has a ton of room i have put this in use as my college backpack and laptop now :
this bag is great everything i needed i can fit in this bag and it is so stylish i loved it so much i ordered it in black too i recommend this to any woman that needs a briefcase for their laptop
this is a true buy the price is great , the quality is wonderful my # `` acer laptop fits in the bag without problems along with the cords , mouse , a text book and odds and ends well worth buying and i do not write reviews but i felt i needed to on this purchase girls , you will love it ! i have had this bag now for quite awhile and have taken it everywhere it is strong , durable and i love it as much today as i did back when i bought it still a great deal
i purchased this bag for a hp pavilion # & # # ; laptop it has sufficient padding for commuting the interior has a velcro strap to hold the laptop securely in the sleeve there is enough room to put the charger in the bag there are two large exterior pockets , one with smaller pockets inside to hold usb sticks , pens , etc . the construction is great the two handles on top are sturdy enough for a # # laptop and it includes an expandable shoulder strap there are two rubber feet on the bottom for sitting on the floor i selected this bag because you can throw the laptop in and go without zippering , if you like you ca n't do that with other cases that open like a briefcase or a messenger bag
i love this bag ! its sturdy and has a great design i especially love the compartments that easily hold all my laptop accessories ; even notebooks and handouts i would definitely recommend this to a friend
i bought this bag for my sister 's birthday she has a giant # + inch laptop and it fits perfect it seems sturdy and padded enough to protect it and there is still plenty of room to fit in a few notebooks if she needed size was my main concern i wanted a laptop bag with room for extras , not just a laptop sleeve with a handle it came the day before
i bought this for my daughter so she could take her computer back and forth to school the school requires a laptop daily to download lessons this bag is very roomy so my daughter can also include a notebook to hold all of her work from school
this is well worth the price it 's hard to find a bag to fit a # inch without paying a fortune but this fit my # inch laptop perfectly it 's also adorable and durable
beautiful and very well made i bought it a little oversized b/c i 'm in school and never know when i 'm going to need to study away from home this gorgeous bag has room for my computer and at least a few books , seems very sturdy i 'm glad i chose this
my daughter needed a new case for a larger # inch laptop she loves the bright color and floral pattern arrived quickly and well packed fits a # inch laptop nicely
this bag is well <unk> of # stars it hold my # `` laptop with about # inch to spare on each side , and the shoulder strap is very comfy i used it while traveling and stuffed my long cord charger , a wireless mouse , junk for the plane , cell phone , etc and it all fit great the material is soft yet durable great buy , will probably buy another for one this one eventually wears out
this bag is stylish as well as being nicely made and padded it has several useful pockets i would certainly recommend this bag to others and the price is right
the case was delivered in a timely manner , i loved that but when i opened the bag it was delivered in i was disappointed to find that the case was very dirty and banged up so in my book its three stars because clearly it seems they did not take much care of it during the shipping process just be warned you may not get what you expect it also doesnt really fit my macbook all that well , i have the # inch without retina display and i cant close the case
i really liked the product it has a super soft fabric inside and it fit my mac book pro # & # # ; with retina display nicely i have a cover from apple on it and it fits snuggly but still fits well i like the side pocket also which fits my nexus # perfectly i also think it is nice that it has a zip that opens for the power plug however i do n't use it because i do n't want my computer to over heat this is a great case however much nicer than i thought it would be
this is a nice computer case it is white , but does not get dirty too easily the interior has a soft plush lining that fits my # inch macbook snugly and protects it quite well when i am commuting the front pocket does not fit much except for my vga the only downside of this case is that it is really thick -lrb- about two inches thick with my macbook in it -rrb- and hence takes up a lot of space in my backpack it also has zippers on the side so that you can charge your computer without taking it out of the case
this case is really cool i did n't read the description very well , and i did n't realize it was more of a white vinyl material , rather than cloth it surprised me in a good way though it 's very sleek and fits my # & # # ; macbook pro perfectly it even has a little zipper corner so you can charge your laptop while it 's still nestled in its case
i absolutely love this case & have given it as gifts ; but not always for a laptop ! ! i actually use it for my ipad air because the design is the best found with the padding & the outside pocket large enough to store chargers and hot spots ! form & function at its best ! !
this has been the perfect outer protection for my macbook air it goes with me everywhere white is prone to show dirt a lot , but since it goes inside of a messenger bag that i have that has never been a problem <unk> <unk> -lrb- <unk> -rrb- http / / <unk> # <unk> #
love the stylish , sleek look while being made with quality nice plush padding inside and leather-like white outside the extra front pocket and side zip for charging <unk> are bonuses fits perfectly in my macbook # ' with retina display just got it so i 'll see if the white case is easily scuffed or not ... but ca n't beat the price
i have n't used this product yet , but i love the style and it looks much better in person it feels like it 's very durable and i like that it has a side zipper for charging i 'm very happy with my choice thank you <unk> much
was not what i ordered and it 's just a waste of my time to send it back and have to wait all over again sellers should pay attention to what is ordered so that we wo n't have to go through this the worse part about it is that the product was labeled wrong
soft feel surface begins to rub off immediately with normal usage just the action of putting it inside a computer bag will strip off the surface on the corners and then within days the whole case has nicks and scratches <unk> <unk> a product can be manufactured and sold but that is the disadvantage of internet shopping , you ca n't tell until the item arrives and who actually takes the time to return items other that that it fits accurately and looks very slick if you just want your computer to sit on display then this is the cover for you , otherwise it is not worth the postage and packing shame on you khomo
purchased this case for my husband as a gift and he really loved it . top case fits in perfect but at the bottom it doesnt clip on perfect but seems fine . apple logo can be seen when lit wish there were more colors to choose
i just put this on my macbook and it does n't stay on completely around the edges in some spots , which is n't <unk> it makes my computer look very sleek , and gives it a new look , which i enjoy
i have been using this product for a few days and its not too bad the black satin finish really adds a nice look to the macbook pro , when in use you can see the apple lit up under the flat black the case does not add too much weight and fits pretty well although there is a little space but not too much the only thing that i 'm not too fond of is the tabs on the upper case make the macbook have a little bit of space when closed but this is to be expected i fixed this by sanding down the two tabs on the top and just letting the case grip the sides and now it closes a lot better with not as much space heat has not been an issue because of their being plenty vents on the bottom to make sure the heat <unk> overall for # bucks i am pleased with the purchase and the satin finish feels nice and adds extra protection to those who want it
this case works great installation directions are a little weak , but you only need to play around with it and the parts fit thus far doing everything as advertised you should buy one if you have to travel and or carry around your laptop a lot
i was very excited about having something to protect my new mac laptop this is exactly what i was looking for , it protects my computer but still allows the apple light to shine threw the product fit my computer perfectly and never came off the only small issue i had with it is the laptop ca n't be opened all the way where the screen is parallel with the keyboard i do n't know where u would need that very much but it is blocked because of the new protective case very nice will be ordering from them gain in the future
i love the khomo great protection for the macbook pro great packaging and easy to snap onto the laptop i love the vents underneath and <unk> it slightly raises the laptop underneath for air ventilation
