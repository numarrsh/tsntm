i recently purchased a # inch green cover from this seller for my macbook pro it arrived in the mail promptly and was packaged safe and securely once i took the product out , the ease to install it was simply incredible and it fit perfectly and snuggly onto my laptop in a matter of seconds , my macbook pro went from a regular , ordinary laptop to a sleek , trendy , and fancy laptop causing all my friends to ask where i had gotten the cover from for the price , this product definitely exceeds expectations and will leave you more than satisfied
ordered this product to protect a brand-new mac and it 's done its job the color is a little <unk> than the photos would have you believe , but then again , it is a clear piece of plastic snaps on easily -lrb- if you 're not a <unk> like me and try to put in on backwards first ! -rrb- and does n't fall off or shift when you open and close the mac and instead of putting stickers directly on my mac , i can decorate this plastic cover all i want and get a new one when i get tired of it
i bought a new macbook pro for college and wanted a case for protection i bought this case in green and love not only the color but how well it protects my computer . it is easy to snap on and off and is a great product
i love this case i bought it with the matching keypad cover it protects the computer and it makes mine stand out from all the other macs at school it was easy to pop on , and it appears to be of good quality
great item , just as described , # stars a + + took a little work to get the correct size and model number , but that was mostly my fault and amazon 's not ipearl 's
ok , so i love my macbook , but , to be honest , i hate the feel of the metal i wanted to get a cover to go over the metal that would last a while and look nice this one is awesome because it is made of a durable material , and it is in my favorite color of green the only negative is that one of the round rubber things that is on the bottom on each corner fell off , but i plan to just hot glue it on again , so not a big deal
i love this case the color is nice , and people always comment on it the cover has protected my computer very well i dropped the computer , and all was okay for both the computer and the cover the cover looks brand new even after a few months use i especially like how it fits my computer like a glove the assembly was practically effortless it is a great product and is very <unk> i plan to order this case in more colors when i have the money
i wanted something for my macbook pro that would protect it while also allowing it to look nice and retain all its functionality and this case does the job very well
this product is great extremely well priced for what you get it fit my macbook pro like a glove , looks great and is n't too bulky initially i was worried because i have a small computer bag that fits my macbook pro quite perfectly and i though that this cover would put it over the edge , but i was wrong its thick enough to keep my computer safe but thin enough to allow it to fit in standard sized bags with no issues i highly recommend this item !
i had been looking for a case for my new macbook pro for two weeks , then on a wednesday after class , i decided to search on amazon.com when i saw that they had cases in different colors i was super excited i had a hard time deciding between the different colored cases it came down to green and purple i ended up getting the green one and i could n't be happier it was super easy to <unk> and i am thinking of getting another one i am super happy with the case it was shipped to me in less than two days i ordered it on a wednesday night and had it by friday morning
product is exactly what i expected came in # days easy to install and now i wo n't have to worry so much about scratching -lrb- anymore -rrb- my macbook pro it even has the kickstands now to find a scratch remover , haha
purchased this for my son he loves it and does n't leave home without it people are always asking about it it was easy to put on and it easily comes off when he needs to clean it
i absolutely love the green mcover hard shell case for my # `` macbook pro it fit perfectly , it protects my new laptop from scratches and i like the added feature at the bottom that tilts the keyboard i 'm looking forward to getting a few more
purchased one for another macbook # years ago and it is still in perfect shape so i was sure to order another for a new mb i love the colors , the simple design , and quick installation the keyboard cover feels great under the fingertips and i 'm happy to have protection from accidental spills , crumbs , etc .
this case definitely beats the $ # + apple wants for a similar product it was easy to put on ; however , the bottom case was a little difficult to snap on at first i purchased the green color and i absolutely love it the case fits my macbook pro mid- # perfectly : <unk> i highly recommend this product to any macbook pro owner looking for a protective case for their laptop at a cheaper price
i bought this product on may # th and received it promptly it fits my mac perfectly i 've had no problems with it at all it 's protective , and ... it 's green , which i like i 've been very happy with this purchase and would recommend it to anyone who wants to protect their investment
was extremely pleased with the quality of this case , which i purchased for my husband 's macbook pro it was thicker than other brands i have ordered , has built-in folding legs , and the perfect fit keyboard cover was an added bonus now i want to get one for my macbook air
was looking for a hardshell green case for my new mbp this def fits the bill i wanted to get an incase because i like the brand and have used their cases on my <unk> etc . . but at $ # i did n't think it was worth it this a solid case for the price the green is very vibrant , not a crazy shade like other case manufacturers have i also like the # feet at the rear of the case to elevate it for circulation pick this case up for your mbp
lasted me a while , then just fell to pieces i was dissatisfied i expected more from case logic , but you get what you pay for more often than not , so that 's how the cookie -lrb- or laptop case -rrb-
the first time i placed my laptop in this case and zipped the main compartment closed , the zipper failed i was n't trying to zip closed an over stuffed case , and the laptop is a # `` toshiba the zipper just failed and can not be repaired otherwise , the case is a functional , no frills , basic case with adequate padding for the laptop overall , i 'm very disappointed
the case worked well for my dad 's # & # # ; laptop until the plastic rings attaching the case to the strap snapped this is a huge design error , and we had to remedy the situation by using metal rings made to hold papers together i would n't really recommend this to anyone with a laptop of this size due to the sheer weight of the computer and the <unk> of it breaking
when in a slack position and then stretched , the strap keeps getting loose , as such i constantly have to remind myself to hold the bag handle not one of my best buys
this is my second bag from case logic and i find that they are very well made and are great for everyday use i use my laptop daily and this bag has lots of room the strap is sturdy and has plenty of length i would purchase this item again if needed and do recommend it to others
a really good buy when compared to similar type cases at local electronic and computer stores it would have been a five star purchase at this price if it had a little more padding
my # . # & # # ; laptop is able to fit in te case <unk> . hopefully the <unk> helps to protect the laptop from some falls also had a few compartments where you can place your laptop acessories like your charger or earphones ect
in my bag now - acer aspire v # g- # . # -inch laptop -lrb- black - computer science paper cover textbook -lrb- # pages - # single subject notebooks - # thick folder containing all of my classes ' handouts from current semester - laptop adapter - water <unk> you can see this bag can handle a lot and zipper is very sturdy only thing i do not like is the strap no matter how little i carry it makes squeaking sound but for this price i do not regret buying it i can just replace the strap
this bag works , but is nothing special if you are a road warrior and drag your laptop all over the world you will want something more versatile and heavy duty me , i take a couple of flights a year and it works for me it does n't have a lot of storage <unk> power cord bulks it out some - if you know what i mean i still give it # stars because of the price , just do n't buy it if you are going to use it on a daily basis
good item , excellent price , high quality , fast shipping , fits large laptop computers up to # inches with ease with room for storage paperwork and , in my case , bulky pc power block
if you 're on a budget and just need a cheap laptop case , buy this one it 's very functional , and seems like it wo n't break anytime soon however , the material is n't very comfortable in the sense that if you sling it around your shoulder , the case feels very awkward and the strap kinda hurts after a while i usually just carry this by the handle on the top
if you want a compact and light case then this is a good option for the price it is great for carrying , it is very light and it is very easy to place your laptop into mine is a dell e # with a # . # `` screen the zippers seem good so far and there is plenty of extra space in the pockets for accessories and the ac adapter if you want a rugged case then this is not for you the protections are thin so do n't expect the bag to protect your laptop from a hard hit it is a great carrying bag that will offer mild protection ; but will not protect it from anything too major
i gave # stars in place of # simply because the padding could be a little better if you are looking for a more solid level of protection for your laptop however , my wife is very small and <unk> and simply wanted to have an easy to carry bag for her # inch inch dell and this works perfectly for her needs in addition to the handles , it comes with a fairly sturdy shoulder strap as well as sufficient additional pocket storage for her power brick and accessories without adding unnecessary bulk nor weight it appears well constructed and tough though i could imagine a handle tearing if handled too roughly do not expect to place a # inch computer in it it would not easily fit however , it is perfect for the # inch dell and protection is quite adequate , but it 's greatest utility is for easy , complete and very lightweight carrying of your laptop i was so impressed that i bought one for my computer and one for my laptop , though the case logic model i bought could actually carry both without adding any <unk> additional weight this is a great laptop bag
this bag is perfect for someone who just needs a basic laptop bag my # -inch laptop fits <unk> in my bag and the other pouches offer plenty of additional space for batteries , power chords , and other accessories the zippers slide smoothly and the bag strap is <unk> and durable when carrying the bag the cost is very good as well , so this bag is highly recommended to even the casual laptop user
i have a # `` samsung laptop that i needed this for it fits perfectly and is well padded the rest of the inside is minimal as far as pockets go if you do n't need a mobile office this is a very nice case well made and i like it
i bought this for a # inch laptop and really liked how the front panel opens up to give room to place and secure the laptop the front pocket is large enough to hold the charger and other accessories the bag is very light , and well made would buy again
i did n't expect much with this case , but i am very pleased at its functionality , space , and pocket placement this fits the # . # inch laptops no problem and has a velcro strap in the pocket to secure it in place the lid opens # degrees , making it travel safe the front pocket was able to fit my charger , external mouse in its case , # mouse pads , # dvd 's , external wd my passport hdd with protective case , flash drive , and recovery disks there is plenty of room left for more as well there canvas material is soft enough to not irritate the skin and rigid enough to protect against bumps and small drops overall , i really like this case , and have yet to find something close to this quality in the same price range
i bought this for my <unk> for christmas . with the new laptop i bought him . i am sure he will smile and love it . it seems very durable and good quality !
i bought one of these for my laptop and really like it it hold the computer securely and has pockets and room to carry additional items my wife also liked it so much that she had me get one for her
you simply can not ask for more this case carries well , has plenty of extra room for accessories , is good looking and strong , giving you computer excellent protection in other words this case is beyond my expectations and since have bought another for a smaller laptop buy this case and forget it , the problem is no longer an issue
i was very delighted to see the caselogic laptop case and the overall build quality was very good until i found a stitching problem apart from that the case is very light weight and easy to carry i loved the strap which can really a boon in tough times while traveling
it arrived within three days with no damage product fits my lenovo b # , a # . # `` laptop with room to spare it is exactly what i needed the zipper goes # degrees making it easy to store and retrieve my laptop
i was looking for a cheap notebook case just to offer protection while transporting my laptop between home and work this case exceeded my expectations on all counts though it is a simple case , the quality , ease of use , and protection are unsurpassed for the price i feel stylish while carrying the case , more than safe putting my laptop in it , and am definitely not upset with how much i paid for it
i got a new laptop this past black friday and all the cases i found were ridiculously expensive this case was inexpensive and worth every penny fits my laptop , the charger , and a few spare parts with room to spare
very happy with this product it has a nice slim and professional design , and the laptop feels quite secure plenty of extra storage in the pockets , inside and out shoulder strap is removable , which is a nice option not always available my # . # inch laptop fits with room to spare and for around # bucks , ca n't beat it
i have never had a laptop case , never really had a laptop of my own until this one , so i had to have the perfect laptop case to go with it this is the perfect case for a first time owner with basic needs the cords fit in the front zipper fine without bulging and the case holds my laptop in safe condition if you are one to abuse your things then you may want more padding but otherwise great product
not enough padding for student or business use although one could easily fix this problem with the addition of a <unk> laptop sleave perfect for any # `` to # `` widescreen laptop mine fit snug , just the way i like it extra pockets and storage areas are useful for $ # you ca n't touch this case
i ordered this on the <unk> for a trip it was exactly what i was looking for i was flying , so i used it for my # . # inch computer , newspaper and magazine outside pocket carried my cord and earphones the strap is wide and carried nicely over my shoulder
i have a # ' laptop and first purchased a # `` case it was way too big this works perfectly for me it is just a case to store my laptop and take it to our boat in the summer it would n't work if it was being used extensively but for my purpose , it works fine from past experience , i 'll bet it will last longer than the laptop and it 's technology
case came in a massive box that was almost bigger than me which i thought was pretty funny this case feels very high quality and you wont have to worry about your laptop or accessories being damaged it looks cool , feels cool , and it has much space for your laptop and all your accessories can definitely not go wrong with this
this case is not large enough for a # -inch laptop but # . # to # inches -lrb- toshiba -rrb- should fit nicely it is roomy for thin reports , multimedia disks , power adapters , and , of course , protection for the laptop when traveling
i bought this after a fair amount of research on cases and am well pleased the zipper goes around # sides so it gives plenty of room to insert and remove the laptop without scratching anything it provides a nice , snug fit and is well made i <unk> forward to using it for many years
this case is durable enough for heavy airport duty and seems well <unk> my only complaint is one <unk> zipper -- not a <unk> as the zipper and teeth both seem to be heavy-duty , and the zipper function is getting smoother with more use
i recently bought this backpack targus backpack <unk> # us -lrb- $ # . # plus shipping charge $ # , from agent frugal -rrb- unfortunately , the shoulder strap frayed after two trips of normal use -lrb- # -day trip , carrying a macbook # `` -rrb- contacted the seller -lrb- agent frugal -rrb- , but got no response would not recommend this <unk> i have purchased hundreds of items on amazon - this is by far the worst experience
this backpack was purchased less than a year ago and was used only a few times the shoulder straps started to fray first and then the bottom completely frayed and the laptop began to slide out i usually do not purchase items that have any # star ratings with a reasonable reason but so many other people gave it # stars and i was <unk> by the hugely discounted price this backpack was definitely not worth even the discounted price and i would strongly advise against purchasing this item
i received this as a gift for christmas # i use the backpack for daily use and travel while it is convenient and works well in design the quality of the product is very poor much like others who have owned this product it began to fall apart quickly i first noticed the straps starting to fray and now there 's a hole in the bottom of the bag where the laptop rests i 'm sure this product will not last much longer and would not recommend it to anyone
i loved the design for the backpack it is well thought-out and a good size unfortunately the straps are not strong enough one strap ripped the first time i used it
nice idea for a checkpoint-friendly backpack , but very poorly made i have just returned from a <unk> trip through west africa and europe unfortunately seams on the backpack began unravelling by the end of the first week by the time i returned home , the backpack was a complete mess -- and the time for returning it to amazon had passed now i 'm stuck with a $ # piece of junk that was used for only one trip i have never seen any other backpack in this condition , even after many years of hard use
i bought this model years ago and it served me well for some time when i got the same model to replace , after a few weeks the back straps frayed at the top i thought this could be an <unk> , so i sent it back for replacement this cost a bit , since i had to pay for the shipping however the replacement had the same problem and the top seems have just about completely come off after a few weeks
i ordered this product for work to carry my laptop to and from the office within the first week , the stitching began to come apart i contacted targus who told me i could send the product back , but i would have to pay for the shipping back to them the cost of shipping the backpack was going to be half of the cost of the bag very disappointed in the quality of targus i will not buy any of their products again i am very <unk> in the customer service of targus
in the second week of use the sewing start to open in several parts of the bag my <unk> targus acquisition was a <unk> however , the technical <unk> in brazil is trying to help me i 'm going forward to see the <unk> of taht customer support
like many reviewers have noted here , the shoulder straps are not strong enough for normal use -lrb- carrying a light laptop -rrb- the straps broke in less than three weeks if you are looking for a laptop bag for everyday use , look elsewhere this bag is nice and works perfectly for going through airport security but the manufacturing quality is simply too low targus warranty does not help much either and since the bag is broken , one can not return the product to the seller , amazon namely , targus does not refund the purchase nor replace it with another model they are only willing to exchange for the exact same model , they wo n't pay for shipping , and they send the new bag a couple of weeks after they have received the old broken one so , i have to pay for shipping to return the defective product , and then after a few weeks i get the exact same model with the same design flaw
purchased in mid # and have only made a few trips with this bag , carrying a # inch laptop , notebook , some magazines and various odds and ends not terribly loaded or overloaded after only a few trips , both straps are coming apart and i can not trust this to carry my laptop through the airport will contact targus to review my options
- this bag has lot of compartments one of them is dedicated for laptop/tablet so you can zip through tsa security quickly without having to remove your laptop - bought this item on # / # , the shoulder strap is already falling apart by # / # from only # weeks of usage - both the shoulder straps and the handle share the same connecting points to the bag so if one method breaks , you ca n't carry the back pack by the handle strap anymore , effectively rendering the bag useless looking through other low rating reviews , i found out that i 'm not the only person complaining about the shoulder strap falling apart bummer : -
i have # rips at three different places . shoulder . handle and at the bottom i have not used it every day , i use it around # days a month , so in the last # day of use it has significant issues ... stay away
i use this bag daily and carry a laptop , ipad , lunch and a notebook or # the seams on the left strap began to tear within # months of purchase i switched to the right side , and now it is tearing also flimsy construction and weak materials before this i carried the same stuff in a north face backpack for # years before i ruined it in the washing machine and had to purchase another time for another , guess which brand i will choose - not targus
just like everyone else , i really like the design and it works perfectly going through airport security , but the seams on the straps started splitting during the first trip , one week after getting it more seams on the straps split over the next # weeks and now i 'm sending it back
i read all the reviews and hoped i would n't run into the same problem as others within one month of use -lrb- two business trips and two days per week of carrying the bag -rrb- the shoulder strap seams are coming apart the design of this bag is great , the size , the `` checkpoint friendly `` feature , and lot of pockets for pens , business cards , phone , headphone , ect i can not believe that targus can not make a bag at this price that lasts more than a month very disappointed , not sure if it 's even worth paying to return it under warranty
i should have purchased a different pack - the straps are n't designed for long term -lrb- length of warranty -rrb- wear and tear - the material separates at the seams and then <unk> i am returning mine
i bought this for my wife for the <unk> of nursing school , now she has to replace it because the strap is three threads from breaking a pack that size should have better durability it 's a pity , since it held everything she needed , but not being able to carry it anymore is a deal breaker , especially after just two terms
i purchased this bag about six months ago and i am very disappointed the seams are coming out of the straps in several places after normal use i thought i had read enough reviews before purchasing this bag , but apparently not , as i now see many others have had the same problem a bag this expensive -lrb- or at least it was when i bought it , about twice the current price -rrb- should not fall apart so quickly do n't buy this bag
i was initially happy with this purchase but i only had the bag for a few months and the strap in the back is torn i am a college student and really liked the <unk> of this backpack but now i am stuck using the one i had tried to replace this backpack was a disappointment i would like to get it replaced
this bag was a waste of money for me the main zipper comes unzipped many times i have gotten to where i & # # ; m going only to find the bag open because the zipper opened up i & # # ; ve tried just about everything i could think of to fix it and finally gave up it sits looking like new because it never gets used as the saying goes , you get what you pay for
this bag could be perfect as it has lots of areas to put things ! but , this is my second bag and the quality of the stitching is terrible i have to send this bag back , too do yourself a favor and get a different bag
i purchased back in # for a job , but ended up not needing four months ago , i started using it daily to carry my # & # # ; laptop to and from the office straps began to fray after just a couple of weeks they were so bad after a month , i gave up on it funny thing is , i got a <unk> bag from our it department and it is a targus - different style it has been a great bag , so i know targus can make a quality product i just wasted my money on a bad one
i travel extensively and like to fly domestic and long hauls with only carry-on bags this backpack had good reviews so i went with it as it sounded like it would be very convenient not to have to unload the laptop going through airport security that worked in the us but in the uk i had to take the laptop out of the backpack the biggest problem , however , is that i have only used it once on a # -day business trip to scotland and london and one of the shoulder straps is already pulling out of the seam do n't know that i 'll return it because it always costs more to return products from alaska than amazon <unk> but it does n't look like the backpack is going to hold up well at all
i got this bag because of the excellent reviews but i was very disappointed the first time i took this bag on a trip , the strap started to give way i was so worried that the strap would completely detach from the bag that i decided to return it as soon as i return home my samsonite backpack lasted more than # years with them straps still intact after hauling it around the world even if the straps hold up , it is still not a comfortable bag to wear
initially i was excited about this backpack , but after less than # months of daily use it was already falling apart the seams where the <unk> are attached at the top ripped open on both sides it still works , but does n't seem possible to repair i will attempt to return for warranty replacement on the positive , the tsa was happy to let me keep my laptop in the pouch every time i used it , about # times the zippers seem strong , and it has a lot of storage space and myriad compartments in fact , i keep finding things i forgot were in there it 's also light weight and very comfortable
i loved the product for the first month the straps do n't have a lot of padding was my only complaint after a month though , the material started to tear and padding started to show i now have holes in the bag to cause me to order a new bag after # months granted , i am a frequent traveler and use this bag every day second time around though , i 'm not purchasing this product or any other targus bag again
when i read the reviews on amazon for this product i was excited to buy this i did order one of them for # dollars and package reached me after a week or so i saw that the <unk> in the bag have started unravelling <unk> then i had to call the targus support and they gave me a replacement for the old bag the new bag that i received as a replacement also started unravelling again after using couple of times i would say if you are a smart shopper there are lot of other backpacks for much lesser price and better quality i am not happy with the bag - unhappy . . :
i purchased this specifically for my travels after the first use , i now have the stiching releasing i would expect this to happen after some time but not after the first use i will not be purchasing targus again
nice looking , functional , worked well for a time the problem - seams started coming apart and fraying after # months , zippers failed in month # this product just is n't made to last
top attachment points of the shoulder straps are not durable even with a relatively typical load -lrb- <unk> laptop , power supply and cables , pens , paper , etc . -rrb- , after about # months of daily use , straps began to detach from the bag now using a swissgear bag that i 'm much happier with
before you buy this backpack or a similar model from targus , i would recommend you read all the reviews talking about the problem with the shoulder strap seams this is a really great backpack with excellent features for a fairly reasonable price however , there seems to be an issue with the design or manufacturing of the shoulder straps i have already gotten two replacement backpacks because of tearing along the center of the shoulder straps as well as other tearing -lrb- on my second one -rrb- i am now ready to ditch the third bag because of the same problem both straps are frayed and look awful any weight at all is enough to cause the straps to start ripping it 's really unfortunate
i really liked this pack however the quality was not as it should be the straps frayed within a few weeks , and after toting my laptop one time i returned it and recieved a replacement , only to have the same thing happen again too bad because i really liked it and am very annoyed by the bad quality
it has nice design and it is great for airport security however , the quality of the bag is not so good after one trip the straps are starting to tear i was carrying # inch laptop , headset , mouse , a/c adapter , agenda , pen and few papers i do not recommend this product
i liked the design of this backpack and it was easy to go thru the tsa screening without having to remove my laptop but like # % of the other reviewers , i was unhappy to find the strap seams fraying after only a few trips i 'm returning this product and will try another company
i 've had the same experience as many other reviewers here have noted great features and good price ... if it lasted only # months of limited use and it is splitting the seam at the right shoulder strap i expected more from a targus product
i 'll start with the good stuff - this backpack is functionally great it has enough compartments to suit my needs , provides enough protection for my valuable gear , is comfortable to carry , and it has gotten me through tsa scanner lines quickly and efficiently this bag would be perfect except for one problem - poor quality in the workmanship i bought two of these , one for me and one for my wife both have shoulder straps that are fraying at the seams that go down the center of the entire strap , on both sides this nearly perfect bag would 've been made perfect had they spent the extra few cents to properly <unk> that seam to withstand normal daily use because it 's such a huge oversight on their part on an otherwise fully functional product , i have to take away # stars from this review you may think that 's harsh on a product that is otherwise outstanding , but it is for that very reason that i have to dock it it nearly is outstanding , and then they dropped the ball on the basic function of a backpack - to have a strap that actually keeps the product on your back these frayed shoulder straps have gotten to the point that it is no longer safe to carry the backpack on my back , so it is now functionally unacceptable
this bag appears to be great -- i had a targus bag before and i loved it it lasted me like several years and i used it all the time this bag has nice sized pockets and the easy access to the laptop feature designed for the airport is nice but the bag -lrb- especially the straps -rrb- are cheaply made within a month of using it , one of the straps had fallen completely apart at the top i figured it was a fluke , but then the other one frayed and fell apart too now i definitely need to replace the bag i looked into replacing it , but you need to pay shipping etc and it seems to not be too easy , takes a long time , etc . so i figure i 'll just buy a new bag -- but not this one or another targus too bad , i was a big believer in the brand before this
this backpack serves me well on my daily # minute train commute the pockets are well-organized and my dell latitude e # fits easily into the laptop compartment the main compartment is spacious enough to fit my extra power cord , a small umbrella , a lunch bag , and a full change of gym clothes as other reviewers noted , the zippers are a bit `` <unk> `` when walking , but that 's a minor nit the primary reason i gave the backpack a <unk> rating was durability after # weeks of very light use -lrb- # trips back and forth to work -rrb- , the seams on the top of the upper right shoulder strap started to fray and rip the material is such that i ca n't sew it or easily fix it , and the tear continues to move down the seam after # weeks of use the same seam on the other strap started to fray and is slowly ripping i expect i 'll get # to # months of use before i 'll need to replace the backpack so while i like the product , the durability was quite disappointing
check <unk> design , slot for roller-bag handle and other design features worked great however , after my first trip with the bag , a seam on the shoulder strap began to fray , and i returned it to amazon this targus bag is just not build for the rigors of serious travel
i purchased this backpack march # st , # and after my # st trip the shoulder strap is completely unraveling very disappointing given similar experiences others have written about with regard to targus backpack products i 'm going to return for a replacement but would not suggest a purchase of these products unless targus is able to effectively address their quality issues
purchased this bag about two years ago and it has been around the world i work in services and never check-in luggage -lrb- so this bag has * always * been on my person . it 's great for airports , and has a handy organizational setup . * however * it wears ` oddly . the place where the major wear occurs is the outside of the shoulder straps near the top of the bag it seems like some additional reinforcement would make this bag absolutely perfect -lrb- hint , hint -rrb- , but of course , <unk> would not last long if everything lasted forever
i have to carry # laptops for my job coming from a messenger-style laptop bag , this was a great change the first time i traveled , i kept checking to make sure i actually had both laptops in the bag because it felt so much lighter than what i was used to getting thru airport security has been <unk> every time additionally , i appreciate all of the compartments for storing things one of the other reasons i purchased this bag was because of targus ' reputation and also because it comes with a lifetime warranty unfortunately , one of the shoulder straps started to fray , just about a week out of the # day return period now i have to pay $ # to ship it across the country for warranty service - this seems pretty <unk> to me after such a short period of ownership i certainly hope my replacement lasts more than the first , or this will become an extremely disappointing purchase
the shoulder straps started coming apart at the seems a week after i received it i thought it would be well made and sturdy , but that 's just not the case it 's roomy , stylish , and has plenty of compartments , but i ca n't get passed the poor stitching on the shoulder straps the zippers on this thing are really nice
have had this backpack for about # months now fits my laptop nicely have been on two trips with it so far easy to get through security at the airports holds my laptop , kindle , tablet , and misc . cords for them all my only complaint is that it is not going to last that long the fabric and stitching on both shoulder straps is already fraying and pulling apart spend a little more next time and buy a better quality backpack
this bag has done the job for me i do n't give it five stars because the stitching on it has come apart in two <unk> areas of the bag there is a stretchy pocket on the inside of one of the big compartments , and the moment i put something in it , the fabric completely detached from the elastic cord it was sewn to i 'm handy though , so i sewed it back up since i could do that faster than it would take for me to send it back and wait for a new one to be shipped after about a month of regular use , the stitching on one of the shoulder straps started coming apart i do n't believe it compromised the strength of the strap , but it definitely was n't comforting sight i sewed that up too and now it works fine again once again , i think its a nice bag , its just seems like it may have been put together a little <unk> probably worth the $ # i paid for it
used it on a few trips and it worked well nice number of compartments however , i 've made the mistake of using it daily to the office and the seams on the straps are coming apart now i am looking for a more durable daily use bag
the bag has a good design but has no cushion or padding on the bottom of the laptop compartment i was really annoyed by the sound of the laptop hitting the hard floor when i place the bag on a hard surface
purchased targus checkpoint-friendly backpack in january as advertised it was very convenient when traveling through airport security good protection for the laptop and plenty of convenient pockets to carry other things however after less than # months the side seam came apart at the zipper now waiting for a replacement from manufacturer , will see if the next one is made any better
i am surprised by so many # , # star review the backpack is just ok first of all its a small backpack overall , i have a medium build and still it looks small on me my # . # `` laptop barely fits in it the top handle is also not so strong the top , small outer compartment is very difficult to access and keep things in
