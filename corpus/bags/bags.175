had this many months now for my mid # macbook air was great at first and protected me from lots of scratches and dings , however the bottom piece of the case cracked around the right side and i was pretty disappointed that it did n't even last a year will not be repurchasing
i got this case for my new macbook air it works great and can be put on or taken off easily , but it does n't come off unless you want it
i returned this it did n't fit it was a super tight when you go to shut it , it does n't latch shut . i wish it did fit cause it 's good
it 's attractive and fits well but ... the snap closure tab bothered me when using the track pad and the case lining covered the sleek , smooth glide of the frame areas where you rest your hands i also decided i wanted a case with a pocket for cord & adapters with it for me , those negatives made me return it
this case would be nice if the top was n't so heavy that it pulled your screen backwards , so you lose control over your viewing angle it 's bad enough that i 'm considering returning it apparently it was n't tested
at first i thought it would n't fit at all , i had to really shove and push my macbook into the case after getting it on , i notice that the side strap that holds the lower portion buckles and the trackpad cover will not lie smooth and flat the final blow is the latch does n't even reach all the way up to lock it shut , i guess that 's why the photo only shows it sitting open i 'm really kind of disappointed . i can only suspect they meant this to fit a macbook air and not a macbook pro the color and feel is nice , though
nothing wrong with this macbook air case but pretty quickly i quit using this macbook is a little <unk> now but its doing what an air should do - which is be incredibly easy to carry everywhere currently carrying my macbook air in a shoulder bag by <unk> called the ` small <unk> brief & # #
i have a similar case for my ipad and i love it -lrb- one of the main reasons i ordered this -rrb- i felt like i was taking a risk on ordering this and it took about # minutes for me to regret the purchase this cover just adds too much bulk to the air with this case the air is as thick as my # year old dell business laptop the flap on the front was an instant annoyance folding the flap under got it out of the way but it creates a high point that causes it to tip side to side if you use it on a flat surface many others seem to like this case it does fit securely and seems to provide good protection i use my air for business purposes so it gets a lot of desk and conference table use if i was only using it on the couch or in the coffee shop i might have a very different opinion
i returned this it just did n't fit my gf 's # `` mba perfectly the piece of material that goes below the space bar and above the <unk> was getting in the way of hitting the spacebar with ease it took <unk> thought to move your thumb around the material to get to the space bar typing just should be that way it was made very nicely , just did n't fit how we hoped
this product is really good for protecting the laptop , especially when being carried by hand it also serves as a great cushion when placed in a bag with other items <unk> , it looks simple , yet professional it allows easy access to the laptop too however , i ended up returning it because it eventually felt too bulky and heavy - defeating the slim and small design of the air
i like this case a lot because of the fabric on the wrist area , but i 've only had it for a month and the elastic is already loosening and a piece of the corner is falling off
just got this cover and dropped my macbook air in it and i must say it looks good i <unk> with the idea of getting the sena cover which cost about $ # more but when i cam across this i had to check it out one thing to note is i wish this had a pocket for business cards like the sena cover my biggest concern is that inside where you insert the keyboard has an edge that i worry will scratch the screen over time this worries me let face it if you shell out the money for a macbook air you want to take good care of it i 'm gon na have to think about this at this time i 'm thinking of returning it there is nothing worst than a scratched screen
# . it 's fashion look and also the method is attractive it 's not so good for users just taking this cover as only case # . the air can not be closed fully , this is the problem maybe you should consider to add protector avoiding dust and water # . when the lip is open , the top side will make the screen inclined , it 's not so safe the the air the price is good anyway
well designed : keep your mac book air on top of everything allowing all devices <unk> and protecting from covers scratches feels good on touch and do n't have the classic <unk> worst smell after a month of usage , approved
i 'll probably repurchase just because i 've gotten countless compliments on this case when it 's closed , it looks like a portfolio -lrb- so no one will even think to steal your expensive mba -rrb- but i 've nicked the edges of my screen with other things in my travel bag since this case leaves edges completely uncovered the clip attachment near the touchpad seems like it 'd be annoying , but it rarely gets in the way i love the suede-like covering between the keyboard and touchpad enjoy , but do n't treat this as a snap-on case your mba is still vulnerable with this one
i wanted brown ... what i got was essentially orange , nothing at all like the color in the picture functionally it 's fine the stand on the bottom is too narrow to steady a # inch rmbp , but i do n't use it anyway i like it , but if i knew it would be more orange then brown i 'd have ordered a different <unk> color
i 've used this case for a year it does the job , mostly , and looks decent for the money i dropped it from a couple feet up with the case on , and dented in both halves of one of the front -lrb- thin -rrb- corners pretty good still closes fine , and i was n't expecting serious armor from such a <unk> case - just be forewarned that anything other than a flat landing on the top or bottom will probably result in some damage the case itself is large enough to cover the edges , but the material is not strong enough to resist buckling i have had problems with overheating as well , to the point that i 've need to take the case off , but it could be just my particular air and type of usage
this case fits very nicely and stays in place well the color is fine for my tastes ... however a little on the orange side of tan i 've had it # months now and the front corners of the <unk> cover have <unk> there is some `` piping `` trim over the sharp edge and that has come loose , exposing the black <unk> it remains to be seen how well it will wear from here on i 'll post an update in a few months
nice protector , tab buckle does not close properly because it is too short to close as <unk> also , item on the side are blocked by the cover i had to cut out pieces to access some of the plug in slots
the case looks much more expensive than it is the material where your wrists set is soft and has not picked up dirt like i thought it would yes it hides that i am using a mac when i am at starbucks and i am great with that , one of the reasons that i got this case hopefully someone wo n't just grab it and run because they see the apple logo the only reason this did n't get # stars is the elastic straps that hold the top of the case to the screen cover up the corners just a touch overall i am very pleased with this case for my ridiculously expensive mac , seems to provide good protection for it
i 've been looking for a case for my # `` mba for quite some time but most all the cases i 've seen were way over prices and quite frankly did n't look that elegant this casecrown fits just right -- for both the price , design , and complimentary style <unk> <unk> material feels great and can be easily wiped <unk> covering on both sides of the <unk> plus : <unk> slot that provides air circulation and props up the laptop for easier typing easy to install and take out of the <unk> buckle no snapping or <unk> protection for <unk> only one : do n't like how the little buckle sticks out in front of the trackpad i have to tuck <unk> the laptop to get out of the way
fantastic protection for my mba with a product that delivers the style and elegance that that draws comments sure it 's faux leather and that is why the price is so low the computer fits perfectly and i have no reservations about my <unk>
it wo n't protect your mac from drops but will <unk> nicely to protect from day to day scratches i actually purchased another that fits tighter and is underneath this one
i 've had this case for a week and like it : it 's snug and <unk> the mba well yes it 's faux leather , but it looks far better than decent , and has a good cushy feel and handsome appearance , so it could pass for leather ca n't beat the price - it looks far more expensive than what i paid it makes my mba look and feel like a book paired with my <unk> <unk> , just perfect for work love the magnetic closure and the stitching accents as well as the faux suede on the inside where your palms rest do n't love the flap on the bottom -lrb- not sure what it 's for , so i leave it closed -rrb- however : i have to return mine because the white stitching is frayed in one place and is starting to unravel
overall i am satisfied with this purchase it is stylish and protects my mba from scratches without adding much weight i also like that it did n't smell bad often these type of products smell like plastic or chemicals good price too i would recommend that you do not use a keyboard cover on this laptop it is designed to vent heat through the keyboard
this looks impressive , and no one would believe it cost what it did , everyone thought it was much pricier the only issue i have is the wrist rest area is actually slightly loose around the edges , so it <unk> an unsightly sag to the edges over time also keep in mind that the side edges -lrb- with exception of the rear -rrb- are mostly exposed so if the laptop takes a tumble and lands on the edge it can still be damaged this was the closest thing i could find to my old moshi case , where you can open and use the laptop while it 's in the case
ordered this because i liked the one my friend had i am enjoying the case with two <unk> first , i discovered that the headphone jack port was covered up by the case , so i had to make a hole for my headphones by poking some scissors through the material on the side of the case secondly , the magnetic clasp does not shut very well i like that the case is padded and has a stand to make it sit up i also like the fact that the area on either side of the mousepad is protected overall , it was a pretty good value for the money spent
not much to say about other than it 's a nice and reasonably well made case for your mba for this item 's price let 's see how long it will last under light use and good care
i dropped my macbook air about a month ago and it 's a bit dinged up i was looking for something that would # . cover the dings protect it fro future dings , and # . this product does a great job of all three the only thing that took some getting used to was the straps that attach the case to the screen they look a bit out of place at first , but it 's something i 've grown to deal with overall , this case is going to provide some solid protection for your macbook , and the leather look and feel gives it a nice look
it 's nice and cushiony easy to put on and take off it looks like a higher end case and it 's really nice get lots of compliments on it the straps that keep the screen covered are a minor <unk> but there would be no way around it there is no ventilation great quality for the cost
i really like this slip on case it is padded and has enough padding to protect the computer from a drop it appearance is nice and modern / sleek i would suggest this for people who need protection for their mac book air
i just got it two days ago fit my macbook air # & # # ; -lrb- # -rrb- perfectly so far , i really like the look and feel , but find the small closing flap sticks out and annoying when using my laptop on a table tried to fold it back but it makes the laptop wobbly i do like the pull out flap on the bottom time will tell if it protects my laptop well
from the picture , you 're getting exactly what you see the leather is that kind of cheesy faux looking stuff however , i 've had this cover for about # months now and it 's holding up beautifully it is very convenient and makes toting around my air an absolute breeze i did n't think it would last this long but it still looks great and does n't show any signs of wear or cheap construction worth every penny
this is my third casecrown book cover case , and i am still pleased with the product overall the look is a nice leatherette , understated and durable the only issue that i have with this product is that my mac can overheat if i am working all day with the laptop in the case ; nevertheless , this is easily resolved
i was looking for a protective case for my new macbook air the casecrown exceeded my expectations materials and workmanship are excellent and the style looks sharp a good product at a good <unk>
i like this a lot the only thing that 's a bit weird is the straps that secure the <unk> of computer , cover the screen a little bit also the material by the space bar is a bit rough so it hurts if you rest your thumbs on it at all would be really great if covered the corners but really it works well and looks very nice i like that there is a little kickstand too
i am very pleased with this case i often sit on our couch and work for a few hours propping up my macbook air on my knees it 's slightly cushioned and the small portion that flips out to prop the computer at an angle is a nice feature too i also like how the computer slips into it covering up the bottom with an opening for the touch pad secure and soft , comfortable to use only minor <unk> are the <unk> sticking out , would be great if it could retract out of the way and the flip out stand is attached with a ribbon to not extend flat i 'm worried it it wo n't last long but overall , i 'm very happy with it
light <unk> , protects my laptop from scratches it fits perfect when it 's closed it 's a bit off when you open the laptop but the top rubber band straps keeps it on , so it 's not falling off the keyboard part of the cover slides down about # cm , but you can pull down the laptop down to adjust , and you have full access to the mouse pad the outside is padded , nice and simple good if you are going to carry it in your bag with other things -lrb- keys , wallet , pens , etc . -rrb- , it will protect
i had to take # star off , just because i wish it was a bit tighter other than that , i get a lot of compliments of this cover whenever i take out my mba # `` in meetings
i like it . it is protecting my laptop as i intended however , the inner side around the mouse pad is a flight grey <unk> which i fear will be come dirty with continued use
this was a pretty good product my wife loved the color but ultimately she decided on <unk> mcover hard shell case for # -inch model a # macbook pro -lrb- with # . # -inch retina display -rrb- - <unk> she loves i ended up returning this because it lacked side protection , was a little bulky , and the bungee straps that held the case on the display side of the computer tended to cover the edges of screen real estate if this is the look you 're going for its pretty much the only case you can buy at a reasonable price
i love this produce very much , it made in good quality , i love the skin , color and every thing , i advice who love black skin to buy it its
i was really surprised with the quality of this product for the price , you ca n't go wrong it looks really sharp and offers good protection i could not be happier
it is a good protection for traveling the closure is a little bit in the way and i know there are <unk> cases where the flap is on top and can be fixed in the back
it 's a great product but the area beneath the keyboard has gotten dirty by my constant use and lotion from my hands and arm if they could make that part out of a washable product it would be perfect
ive been using the case crown case for a couple of months now it looks elegant and more expensive than what i paid for it -rrb- it is functional with access to all the ports and the trackpad the only reason i held back a star is that the felt surface that makes for a wrist <unk> feels right but tends to pick up <unk> and being light colored -lrb- a light grey -rrb- <unk> easily i can see myself replacing this case because the felt wrist <unk> got discolored enough to be unsightly -lrb- with skin stains if not coffee or worse -rrb- the other critique of cases in general is that unless it is one of those <unk> cases , several airports around the world make you take the case off the neoprene skins are easier to take on/off than a case like this because your are fumbling with elastic straps on this case in addition to your laptop , <unk> , shoes , belts etc . however , if i did need to replace this case , i would still buy this one again cant beat the value
i loved this case . it makes me feel protected and snug on my mac . it does stain easily so i guess that would be my only complain other than that its
this case is really nice i was worried that the brown case would look cheap , but it does n't , and it <unk> makes my macbook look more professional when i 'm using it at work my only issue with it is that it does n't fit completely everything is perfect except for the little magnet clasp the clasp wo n't reach all the way around to lock into place , so there 's nothing to hold my laptop together i 'm hoping that through use the material will stretch and one day it will fit -lrb- however , i need it to stretch about a quarter inch ! -rrb- it 's nice to have the <unk> underneath as well it keeps my laptop cool , and it works great if i were able to latch it , i would have given it # stars
i love the look and feel of my cover i was able to find this one at a great price , something that i was not able to do at the stores
this is a great option for the price my only complain is the elastic holding on the screen does not look nice but i can not think of any solution for that overall , great product
first of all this is a ` cheap ' laptop cover , the faux leather is obvious and you can feel the cardboard material inbetween it as is common with this type of cover however it is well designed with the clasp , fit , access to ports , and pop-out stand it looks great and offers a fair amount of protection against minor scratches light hits to the bottom or top for $ # i 'm happy with it assuming it holds up to normal use the plastic covers or sleeves in the past have tended to be more trouble then they 're worth as long as you do n't mind the faux leather you 'll probably be pleased with the cover as well
purchased for my work macbook air it is well made , soft yet thick , nice stitching so far durable the tab in front is a bit annoying but you get used to it , and it 's necessary to keep case closed i would recommend and/or buy again
i do n't use this cover all the time , but when i 'm going to work and coming home , i always have my macbook air in this cover putting the computer in the cover and taking it out is quick and simple
works well with my mac , but the cover over the area where the palms of your hands rest gets dirty easily this part of the case is a soft brushed felt like material that is not easily cleaned and also raises your hands somewhat above the keyboard i would much prefer that material be smooth and something you could whip down the outside cover , snap and other closures have worked well and i ended up buying two - one for each computer would have been nice to have two different colors , but that was not an option
as the title says , it does n't quite fit the old macbook pro just right it barely squeezes into the case and it covers up the headphone port on the left side of the laptop when i need to use the port , i have to slide the laptop out of the sleeve a bit to get to it aside from that , it 's a very nice looking case i 've gotten compliments on it
like this case a lot for the money reviewed a similar case that was over $ # only complaint is the strap is from the bottom instead of the top i see the reasoning and it really is n't that big of a hindrance so i gave it # stars for price and left off the # th star because of the strap and the material inside the case can get dirty quickly
i 'm happy that i got this for my macbook pro it protects where your wrists sit when typing , and that 's exactly what i wanted this case for the outside of the case is a soft surface and easily cleaned i really like how it holds my macbook the clip gets in the way when using the machine , and the straps that hold onto the screen block some of the visible screen those are my only two grips , hence the lack of a star i hesitate to say that this will protect your machine from falls , but it will protect the shoes and bottom from scratching on the random surface you sit your macbook on the edges of the screen are n't protected either , so be wary overall : a sufficient case to protect a macbook pro -lrb- w / retina -rrb- although it lacks in the <unk> department
this is the perfect case for me i wanted something to add a little more protection for my # `` air i carry my air with me everyday and the messenger bag i use just was n't padded enough to give me peace of mind i am a <unk> student and the work i have on my mac is my life i have it backed up of course but ... you know what i mean it does add <unk> and weight but it 's the protection that i wanted that makes those set backs , if you want to call them that , totally acceptable i spent less than $ # dollars for this product and its worth twice that to me
good look , good materials and build quality , seems to provide good protection two major reasons to miss # stars rating the magnetic snap fastener is more like <unk> <unk> than a physical one still , it <unk> the <unk> , thus <unk> the <unk> the light grey cover under the palm rests shall be spoiled with time and use both are minor <unk> i recommend the product for purchase and use : -
its really good i was a bit <unk> while placing an order , about the quality levels as it is way cheaper than many products out there but im shocked when i actually got it it looked great and good on quality perfect fit to your air and does not make any mess while opening or closing the lid
very nice case for my macbook air # `` mba fits perfectly in it no doubt if you have to buy a <unk> case for <unk> mba # `` good quality , good fabric , good price it wo n't protect your mba if it falls down by accident -lrb- it 's not a padded closed case -rrb- but it will make you to carry it in a better way one final <unk> : to avoid overheating the case has a rectangular opening at the bottom used to elevate the mba as well <unk> : highly <unk>
worth every penny just as described and works great i was looking through all the different cases on amazon and ended up ordering this one and i am definitely happy i did
this cover is even better than i 'd hoped it is light weight and provides a comfortable no-slip grip the part that covers the area beneath the keyboard is very comfortable for my wrists and hands . it looks really good , as well i recommend it with no reservations
i bought this in november with the thought that this would be my interim case until i figured out just what i needed the price was the selling point i was impressed at how good it looks and how well it fit my needs i was ready to buy a much more expensive case but i have stopped looking as this has exceeded my expectations
i really loved the case and i am enjoying it it is lightweight and beautiful it looks very nice it fits my # & # # ; macbook air perfectly the case does leave the back corners slightly unprotected so i just have to make sure i do n't drop it however , i do n't know that any case would totally protect agains dropping a computer so , i 'm very please with the cover
fits macair perfectly it is really comfortable and durable due to constant use , the grey on the inside does get a little dirty , but it is only normal for an item you use so often will definitely get another one after this one serves it 's time
the moment the case came to my door i had to try it on my computer it 's very beautiful the black leather is finished well and the interior is just as nice it does fit slightly tight but its made to fit like that other wise it would come out and have no point in being in the case the only slight problem is how it closes the clasp is difficult to close , not because of the quality of the magnet but because of the height of the computer i would buy it again and recommend to anyone
it is exactly what i wanted the macbook air # has sharp edges and it is so thin and smooth that i worried i might drop it now that i have this cover , both those problems have gone the cover fits and looks great plush soft black on the outside , and velvety <unk> on the inside i love how it snaps together -lrb- magnetic -rrb-
i am so happy i bought this case it looks nice , i get tons fo compliments on it bottom and top of the case are hard to protect the computer , but also squishy padding for the computer only problem is the computer can get very warm since inside -lrb- part touching computer -rrb- is made of cloth bottom flap opens to help , but still tends to overheat very happy though overall since protects and looks great without scratching computer
i love it , it appears to be well made and so far i rate it high i like to use my macbook air on my lap and i 'm <unk> to metal i 've started breaking out this case is <unk> this :
i am very happy with the purchase of this item , my laptop looks beautiful ... and i would recommend this item other people , is very good and the material is very soft if i had to order this item again , i will not hesitate to buy it
some have <unk> my & # # ; team <unk> & # # ; for the texas <unk> because this case looks burnt orange i did n't notice this from the images online , but if you are a <unk> fan who wants to look professional this case is for you the case fits very nicely on my mac and does not seem to cause the computer to heat up at all the one concern i do have is that the wrist guard prevents the computer from shutting all the way i have n't had it very long , so i am hoping that this will not have any long term harm on my computer 's hinge overall -- great case for the price it looks really nice , feels nice , and i 've received lots of complements too
i really love this case , and i 'm so glad i bought it it fits my # -inch macbook air perfectly , and i always leave it on it looks very classy , not cheap looking at all , and very lightweight i do n't have to fear my laptop will be stolen because of how discreet this case is the only issue i have with it is the <unk> thing it 's very often in the way , which is more annoying than you might think however , overall , it 's such a nice case i will repurchase if it ever wears down , which i do n't think will be for a long time
i love this case what an attractive and inexpensive case i am trying to get my entire family to purchase this case so far i have # out of # ordering this case i am and was the last to give into purchasing an apple computer , but i will be the first in the family to get them to purchase this product
i purchased this case just # days ago it 's just nice and elegant got it less than $ # ... none of my friend think this case only cost $ # . . it looks on par with $ # + case i love casecrown brand now and just order another hard case to protect my mba # definitely a great buy ! do n't waste your money on anything more expensive ! most of accessories for apple products are over price ... except for this little case
i love my new cover for my mac air i like to take care of my electronics with quality covers this cover is definitely one to own it fits perfectly on the mac air laptop it is light to carry and the leather material ensures your laptop is protected from stains and such it also gives a very sophisticated look i would recommend this product without reservations
it 's a perfect fit and does what i expected it to do i was simply looking for a cover to make handling the laptop easier electronics tend to be slippery the small flap that closes the case is easy to fold under when using the computer i do n't really use the fold out piece on the bottom to prop it up i doubt it would be very sturdy
this case went beyond my expections i have no words to <unk> what you get when you purchase it but please do it looks and feel like real leather -lrb- no cheapie looking thing . i 've even gotten a compliment from an apple <unk> when i when in for one of my one to one sessions i even though of get getting another one just incase something was to happen to this one ; that 's how much i love this thing
looks and works great i love the stand and use it quite a bit even though i did n't really think i 'd use it at first i also like the way the case looks and feels , it 's like carrying around a small notebook i 'm a satisfied customer and definitely recommend this product
absolutely love that i got this cover it fits perfectly and the suede on the keyboard is nice against your palms : -rrb- . the only complaint would be the suede gets dirty but i 'm sure if i take it off and get some soap and water to clean it up , it will look like new do n't think it is real suede so it should be fine gotten a ton of
owned one before it got dirty where the heel of my hands sat due to working with it in a dirty area needed to replace it for cosmetic reasons only would order and buy again
purchased this cover because i noticed scratches <unk> on my macbook no more such worries from now on looks really good too quality wise its still holding up well # months after i got it customer service was excellent the first cover was lost in the mail when i emailed them about it , they sent another straight over with express post would buy from them again
i wanted to protect my mba but did n't know whether to buy a hard case or sleeve this padded case is comfortable to hold / carry and attaches perfectly - the magnetic clasp is very convenient i like not having to pull it out of a sleeve which would need to be stored somewhere - this is all-in-one i also like to use the pull out tab so it can be angled on a flat surface very attractive at a good price = great value it arrived quickly as a super saver order so i was really happy
i purchased this in a # for our son first so he would have protection while carrying his in school it was so nice my husband asked for one they both love it best cover for the younger set because of the way it holds the computer in it on both ends durable , good looking and most of all , functional
i buy a lot of stuff on amazon over the course of the last # years , i 've left # or # reviews before buying this product , i read the reviews some of them were so glowing i was a bit suspicious you may be as well do n't be when you get the cover and start using it , you 'll wonder how they can produce something that looks this good and works this well for under $ # i 'm a believer if you have a macbook air , buy it now ! ! !
even the apple store technician was impressed with it i had previously tried others but they did not do <unk> and some even kept falling off this is my second one , only because i used the computer so much <unk> got dirty i would highly recommend this <unk> the # & # # ; macbook air
case fits perfectly for my # & # # ; macbook air also love the fact that on the bottom of the case there is a little slide that allows you to prop up the laptop
i bought this for my husband to replace a speck case that could n't hold up to his constant travel he was n't sure based on the picture , but when it arrived we were both pleased clients are always commenting about the slick professional lines of the casecrown , quickly followed by asking where he purchased it he also likes the fact that it does n't look like a laptop when closed but a business folio would purchase again without hesitation
expecting it on the # th , but it came in today -lrb- friday the # th of january # -rrb- through usps the packaging was ok , item was in plastic product was so smooth to the touch , looks well-made -lrb- will update if begin to see any wear and tear -rrb- , and it looks professional i got this mainly so my hubby and i can share my macbook air , because i put a girly <unk> flower laptop sticker on the outside he feels awkward using it for his <unk> with clients , and i did n't want to get those clunky , plastic covers that you could still see through them i do n't mind the weight since my husband will use it more anyway with the air so far , it 's a good buy for the price and appearance , did n't burn a hole in my pocket
strongly recommended , fits perfect on the mac ! , not heavy and it does n't block the ports so you can use all of them without having to take it off you must have one !
the price is great and it does what it advertises , but it adds tremendous thickness to your air i think it might double the thickness of the machine so if your bag is sensitive to thickness , my metro bag was , then it would be something to consider if not , its great
i spend considerable time -lrb- ocd kicking in here -rrb- researching various cases for my macbook air # . # inch i stumbled across this case and read numerous reviews only to make the purchase myself result : # <unk> case is as advertised , fits great and the price is just right
i was blown away by the quality and feel of this case it is built extremely well and the quality of the faux leather does n't feel cheap at all most importantly , for the price , this is truly an amazing case i just bought a new mba and was searching for a leather portfolio like case . i found some that are extremely expensive , over $ # - $ # i kept searching and found this particular case from amazon based on the positive reviews from other buyers , i decided to take the plunge i am glad i did i also love the faux suede on the palm rest area no regret here .
just bought this for my new # inch macbook air the case is a perfect fit and it 's a steal for the price if you 're not worried about letting everyone know you have a mac , this case is for you the case gives the appearance that your carrying around a portfolio rather than a laptop
it really makes the macbook air feel more sturdy and less fragile , but not at the expense of weight it also looks really sleek ; the faux leather feels really nice and looks just as my only complaint is that it makes the jacks on both sides a bit hard to get to but it 's really the only flaw i can find great purchase , and received on time
this case is exactly as promised for under $ # dollars the quality and product itself is amazing i personally might return it because the macbook air is so beautiful that i want to show the computer and might buy a see-through transparent case however , if you want to protect your computer and take it to class or work at the office , this case looks extremely classy and elegant it looks like real leather and people constantly comment on how nice the case looks this is a # only improvement would be to design the latch a bit better , but you can not ask for better designs when willing to spend under $ # bucks if you want an even nicer case , look for $ # dollar cases this is an awesome case
this case looks great and protects my mac book with very little bulk the clasp is nice and keeps shut while in my bag or purse the cover is a decent quality and great for the cost
this was a perfect gift for a relative he always had the computer out in the open waiting for it to get damaged this is a good way for protecting it and a fashion / nice way to do so
love my case crown book cover for my macbook air it fits perfect and is of good quality i looked all over for a good cover to protect my investment and i found it with this cover i am very happy with my purchase
this case is great it provides great protection and extra cushioning for the macbook air i kept scratching mine before this the case adds a little bit more weight than a thinner case but i like how i can just throw it in a bag carelessly i know it will be okay great buy and great price
