i got this sleeve to protect my ul # a # . # `` laptop the goal was have a sleeve that would take the laptop and the peripherals , like mouse and power supply to that end this sleeve works great the laptop is a little squeeze , but fits well , and mouse and power supply fit in the front pockets everything is easily accessible , in and out , and i can just take the sleeve with its contents and throw it into a bag without worrying about it
i bought this for my # macbook pro # `` and it fits great , super snug , but great ! the build quality seems good and i like the design the pockets are great for my charger and usb , but a note if anyone takes it on an airplane nothing can be in the pockets when going through security even if the sleeve is outside of your bag built ny cargo <unk> # `` laptop sleeve -lrb- black
it looked really cool , but but the fit was really snug on my sony vaio s , which i liked but the zipper was touching my computer and i got worried about scratches i also wanted some kind of lining if you dont mind these things id recommend getting it
the sleeve works well i like the pockets i do wish it were better lined like the incase sleeve for my macbook that has a fuzzy lining that protects the laptop better than the built ny case otherwise a good buy
i bought this sleeve for my # -inch macbook pro , and it fits perfectly it 's snug , but comfortably so ; there 's a bit of extra space at the top but not on the sides , so it does n't slide around i 'm very happy with the sleeve so far
built has create the best laptop sleeve on earth with the cargo it is extremely lightweight yet offers good protection the pockets in front are superb for putting anything i slot my iphone and <unk> into it all the time all that , and top it off with a great and futuristic looking design , this is as close to a perfect sleeve as it gets even more amazing is built 's attention to detail and search for perfection i love how they covered the bottom of the zipper so that it will not scratch my macbook even when i hold it upside down
i bought the laptop sleeve as a gift my friend 's macbook fit perfectly into the sleeve -lrb- which actually stretches a little -rrb- he was also able to fit his mouse , power cord , and flashdrives in the exterior pockets excellent quality and is visually appealing
this laptop sleeve fits great on my # `` mac the zipper does not feel like it 's going to rip at all ! the pockets are awesome and i am very happy with this item ! ! very very <unk> ! !
the product is great the # pockets ahead are good for keeping a mouse and a headphone but not a charger fits my hp touch smart perfectly thanks for the previous reviews as they helped me buy this
i bought this for my netbook and love it i knew i did not want a bag , i mean the whole concept of a netbook is extreme portability , and a bag would be big and cumbersome for a # `` computer when i saw this , and noticed the brand -lrb- built ny , i have their # <unk> holders and the sleeve for my <unk> -rrb- i knew it was going to be a good product the pockets on the front hold the power cords , full size mouse , and whatever you want to put in the small one -lrb- i have my ear buds and a flashdrive in there -rrb- in the end , i am extremely happy with this sleeve and recommend it to anyone who asks
i shopped around quite a bit for a slim <unk> case for my hp ultrabook dm # z it is in between sizes of a netbook but smaller than most ultrabooks i settled for the built # `` sleeve it is actually probably a bit too large for the hp dm # z as there is some room at the top and on the sides so the notebook moves around a little however , it is well constructed and the extra space actually allows me to slide in my ipad as well in circumstances that require i have both devices overall , i am happy with the construction and feel but i would n't mind if my unit was a bit more snug in the case the holes on the exterior allow me to fit my power cord , though it does make the entire case quite a bit more bulky overall , very pleased and would recommend
overall good , but gets little dents in the foam-like material that make the case look <unk> it definitely does the job of protecting , but <unk> it can get damaged on the exterior
nice product fits my asus # `` laptop tightly . would recommend to any one who wants to put your laptop in a regular backpack . nice pockets for a mouse and <unk> i use this in my regular lap top case for extra protection
this is a great bag for the new macbooks as it is a snug fit , so no moving around , and the pockets stretch to fit just about anything i keep my battery and power cord in the pockets easily shipping was also fast , i ended up getting it a day early this is a great product ! highly suggest !
i ordered this built product -lrb- black with turquoise blue inserts -rrb- for my macbook pro # `` -lrb- purchased in december # -rrb- it fits my computer perfectly , along with the power cord and my cell phone i like the colors and the style the reason that i bought this was to stick my laptop in it - mostly for use around the house or when traveling short distances - to prevent scratches it works perfectly well for that i also plan to use it when traveling -lrb- putting it in my tote bag -rrb- but , i agree with other reviewers that it does not provide the same level of protection as a typical laptop bag , so if you are traveling a lot , i would recommend one of those instead this sleeve is not meant for `` hard wear and tear `` travelers
i just bought a new lenovo t # laptop , and i needed a sleeve to protect it while carrying it around in my backpack my backpack has a dedicated section for laptops , but it 's a lot bigger than my laptop is , and i also wanted to keep dust , hairs , nasties away at the same time the t # fits very nicely into the sleeve with just the right amount of tension keeping the sleeve on pulling it out is not a struggle and is quite easy the # pockets are quite useful i do n't have a mouse yet , but i stick my usb flash drive , headphones and occasionally my power adapter when i need to carry it around by itself obviously , it 's not a very good idea to stick a whole bunch of things in the pockets when you need it to be flat -lrb- like putting it into a laptop compartment in a bag -rrb- the construction is sturdy and the seams are all done well the neoprene thickness is about # mm it also looks cool
i ordered this because it has a place to keep your cord , ipod and other little accessories in the pockets and still remain slim it is a great solution for travel with your laptop it fits my dell inspiron # pretty well - the corners bulge out a tiny bit , but it is n't an eye sore or issue
this is a well made , thin , simple case for protecting my laptop . the pockets are nice , but i have n't really used them much ... i do like how they make the case look cooler :
this cover does n't fit as well as i wanted it too but it stays on and keeps my mac from getting any scratches i think they designed it for the older macbooks , and i have a # macbook pro so i can understand why there 's any issue with it fitting it comes in # pieces -lrb- top , bottom -rrb- the top one fits perfectly it 's the bottom one that has a bit of a problem
met my expectations i had one for a macbook # that i sold to buy the mb pro # not quite a perfect fit on all corners as another reviewer pointed out but is generally well made and secure -lrb- though i have n't taken it out much -rrb- i leave it on at home i like it
the cover fits well and makes you feel that your laptop is well protected it snapped on to my pre-unibody macbook pro perfectly it does add a little bulk to the computer but that 's what protects it so it 's expected it also makes the catch a little hard to open but again that 's what makes the cover seem sturdy but calling it a leather cover is <unk> misleading i had read the reviews and known it was `` leather effect `` but i would have been somewhat irritated if i had ordered this and expected leather there 's no leather on this cover saying that it does a good job and looks good
this case made my day when i saw it compliment my already gorgeous macbook pro only one con : it 's a little difficult to press the button to open the lid , but that i can deal with
this is the perfect laptop backpack if you have a # `` laptop it is large enough to hold my laptop , charger , and mouse with plenty of room to spare it securely holds the laptop in large pocket that would be right by your back , but there is plenty of padding both in the bag and on the straps despite the size and ability to hold all of that , it looks like a stylish backpack as opposed to a laptop bag
looked and looked and bought and sent back many a bag before i found a bag that would fit my over-sized # inch computer i love this bag and would highly recommend it it is very roomy there is enough room for plugs and extra plugs , earphones , a laptop cooling base and folders etc . the color is very urban and my students love it i am extremely satisfied ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
for price and functionality this bag ca n't be beat easy to use and more room than you can possibly imagine holds my # `` dell with no problem , plus notebooks and other accessories all for far less than other bags
love this bag like many of the other reviewers i had trouble finding a bag to fit my <unk> <unk> of a laptop -lrb- on my student budget -rrb- this is it people with more than enough room for my # `` laptop , power cord / brick , and books i think i could toss in a six pack too ! -lrb- making use of the handy opener -rrb- basically if you have a huge laptop and a little budget this is your bag :
i 've been using this close to an year now , and i use this daily to carry my <unk> # `` laptop to school , as well as carrying groceries in the weekend it has not failed me once , and it does n't seem like failing in the new future i have received a few comments on style too overall , it 's a fine backpack for a reasonable price
this pack was everything it advertised it has more room than i need right now but as i add features to my laptop it 's nice to know it will all fit in one bag i have a # `` hp pavillion and it 's a pretty big laptop it <unk> fits in the assigned slot in the bag i also store a platform type fan cooler , the power cords and cordless mouse with room to spare i do n't get the bottle opener but everyone notices it and it sure is a conversation starter this bag is well constructed with heavy duty materials i do n't anticipate having to purchase another for a long time
this is a great backpack for a great price some of the reviewers complained that the bag was too large it is very big i must remember that whatever i put in there i have to haul however , this is the first backpack i 've owned that will fit my school books and my laptop another reviewer complained the laptop compartment was too big for his or her # `` laptop my # `` fits snugly and i imagine that with the elastic strap that holds it in place i could fit a <unk> larger laptop in there as well in short , this bag is cheap , sturdy , comfortable and holds a lot
i am very happy with this backpack the color is great i have to lug around a lot of materials , and this backpack is perfect for it the straps are very sturdy and do n't cut into my shoulders it is very comfortable to wear
this bag it awesome it was bigger than expected , but considering it 's for a # `` <unk> , that is normal i love the pattern and how durable it has been so far does n't hurt my back either , even when i have a lot of stuff crammed into it
i got this bag to take my laptop with me to mexico it worked fine , was n't too bulky like the other 's that encourage you to load up with tons of pockets but it torn through airport security when i used it for clothes only on other trips the latch also broke when i pushed down hard to lock it tight after filling it with clothes it 's good for simple stuff though , here and there , in no extreme conditions
i really like my bag it is the perfect size for my laptop with a separate compartment for my plug and other larger items it has a zipped pocket for little things and fits my needs quite well i 've had other messenger bags that were bulky and heavy and this one is neither of those things the only downfall -lrb- and why i gave it # stars not # -rrb- is that it does n't have a handle on the top no handle makes it hard to grab it , since you have to grab the long strap and it 's awkward overall highly recommended
the canvas bag is exactly that , a really big bag it fits my # in laptop and may even fit a bigger one the bottle opener is kinda big and a bit difficult to use if you are looking for a `` cute `` bag , this is not it the big is huge everyone constantly tells me of how big it is
i love this bag i have a very large and heavy # `` laptop and this bag is perfect for it it also fits all the gym clothes for my daughter and me i love the fact that it does n't look like a laptop bag at all
this backpack is the answer to my travel packing <unk> it safely holds your laptop with enough extra room to pack for a weekend away or at least for all the stuff you do n't want to store in your checked luggage if traveling by air , just do a trial run on pulling your laptop out for security to make sure you still have easy access to it after packing very comfortable to wear & leaves your hands free
this bag is pretty huge and great for toting around a laptop and a few other random things i know this bag is big because i 'm relatively short and i always get comments such as `` thats a big bag `` great bag to carry around my # `` display laptop and school books and notebooks
i really , really like this backpack i bought it for my # `` laptop , and it fits perfectly the laptop sits in a padded sleeve inside the backpack , and the sleeve is secured with an elastic velcro tab there are more than enough zippered pockets to fit all my portable drives , mouse and power cord it looks nice , and is n't at all bulky the only odd thing , as others have said , is the bottle opener in one of the front pockets a little strange , but it does n't bother anything
i have had this bag for about # months now and everything has held up fine except the strap in the front which secures the front flap it ripped after only a few months and was always really difficult to put back through the metalic slot if this one aspect of the design would of been more well thought out it would of been a great bag , but dealing with the broken strap every time you want to open and close it is really annoying
the bag is great there 's plenty of pockets and i 've gotten more than a few compliments on the look of it i just have one question why in the world did the designers put that stupid strap buckle on this bag that is the absolute worse buckle device i 've ever seen i can get it to work okay when the bag is <unk> , but how useful is that i never use buckle and thank god they put velcro on flap short story , it 's a great bag that has a `` form over function `` clasp
this is a sweet looking bag , much better in person than the picture can really do justice the problem in my mind is the black strap on the front what is difficult to tell in the picture is that the outer flap has a metal rectangular opening that slides over a metal buckle through that buckle you need to slide the black strap you see on the front of the bag the problem is the buckle is a good # `` wide or more and the strap is just thick enough that this takes some serious wrestling to get through if the strap had a tapered end i think this would not be a problem , but squared off is difficult to get through that buckle easily other than that , the bag is very nice plenty of pockets for misc . stuff to carry with your laptop just that one minor flaw that makes the bag a bit difficult to properly close
this is a little larger than i expected , but the messenger flap makes it easy to find items buried in the bottom , -lrb- unlike the backpacks i usually travel with . the fabric is just a tad more `` distressed `` than the photo depicts , but i can live with it
i just opened the box and my first reaction was they sent me the wrong color i can only report on the <unk> really is closer to an olive drab color so , if you like the lighter green in the picture this is n't the color for you however , i am happy with the bag overall
i needed a new laptop bag to replace the one that came with my lappy ... which had `` pc laptops `` printed across it i wanted something a bit more discreet , not corporate looking , and casual with more storage this bag hits all points easily i was originally a bit weary of the green color , but i 'm happy to report that the green bag is n't as vibrant as it looks in the picture , it 's really more of an olive drab oh , and i 'm especially fond of the closure and the bottle opener
this is a great bag and lived up to everything i was expecting if i could do one thing to the bag it would be make the shoulder strap more comfortable but i 'm sure i could do something to make it better
bag looks cool with an interesting design my buddies make fun of me , saying that i am carrying a purse i have to explain that it 's a messenger bag , like the one indiana jones carries i 've had the bag years now and carried a few different laptops in it hold what i need it to , what more do you want
i love this bag i have a studio # laptop which is too wide for normal # `` laptop bags -lrb- as i unfortunately found out -rrb- this bag holds my laptop , all the components i need , some books and extras also i love the olive drab coloring and the canvas it is lightweight but sturdy and i love the look the front clasp is a bit frustrating to get just right if you want it completely shut , however , the velcro at that location holds the front shut well on its own
this bag is excellent -- it has a very attractive design and it 's a strong yet lightweight in construction great in its distribution of weight safe closure system the price here on amazon is excellent -- it was $ # + dollars on every other site i found it on it holds my laptop , accessories , and textbooks with ease my only qualm is the lack of the handle on the top -- it is slightly inconvenient , but not enough of an inconvenience for me to <unk> the purchase of this in any way
this is the best bag i have tried different brief cases -lrb- carry and rolling -rrb- and i just could n't find something that let me fit everything i need to carry this bag does ! ! many pockets allow for carrying smaller items without them flying all over the inside of the bag great for carrying my laptop , cords , mouse , and the many other things i tote back and forth to school each day some reviewers did not like the metal clasp -- said it was too hard to insert the strap i disagree -- i 've found it very easy to use
the bag is trendy and stylish with plenty of pockets to accommodate anything you could ever want to put in it the bag also feature a padded section for your trusty laptop keeping it safe from harm
it works and it covers most keys , but it tends to shift and i was hoping it extended all the way to the bottom of the white plastic because of the chipping problem with my laptop ... but it works
i like the macbook silicone keyboard cover it is slightly off in covering the function keys , but that is not a big problem it has a spongy feel to the touch , and is nice against the finger tips when typing not to mention , a great price
i bought this bag to replace my maxpedition man purse -lrb- <unk> -rrb- the outside pockets -lrb- front/back -rrb- have sleeves in them that are the perfect size for my # `` macbook air and/or my ipad this leaves the entire large middle compartment open for <unk> , text books , binders , lunch , whatever you may need to carry around i 've been using it as a hybrid <unk> bag with the inclusion of a smaller bag to hold my <unk> this will be the perfect solution to my everyday <unk> needs the quality of the materials is spot-on ; i think the shoulder strap is cool because it could be removed and used as a <unk> sling should the need arise high quality bag , but the price is too high for something made overseas i did save about $ # buying this `` used `` through the marketplace , but it still had the tags attached , wrapped in the plastic bag and had no signs of wear or use i 'd suggest going that route if it 's available
maxpedition bags take some <unk> at first , the material is very stiff and some pockets may be difficult to use this is a good thing - they are built to last my only -lrb- minor -rrb- beef with this particular one is a shortage of molle loops it would be nice to be able to strap on an extra small pouch or two the only loops are on top of the main compartment , sort of under the handle , limiting what you can attach
my wife and i have several maxpedition products however , i have one complaint it seems that they have started cutting some corners most particularly in the shoulder strap it is much thinner and less comfortable than my previous bags it works great though i use it as a & # # ; media bag & # # ; mainly netbook or tablet , magazines , writing journal , magazines , etc . whenever taking a trip
i own many maxpedition products this addition is no different in quality and workmanship the nylon is a little tough on clothing if you wear it next to your body for an extended amount of time it is not a soft <unk> # nylon it is a little tougher with that said , if you are lugging around a laptop however , the padding is top quality and i highly recommend it for just that purpose
the mpb multi-purpose bag from maxpedition exceeded my expectations all around love the feel and the way it carries . # . # laptop , plus all other gear that i used to carry in a smaller bag and a whole bunch of new gear it can handle way more than i can actually carry , either way , love it
i love this bag i like the way it opens and how it stands up straight i wish i would have bought it a long time ago . this bag is perfect <unk> airline travel . it is the perfect size
the nylon stitching is <unk> to the case on the inside , creating hard tiny pieces that scratched the top of my beloved laptop i liked the <unk> , however , seems to defeat the purpose of the item if it is being damaged while in the case also , the ad and the box says that it is reversible , however it is absolutely not reversible i returned it , save yourself the trouble , do n't buy it case logic <unk> # -inch reversible neoprene <unk> sleeve -lrb- green
i bought this case for my macbook air ; the case fits very well however , i did n't realize that the ends -lrb- # + of them -rrb- of the embroidered thread are glued to the case the hardened glue are rough and could scratch the computer , defeating the purpose of using a case to protect the computer
i wanted to get the incase zip case , but this one was cheaper i wish i just got the incase and spent a little more money it works great with my mac , but gets a little stretched out
just received this for a macbook -lrb- not pro , regular -rrb- and it fits great seems like it would protect it without scratching the case while i think the <unk> outside cover is stylish i would have liked a different overall color while i 'm not a huge fan of the <unk> the reverse color is even less attractive . despite this , i think it 's a good solid fit and does what i bought it to do
i use this case on a regular basis and love it easy to slide the computer in and out and works as excellent protection from scratching love that it has no zippers or anything on it that will rub against my mac and scratch it i purchased this for my macbook pro and it fits like a glove
# macbook sleeve by case logic is a great product i believe i got a good value for my dollar : good aesthetics , a tight fit on my macbook , and good durability the sleeve fits well on my computer , providing extra cushion and protection within my work bag i shopped extensively before buying the case logic sleeve , reviewing similar products from a number of different manufacturers as long as you do n't mind the envelope style encasement -lrb- as opposed to zipper access -rrb- , this sleeve will serve you well
i spent some time doing research on a soft case for my new # . # macbook after i found out that soft cases with zipper tend to scratch the surface , i went on to look for a zipperless soft case and from there it 's just a matter of price and design i bought this from amazon because the price was <unk> and it is about double if you buy it from the official case logic site the protection could not be any better , it fits my macbook perfectly without the hassle of the zipper scratching it there are other designs out there to suit your taste but if you love your macbook , definitely go zipperless
i used my macbook sleeve to travel with and it was great it protected ny mac without me having to carry a bulky computer case i put it in my travel bag it 's also attractive
i have a # inch widescreen dell xps and it fits very tightly into the padded section you have to work it in maybe it will stretch out but otherwise i love the bag and fact that it is gray & pink
i love this bag i struggled for weeks to find a messenger bag for my new -lrb- pink -rrb- dell studio # i was impressed to find out that there is a lot of room for books , paperwork , cables , power cord , etc . even with the laptop in the bag the laptop sleeve within the bag was a tight fit for my # `` dell at first , but now fits like a glove the shoulder strap is padded and does n't twist like some others i have had the bag has great interior front pockets and the back has a zipper pocket that goes the entire width of the bag it is perfect for shoving magazine , mail , etc . in without having to open the rest of the bag my technology friend was even impressed with the amount of padding for the protection of the laptop itself
this bag fits my wife 's laptop and is functional with all its pockets when carrying it , the strap is sturdy and well designed throughout my wife is very pleased which in turn makes me pleased
i bought this to replace a heavy , company issued laptop bag it is much lighter , roomier , and has a more comfortable strap - everything i was looking for the color is pretty close to advertised , my # . # -inch widescreen fits perfectly , and there are a good amount of extra pockets to keep accessories and supplies organized there is not a lot of protective padding , but if lightweight is what you 're looking for , this is a great bag for the price
i am very happy with this bag however within a month or two it had a series of issues the velcro began becoming unstitched , the clip broke , little things but important finally the metal that holds the strap broke although i carry quite a few items it was nothing that should have broken the strap in just a few months this is a nice bag but maybe not super durable i would n't still have it today unless amazon was <unk> about replacing my damaged it hope the info helps
the interior laptop sleeve fits my # . # `` macbook comfortably the other interior pocket is large enough to fit several large books the two external pockets are a bit awkward -- too narrow and deep to be of much use -- but overall , i am pleased with the bag
i purchased this bag to carry my # `` macbook pro very nice , durable material laptop fit perfectly i was also able to carry quite a few cds , flash drives , a couple books , my cell phone and other items great value , awesome bag
people keep asking me where i got this bag , as it 's perfect i like that it 's not too stuffy <unk> , but not so funky as to be off-putting to potential clients i had planned to <unk> it but like it plain , and it 's durable and washable and has all the right pockets and suits my needs perfectly
i really like this bag it fits my # . # in laptop perfectly and has plenty of room for other items i love that you 're able to draw on it and give it your own personal style the only thing that i might like to be different is the padding there could stand to be a bit more in the laptop compartment but it really does n't detract enough from the bag to make me like it any less it 's really a great buy , i 'm glad i found it
first of all , this product is way overpriced for just a burlap sack i was expecting a much more durable product than this but , i thought it was cute for my macbook and i just needed something to protect it when i went on vacation as soon as i got it , i put my white laptop in it it did fit perfectly and i was satisfied then i took it out and to my horror i had brown fuzzy things from the lining all over my brand new computer it was all in the ports and everything , and i only had it in there for a minute i even took a lint brush over it to get rid of the fuzzies to no avail i will never use it again and i wasted too much cash on it do n't buy it unless you want to clean off your laptop every time you take it out
i had the same lint problem that another reviewer experienced the sleeve is very cute and offers a moderate amount of protection , but the lint is awful i turned the sleeve inside out , washed on delicate and then used the `` air dry `` setting on my dryer in an attempt to get the lint out this strategy cut the lint down significantly , but i still get fuzzies on the computer and -- what 's more troublesome -- in the ports every time i use this sleeve
i love my applesac and have gotten lots of compliments about it i especially love the pocket in the front it 's great for carrying cd 's and my charger my only complaint is that these things do n't hold up my first one shredded after normal use -lrb- i carry it in a backpack or in my arms -rrb- in about # months i returned the case to applesac and they sent me a new one -- free of charge i was more than pleased with their good service , but now my second one is falling to pieces i think it 's time to find a case that will last longer than a year also , do n't get this if you want something that will protect your laptop from any impact i learned that the hard way
i love my applesac i got the red one and everywhere i take it , people ask me about it ... where they can get one , etc . it is so handy it protects my mac and it is fun
i like this product because it stretches and holds my laptop nicely only problem is that my plug fell out of the external pocket it would be nice if there was some velcro to insure everything stayed in - then i would give it # stars
the case fits my # . # inch toshiba laptop very well definitely thick enough to prevent scratches and bumping i ordered fiery orange , but it definitely looks red to me overall a good purchase
it 's stretchy and flexible just like every built product ; the zippers never fail me and the exterior pockets are an awesome , well-designed feature of the sleeve i store my phone , charger , and pen in them when at meetings plus the case looks really cool
thought the color would be too bright , but i think it 's a perfect contrast if most of your stuff are neutral colored <unk> , the pockets work for me
i purchased this for my wife to carry her macbook air # `` to and from work with all her work essentials she is an elementary teacher , and needs to take junk to work all the time a purse does n't cut it all by itself the backpack looked really nice the first day we opened it however , now , after a few months of use it looks pretty bad the fabric frays pretty easily , and the zippers do not hold up it is hard to zip the compartments closed , because the zippers are low quality
positives : professional looking and holds my laptop , billfold , etc . works much better than my old side shoulder laptop bag that was killing my shoulder i regularly walk and ride the bus to work so i needed a comfortable yet professional looking backpack i would like it if it came in a slightly smaller size
i 'm back at college and wanted a backpack that did n't look too `` young `` and would protect my laptop most laptop bags are somewhat <unk> and i did n't want one of those this bag is perfect it 's professional yet cute , and keeps my macbook safe it has lots of little pockets for supplies i keep my laptop cooler , power cords , kindle , iphone , keys , and writing utensils very comfortably i do n't have my books for the semester yet , so i ca n't answer as to how well they do or do not fit it seems ; however , that i will be able to very easily put at least a few notebooks in there , but highly unlikely that textbooks will fit
i travel for work this pack has plenty of room for my stuff i can wear it on my back and still fit down a narrow airplane isle without <unk> the other <unk> it feels good and looks great
bought this for my daughter as she is going back to college she loved it and i bought this brand because i have another backpack from mobileedge and i 've returned it # times and they replaced it
the case itself is very handy and well designed , with a convenient pocket for a power adapter and usb stick , which is invaluable for carrying around the macbook as a previous reviewer mentioned , the zipper is located such that the power cord can be plugged in while the laptop is in the case however this also means that it 's on the bottom edge , where it will press against the computer if put in a backpack i set the backpack , with the computer in it , on a hard surface , and the zipper created a sizeable dent -lrb- about # mm long -rrb- in the corner of my unibody macbook pro warning : always put the zipper side up in a bag , or else this might happen to you since this is the only neoprene sleeve with the pocket , i attached a piece of cloth behind the zipper so that this never happens again
this case is decent quality and very well fitted for an aluminum macbook previously i owned an incase brand sleeve for my powerbook , and the incase sleeve is much more padded than this sleeve however this sleeve has a power supply pocket which is why i decided to try it also the zipper is more of a dark <unk> color rather than the purple color shown in picture which is a plus for me anyways
nice fit and decent quality material it was definitely worth the price upon comparison lost one star because of no carrying handles and one star for small pouch on the outside it could have been a bit bigger it was a tight fit for the power supply , cord and a wireless mouse yes , i have a mouse , have you used the built in mouse it is not nice but , works very well nicely padded , and easily fits my gateway # . # good fit and good quality
this case is exactly what i expected it to be zipper compartment is nice , but not great for accomodating power cord more useful for disks or zip drive perfect for a # in
recently i purchased the new macbook pro # inch and got a few scratches on it about time to buy a case for it so i can keep it in <unk> condition this little case looked like pretty good <unk> for that price i went ahead and bought it and have been using it since it is really good quality except it was n't as snug as i thought it would be no big deal , as long as it does its job the little pouch it has is very convenient as long as there is n't anything bulky in there perfect for an ipod touch and a usb flash drive ever since i got the case , there has n't been a single scratch added to the beautiful design on the macbook ca n't take it anywhere without knowing it is safe inside this case
i bought this case for my new # . # inch aluminum macbook the case fits it like a glove the front pocket is a nice touch for convenience it can fit the charger but i never put it in there because it sticks out too much i bought the incase originally and returned it for the caselogic the caselogic is a better value versus the $ # incase
it 's well made , and it fits my aluminum unibody laptop well it has a pocket which fits the power adapter well i only wish there was two loops and a strap so i could hang it over my shoulder , but i do n't think it was meant to carry on a strap it 's more like a sleeve to put into my backpack and not scratch my laptop good product , and i think it 's worth the price
like the title says , this is a sweet case for the # inch <unk> -lrb- metal macbook -rrb- nice lining inside is kind to the finish , nice zippers and overall durability would definitely buy again
i have a # `` macbook pro <unk> `` incase `` -lrb- from the apple store -rrb- cover on it to protect the aluminum this is a home computer so this sleeve is only used when we travel , which is at the most once a month that being said , the cover is soft and just thick enough the zipper pulls some from the fabric if i have the big wall charger in the front pocket -lrb- which does fit -rrb- and the macbook -lrb- w / the incase -rrb- in it and have it all zipped up i was worried i would n't even be able to zip it closed ; but it does close , pretty easily so for the price , if it eventually does rip , i wont loose sleep over it does the job , has a nice accessory pocket and a good price
this fits the # `` white or black macbook perfectly the interior is very soft the zipper is positioned so that you can open it slightly and plug in the power the small pocket will hold the power supply -lrb- with the small plug -rrb- and a mouse you can put the case through an airport scanner without taking out the computer this is a very well made case
this case is a good choice for the # . # `` white macbook it fits really snug - hardly any space left free if you put the charger in the side pocket , the pocket does bulge a bit - not sure if this can cause the pocket to stretch and hang out in the long term quality of outer material is very high -lrb- better than the incase product -rrb- - feels like a wet suit the zippers are cased in high quality rubber the inside is not fleece , but a soft synthetic material
i love this product i can take my laptop anywhere knowing that it is well protected i like that i can fit my charger and usb cords in the side pocket as well fits snugly for my new macbook # inch
