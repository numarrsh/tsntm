i like the bag , using it for # months now , hold my laptop , books wallet , what not and cute . . only there are no zipped pockets besides the laptop section . # <unk> pockets . . but come on , one must n't be too <unk> ; -rrb- too good for the
this bag is perfect for me i carry it everyday to the office it holds my ipad and a small purse i travel for business and it is great for my laptop sturdy , comfortable on my shoulder , lightweight to lug through airports
we bought and used this tote bag on a vacation trip that involved a change of planes and a week with a rental car and driving around it worked great and was <unk> to carry
this bag has a built-in sleeve to the bag and protects well only hoped if there was an option to remove the sleeve fits two large a # binding folder too
this tote bag was everything as described i purchased it for my macbook and it fit like a glove with lots of additional storage the fabric allows you to carry over the shoulder comfortably i would recommend this to anyone looking for a lightweight protective bag
i finally found the bag to carry my laptop and everything else for work the bag looks great , the material is super durable , washable and maintains its shape no matter how rough i am with the bag i love it !
i was looking for a bag that was light and did n't add much weight when items where placed inside the bag and this one was perfect i wish they had more style options available - i already have the polka dot version as well i highly recommend this
this laptop bag replaced a previous bag i had for # years i believe this bag will go beyond that length of time i carry # notebooks , files plus more prior reviews stated the laptop compartment as snug , but it is not i was hesitant about purchasing the black since i prefer feminine colors but given the inside is neon pink , it was a great contrast to the black this bag is durable and looks great
i love that this fits my hd # inch laptop - and that my laptop has its own middle pocket i can carry my paperwork and files all together i definitely need to invest in the cable pouch since my power cables are a floating mess on the bottom of the bag <unk> fishing <unk> out i wish it was n't so hot pink but it 's a bright surprise highly recommend to anyone looking : do it buy this bag it fits your life ... promise
after ordering my first laptop , i ordered this bag what a good decision that was it 's really durable and big i knew i was going to need a lot of space - this bag is big enough for me to carry around my # . # `` laptop , a textbook , a notebook , and a few folders wonderful for students it looks pretty cute too it 's heavy duty but has a soft fabric , so it 's comfortable to carry -lrb- wo n't dig into my skin or make marks -rrb- this is a very , very good choice
the colors and design of this bag are perfection it 's so comfortable to hold in your hands or on your shoulder i love that there is a central sleeve for my laptop , as wells as a little room on each side to place a slim folder or two , a book , the power cord , etc . i get compliments on this all the time , and am very pleased
this is like carrying a <unk> for my computer it improves my attitude about work it 's beautiful it 's light it fits lots of companion gear and papers the internal zip pouch protects my computer and is easy to unpack at airport security
my work provided a boring , heavy laptop in a boring , black , <unk> laptop bag that was big and cumbersome to carry so , i ordered this laptop tote bag and problem solved -lrb- well , mostly , i 'm still stuck w / the boring , heavy laptop -rrb- this bag is very functional - protects well the laptop , has pockets for additional stuff -lrb- mouse , charger -rrb- , it has enough space to carry files , and the material itself is nice and squishy i can carry my heavy laptop as a purse and it does n't feel as heavy the dots are fun and a little <unk>
this bag is great my laptop stays nicely zipped up in the middle compartment and there are separate compartments on each side of that to carry other things i need for my laptop and even a couple of my favorite dvds love the stretchy material and how well it is put together i was also pleasantly surprised to find that there are # smaller pockets inside that hold my jump drive , mouse , etc , and they close with snaps i can bet i will have this bag for a long , long time i also have a couple of other items from built ny made of this same material and love them just as much
this bag is awesome although it does n't snap or zip close , as it 's worn on the shoulder , it does want to seal closed by itself there are two pockets on the inside that snap closed , perfect for any electronic devices or smaller items best thing about this bag it stretches to accommodate whatever you put in it
too bulky to carry with purse or briefcase the pocket on the front pretty much useless as it does n't open wide enough to use having said that , it works great if all you want is your ipad with you
love the look , feel , and utility of this sleeve -lrb- fits the mba # perfectly -rrb- , but the accessory pocket for stashing the ac adapter is far too thin recommendations : do not wrap the cable around the hooks on your apple charger , instead , loosely coil the cord and this will give you an extra mm of space when in the sleeve with the mba but even as such , the <unk> should build an extra # & # # ; of lateral give in the outside pocket for space if that were the case , this would be a # -star product i would recommend this sleeve , just with the caveat that everything will be a very tight fit
this bag perfectly fits the macbook air # & # # ; it 's sleek and sexy i had to knock off a star because the pockets are too tight to carry the power adapter the front pocket is very tight and i feel like it 's pressing the adapter into the laptop the back open pocket bulges uncomfortably if you put it in there since i have an edc bag i carry anyway that 's not a huge problem , but it 's less than ideal if the front pocket expanded a bit that would be magnificent
great size , well made , exactly as described if you are wondering what can fit in the pocket , do n't count on your charger fitting , unless you purchase an aftermarket slim charger from <unk> systems on amazon like i did ! ! anything about an inch or so thick will
this is a fantastic bag for the macbook air # `` very compact and trim -lrb- and well built in that respect -rrb- , but with enough extra capacity in the outside pockets to carry a bit extra and/or the power adapter in other words , you can fit just enough in with this bag alone to go work at a coffee shop or library carrying strap is very high quality with fully rotating attachments -lrb- so the strap does n't get twisted -rrb- and very clever spring-loaded clips the strap hardware remains with the strap , so , if you are like me and do n't use the carrying strap , the bag itself is not <unk> down with annoying hardware and clips and so forth given how many crazy expensive bags and sleeves are out there -lrb- like , in the $ # range -rrb- , this stm bag is a crazy deal in the $ # range the only negative i can think of here : my bag has a bit of a chemical odor that has n't gone away as quickly as i 'd like but that might just my particular one
this thing is quality ... stm makes some great bags ... i use this to protect my macbook air that is held within my # . # messenger bag and it is great this will last a long
i really dig this sleeve it 's a little more that i wanted to pay but , i 'm glad i spent the money my macbook air # inch fits nice and snug very nicely padded shipping was timely i will buy
sleeve ... smells bad and is lumpy and hard to zip you ca n't really buy something like this on the internet i 'm amazed # other people are so pleased with theirs ... its definitely a lemon for us and so , my wife is sending me to the apple store to get one that is acceptable
the case itself is great i love the front pockets for charger , cable , phone etc . , and the inside <unk> that protects the top of your laptop from zipper scratches , but the color looks nothing like i expected i wanted something bright and funky and this is more <unk> 's old <unk> <unk> - think the old <unk> <unk> <unk> so i might exchange for pink ? ? - not sure if i 'm really a pink person , but i love those pockets ! ... we 'll
the product looks different from the picture online -lrb- <unk> so -rrb- the quality from inside is ok but the color is almost the same i do like the pockets outside and the flap inside for extra protection con - they could have done a better job with the zipper overall , not bad for $ # or so that i spent on it
first time amazon reviewer i just want to say that i like amazon and its wonder for buying things a little bit cheaper . . and the wait time was n't bad at all for this product . i would have paid # . # dollars easy for this bag across the street i have to say it looks sleek , enough space for storage for a macbook pro with a cover ... and you have pockets to store a few small items with you on the go i do like the grey color but should have opted for a brighter / fun color like green or blue but its cool buy this product if you need a cover that doesnt cost too much and works
this is a good sleeve , but a little big for the # -inch macbook air because the laptop is so thin the outer pockets are really only good for thin items -lrb- headphones , usb drive , etc . . needless to say , i ca n't carry my charger in the sleeve , but it 's not such a big deal for me the quality of the sleeve is really good and you ca n't beat the price
i love this item it looks exactly like in the picture and my macbook air -lrb- # new model -rrb- fits beautifully in it , it 's a little on the roomy side but it has an inner lip that holds it in safely i do n't give it # stars because the outside pockets make it bulky if you actually use them
in my mission to fully protect my macbook , i researched dozens of different sleeves at various prices i finally decided that this one was a good blend of function , price , and fashion i agree with the review that it has a strong chemical smell out of the package , but like any scent , i 'm sure that will eventually fade i like the snug fit and extra padding the inside flap makes me feel like my mac is secure the front pockets are convenient for my charger and phone , but of course , the charger will cause it to bulge out quite a bit that 's fine with me as i slide it all into a computer bag when i transport it , anyway , so that i can throw it over my shoulder with a # year old , # month old , and huge diaper bag , it 's not really convenient to have to hold something like a computer in my arms for the money , i 'm happy with my purchase
i purchased this iluv case to replace my worn out incase neoprene one i was hesitant because my incase sleeve had worn out badly - peeling off all along the edges , making a mess but i took a chance with the iluv neoprene case because it has a sturdy border along the edges it also is very cute with the floral pink design it fits my # inch macbook pro perfectly it has a soft protective inside with reinforced neoprene all along the edges there is a protective fold between the zipper & the computer there are two outside pockets that could hold pens , flash drives , maybe a mini mouse or small accessories but the pockets are too small to hold a computer power cord all in all , i am very pleased with the purchase & highly recommend it as a laptop sleeve
i think this is a really practical product , because you are able to carry your charger in the sleeve i loved the color , and it fits perfectly my # `` macbookpro
this is a great case -- to protect from scratches ... do n't know if it will do much if dropped on the floor but , it provides a little cushion i love the pink floral one i ordered , though the smell is very strong i set it outside for half a day , and the smell is still strong it wraps around my new macbook pro perfectly and has a double inside flap to protect from the zipper for the price , i am happy
i like this laptop sleeve , it fits my macbook with an incase case on it very snuggly i wish the outside pockets had zippers but i think because of the material it 's made of nothing will fall out i really like the fact that it has an inside lip to protect the laptop from the zipper i 'm very happy with this purchase
the case is adorable the pockets are fantastic it 's very bright though ... much brighter then it appears on the computer however , it stinks has this strange chemical smell to it i guess a little febreeze may help i thought if i just let it sit out in the air the smell would go away but # weeks later and it 's still there
fits the # in macbook pro like a glove highly protective on the inside with soft neoprene , this thick sleeve will save a macbook from small falls or scratches while it 's being <unk> there is even a sleeve inside to keep the macbook from the zipper great value ! iluv it
i have searched and searched for the perfect sleeve for my # -inch macbook pro i was looking for something a little less boring that basic black i also wanted to make sure my macbook fit even if it had a hard cover shell case on it this one is perfect it fits just right , no wiggle room yet easy to insert and remove there is a zipper cover/protector inside as well i bought the orange hard cover shell to go with it that 's protection with personality sleek design , excellent packaging , and fast shipping i could n't be more pleased
very satisfied with this laptop sleeve fits my # `` macbook pro like a glove and i love the floral design the pockets also come in handy to place headphones or other small items , but nothing too big well made , would highly recommend
fits like a glove for my laptop the pockets in the front are great for small accessories like headphones , ipod , etc . i 've had it for # + years and love it
i actually purchased this sleeve for my ipad after i put the new apple <unk> on it and it would no longer fit in my iluv sleeve made for the ipad , which i love so i was thrilled when i found this one that is slightly larger it arrived promptly , and i was pleasantly surprised when i opened the box the color on this one is even prettier than the ipad version ; the interior is lovely and soft to protect the device , and i love the lip inside that holds it in place the pockets are really nice - i use the small one for my microfiber cloth and stylus , and the large one for the charging plug and cord perfect fit , and easy to access this is a superb protective bag for any tablet or small laptop i never have to worry about my device in my backpack because it 's cushioned and safe from scratches love this !
i ordered this sleeve and when i received it , i notice that some teeth on the nylon zipper where crooked or missing i returned it -lrb- great service from amazon -rrb- and received the new one within # days it fits perfectly , well padded and has an overlap to prevent the zipper from scratching your computer both pockets are big enough to put your charger , plug-ins or usb device it easily slips into your travel bag or briefcase i have searched and read about different sleeve and this one is ideal
this laptop sleeve is very stylish and keeps your macbook save i have a skin on the laptop as well and it still fits in the sleeve , a little tight but still zips the bonus pockets on the outside of the sleeve are great !
i love my new sleeve the floral pink is a little <unk> , but it is still a great color it is true that the zipper can be hard to use , therefore i would not recommend it to some one who is <unk> or who is weak other than that , it is great i agree , it does have a `` smell `` -lrb- like something new -rrb- when you first receive it , but it goes away after awhile also , i do n't see it protecting my computer if i dropped it besides that , i love it it 's great that it 's water proof and has pockets on the outside i will be using it to carry around and to throw in bags i would recommend this product to any one looking to protect their mac from scratches and rain
i simply love this case , i have one of the # tb wd external hard drives and it fits perfectly in the big pouch and the cable in the other it closes good to keep sand and <unk> computer destroying dust <unk> out it also has a hard backing so it is n't one of those floppy crap <unk> you can get for twice as much money
i bought this case for my # inch mac book pro i love this case it fits perfect and has an extra protective layer so the zip does not scratch the case the two outside pockets fits my iphone perfectly and then pens and other little stuff for school i love this case and would definitely
i care a lot about my laptop and with that bag i do n't have to worry if i drop my comp on the floor because its inside has a major comfort pad
this case is not only cute , but works well in cushioning my laptop in my back pack i like how there are a couple pockets , but the larger one is n't quite big enough for the charger unless you really force it perhaps better for a hard drive . love the case and people often say it 's pretty :
everything was perfect when i got it . arrived on time . color was just like it is in the picture . fits mac pro # inch perfect even with a hard cover case on it : -rrb- love it <unk>
this sleeve is too small for a # `` macbook pro you can squeeze the laptop in , but there is no way you can zip it up amazon , please take `` for # -inch macbook pro `` off the description for this product
after trying to buy a couple different sleeves i found this one online and bought it it fits perfect i really enjoy the pockets on the front as well , however they do n't fit the charger well , and did get a little stretched out from my mouse other than that iluv it ;
i bought this case a few days ago for my # inch laptop though my laptop is a bit smaller it still fits quite snug due the slip inside the case which prevents it moving around there is also a suede type lining inside the sleeve that prevents light scratching of the laptop all in all the case seems to be very well made and also functional with two pockets on the outside of the <unk> you have a # inch laptop it would be a prefect
perfect fit for my needs -lrb- occasional photographer - everyday business bag fit and finish is great , strong straps , all functions of bag are working well if i had to find something to complain about , the small pockets where the pens and cell phones slip into place are a bit thin and seem to let things move around a bit to much for my taste overall , this bag is great very pleased , after an <unk> search different colors , and better pockets would have scored # stars
i 've got this bag # + years ago and it is my everyday bag since then main requirement when buying was the ability to carry the unibody macbook pro # & # # ; , nikon d # and <unk> dx # lens , and it fits perfectly for this set it is great for day-to-day usage , and its removable shuttle makes it really special recently i 've been to the local photo gear shop looking for the possible future replacement for this bag , and the guy has admitted that there was no other model on the market with such a functionality it is very convenient and durable overall , and my only concern is that the shoulder pad has got completely cracked over the time i 'm going to contact the manufacturer , if i can buy the spare one somewhere -lrb- sincerely , i doubt , but who knows ?
wonderfully made and easy to use with the minimum of stacking items on top of each other i only wish the laptop section would slide out the way the camera section does regardless a great bag and very tsa friendly
i just bought my third case i love the fact that i can customize the look of my computer without permanently changing it the previous two i bought died after i had them for # months , longer than i would have guessed given how hard i ride my electronics the two things that fail first are the little tabs that hold the top to the screen and the feet but the product is great for protecting from major scratches to the top and bottom the other great feature of these cases is the foldable feet they help prop up my computer for a more television like viewing experience and help increase airflow to the fan when on a softer surface the one i got was the green one for the hp dv # and the only difference from the picture is that the green is not so seafoam but instead an intense kelly green i like the real color better , so no complaints
i love my green mcover . it fits perfectly and it makes my computer look beautiful . i did not wait for it long and it is in perfect condition i love it everyone should get one ! ! ! !
i bought this case for my macbook pro and i love it a friend of mine got it for his dv # and it 's simply the best way to protect your notebook initially , i was concerned that the price of the product was too reasonable for this to be a quality product but i must say the quality is just as good as the more expensive units obviously , it 's easy to attach to the computer , it just clicks on in a matter of seconds the cover is n't slippery and it 's just as easy to carry one handed as it was before the best part of the case is that it has rear feet that can elevate the computer and make typing easier in all , i can highly recommend this case it 's a great deal for the money and a high quality product
this case was not mag-safe and thus the cord always had to be plugged in one way i bought it a year ago and by this year i had to buy a new one because it was completely cracked and ruined i am not very rough on my laptop so it really should have held up better than this we will see how the new model works
i bought this case in december within two weeks , the grip / sealing on the case started shedding around the edges then , over time , it started progressively getting worse i bought the same type of case -lrb- different color -rrb- previously from the apple store , and it never shed like this one did , nor did it make my charger plug in only in one direction other than that , this case has almost the same feel as my previous one , although i did not trust it for fully protecting my computer
this case provides great protection and provides a snug fit however , it started peeling after only # weeks , and for being such an expensive case , this should not happen considering all my laptop does is sit on my desk
i really like the case , because it came in my favorite color , turquoise the case was easy to pop on but there was a smudge on the inside of the case it looks like it may have been scratched a couple of times or something when i put the case on you can see it just make sure you check out the case thoroughly before popping it on , it proves to be a little difficult to take off
hey , my wife thinks it is great the case along with matching keyboard skin makes it look great and protects it from spills and sweaty hands i told her that all she has to do now is match the color of her nails and it would be complete even though it looks great i am a little concerned that the heat trapped by both case and skin will <unk> the life of the computer
bought this case for my cousin as a graduation present for her new mbp i chose this teal color because this is her favorite color it fits snug , looks great and most importantly cheaper than the incase website
i read every , single review before purchasing this case and i am completely satisfied i did some research and found incase has the best product some notes : the color is more vibrant than the picture it is very easy to clasp on no damage to packaging during delivery arrived earlier than expected best brand for the macbook pro
i had previously order another case off amazon that did not fit my macbook properly i received this case in the mail quickly and it fit perfectly i love the color and the fit can not be beat well worth the money
this case is perfect it provides protection , it feels great , keeps the computer cool -lrb- although my new macbook does n't get as hot as my last one -rrb- but , most importantly , the case works it accommodates for the power plug , which others i tried did not and , it allows the top to open fully , unlike the others i highly recommend it
this is a great case the color is <unk> and it fully protects the lap top the bottom is ventilated to the heat does n't get trapped and cause the laptop to overheat i was n't very gently with it and its still in good shape the top coat has peeled a bit on the corners - leaving a slightly lighter blue in those areas but it is n't very noticeable i have never taken the case off i was warned against doing <unk> it would be difficult to remove
if this case were a man i 'd be <unk> all over it lol . so sleek and smooth , fits my mac perfect i 'm a very picky buyer for all the right reasons i always make sure to read the reviews and do the research for each product purchased and this case is the <unk> de la <unk> of cases not overly bright and kiddish looking thank goodness i 'm going to order this case in red so very gorgeous ! ! !
i bought a toshiba laptop and to my surprise the touchpad did not work properly from day one after hours on the phone explaining the problem and doing a thousand procedures i had to ship it to toshiba the problem is that they lost my computer and they do n't do anything to solve the problem i have called them more than # times already and they have been unwilling to help me i will never buy a toshiba again and i suggest you do the same
my # -year-old niece saved up to buy a netbook , and i talked her into a toshiba because i 'd had a toshiba laptop in the past that was <unk> well , she received it yesterday and immediately started getting an error message that says `` warning : a problem with the cooling system has been <unk> . it then shuts down beach camera , the amazon <unk> that sold her the netbook pushed her off on toshiba , and i do n't envy the customer service <unk> my niece 's parents are going to experience dealing with them probably best to avoid this item
i like this netbook apart from the speakers , which do not work the sound coming from the speakers is too low to hear , even when turned on the <unk> setting i called toshiba customer service about this , and they just said that its a netbook so the sound is going to be low i told them well i ca n't even hear it they said well , just get some external speakers or <unk> that is bs they should be able to put together a machine with speakers you can actually hear out of i am keeping this netbook because i ca n't return it now but i will not buy another toshiba product i do not recommend this netbook because the speakers are not functional
i purchased the toshiba nb # when my previous lenovo gave up the ghost and i needed a device for use at the boy <unk> national <unk> although the fit and function of the keyboard is just right , and the brightness of the screen more than adequate , three gripes <unk> minor was the inability to upgrade the memory to # gb due to <unk> of the part specification second , the battery life went for # hours indicated after first charge to # hours after the second charge , and the device has remained at # hours since but most aggravating and <unk> was the inability to connect to the <unk> wifi at the <unk> staff site while all around me were connected with their apples , <unk> , <unk> and some older <unk> , there i sat with my new nb # and nary a trace of a signal <unk> , <unk> , and with an opportunity to trade sleep time for internet time if faced with a marginal signal issue again i shall probably opt for an external <unk>
this is a great little computer but is much too slow with only # gb of memory it is too bad that you have to buy the # gb of memory and throw the other out what a waste not very green or cost effective good for travel and keeping up with email and internet
we received in netbook order in a very short impressive period of time the laptop itself seems to be okay we have n't used it too much yet as it was a christmas present
i have been ` into ' toshiba 's for about a year now and this mini-laptop did not disappoint the only reason it is a four rather than a five is because -lrb- as with all netbooks -rrb- it only has # gb of ram i ca n't wait until they come standard with more anyway -- i love it great if you are doing presentations and have to carry it around all the time
i , too , initially had problems <unk> the # gb memory card from toshiba -lrb- the first card sent did not work -rrb- it took them about # weeks to get a sufficient supply of the # gb cards in stock i replaced it as directed and everything functions great
works fast enough for me but is a little slow if you are looking for something that 's works for travel though you have to be very carful with the screen the screen broke within two weeks of having it
i did alot of <unk> around with netbooks at best buy the keyboard is the best part on the netbook alot of netbooks make it hard to type fast cause the keys are so small it also has amazing battery life i 've had this computer for over a year now and it still works great and hours without charging it was also helpful to take this little computer to class with me and to take when traveling if your not saving a bunch of documents , its perfect for checking email and scanning the internet i do n't really need the hard drive space anyways i can just email all the files i need to myself
i gave this as a gift to my daughter i took it out of the box , charged the battery , upgraded windows # to home premium took off some `` <unk> `` trial ware and i am amazed at how easy it is to use highly recommend it
this laptop bag was too large for my # `` laptop there were several inches of space beside and above the laptop and only one vertical strap to hold it in the strap was too long to hold the laptop , so the laptop was sliding around inside the case the bag also had that awful chemical smell that products from china sometimes have the smell did not go away even after being aired out outside for a day i returned the bag and bought a case logic bag that i am very happy with
got this in the mail yesterday , have to send it back today on my way home from the office -lrb- first time used ever -rrb- the top <unk> ripped off sexy looking , but terrible quality sending it back , hope they give me a refund i read some other reviews people were having a hard time getting their money back i will keep you posted if you care about quality , using it more than once , do not buy
this product is junk i only used the bag for about # weeks before the handle fell off i see now that the stitching connecting the handle is shoddy the bag was not even fully packed ; only a few light items
after reading all the reviews on this item , every thing looked great , , , however , after using it for just # day , the bottom corner of the bag ripped open luckily my laptop did n't fall i must be just the exception on the quality of this bag then
i got this laptop <unk> a month ago and the bottom of the bag is ripped what do you expect from a cheap quality bag i should of got the branded bags
purchased this and have used it twice top handle pulled loose because it was not sewn properly and the middle zipper teeth will not grab when i use one of the zipper tabs -lrb- they pull apart -rrb- i would not recommend purchasing this product average contents : laptop , mouse , power supply , small notebook , gps and chargers for phone and nook pros : good padding on straps and easily adjustable size is great for small <unk> : poor quality , did not hold up to minimal use
it took less than # months for one of the sleeves to rip i read through the reviews before i purchased the backpack and read other reviews warning me about the ripping do n't be a sucker like me , just believe the sleeves will rip
center carry strap ripped away from left side after # weeks use barely fits a # `` laptop add # book and few other things and this backpack is ready to burst it looks nice , but it has since been <unk> to lighter duty
just what i was looking for : comfortable , looks fine and you can fit a # `` laptop do n't know about the quality though , i have been using it for two months and it is already breaking it comes with a guaranty i will have to use soon
using since march # with my # inch lenovo laptop everything was until the handle tore on one side and i had to <unk> it back on then the other side of handle tore only have the laptop , mouse a few pens and pencils and about # sheets of regular copy paper not sure what the weight limit is supposed to be but should have lasted longer than a few weeks they should be made more durable for the expected wear and tear for a laptop
i got this product for my birthday in february this weekend , it broke in the airport carrying a laptop and one book if you actually need this product , get something else it was useful before it broke but i ca n't use this in a airport anymore so it is n't useful for me
i was a bit disappointed in this when i finally got it it feels very cheap in person and when i walk around carrying my laptop in this i 'm always worried that a strap or handle will just break off and my laptop will fall and get damaged the way it was put together does not give me confidence at all it was definitely a mistake on my part in buying this and not something a bit more expensive but more durable
the straps are weak and began wearing out only weeks after purchasing i used this product for carrying books , a laptop and other every day items would 've been a great product otherwise
this sleeve was as expected now that i have it i wish it had handles would only purchase this if you plan to put your laptop in another bag since it is very <unk> to carry
i like this bag it does it 's job however , it 's a bit small for the laptop accessories -lrb- i.e . mouse , charger , mousepad -rrb- i fits my # . # in asus perfectly , but the front pocket is a little too small for the charger , mouse , and mouse pad , and they do n't fit in with the laptop also , the strap occasionally <unk> , but i usually catch it by the handle before it can fall to the ground if you can get past all that , it 's a good product arrived on time sturdy and looks nice
it 's a decent bag for the price the problem being they are very <unk> with the size , it 's a # inch bag and it will fit a # inch laptop , and no more my # . # inch laptop refused to fit inside the case , it was too big i 'm returning the bag and getting something else
this product seems fine for $ # nothing to write home about i would n't haul around a $ # k + alienware laptop around in the thing , but for a lightweight # `` acer laptop it will be fine there 's not a lot of extra room , and the padding is pretty thin but again , it was only $ # you get what you pay for overall i am satisfied
i use this for carrying my laptop and accessories to various meetings at work i do n't carry textbooks , a lunch , or a coat in it the space and organization options inside are perfect for my needs it is not bulky very simple design it does n't have extra straps and pockets to catch on things the carry handle is strangely cheap compared to the rest of the bag mine tore out at one end within # weeks of use the outside mesh pockets are too small to fit a water bottle i do n't know what else they would be useful for
it 's good if you only need to bring a lap top and a few papers with you to work i put my lap top and one of my text books in and it started to rip i like the look of it , but it just does n't serve my needs
i bought this for my new # inch hp seems it 's a little big for my laptop ; but does hold my computer in place with the velcro strap in side . not sorry i bought it
i gave this # stars because the top handle broke the first time i used the bag however ; i love everything else about the bag the zippers slide easily , the inside is well padded and the straps are very comfortable it has great storage and the front zipper opens very wide my only complaint is for the top handle perhaps it was just a fluke where mine was n't sewed well
shipped fast via amazon prime and general quality was good for the price paid , but the sewing and fit of the main zipper is a little snug you have to open it a certain way and many times the zipper sticks wonder if an identical unit would have the same problem but seems like too much of a hassle to return and get a replacement
