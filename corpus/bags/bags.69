i have a macbook pro retina and it fits just fine the only thing is that you ca n't use the case if you want to plug-in your mbpr it just does n't fit what i do to solve this is just set the mbpr on top of the case just watch out for the aluminum thule tag , as it could scratch the bottom of your mac
if you plan to travel with your macbook pro , this is a necessary accessory why would you spend so much on a laptop and not protect it it adds only a few ounces to total weight
my son loves this thing , he was carrying a separate bag with his laptop in it , to classes at <unk> now he can put it in the case and toss it in his backpack and it is protected
i use this case whenever i take my macbook pro out of the house slide the laptop underneath the strap in the middle , zip up , put it in my bag and go it protects the laptop a decent amount and the build quality is great , especially the zippers
... well a fantastic price if your comparing it to what you 'd spend at an apple store i shaved off about $ # buying through amazon , and like i said this is a great case to keep that expensive computer safe i bought this right before my trip to hawaii where i would be taking my macbook through a lot of public transit and it did an a + job the only downside i found about this case is that it makes charging and/or using the sd drive cumbersome when you are trying to work from inside of it
my husband bought this and well i was so impressed about the protection it delivered i 'm going to be buying one too love the fact he can put his mac in the case and set it down incase of a dirty surface it has a hard shell on the sides and soft inside the case is heavier than the mac itself , but it 's well worth it for protection
fits my mac perfectly one only needs to be careful with the straps i feel it protects well but never had any accident to check it so far i love it
fits the # `` macbook pro retina with just enough room to throw in an ipad has a bit more protection than other sleeves it would be nice to have a pocket or two on the outside for additional items
i first saw this sleeve at an apple store and instantly liked it got it via amazon since it was cheaper here -lrb- not any more , unfortunately -rrb- it provides great protection for my unibody -lrb- non-retina -rrb- macbook pro it 's sturdy , made of high quality material , fits the laptop like a glove , it 's water resistant including the zipper , and finally it looks stylish i also like the possibility to use the laptop not taking it out of the sleeve highly recommend this sleeve , it 's a bit of investment as compared to many other sleeves in the market but it 's totally worth the money , especially if you find it for under # dozen bucks
this is perfect for my # ' mac book pro keeps it safe and dry scratch free i can toss it in the floor boards of the car , slide it under the seat and even put it in my saddle bags on my bike with out the worry of it getting hurt
this is an amazing case the build quality is <unk> and it literally looks waterproof i have no <unk> taking my computer in the rain , as all the zippers are weatherproof and the rubber itself is waterproof i expect it could survive a brief <unk> without too much water <unk> in through the zipper pulls there is not much padding , but there is enough around the edges that it feels safe in a messenger bag or backpack additionally , i have used it several times as a & # # ; <unk> & # # ; case and i think that it works wonderful for this purpose if you need the protection , especially on an airplane you ca n't access any computer ports when using the case like this , however
it 's been about a year since i bought this i recall when i bought it that reviews from here and from the apple online store had mentioned various zipper issues a year later , this case has been excellent , no issues whatsoever i am not sure if they resolved the zipper issue entirely or if it was just a few cases here and there that had the issue i remember babying the zipper at first thinking that maybe there was a period that required it to be `` broken in `` a little , because the fit is especially snug when you first get the case pretty shortly after getting it , it was `` comfortably `` snug and i was not wary of the zipper at all just be mindful of it when you first get it , pay attention to how well it does or does n't work if you get a dud , just exchange it p.s . . the mbp i bought at the same time is in perfect condition because i never have to take it out of the case while in use
i keep my computer in the bag i take to school but it cracked pretty quickly it 's still on and i 'm using it but it does n't seem to grip as well now either
great value for the money once u put it on , it 's on which is a plus only complaint is my son wanted to put a sticker on the outside of the case for decoration but because of the case texture , it would n't stick overall very glad i purchased
the case fits my air perfectly , adds very little weight or bulk and looks really nice it does n't interfere with the use of my air i would be perfectly happy , except the case scratches really easily i set my magic mouse on top of the case and when i picked my mouse back up , there were visible scratches i got the case to protect my air , so i 'm glad the scratches were not on my computer great value , given the price
worked just fine ... bought it to replace a blue one that i had earlier these only last about a year before breaking down , but for the price it 's a win
the color is very light pink and resembles the picture it 's a bit clear , but it gives it a more rich look does n't look plastic or cheap or anything , in fact , it looks like the macbook came in that color
love that this gives you the option to style your computer while also protecting it i have had my macbook air cover for over # years now and it has held up i have chipped some pieces off the corners , but i would rather it take the blunt of damage over my laptop i will definitely purchase another one in the future
it was just as advertised good for the price the end nylon hook is pretty flimsy as it ripped in half in just its second use a little bulky overall a solid laptop <unk>
surface is not flat - matter is slightly wavy because of not perfect seams it is also too big for my macbook air # & # # ; . it is not just sleeve - it has form and it is thick notebook in this sleeve becomes three times thicker
this is a nice sleeve at a very reasonable price , but the product dimension listing says that it 's # . # & # # ; deep it 's not it 's <unk> only # & # # ; deep , so my older model thinkpad t # would not fit i had to return the sleeve for a refund
it seems like a good quality sleeve that will surely protect your laptop properly and at a good price however , comparing it with other sleeves i 've seen , it is rather thin and its fabric it is not as soft as you would like it is a good one though , specially taking into account its
thick -lrb- # `` ? -rrb- foam panels font and back provide more than adequate protection , much thinner foam at corners and edges is probably adequate fits my toshiba satellite l # -s # snugly , perfectly my measured laptop dimensions are # x # . # inches and # . # inches thick at the thickest point my previous sleeve was just thick neoprene which i liked better the thick foam panels in this sleeve offer better protection , but make it seem overly bulky to me
i bought this for a # . # `` asus and it fits perfectly it 's a sleeve , so do n't expect much protection if you happen to drop it the only gripe i have with it , is the fact that only the left and bottom edges are padded the top and right side are used for the zipper and offer zero padded protection
it fits the # . # & # # ; chromebook perfectly , the padding seems to help protect it from damage i have n't had it long so only time will tell if it stands up to wear and tear , but so far i like it very much
nice slim , if you 're looking for a laptop sleeve at the very basic end of the scale , this is a good one it is fairly easy to keep clean with a damp cloth it has a long zipper from one end of the long side through to the end of the short side , making it easy to get the laptop in and out it is n't loaded with <unk> is a basic sleeve it probably wo n't keep your laptop from major falls etc . but will protect from casual daily maneuvers the padding is thin if you do n't bang around much it should be sufficient for the casual user case logic seems to use durable fabrics , no extras i use this on my mac-book and its a nice fit for the quality and price , this a fairly good product
it fits perfectly for my # . # inch asus vivobook this one has only one space for laptop , but no a/c adapter , mouse , or other stuffs other than , it is overall good laptop case
we bought this for use with a samsung series # chromebook and it fits perfectly it 's snug - there is no way you can put anything else into the case other than the computer the outer shell is soft , almost like a wet suit it will keep the computer clean and protect it from some damage and drops , but i do not expect it to do much more it 's perfect for protecting the chromebook when kids throw it in their backpack
i 'm using this for my sony vaio z , and it fits perfectly it 's sufficient protection against minor bumps , and will definitely protect against scratches & abrasions , but i would n't use it as my sole source of protection , especially when traveling it 's really just what it says it is , a laptop sleeve , not a laptop protector , so as a laptop sleeve , it 's perfect for my intended use so far , it seems well made ; no problems with zippers , no loose or unraveling threads or stitching
the <unk> # is a very good companion for my hp # . # netbook it 's a snug fit as expected , and offers very good protection all around it should last me a long
got exactly what i asked for : a simple , non-descript sleeve for my toshiba thrive however , as i knew before i got it , there is not pocket for accessories like power cords just remember that when you are shopping
plain zippered sleeve has foam insulation on both sides and cover is <unk> polyester zipper goes full halfway around the case for easy access to your netbook my acer # . # `` netbook fits nicely ... not too loose and not too tight only thing that would make it better would be a small separate compartment or pocket for a pen , ear buds , other small items which may damage the finish of your computer i 'm not complaining good buy for the price
i use this case when i want to carry my # . # `` tablet along with <unk> tablet keyboard for android # . # + -lrb- <unk> combo # -rrb- , which is a perfect fit width wise there 's also some room to spare for a mouse and the charger cable so for space it 's perfect and the padding inside is more than adequate the main drawbacks i could find are # -rrb- there 's no hand size loops or slots to grip on to , so it can be difficult to <unk> when you 're carrying a lot of things there is a small finger size loop on one side that could get a lanyard of some sort i suppose # -rrb- there 's no pockets or divided slots , so the risk of scratches or damage from <unk> accessories goes way up one other observation is that the shell is a coarse fabric , so it will probably last longer but it is n't as pleasant to hold as neoprene imho regardless , it 's a nice case that does the job i need it to do
it has n't fallen apart yet and it 's been through some events it keeps my tablet safe and secure and i do n't have to worry about it getting scratched or damaged . thanks for this
this case has great padding and works well when the laptop fits inside i have vivobook # . # & # # ; laptop and it barely fits and it is marginally difficult to zipper the case shut yet , it works well and i ca n't complain when i paid $
bought this sleeve for my little hp mini # , and it is a perfect snug fit the one downside to this sleeve is that perhaps it is a bit too padded -- makes the netbook a fair bit thicker leaves less room in my small backpack for books but overall i 'm pleased with the fit of this sleeve the quality seems really good as well
i was just looking for a cheap protective sleeve for my macbook air # . # `` and this happened to also have free super saver shipping it 's a great sleeve , good quality , and fits my like a glove i have the ipearl mcover on my air , and it fits perfectly inside the only reason i am giving this # stars instead of # is because it is a rather thick sleeve it definitely adds a lot of bulk to the air , which is super thin it 's not neoprene so it 's not just like a thin layer sleeve , rather it is a cloth with a foam sheet stuffed inside or something like that
i am very happy with this case i have had it for # months now and use it every day it is for my ipad which fits with some room to spare at this price its a great case the padding and the materials feels good and is great quality i recommend it as a good , inexpensive way to carry your ipad around
i was looking in local stores -lrb- you know the big box stores -rrb- for a slip case that would fit my new # . # `` netbook they did n't have a thing -- not one you know who did of course i 'd had a case logic for my smaller netbook and this one did n't disappoint either it 's a snug , but not too snug , fit -- i can even keep a small bluetooth dongle in a usb port and still fit it in the case there is a small pocket on the outside the slip case lets me keep the computer protected when putting it -lrb- in the case , of course -rrb- through airport security all in all a great choice
this fits my # . # & # # ; msi laptop very well there 's only a tiny bit of space for the laptop to move around inside , which ends up being quite good for the laptop 's safety it 's not too thick and it will not protect your laptop from a big fall , but it does prevent those annoying bumps and scratches good buy for the price
i bought this brand because i still have a <unk> ~ # year old case logic cd case rolling around in the back seat of my car case logic makes good stuff this fits my samsung chromebook perfectly without a whole lot of extra room for it to shift around
i picked this up to protect an hp envy , but given the generic nature it works just as well with my lenovo case logic make good stuff this is probably my third or fourth sleeve from them in last decade it keeps the machines from picking up any extra scratches , scuffs , or other marks it 's a laptop sleeve , it is soft , it works , what else can anyone really say
case logic makes the best cases this is perfect for the dell inspiron # r keep your computer looking new for years will also provide extra protection when in a laptop bag for travel ca n't beat the design and snugness
i got this cover for my asus aspire one notebook i went with case logic because i remember using their products a long time ago growing up i 'm glad to see that they are still reliable today the case is a perfect fit for my # inch notebook hardly any space inside the cover so the notebook ca n't slide around in it the case itself is made with enough material so that whatever is inside is protected from outer elements truly a great investment
it came nicely handled and delivered the outside looks great , although not fancy but that is all i need it is simple and does the job the sleeve has thick foams inside to protect my laptop the only thing down is that it is a little bit bigger than my vaio ultrabook the length is perfectly fit , but not the width anyway , it does not make that much different still a must buy
i have an # inch acer netbook and this little case works great it allows me to provide protection to the outside cover of the laptop while still being small enough to fit in my bag with the rest of my daily supplies
just got this today and love it it is a perfect fit for my # . # macbook air it fits snug , but not too tight , so it is easy to get the zipper closed the zipper does not run against the laptop like some other cases it has nice cushioning without being heavy and bulky the material and zipper are good quality great purchase , especially for the price
this case is just right for protecting my # . # inch netbook while i am traveling the long zipper makes it easy to take the netbook in and out it is just what i was looking for
a good laptop sleeve is one that protects your computer , fits within your briefcase and is professional enough to be left out on a conference room table this case from case logic meets all of these criteria the case is well made with a zipper system that opens enough to easily put in or take out your computer , but not so wide as to either flop around or let your computer to fall out by accident the padding is substantial and stiff rather than being spongy i prefer stiff padding as it supports the computer , is less likely to snag and does not <unk> easily this case provides substantially more support and protection that the neoprene case it replaces no one will ever call the case sexy , but its good looking enough to take into a professional situation where its not flashy but more than functional overall recommended if you have a neoprene based case and are tired of snags or the fact that the neoprene grips inside your briefcase recommended as well for people who are looking to a case that will compliment a new briefcase and replace the flimsy build in computer sleeves finally recommended for people who carry a messanger bag or backpack as this case is sturdy enough to protect your computer while being slim enough to save space for your other stuff
i bought this case to use for my iconia tablet or my # . # `` netbook depending on which i needed to take both fit perfectly ! good build quality at a great price !
this is a good basic sleeve that has what you want with no frills sturdy nylon and sturdy foam not great corner coverage slightly cheap appearance it would be better with pockets i am sorta complaining about the cheapness , but not really it 's what it should be for the price i have a la robe sleeve for my air and that is a much nicer sleeve but of course , that costs more , too this case logic sleeve is a good one
i bought this case for my motorola xoom tablet computer it is a little bit large for my xoom , however , it still holds it in place , and protects my xoom very well i 've dropped it twice , once from about # feet off the ground , and the case protected my xoom perfectly also , for the price , it ca n't be beat
bought this for my acer # . # & # # ; laptop , and it 's a perfect fit well designed and provides good protection it was a great deal at half the price as an open <unk> item through amazon
laptops with heavy processing punch are ubiquitous these days the <unk> factor is the size and weight you need to be able to put these computers in and out of bags easily , and they do n't come with their own bags case logic <unk> # -inch laptop sleeve is the solution they come with padding without compromising weight or size it even has a handle to easily pull it out from a backpack very stylish , too
fits the microsoft surface pro just fine , but i needed something with a pocket so i exchanged it for something else , but it 's great and high quality if you just need a sleeve
this laptop case is very practical i fits my # inch asus really well since it is not too big , it fits in my bag easily and i dont have to worry about damaging my laptop because the padding does its job
i ordered this case for my # . # `` acer tablet and it was exactly what i was looking for it is well made and was over half the price i would have paid at on the big box office store it is a little larger than my tablet , but i knew that when i ordered it , but still protects the table
in my experience , case logic cases seem to be very durable and long lasting in fact , i still use a case logic bag i bought back in # they take a lot of abuse and still function this laptop sleeve is no exception the zipper feels well made and sturdy the padding is thicker than other brands i have used the exterior feels nice too and actually feels strong it also feels softer than some of the other case logic cases i have , which is a nice bonus overall , this is a great case and ca n't find fault with it
this case has very little padding and is also entirely too large for my # & # # ; mbp it is so flimsy that if i hold it out open , it collapses on itself if you 're looking for something that will protect your laptop , look elsewhere
this case is marketed as a case for the macbook air the case , in fact , is for the # `` inch macbook pro it says so on the packaging when you receive the product i was highly disappointed by how poorly it fit my macbook air it 's twice as wide and way too big do n't buy this product if you have a macbook air
i decided to believe the description when it said it fits & # # ; perfectly & # # ; for the # & # # ; macbook pro i did n't notice all the reviews saying that it does n't fit at all please do n't make my mistake there is about half an inch extra space on each side with the laptop in the sleeve when you hold it closed and move it around , the laptop will slide inside the sleeve not what i wanted at all
i bought this sleeve for my asus x # e # . # inch laptop since it showed up in the ` buying together ' suggestions the description says it is made for # . # inch laptops but unfortunately my netbook did n't fit the inner dimension is lesser than # . # ! ! so i had to return it i wish amazon had separated the reviews for the different sizes , since most of the positive reviews are for other sizes i should point out that the low rating i gave this product is mainly because of the <unk> in description and actual size it also <unk> from the fact that this came up as a `` frequently bought together `` suggestion when i bought the netbook on the other hand , if you buy this for a smaller netbook the quality seems to be very nice for the price
i originally bought the # & # # ; for my sons new # & # # ; macbook pro # retina display laptop it was too large there was at least an extra half inch on the top and # . # & # # ; on the side i returned it , paid the $ # return shipping charge and ordered the # & # # ; one the measurements listed in the specs for the # & # # ; seemed like it would work the laptop did fit into the case however , because the edges are curved it would not slide all the way to the bottom of the case and so would not zip the case was what we were looking for as far as material , quality and price , just not fit
not saying my <unk> air does not fit , it does , but it also fits inside a large suitcase this case if macbook pro , not for air , your air will swim inside the case one more instance of trying to have a once size fits all
i bought the # & # # ; version of this case assuming that it was made for the thinner macbook air / retina macbook pro as per the title it 's definitely made for a standard thickness laptop , and i could easily fit # retina macbook pros in this sleeve it 's very loose , and my laptop <unk> around quite a bit inside of it i 'll definitely be returning this in search of a slimmer one
ordered this for a super thin # . # & # # ; laptop with almost no bezel won & # # ; t fit because of the rounded corners on the sleeve compare the dimensions to the amazon basics # & # # ; sleeve . # . # . # . # compared to # . # . # buy the one from amazon it & # # ; s the correct size for a modern thin # & # # ; laptop and much cheaper
case logic does not advertise this product clearly the & # # ; # -inch & # # ; sleeve sold can only fit up to # . # inches the product review online does not give this specification upon review of the actual & # # ; # -inch & # # ; sleeve , you can <unk> text on the product to give the # . # <unk>
my lenovo t # laptop is smaller then the maximum size which fits # `` laptop sleeve nevertheless this sleeve is too small i wanted something compact and lightweight , but ended up by <unk> product otherwise this is a sturdy and well-made product with a slight rubberish smell to be on the safe side i <unk> to carefully measure your laptop and take one size bigger
i got this case yesterday i bought it cuz there are many postive feedback from other buyers but when i first time put my macbook pro # retina in and pull it out the zipper on the bag scratch my macbook a huge noticeable <unk> on the back
i guess maybe the price makes up for it , but this thing looks and feels really cheap i expected it to be more <unk> but its stiff plastic-y rubber i just got it and i 'm already about to order something else to replace it
seems to be very well made an outer pocket would be a nice extra unfortunately , this sleeve does not fit my # . # asus vivobook as described in the product title had to return it so , beware all of you # . # & # # ; asus vivobook owners
looking at the dimensions on amazon and actually looking at the dimensions on the product are different the product is smaller than amazon says so be aware that a # . # inch laptop may just barely fit i love the product but the size is just not there
but am disappointed that it is not quite the right size for my asus # . # laptop it <unk> fits , but putting the puter in and taking it out of the sleeve is a challenge like putting <unk> <unk> into a <unk> -- inconvenient and <unk> i can use it for an older and smaller netbook , but will get a larger portfolio case with handles when i begin using the computer during travels
it 's ok but not really what i expected it 's actually bigger than stated there 's excess space at the top which is quite annoying and makes the laptop seem bigger than it actually is i think i 've been spoiled by case logic
the case did not fit the lenovo # . # inch yoga idea pad it was a bit bulkier than i expected so , i had no real use for it but too troublesome to send it back
a word of warning for dell precision mobile workstation # `` owners : look elsewhere for a sleeve my m # just barely fit after much stretching and shoving the computer is just slightly too wide and thick to fit comfortably my logitech mouse usb receiver , which sticks out # mm from the usb port , makes it impossible to fit the computer into the case <unk> how tight the fit is also , the padding is too thin to offer much protection for your # . # lbs $ # . computer
sending this one back the product arrived quickly and in perfect condition it just smells like bad rubber and does n't have a quality feel to it it is very light weight and would definitely blow away on a <unk> day i also have a hard case on my macbook for style but the slight addition in thickness makes it very difficult to get my laptop in and out overall i am pretty disappointed because i typically love case logic products and do n't feel like they came through on this one
this case is fairly well constructed and a reasonable price , but it does n't have a very snug fit for the late ' # macbook pro retina for a sleeve that was advertised as a fit for the macbook pro , i was expecting a better fit , but the notebook can slide around in it a bit
i bought the # `` sleeve for my new macbook pro retina laptop unfortunately , this thing is much too big and loose so can not do an adequate job in protection i would not recommend this for the new mbp retina laptops
it 's is way too bulky and ca n't fit into any laptop bag i own the outer and inner material feels light and cheap , almost styrofoam like in flexibility as well not recommended for a business traveler ... although it does act as a decent at home manila folder paper zip up
this laptop case is way to big for my # . # laptop if your into that sort of thing go for it , but i like the snug safe fit for my laptop no room to slide around and get dents
this is my fault really , i should of been more <unk> when purchasing the sleeve since i wanted something that securely fit around my rmbp this case does n't do that there was a good inch a half around the sides of the laptop giving a big wiggle room for the device making it prone to dents and such
this will not work with a # . # asus computer , no matter what the description says there is <unk> you could get it to work lucky for me my wife had a # . # asus and it fit like a glove
it does n't fit the product for which it is sold it 's a bit too small i fear i will damage my computer if i try to force it , if i should force my compter into the case , i fear i will not be able to get it out so ... my case sits there unused perhaps it could be used for kindle fire or nook , but it certainly wo n't be used for the computer for which it was purchased
i just received my sleeve today and was greatly frustrated that is was too big for my # macbook pro # inch it is probably a good # inch bigger all around than the actual computer however , i feel that the case itself was build well and would have lasted a long time there is sufficient padding and the zipper was smooth unfortunately , it 's not going to work for me bummer <unk> back to the search
extra space on all sides will leave laptop unprotected and with bumps that would n't occur with it in your backpack if it was a snug fit damages laptop corners like those of a book in a box to big for it also , it is thin
i purchased this case because it was sized for the macbook pro when it arrived , it was clearly labeled as a general case for all # & # # ; portable computers the macbook pro <unk> around inside the case and was poorly <unk> so i returned it to amazon
it did n't slide in/out of the case that easily -lrb- note i did n't have a mac , though the laptop still fit anyway -rrb- , and there was minimal protection ; not really worth the buy
the case is not a standard neoprene that stretches around the computer my # in macbook pro flaps around inside the case but it 's the lowest cost case around so one extra star
bought along asus vivobook # . # as recommended by amazon to buy together but the notebook does not fit in did not return since i have a netbook of # inches and quality of sleeve is good make sure you check the external dimensions of your laptop before buying any sleeve
i bought this item for a macbook air which this case claims to be designed for however the sleeve is overly large for a macbook air by a massive amount - according to the packaging it is designed for a # . # `` thick device , not a . # `` thick device the packaging also states it 's designed for a macbook pro or macbook , and no where does it say macbook air -lrb- unlike the amazon listing ! ! in fact it seems quite thick even for a modern macbook pro with <unk> display , which this listing claims as well it looks like it 's designed for a # macbook
when i received the product i found out it was damaged i was very disappointed as this is not the type of service i expected from amazon or it 's retailers
my granddaughter has tried using this , but it just is n't functional for her it does n't fit in her book bag and it does n't have a handle so she does n't use it she is shopping for another one this was a waste of my money
i purchased this case for lenovo yoga # as advertised and it does not fit that laptop it barely zips up over it and i can tell that this cheap & # # ; case & # # ; will not tolerate the pressure <unk> over its zippers due to bad fit just like many other similar & # # ; cases & # # ; this one is poor quality and bad advertisement such cases should cost $ # not whatever it cost
this is too wide for the # mbp -lrb- fall # -rrb- i ended up using this as a buffer for table or on my lap while using the laptop dont waste your money
this item was suggested with dell # -inch laptop i ordered with one laptop without any doubt on size when delivered , it is found too small to fit the dell laptop , maybe for # -inch one
did n't like the product because it was too big for my macbook pro # & # # ; too loose and not well protected the . # & # # ; of extra space was misleading to me the description says it fits a # & # # ; macbook <unk> pro so i got it i thought the . # & # # ; extra space was because of the expansion or something that is needed but it is not needed get a # & # # ; not a # . # & # # ; for your macbook pro
the <unk> it came i tried it on my mac , it was a inch larger than the mac , it moves inside i had to put something inside to kinda fill in the gaps ! ! i hate it
good protection , but i was expecting a tight fit sleeve like the one for my last macbook pro this thing is way too big for retina macbook pro # `` -lrb- late # -rrb- you can almost hear your own echo in this cavernous bag when your computer is sliding in a bag , some damage could very well happen too much trouble to return it , but i wo n't buy anything from case logic again
my fault for not checking it out enough before ordering zipper is only on one side , needs to be on # sides for greater use it will protect laptop fine , but not user friendly
