this bag is really efficient , seems strong , wheels are working perfectly even in rough surfaces . only improvement would be the inner separations , maybe more separations for your books and the laptop cables and stuff
i love the sturdiness of this bag , the ease of use of the telescoping handle -lrb- it 's very smooth -rrb- and the organization this bag offers my one and only <unk> is that the zipper of the main compartment gets hung up on the curved part of the bag where it is more rigid i almost forgot , but one more thing i like about this back is that it stands upright and does n't fall forward when loaded with books my only concern is if it will fit into my daughter 's locker at school
this was a great buy for me since i have chronic back pain the handle was long enough for me to not have to hunch over the wheels are smooth and there is ample space , including a compartment for a laptop i would recommend this product
most people consider rolling backpacks dorky you can either be one of these & # # ; cool & # # ; people and suffer terrible back pain from carrying around those # lbs of law books or you can put your books on wheels this backpack is great i 'm able to fit # giant law books , a couple of binders , and all my notebooks into it it even has a nice protective pouch for my laptop the big front pocket has a spot for your cell phone and wallet it 's sturdy and will honestly make your life a lot easier
this is the second identical backpack of this type that i have owned i drove the first one into the ground , but got a lot of use out of it the backpack has many compartments and storage areas , and holds my laptop securely i use it every day for work and travel by air a lot it holds up really well for hours of airport travel -lrb- i use it as a carry-on -rrb- when i finally needed another one , i figured they probably did n't make this model anymore i was very pleasantly surprised when i found out that it was still available it is well worth the price
the wheels have performed very well in the cold weather the shoulder straps are a nice option if needed the shoulder straps have n't been used due to the weight of my text books the handle has held up well in daily use i am pleased with my purchase
i am a teacher and this bag makes my life so much easier it moves well and is easy to handle it has lots of compartments and tons of space the material is sturdy but the bag itself is relatively lightweight i highly recommend this bag
there are days that i have to carry more books than my back can handle i just do not want to hurt my back anytime soon this is a great wheeled backpack , it has so many pockets and i can put # maybe # of my really big books , along with a notebook
that 's how the other travelers look at me in the airport not only is this an attractive color but also it is so versatile and easy to maneuver it can hold all of my work items including my computer plus plenty of room for some personal items as well it is a snug fit under the seat but it does fit i am the envy of my office too since i use it even when i am not traveling i would recommend
i had one of these ruggedly strong bags which i used to <unk> the nyc subways it had a nice black color the thing was just freaking <unk> it was so damn good that one day somebody just up and stole it i am not mad i just want another one update : october # i had gotten another one this bag is amazingly indestructible
the quality of the backpack is outstanding it 's pretty with lots of pockets and very spacious inside the wheels glide easily and the handle is easy to hold very good value for the money thanks amazon !
this was a purchase for my girlfriend she says , `` this backpack carries # very heavy nursing books , my netbook and all my accessories including my wallet and water bottle and i still have a free compartment the wheels are very sturdy and roll over everything i take it on the adjustable handle is perfect the solid base at the bottom makes it stand up without out falling over . this backpack is perfect for any person with any back problems totally worth the asking price
my son went through # decent backpacks last year -lrb- grade # -rrb- , including a <unk> samsonite -lrb- lasted # months -rrb- this rugged <unk> -lrb- and a little extra care -rrb- is the solution this is the first and only wheeled backpack that has stood up to the abuse he gives it also , this unit seems <unk> : it holds far more than you might expect this is a very well engineered backpack and therefore highly recommended go ahead and by cheaper ones ... you 'll eventually end up with a jansport like we did just wait for a decent sale price -- update : my son did manage to destroy this in less than one school year
i am taking grad school classes , so i have to carry a lot of textbooks around with me i also have to depend on public transportation to get me to class and around the campus the back pack is roomy and easily holds all my books i especially like the ease with which i can <unk> it the handle extends easily and is comfortable for this tall person to pull around
bought this item for my granddaughter who was complaining about her back bothering her due to the weight of her school books since she can now wheel them , she has no complaints and the school found the product acceptable for her to use she is now in middle school and can even use it there
i have been struggling trying to find a rolling backpack to fit my monster laptop the laptop was a gift , and i love it , but it is a beast , measuring # x # . # inches it 's a snug fit , but it fits plus i have room for # textbooks , a couple notebooks , my <unk> # calculator , laptop charger , pencils , and wiggle room also the side compartment for a water bottle on the side is a bonus truly , this has been a dream for me the color is perfect -lrb- <unk> brown -rrb- , rolls smoothly , and so far no problems there are pockets in the outermost compartment that are for pens/pencils , so the reviewer that said there was no room for such must have gotten a different model i would highly recommend this for those that have large laptops i have n't had a problem so far ... it 's been a month and i lug this around daily . . and even <unk> to the library for studying
lives up to the jansport reputation love the multiple compartments , including padded sleeve for laptop or tablet wheels are heavy duty enough to roll over rough surfaces definitely worth the price would have liked to have had color choice , but basic black is fine
my husband got this for our son his backpack is so heavy , the straps ripped off i ca n't imagine the kind of damage all that weight does on a little kids back this is the perfect solution
best quality offered always by jansport and the lowest price offered by amazon love it ! no need to worry about breaking your kid 's back carrying a heavy back pack on his back
this is a great backpack the wheels roll easily and the handle is sturdy it is very well made and there is plenty of room this backpack has multiple pockets including a padded pocket for a laptop , and other pockets for folders , pencils , etc .
this backpack works great for airline travel and all around just taking along your laptop , ipad , cameras , chargers , meds , bagged liquids , sweatshirt , etc . the side pockets worked great for easy access to passports and boarding passes it actually fit under the seat in front of me on the airplane once i took out the laptop which i always use to watch movies when in flight it has a laptop sleeve which protects the laptop and i use my own neoprene ipad sleeve all of my devices that i need to access at the airport or on the plane are in easy reach with this rolling backpack i love the plaid color inserts which help it stand out from all of the solid black ones i prefer this over other lighter colors which get dirty looking easily i would highly recommend this for students , travelers and those living in a high rise
this is a <unk> book bag for heavy books and a lunch bag i have rolled it in rain and shine and has held up wonderfully it is very easy to maneuver around
this will hold two of my binders , two large textbooks and still room for my laptop and my lunch there is room in front for pens and odds and ends and the large wheels will roll over just about anything without mishap the only downside is that sometimes when i really load it up , it looks like there is too much pressure on the zipper , so i 'm careful
jansport is a great brand and this bag is no exception it fits the laptop , notebooks , books , anything yet , it does n't look bulky and when you pull it , it feels like it has nothing inside all the guys in the office asked me to place an amazon order for them -lrb- we live in <unk> -rrb- great product and it comes in many other nice colours i wanted to buy the dark <unk> but it was out of stock when i placed the order
i have had this bag for a year and a half now we use it for all our heavy items when we are getting groceries since we take public transit i love that the bottom of the bag and the wheels are sturdy since i have to pull it over a lot of bumps no signs of damage to the bag yet from all we load it up with
this <unk> is exactly what i was looking for it is very spacious and it has a laptop sleeve i love that it can convert from being wheeled around to being an actual backpack jansport driver # core series wheeled
my son really enjoys his jan sport rolling back pack it 's well made , it glides easily and it has room for everything he needs this is the second jansport rolling back pack we purchase we were very satisfied with the first one
i bought this for my son for school he wheels it to school every day he really loves all the compartments , and it is holding up really well i think this is well-made product
as a graduate student suffering from back problems , i was very particular about the backpack i wanted to buy this bag is very sturdy , easy to maneuver and fits everything i need , i.e . computer , books , water bottle , etc . jansport knows how to make a great product and i would recommend this bag to anyone
i bought this pack for my # th grade son who also carried a laptop daily the laptop was very secure , the bag is functional with multiple sections and it is sizeable the pack is also relatively lightweight to start compared to other rollers after # months , the bar did break , but jansport service is tremendous they <unk> the pack and because they could n't repair the pack , they sent us a brand new one we have gone another year of heavy use with no incident and the pack is going strong i fully expect to get through elementary school with this pack so feel like my investment is paying off while i bought a different jansport <unk> for another son , this one is much better given multiple pockets and better padding
i did n't want to do it i hated the idea of being the old lady on campus with a wheelie backpack but the textbooks required for nursing school are gigantic and heavy and if parking at your school is anything like parking at my school , it is n't exactly convenient to run back and forth to your car to exchange textbooks this backpack carries it all and it wheels easily i do n't really have any complaints it has held up for # hard semesters i carry my # & # # ; macbook pro , chargers , a bag of pens and highlighters , my wallet , books and binders and a full size planner
a compartment for everything it all fits no more carrying a heavy bag leading to a sore back it looks funky too i do n't care if people <unk> because they do n't know what they are missing out on
this backpack was the only one i could find large enough for the amount of books my <unk> brings home it is very sturdy , stays upright , rolls beautifully and is easily <unk> it was also $ # cheaper than purchasing in a local store so far very pleased with the construction
our son transports a ton of books his backpack basically is his locker on wheels before , he carried them all in an oversized messenger bag ... <unk> this bag has been perfect i was concerned it would not hold up under the weight when he does have to use the handle for carrying it up the stairs at school , but it is not even beginning to look like it might tear
i got this bag for law school it has been able to hold up to three <unk> and my laptop i have been caught it the rain , but all my contents were kept dry , which is good especially since my laptop is in the bag , the bag has also shown durability , the experience has been great
i had to get this for my # year old to carry is books sad day when he could not carry all of the books he needed this bag has not disappointed in any way
i love this bag im a nursing student and i have to haul a lot of books this bags holds all the ones i need to take to class people always ask where i got it and want one its an awesome , sturdy
this backpack is the best we have ever had for carrying a laptop and books jansport as always has made a quality backpack with wheels to make moving about the campus with a heavy load easy
as a law student who walks a couple of miles per day with my books & computer , this bag has been a life saver <unk> as i feel dragging a wheely bag , the relief to my <unk> spine is well worth the damage to my image it is big enough for # law books , # notes books , and a net book in the main compartment the wheely bag function is better than the bookbag - the straps lack padding and support but the overall product is so good that it still is a # -star for me i highly recommend
this is a fantastic laptop bag for ladies it has many compartments -lrb- zipped -rrb- to keep things organized the laptop portion is well padded and there is plenty of room for files , books etc . the bag remains standing upright when full and the telescoping handle is easy to use it has optional shoulder straps so it can be used as a backpack the wheels work well over lots of different terrain would definitely recommend this as a day-to-day work bag -lrb- to save your back -rrb- or travel work bag
i bought my first stm sleeve in # it was a dense neoprene , was fantastic protection the next generation i bought in # was thinner , not as dense , but for a neoprene sleeve still decent protection , though not as bullet-proof as the first this generation is thin and flimsy not a little thinner , a lot thinner . they changed how the pieces are sewn together , which i believe also affects how well it protects on the side this version uses an additional piece of fabric that each side is connected to , the older ones were sewn directly , that <unk> of fabric provided a nice bumper that this one does not this generation has a fluffy interior fabric that is not mentioned in the listing no reason for this , as it can collect dust or debris and likely to promote static , which the regular neoprene did not there 's got to be a better option for the price point stm no more for me
this is my first laptop sleeve and i 'm happy with it i bought it to protect my laptop in a bag full of textbooks and it 's doing a great job it fits my # `` macbook pro snug with a little bit of room and the zipper is lined on the inside so it wo n't touch the laptop this causes the zipper to not close easily as <unk> in another review but it is not a big deal the material is plenty thick , but this sleeve , like any other , is not going to protect your laptop from the extreme there is a poor excuse for a handle on the back but it still works if i had to redesign this case , i would have added a larger handle this was not a breaking point for me , since i planned to use this within a backpack anyway if you 're looking for a sleeve for your # `` macbook pro , this one is great
first , let me say that i 've owned the sleeve for the # & # # ; macbook pro as well as an stm backpack all of these products are incredibly well thought out and constructed in the time i 've been using them , i 've never had a zipper fail on me , or a rip occur certainly , this is not a case that will take a & # # ; <unk> and keep on ticking & # # ; , but it is good to protect your notebook in a briefcase or backpack it resists the occasional splash of coffee , and cleans up easily the padding is adequate for the protection it affords , and the lip at the top inside , under the zipper , is a great improvement over other cases it protects the ports on the side of the notebook this is especially valuable with the new lightning bolt technology , as adding this is n't exactly cheap take it from me , this is the best thing from down under in a long time you certainly will get your money 's worth , and never be sorry
they always fit right , they protect well with the right amount of -lrb- and lack of -rrb- bulk , and now they are even lined with a furry coating that allows for smooth slide-in these are my go-to sleeves , and what i use for all my laptops and devices
i should have read all the reviews before i ordered this thing it is cheap feeling , has virtually no real area to operate a mouse and feels like it just might break at any minute the size of the lap top in the pictures must be a netbook a # or # inch lap top over <unk> this thing i guess it would be barely acceptable if you did not use a mouse ... but the mouse is a deal breaker for me will <unk> to local <unk> shop rather than return not worth the hassle and postage i will be more careful when i buy something like this again frankly the lap desk i got at the big blue box store for nine <unk> eight is way , way , more functional than this i 'll buy another one of those tomorrow to use when i 'm in bed surfing
this product is flimsy and tends to become lose the more you use it made from very cheap materials , so it is definitely not a good value for the price beware - if you return this item you will only get # % of your money back this vendor has a heavy <unk> that is not advertised when you purchase the item
had this product now over # year main part of desk is ok but still gets hot after an hour or so underneath is not very comfortable on your leg as there is no padding the add-on mouse extension is a joke it locks on with just pressure clips and falls off constantly it also is slick so unless flat the mouse will slide off
i had hoped to use this and have room for mouse activity ... not so i thought , based on reviews , that there would be room for my laptop and external mouse only use for notebooks - not laptops if you 're going to order
the idea of having a place on the lap desk to put my mouse on when it arrived and i opened the package , i was taken aback at how flimsy and cheaply it looks did not like the way it sets on my lap returning it tomorrow
we got the original lap works fold out desk a few years ago more recently my wife upgraded her laptop and we found <unk> fighting over the desk , to the extent that the most <unk> solution was to buy a second one a real let down the new one does not fold open smoothly - or flat - and is very <unk> produced more cheaply and from cheaper grade more brittle plastic that ` creaks ' when you lean on it or apply any pressure we 're stuck with it now of course , the apparent <unk> of a company 's success in the marketplace sadly , i can not recommend it like i so easily could the original
when actually using this on your lap in bed , on couch , etc it can not seem to hold up to the weight of your <unk> i am # ' # `` and # lbs # . # % bf so that is n't the issue , but it bows when any kind of weight is applied it needs to be thicker great product idea just needs to be thick enough to handle a mouse and a persons <unk> weight let me know when # . # comes out
i see this product less as a `` desk `` than as a heat shield for my lap at that it does a fine job it 's also light and folds nicely to fit in a briefcase or backpack i use mine when i work on the road , which is often last week i left it on an airplane , so i 'm ordering another today
i have been using a laptop desk # . # for the past couple of months and love it the desk is light and thin making it easy to carry in my laptop bag its also sturdy and makes working from my laptop when on the road much more comfortable
i love this product i am always on my laptop and ca n't stand the heat from the laptop as well as not being able to use my external mouse with this product , the heat is n't an issue and i can use my external mouse as well great for your lazy boy chair , in bed , where ever i looked and <unk> many different `` <unk> `` and this one for me was the best should have ordered this years ago ... better late than never
i bought this stand as a gift to my mom and she loved it i trust this company , because i bought a stand from them a couple of years ago and it is still holding strong this is a must have product for anyone with a laptop i had a problem with one of the pins sticking out , and i e-mailed the company and they got back to me right away and sent the replacement out quickly i would recommend this company to anyone
i 've been using one of these for # . # years and it has made using the macbook pro more comfortable , especially when laying in bed or on the sofa the macbook pro sits well and does n't slide i have even fallen asleep with it on my lap and it has n't slid off i can plug things into the ports without worrying about the connectors and my iphone says nice and stable next to the macbook i use it at home and when i travel -lrb- with my larger laptop bag -rrb- i also use it on my desk and find the adjustable angle makes the laptop more comfortable unfortunately mine broke today when i applied a little too much energy when opening it and stressed the edge of the hinge i realize how much i miss it already i 'm ordering a replacement but will probably go to the store to pick it up since i ca n't wait for the shipping this is a great product for any laptop owner
i needed a backpack that would securely store my # `` ibook and a change of clothes on vacation , so i bought this on sale here at amazon when i got it , i was surprised at how big it was even though i did n't have much in it , it bulged out there are so many compartments that are hard to access quickly i also had trouble fitting it underneath the seat in front of me on the airplane i 'm sure many people will find this backpack very useful , like college students and such , but personally it was n't the right bag for me it did keep my laptop safe and secure though
this bag is really strong and has a lot of cushion for laptops but it 's very heavy and big i would n't like to carry it around without my laptop it <unk> a lot of space even if there is no laptop inside
good bag for the price only problem is when loaded up the bag is huge on my back a shoulder bag can carry the same , but with a slim profile
a bit heavy but it is very practical and definetly protects the laptop well in the inner pocket . well padded and comfortable to carry too . overall , i think this bag is worth my thirty <unk>
this backpack is great at this price one zipper on the large middle pouch does n't zip very easily , but is not really faulty ample and varied kinds of space , comfy shoulder straps the padded laptop case is appropriate for my # `` macbook , but a larger one would still fit someone else posted a review about the <unk> color looking silly , but i think it looks fine overall a very good backpack
this is a sturdy backpack that will easily accomodate your # . # `` laptop pockets are plentiful and well made zippers are sturdy lots of storage and great padding this will be our family 's third maxxum the grey color is actually silver so the picture above does n't accurately reflect how flashy the color is so if you do n't mind looking like one of the extras from an early <unk> `` <unk> `` video , it 's a great choice
the bag is nice , with lots of storage space and different conpartments the laptop <unk> is well-padded and secure i do n't like the look of the bag , but you ca n't complain given the price is so low
i bought this backpack for my boyfriend and he likes it a lot there are several advantages of it it has a number of pockets so you could seperate things neatly the size is relatively large and there is plenty of space you could store things additionally , it looks very nice finally , the prize is very reasonable
this is an excellent bag there are lots of pockets to organize and stash things there also is ample room for my laptop , books , and all kinds of other things that i carry with me to uni it is waterproof , and the straps have a good amount of padding to keep them from hurting my shoulders also , there is a great weight distribution so my tons of books do not seem as heavy as they could feel
the backpack has many compartments and plenty of additional room for books and folders there are n't many backpacks that accommodate a laptop and books , but this one does really well the materials are high quality the only issue i 've seen is the zipper for the books compartment is difficult to use with one hand because it 's not as smooth as i would have liked there are no problems with the other zippers
i found the quality of the bag to be great , it had what i wanted , more space , more pockets and the fabric and zips and the pads are amazingly comfortable great buy and the deliver was amazingly quick
for the money this is probably the best out there lots of <unk> so if you happen to use your laptop and it is still warm it helps <unk> the heat plenty of storage for wires and junk waterproof bottom is nice along with the headphone port if you on the fence i would recommend it
great product , highly recommend it , fits my # . # inch laptop , fits around # textbooks and a couple of folders , has many other pockets that are useful , overall , i 'm very satisfied
have been using this bag for just under # years now and i love it i use it for my # inch laptop and all the other electronic accessories i have -lrb- mouse , external hard disk and a few usb sticks -rrb- it is of very good quality , looks good , is durable and easy to clean -lrb- very important as i live in a dusty area -rrb- i recommend it highly for anyone looking for a spacious laptop backpack
it has everything i need in a backpack , room for my laptop , for my books , personal items for an on-the-go student it is all i could ask for very comfortable too
we bought this item four months ago for school and it has met all expectations the most notable difference is in the construction , cushioning and pockets the backpack it better made than any other we have purchased for school over the years in materials and stitching the extra cushioning is a great feature too , adding a lot of comfort against the back there is also a pocket for everything with easy access i wish i would have discovered it earlier
got this to carry computer and other items between home and work and on plane trips computer protection and airport quick access is excellent room for other items is very generous quality and workmanship and back padding and computer padding is first rate the chest straps are high , close to the neck - if i used them , they would be a <unk> , but i do n't find i need them
whenever i travel and i do n't have any <unk> , this is <unk> i use enough space for computer , <unk> , accessories and some clothes really good for carry on no matter the weight fits very good on your back and you can not fill the weight
without a doubt , this is the most outstanding backpack i 've ever owned or used it has an amazing amount of space , and perhaps more pockets than anyone could ever need even when loaded down , the shock absorbing straps fool your shoulders into feeling a much lighter load
you just ca n't beat it for < $ # just enough room for a # . # `` inspiron , plus accessory pockets galore i just really like the design and comfort factor the wife uses it mainly , and she puts it through hell and back so far , so good if you have any reservations , run by one of the office supply stores or the big box stores and take a look at it then get back on amazon and save $ #
this backpack rocks i bought it because i had a regular jansport backpack with only one pocket for books and papers plus my laptop in a laptop sleep i hated that setup so i bought this one and immediatly my mom wants me to but her one of these i highly recommend this bag for any student or anyone with a laptop i have a gateway and it fits snug into the computer section in the back and has left plenty of space for organizers and such that i must carry as a student with lots of assignments might pick up one for my mom as a gift , along with a laptop for her use
this is a great backpack for college it has pockets for everything and my # in . laptop fit in the laptop part perfectly i used it all # years in college , and it 's still in great shape so i definitely recommend it for college student or anyone who has to carry things around a lot like college students
i bought this two months ago and so far i 'm very satisified with it my # year-old thinks it looks very cool it holds the laptop in a very secure cushion , and most importantly , has room for a lunch box , the occasional extra item of clothing , etc . lots of extra pockets i do n't need but many i do . # <unk> zippers on the two big pockets where they 're needed , and not on the smaller ones where they 'd be a nuisance comfortable back and shoulder padding
a very nice backpack has a separate compartment for the laptop so you do n't have to take all your stuff out before you can reach it has shocks to make it easier on your back heavy duty zippers has an ipod compartment with a way to listen to music without leaving it unzipped
i bought one of these a couple of weeks ago when i got it i noticed the pieces that attached the straps to the bag were made of a cheap plastic i had my doubts that it would hold the weight of my # inch laptop and of course it could n't the strap broke and of course my laptop was damaged in the fall i should have returned the bad when i got it
bag itself was fine i used it to travel across the <unk> , but the flap clip would not latch properly at times so when i picked up the bag , it would flop open i expected more than `` okay `` quality , so i returned it
this item was no good from the get go it was not capable of my # inch laptop , and the text books i carry day in and day out i was also disgusted with the poorly designed to secure the bag i had to return this item
the item is of good quality and arrived in a timely manner the dimensions given must be outside i purchased this for my # . # inch laptop and it is a very tight fit in the section designed to pad the unit it will work , but not easily i am still happy with the case for the price , and i will not be transporting it often for daily use i think it would be <unk>
nothing too fancy about this bag but it does what it needs to and looks ok i 'm in no way blown away by it but i also think it was a good purchase it does it 's job
it 's always difficult to find a bag that could hold a # inch wide screen laptop and this bag fits my dell studio just right had it for a month and have had no problems with it hauled it around the airport with no problem material and construction are very good and has many sections and pockets for all your need at this price , this bag it 's a steal ! !
this is a good solid bag for the price holds most # & # # ; and smaller laptops with plenty of pockets and compartments nice padding for the notebook and a stout strap
this is a great bag for the price it came quickly and my # inch dell lap top fits snug but do not have to fight to get it in and out lots of room for cord and papers
i was an <unk> and needed a sturdy bag for my laptop and files i used this for a couple of months and the top handle broke so for light use may be a good option but not for intense use - airports , work , etc .
i brought this backpack as a gift for my boyfriend i thought that it was a trendy and cool look to sport a lab top bag pack i like that it did n't look like it was mint for camping in the woods i like that the lab top was secure inside of the backpack i like the compartments and most of all i liked the price only thing is when i opened up the box and took it out i notice that it said mobile she edge they do n't say that it is a female 's bag i thought it was universal for both men and women i took the tags off and gave it to him any way he loves it and i think it 's a great bag still
this is a great backpack for combining all your stuff along with your notebook computer i particularly like the flap which makes the compartments more secure there are separate compartments , so folders do n't get bent , nor do they slide down if there is n't much in the pack the front compartment has also <unk> which can hold pda , phone , pens , etc . the whole thing is a little square and bulky , but not uncomfortably so i use it on public transportation every day the straps are very comfortable as well it slips on and off easily backpacks are easier on the back than briefcases , but most of them do n't look very professional this one does
the bag seems a little big on my back - i am # ' - # `` woman also , the black interior makes it hard to find stuff inside , but that is true of most laptop bags but it is comfortable and does the job in an attractive package
i purchased this backpack to hold my laptop great padding to protect my computer , a bit bulky but i find that is typical of all well made computer cases i love the stylish design and the fact that i can carry it as a backpack there is a handle but it is at the top of the backpack since i am short carrying the case by the handle is a bit akward since the end of the case is then close to the ground it would be a nice feature to add a handle on the side so that you have the option of carrying it like a briefcase there are plenty of pockets to hold accessories , and pockets are deep to easily hold bulky adapters the faux leather finish and microfiber cloth gives it a professional and elegant look in my opinion it is the best computer case on the market for quality and style
i was using a swiss army backpack to tote my laptop and all it 's paraphernalia back and forth from work but it was just too bulky i looked for something slimmer and more compact but with a classy look to it and i found the mobile edge paris backpack i have been carrying it for months now , everyday , and it is comfortable and works very well for my purposes
i loved the backpack the first few times that i used it then after one month and very few uses , the shoulder <unk> falling apart the stiching fell out on both other than the straps which hold the pack to your back , it ` <unk> but why then would you buy a backpack
i have to agree with the other # star reviews the bag after a bit more than a year is really falling apart and i do n't use it that intensively now i will try to see if i can have a replacement
i use a lightweight laptop for portability & so i like backpacks to be comfortable and light somehow it feels like quite a load when carrying it & people have commented to me that it even `` looks heavy `` it also feels rigid and bulky and it barely holds more than a laptop and power cord on the other hand with all that bulk , there 's no doubt it will protect your laptop
i love the style , the look , and especially love the compartments however , there is minimal room to actually store things as a result of the lack of space , i have traveled with it very heavily packed -lrb- and yet nothing <unk> -rrb- to my <unk> , the front corner is starting to come apart
i ordered this notebook to hold my school-issued gateway tablet computer it is well-constructed and solid the computer is well protected with ample amounts of padding there is more than enough room to put all the standard cords and cables in the front velcro pocket i can put several folders and small paperback textbooks in the zippered compartment behind the front velco pocket each pocket also has room and compartments for assorted school supplies , calculators , <unk> books , etc . the straps are very well padded even though the computer weighs a lot for being a notebook , it hardly seems like any weight due to the strapping and solid construction it is well worth the money
this bag was better than i expected it is really well organized , very comfortable , and looks great it 's a great value , and with a lifetime warrenty , obviously the company stands behind it
