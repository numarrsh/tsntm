do n't be fooled by the <unk> <unk> comments about this this bag is not the same color as the picture it is like a dull used greyish pink color material is not cushiony its cheap , and as thin as paper low low low quality i would not pay # bucks even for this i usually do n't write reviews but this false
this is a really cheaply made piece of crap hardly durable , no handle and not very protective i would return it but do n't want to deal with the hassle save yourself the trouble
i never got it it 's been over a month and i could n't even contact the company to inform them of my missing package maybe it will show up in the mail one day until then , not happy
this is literally the s *** <unk> case i 've ever bought the laptop fits , but there is no protection whatsoever if you poke the case on the outside it makes dents <unk> the material , and those dents do n't go away this will only protect against scratches , but if you put this in your bag and it moves around then i doubt this case would do anything to protect it this is blatant false advertising , there is no memory foam i am returning this asap
i was wondering why the price on this cover for my macbook pro was good the product i received was certainly not a `` high density memory foam `` material there is no protection or padding for my computer , i would not feel safe even putting my computer in this sleeve to protect it from books in my bookbag i would return this product if it would n't cost me more than i paid for the original product shows me that you get what you pay for , do n't make the same mistake i did cheap cheap quality material , i 'm embarrassed for cosmos if they <unk> this product spend the extra money and protect your investments
it was pretty awful flimsy , ugly , trash overall it gets two stars for <unk> being made from memory foam as promised i ditched it in favor of a case logic case that i have had for two years now stick with a reliable brand
in the picture , this cover looks like a cute hot <unk> is what i wanted but when i received the cover in the mail , it was a darker magenta color it was n't what i wanted so i decided to return it also , when i received it , it had been crammed in the box so the cover was wrinkled and it just was n't very attractive and it was a little too thick for me as well i do not recommend this sleeve
as a whole , i like the product , but the zipper is really annoying i often times end up with the zipper getting stuck , which causes my computer to be stuck in the case
if you 're <unk> for somethign <unk> <unk> . . pay a little more . . it feels and looks cheap . but then - its not exactly costly . so you get what you pay for :
the protective cover is ok , i would have preferred it to be a bit more padded i keep my mac in it always , especially when transporting it i like the color , ease of use , zippers are good glad i have it
the padding on this seemed to flatten at a slightest touch i only used it for a week or two until i felt like it was no longer protecting my laptop
i 'm a college student and wanted something to protect my macbook pro but i have to say that after a week or two it got very dirty and is beginning to rip i carry it in my backpack that has a pocket for it and yet it still is ripping and dirty
i really like this product it has a sort of memory foam padding inside of it and i feel like my computer is very protected by it great price and great product
this came & works great , fits my # `` macbook pro perfectly it 's on ' y not quite perfect because the photos show it looking almost neon pink ... when in fact its a pale magenta ... so kind of a let down there i love the flap opening because i can plug in my laptop when it 's charging , while still in the sleeve so great functionality , but color was weak
i love this the reason i love this is because it is a great protection for your mac , but not only that you can also use it as a bag to carry it with you every where you go this is honestly a really good thing to have
i absolutely love this case the color is great , the the memory foam is awesome my laptop already has a hard shell case on it and it still fits nicely into the cover very handy when traveling would 've been better if it had a carrying handle but is still a very nice cover
this is used by a # year old every day , and has help up perfectly a great solution for extra padding and protection for the laptop the color is not quite as `` hot `` pink as the picture , though a bit darker than i expected
i bought this sleeve the same day i bought my new macbook pro # , just to have some protection while carrying it around the color is more red than the pink tone shown in the picture it 's almost a candy apple red but not as bright the one complaint i have is that it is a little too big my macbook slides a little within the sleeve which kind of defeats the purpose of having a sleeve for now it will work , but i will probably end up buying a better fitting sleeve
pretty , sturdy , and fits my # `` macbook perfectly best of all , the zipper opens all the way so i would n't have to take my macbook out to flip it open
there is so much i can say about this case i do a lot of traveling as a student and like most student we carry a lot of books and other gadgets in our bags i brought the red case -lrb- exact photo -rrb- and it really is memory form i own a macbook pro and usually buy the hard shell cases but this time i decided to stray away from the shell because of past screen issues with this case i know my laptop is secure its been almost a year now since i purchased this case and i have had no issues the case itself is thin but the memory foam makes up for that which allows me to slip folders , papers and sometimes books into my case logic -lrb- which i brought on amazon -rrb- travel backpack when the laptop is in the case i know that the memory foam will absorb any pressure but i try not to make a habit of putting books on my laptop
i love this cover ! its amazing and has everything that a good cover should its big , the colors wonderful , the material 's cozy and overall its awesome ! i am using a macbook pro # and this fits perfectly would highly recommend
i got this because i did n't know there were other options available i paid # for it and it was way too much it would be a good value for about # but more than that is far too much the tablet fits snugly into the case but if you have to remove it a couple times the case loosens up and no longer fits well when holding it in my hands the tablet will slowly slide out the bottom making the volume buttons at the top <unk> , very frustrating
nice case , fits snug , covers camera lens , and other areas <unk> for operation bought from staples , sent back just not user friendly and too expensive to just let lay around
i bought my iconia from costco with the case i really saved money but when it comes to functionality it really sucks it you need to access your micro sd card you need to remove the case before you are able to <unk> into it the aftermarket product like the <unk> which i bought is much better <unk> is very
so <unk> i assumed acer would make a good quality product to <unk> the i pad magnetic case the case is a very tight fit , with the right cut outs -lrb- apart from sd slot which is n't a big deal its thin , and the screen cover is n't rigid enough to fully protect the screen fully and then there 's the velcro , wow ! not magnetic , and not very sticky ... screen flap does exactly that ... unless its pressed tightly , mine flaps it works ok as a stand , although the screen rocks a bit , and the v shaped slot in the back is <unk> to insert the flap into overall its better than nothing , but i 'd hold off to see if a third party makes a <unk> value for money , product
i had this case for a week and half and did not like it first off , it 's expensive at $ # retail that 's way too much for this case the material is smelly , and attracts dust and debris and really <unk> the look of the tablet although its a tight fit , the tablet does slide down and out of the case when used in landscape mode because its not closed up at the bottom the feel of the case feels cheap and i do not like the seams along the edge at all the good things about it is that its super lightweight , and has a built-in stand , though i never used it i recommend <unk> cases i am currently using the <unk> folio case and its a huge improvement at half the price
i have had one of these for a couple years fits a # but us <unk> heavy , clunky , and tablet slides down when in easel mode controls home , return , etc on screen are covered up by frame much too heavy newer cases rely upon corner clips to hold unit and thereby expose more of tablet screen and controls for same see moko for nexus # . #
i love my acer iconia a # this love , however , is partially <unk> by my hate for this case sure , it protects my <unk> , but at what cost it does n't stay stationary when protecting my tablet it likes to slide into positions that block <unk> cameras like previous <unk> have mentioned , the material that compromises the case attracts a lot of dust when i do n't have a <unk> on hand i use the next best thing - which is of course , my tablet case that 's all i have to say about that .
the case is ok it fits the tablet well , but does not stay in place the tablet will slide down a bit when standing in the vertical alignment , which will completely cover the camera and the light <unk> actually , it slides down pretty much no matter what you do ... it could have been much better
pros : the cover has holes so you can plug in all of your <unk> <unk> : the cover is not sturdy and feels very flimsy there 's cheap velcro holding the front flap of the cover over the face of the tablet when i try to prop up my tablet the cover is not strong enough to hold it up w/out easily tipping over the equivalent cover for an ipad is much higher quality for the same price not impressed and will likely return
its not too bad a little too flimsy for me , especially the lid if this is in a bag or backpack i do n't think it will hold up , but i could be wrong
product felt really cheap smelled like it was placed in a <unk> full of <unk> ordered this & # # ; new & # # ; as well will keep it because i need a case , but will look for an alternative flap looks like it will fall off after a week when putting the tablet in a standing landscape position , it seems like it will slip just a bit so you ca n't get to the home button easily
in general i am fine with the case does n't feel valuable , but it is also not unpleasant there 's a <unk> flaw , though : it covers the microphone and results in a terrible <unk> quality when using skype , etc . . the microphone is located precisely under the little velcro dot fastener for the case -lrb- a little hole between screen edge and plastic case just right in the middle of the <unk> control side -rrb- one either has to lift that part of the case to gain back the normal microphone <unk> quality again or take the tablet out of the case the position under the velcro fastener makes it also difficult to create an additional microphone hole in the case yourself definitely a design failure , which is <unk> for the price of the case
the main thing about the case is that it offers a couple ways of standing the tablet these two functions are great , and work well with this case for that reason alone it may be worth buying , since your options are currently very limited the only other choice i 'm aware of is a $ # leather piece however , the fit and finish of the product is terrible i was very surprised to find , when first opening it , that there are exposed seams which run all the way around the edges of the case , where the two sides were <unk> together i could n't see this in the pictures of the product , and did n't expect such poor <unk> at a <unk> dollar price point acer did a great job with the tablet , and an absolutely horrible job with the case
as the # star rating pop-up suggests - `` it 's ok `` i bought my wife an off brand cover for her tablet for about $ # and it is better on her <unk> case the edge seam is on the inside which gives it a more finished look compared to this case which has an outside <unk> type edge hers also has # interior magnets to hold the cover down compared to this single and weak velcro <unk> does has access holes in all the right places as it is built specifically for the iconia tab
i got this case when i purchased my a # it does a pretty good job , but i 'm not thrilled that i have to remove it from the case to gain access to my sd card i 'm not sure about the other reviewers , but i have a hard time getting my tablet out since the fit is very tight i am going to look around for a different case since i do like to have access for the sd card but if you do n't need that , this case will work fine for you
this is an ok covering the tablet kind of slides around inside the opening , so the edges sometimes cover where you are trying to see or tap on something would also be nice if you could stand it up length wise not a bad case , just could be a little tighter fit , so it stays put construction is good , materials are nice
the camera holes on my case would not line up properly and i would constantly have to push the tablet back into the case whatever the case is made out of attracts tons of dirt and hair not to hard to clean off though , but should 've been made out of something different i do dig how thin they made the case though i will be returning this and wait till the roocase comes out for this sucker
it 's an okay cover but definitely not worth the $ # the thing that bugs me the most are the edges of the cover the edges stick out and are kinda hard so they dig into your hand while holding the tablet while inside the cover the other thing that bugs me is that the tablet will slip out a little while i 'm moving the unit around , this leads to the ports for connecting stuff covered up by the cover i 'm planning on returning this cover
the case is thin , functional and fits well i have no issues with the velcro tab as others have expressed while i would like a magnetic latch it would add to the thickness of the case i really like how thin the case is while still adding protection the stand feature is useful and works fine however , the case turns the slick design of the tablet into trash the welded <unk> edges are pretty cheap looking the case really should have been formed to a mold and had the seams trimmed unfortunately its pretty much the only option for this tablet right now at thirty bucks its okay but really should be around fifteen bucks , imho
like the look , however the stand seem to be getting weaker after each use -lrb- not able to hold its own weight other than that it 's great , flat , tight fit and slim
not a super tight fit better than nothing nice to be able to stand it up very slim , barely adds bulk or weight the longer i 've had the case the looser it fits tablet slides down and out of the case when used in landscape mode
i was n't happy with this case because it was n't the newest version to fit my acer it fitted well but the frame was n't align with my charger , ear piece and webcam overall , it would probably work better for a later version
this cover is fine in that it covers and protects the tablet however , it seems very pricey for what you get i would guess there is $ # - $ # of materials used in this cover too much <unk> i see the price has been reduced some but still too expensive i would suggest one of the other tablet cover options
this case was automatically sent with my iconia tab it was easy to fit in , but there were a few issues first of all , when holding the tablet in landscape mode , the tablet was prone to sliding out , since nothing covers the bottom second , the case was quite bulky , and considering the weight of the tablet , that was n't to good <unk> , holding it in portrait mode was quite uncomfortable , due to the velcro strap , which was located where most portrait <unk> would place their hands but it did at least provide some extra support for the tablet so i think it 's an okay case there are definitely other cases that are better , like the roocase
i have to agree with most of the reviews i 've read on here so far first , it is a little tight when you place your tablet in the first time but , that is a good thing you want a good fit and that is how it starts out however , after using it for about a week , my tablet has begun to slip slightly which causes it to cover parts of the screen as well as the <unk> camera i seem to be constantly adjusting it i 'm kind of concerned that over time , it will become even looser , rendering it unusable the one other big con i see in this cover is the fact that it does n't support the tablet when using the portrait view the price was n't an issue for me as mine was included in my purchase from costco overall , i do like the protection it gives my tablet
not a bad little case for protection from minor scratches and drops , but does n't really offer any padding also , the tablet tends to slip out and needs to be constantly adjusted the material seems a little flimsy , but i think it 's holding up alright
the cover is a great fit with no problems <unk> the ports seems to be durable i carry the tablet in my briefcase with lots of other things so i need the cover to protect the tablet
i like the product a lot it does a wonderful job of protecting the tablet and providing a stand for it without adding to the size or weight my only gripe is that it does n't have a opening to give access to the micro sd card , it would be perfect if that was fixed
this is a really nice cover it does have a couple of issues smells kind of funny when brand new but that <unk> after a few days i read the reviews before buying and the one thing that rings true with me is the tablet slipping just a little in the case the way it is configured , the tablet when in the upright position , sits with the opening to the bottom & it slides down just a little bit it is enough to partially cover the forward facing camera i do n't skype or anything but it bugs me & i find myself constantly adjusting the tablet in the sleeve that said , i am really happy with the sleeve otherwise & think it was a good value
while this case wo n't likely `` wow `` you with its quality and construction , its functionality eventually wins out in the end my first thought was that the welded seams were unsightly and made the device seem larger than it actually is - which it does on my second thought , i can see how extra bulk might better protect the tab if its dropped on its edges , and <unk> its not adding that much to the overall size of the tab the velcro fastener for the <unk> was also somewhat of a letdown as i was expecting a slicker magnetic closure like the ipad # cover overall , a worthwhile accessory for the a # the kickstand feature is worth it alone as it makes typing and watching videos a hassle free experience
i actually like this case it is lightweight and pretty snug , so it does n't make the overall package too bulky i also like the fact that it covers the corners completely , and the seam sticks out to provide a little extra padding my guess is that if it gets dropped , most of the time , its going to be the corners and edges that get the impact a lot of cases have the corners of the tablet exposed , which i do n't really like the tablet does seem to slide out just a bit , obstructing the camera , and part of the screen at the bottom its kind of annoying to have to constantly push it back up it would be nice if there were a flap at the bottom to tuck under the tablet and into the back of the case to hold it more firmly i think the $ # price tag may be a little high too , but then it is oem
actually it is an excellent product , it fit perfectly to the iconia a # , even though this is the lowest price that i have found , it is in any case too expensive for a case
the protective case is just a thin case that turns into a stand i do n't think its worth $ # tho more like $ # but it keeps me from having to hold my iconia then it makes it easier to <unk> the net , play games , video chat and take pictures overall it does what it suppose to do you will still need a sleeve or something to keep the dust and etc out
that 's about the best i can say it 's a basic $ # case including shipping i like how the corners are covered and padded that 's where you want to protect your investment
super speedy delivery ordered it on a wednesday and got it on saturday product exactly as described fits perfectly on my acer iconia tablet and does a great job protecting and standing it up satisfied ! :
i thought it might be different than the one that originally came with my tablet but its identical and i 'm happy fits perfect and i 'm used to it i just wish acer was smart enough to make an access slot for the micro sd card
i had heard mixed reviews about this case for the acer iconia by acer then i caught a good price for it on amazon and placed an order i have to say that i personally like it ... a lot the case i had prior was a bit bulky and did n't fit the tablet to a tee this case is very lightweight , not bulky at all and fits my tablet like the skin on a <unk> she looks beautiful in it
so far , i am quite pleased with this product ; it is slim , yet provides a decent level of protection for the tablet i especially like the ability to prop up the device up in two different ways for better viewing this professional looking case provides access for all buttons and input spots my only complaint is that the material seems to attract dust , <unk> it to look dirty very easily , however it is easy to clean overall i am happy with this purchase
this `` slim fit `` case for the # `` macbook air is about half an inch too short which means the snap closure can not reach around the end of your the laptop on top of that my case arrived with a <unk> , bent snap closure which could not be fastened even with an empty sleeve very poor quality control on the part of speck too bad because the thick faux saddle leather design is actually quite nice
excellent form factor , design , and build quality -- but too small the sleeve leaves about # -inch of my # macbook air # `` exposed at the open edge , making the snap difficult to close speck customer service <unk> this as a known problem with `` some `` <unk> -lrb- bad batch ? -rrb- otherwise a nice , sleek sleeve -- but unless you have the <unk> to gamble , i would wait until <unk> are <unk> out returned to amazon
this carrier is sleek , elegant , low profile and light weight the computer sits very snugly in it and would never slip out if is cover was not <unk> close the only thing i would change is that i would make it on quarter of an inch longer so it could completely cover the laptop i would also make it easier to clasp close -- the tab to do that is an eight of an inch too short i 'm still very happy with my purchase
the sleeve fit is snug and feels great the sleeve surely gives the protection i have been looking for the look is premium and the leather feels great only cause that is making me not give a five star rating is that because its so snug its a little difficult to take out the macbook air other than that its a great sleeve and i recommend it
i really like this sleeve it looks professional and does n't add a lot of bulk to my macbook air # `` -lrb- which makes traveling with it in my tote bag easy -rrb- i wish it was real leather -lrb- - # star -rrb- , but at least amazon sells it for much less than the listed $ # bucks the inside also has some of that soft fuzzy stuff that is seen in their <unk> or those incase plus sleeves my macbook looks just like the the one in the picture when it is in the sleeve
flimsy product , cheaply made , smelled very unpleasant and i have n't even taken it out of the plastic packaging yet horrible product , i 'd rather put my laptop in a paper bag
this is not a good product i have a # `` macbook air and bought this case to go with it due to the macbook air 's edges it caused the case to develop a tear after # days i 'd suggest buying something that has a bit more <unk> to the design its a good looking case and my air fit well , it just does not stand up to everyday usage
the product does not match the picture at all it has the very large words `` macbook air `` embossed on it and the workmanship is very poor the red string dots are not even centered the pictures of the product do not have the words embossed on it i am not using it to hold a macbook air , but rather a surface pro
i ordered this product for my asus # . # in ultrabook this sleeve does not fit it is far too small which leads me to wonder if it will actually fit any # . # computer
when it got the case it looked pretty much like i expected , not too plastic-like to be obvious , but definite not faux leather looking when i took it out of the clear shipping bag i was hit with an intense & # # ; fishy & # # ; smell that was way too <unk> to overlook i tried airing it out , i even put a new dryer sheet in it , but the smell actually took over the dryer sheet too this is day three of the airing process and though it is less pungent now , the smell still lingers and i continue to have reservations about putting my new mba in it would not buy it again , sadly , and will go back to my <unk> bookbook
i just got this case the other day and i 'll have to return it i wanted a little something extra on top of my case cover for travel unfortunately my macbook air does n't fit in here because i have a case cover on it other than the size needing to be slightly bigger this seems like a good product so if this is you only form of protection for your # `` macbook air than you might love it
the material is a lot cheaper than i expected also i purchased this to use with an # . # in laptop , and it does n't fit i kind of figured that the hassle would n't be worth it to return , so oh well if it actually fit i would use it even if it does n't have the amount of cushion i was expecting
i returned the first one because the edging material -lrb- a kind of plastic used to seal the edges -rrb- peeled off leaving the sleeve fraying the second one was n't peeling , but the edging is cracked and looks like it will peel pretty soon what can you expect for # <unk> other than that , it is <unk> and the material is strong they just need to seal the edges all around with a more durable material
wanted to use this for my # . # `` samsung chromebook but it will not fit properly i managed to squeeze -lrb- was n't easy -rrb- about half the chromebook in before i called it quits and had to have an extra pair of hands pull the chromebook back out quality seems okay and it looks great but not for chromebook users
maybe i should have known my computer is # . # & # # ; in dimension so i ordered the case to fit accordingly when it arrived , it was nearly impossible to fit the computer in , and i had to cut it open to even get the computer out take caution , and buy the next size up for some breathing room other than that , the quality was okay for what it costs and was advertised size is my only complaint
in general , the case is great able to protect your laptop from the daily <unk> in a bag filled <unk> items i would not want to drop my laptop with it though as the protection is definitely limited the main main flaw however is that it is too tight for the air i felt like i could break the air just <unk> get it out of the case
this case is priced right , and protects against surface scratches i get some nice comments on this item however , it offers only the most minimal protection against short falls - i dinged a corner on both the macbook and the case by dropping from a short height just keep a tight hold on your laptop and do n't expect much <unk> protection from this very thin case
this product is ok i liked it for what it was and it was a decent price but it 's not the best quality i ended up returning it and buying a higher quality case for # bucks more from speck
i bought this sleeve to use with my new samsung google chromebook since the dimensions were the same after it arrived , it was too thin for my chromebook and i had to return it so i recommend only buying this for your macbook air model that 's listed in the description also , the construction is a little flimsy i read other reviews where the stitching came loose i did n't have this long enough to test it , but i could see that happening
its ok for the price , it fits well , but i think it could have been better made i recommend it to anyone looking for an inexpensive way to protect their mac air
the other reviewer was correct in that the red string easily gets disconnected but it 's an easy thing to just reattach it provides adequate protection from scratches but will certainly not provide enough protection when dropped it 's also a passable disguise when i 'm walking around the city on my way to a client meeting recommended buy - good value for the money
good case , fits well only reason its not getting a full five star is because its low quality material and edges are already fraying apart after only a month of use
my boyfriend was keeping his macbook air in a brown envelope bc he needed protection , but did n't want any extra bulk i found this sleeve as a funny <unk> to his previous case turns out it really was perfect bc it is so very slim and a perfect fit for his macbook air the velcro stays closed alone , or you can use the cute little red string for guaranteed closure :
i bought this pouch to protect my mba from knicks and scratches while it 's in my backpack and the pouch does exactly that i also like that it 's a <unk> to the original mba <unk>
i 'm pretty happy with this case , although the red circles for the string do n't line up exactly and are rather flimsy but the velcro is there to keep it shut so it does n't really matter i expected it to be a lighter color though , the real thing is a bit darker than the picture
i love it is case , it was everything that i want it , i got for my mac book air # inc and it just what i need it
it 's cute , the red tabs do n't match up , but it 's not that big a deal to me i just received it so i do n't know how well it will stay together , but it seems like it 's pretty well put together otherwise it 's simple and lightweight so it should work just great you ca n't beat the price
this is the perfect laptop case for the macbook air i get lots of compliments on this all the time at work it really <unk> how slim the macbook air is i have had it for about a year now and it has not frayed or torn at all
got a lot of people asking what 's in the envelope this is great if you do n't want to show up with a notebook case thin , lightweight ... keeps resisting abuse since # months ago i just loved bought another cover here which is also great , but this one got me hooked up
remember the macbook air presentation by steve jobs ... the mba was in an envelope on a table to show how thin and light this jewel is this cover is a <unk> to that presentation , light and simple its not made in leather and is not an <unk> cover
it has been more that # months , holding great , no flaws nowhere you can <unk> like this in such price shipping was much <unk> than i expected .
we are very happy with this sleeve for our macbook air fits it perfectly , looks good and the velcro on the tab is added security so it does not drop
this case is exactly what i wanted it provides some protection with minimal bulk since i will primarily use it inside a larger case containing other items such as my ipad it protects adjacent items scratching and bumping into each other the fit is snug still easy and quick to use perfect for for my macbook air my only reservation , the closing string is much longer than i need , requiring extra time to secure the lid easily fixed by cutting to to my preferred length
for the price i figured i 'd take a chance on this little sleeve it is actually very nice looking , & very well-made the stitching is especially nice i like the fact that it looks just like leather but is n't the envelope look is also very cute the red string was a bit long so i cut it down it 's not really necessary as there 's velcro as well , but it does complete the look perfect case for me , & quite an amazing deal
its been a year since i purchased this case and it is still holding up i love it people often think that i have important files that i carry around when its really my laptop . love
product arrived a day early it is a unique case for my mba the only thing i would change about this product would be to improve the quality or increase the size of the velcro or incorporate a zipper to prevent the mba from accidentally slipping out it is a great buy at a good price and i would purchase another one
it is n't leather but who cares very good color the velcro works great and i always use the strings because it just really looks so good when i take it out of my bag always get comments oh and it fits perfectly too
i purchased this macbook envelope to protect my laptop from minor jostling in a backpack i wanted something form fitting so it would not add bulk to my load i received this item very quickly after ordering and was super impressed for the price this item is more than a great purchase my macbook air # `` fit perfectly , not too snug or too loose , and the quality was way higher than i expected this was definitely a great purchase
you get what you pay for the felt string fell off after a couple weeks the cover looks good and provides the amount of protection i need for my macbook air
first , some context - this is a cheap cover for your macbook air the material feels cheap , the little strip of velcro is cheap - nothing about this screams ` quality ' ! ! ! having said that , it 's good for the price the little red string fell off of mine after a few weeks of use , but it 's fairly pointless anyway - the velcro underneath does more to hold the flap closed than the string does anyway the macbook air is protected nicely in the case , which is the most important point and it 's absolutely as slim as it could be - there is n't any <unk> space or unnecessary bulk so - # stars if the string had stayed on it would get # stars the review is price based - for the price , it 's a good deal
i really like this case and would definitely buy a new one but keep in mind this is n't a hight quality case that will last forever it is a good looking sleeve that is n't that expensive and will last a few months the string gets caught on the velcro from time to time and starts to fray the red button toggle to wrap the <unk> around starts to fold over and get floppy that being said i 've had mine for a couple of months and still really like it
