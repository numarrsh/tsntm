i purchased this case for my mac air and found it to be too small even though the product information said it was made for a mac air it was also stiff however , i did like the look if it had been one half inch wider it would have fit much better i had trouble putting the mac in the case and then pulling it out
the fit is a bit weird , and if you try to put even a slim case on it will be difficult to use i ended up returning it since it would be too difficult to use regularly the padding seemed pretty nice overall though
fit too tight for lenovo yoga # pro you can get it in there if you really try hard but you 'll need a couple of people to get it out was n't a fan of the heavy duty velcro either it 's just too loud especially if you are late to a meeting , class or library the vinyl covering is a bit hard also so it does n't take shape around the laptop which makes it bulky i ended up sending it back and getting a brenthaven <unk> # prostyle ultrabook # <unk> fits perfect with better materials and a <unk> zipper
i used to have the speck hard skin for my macbook air , but that broke off in small pieces within a couple months of usage i decided the thin nature of the air would benefit more from a sleeve for the money , this sleeve is alright it does its job but it is n't snug around my # `` macbook and the velcro closure is annoying after a while i use this sleeve to protect my laptop in my backpack but pulling it in and out of the sleeve all the time is becoming more of a hassle due to the velcro closure
this sleeve fits my # macbook pro w / retina nicely i like how easy and fast it is to use , and the color is pretty my main concern is that the edges are <unk> and not sewn i hope they do not come apart
very nice case that first the macbook air very well and pretty snug i agree with other reviews that say the velcro is loud it really is but other than that , i really like this case
i just bought this today and it fits the retina # `` perfect i 've been having a hard time finding a sleeve that would fit the retina model as it 's much slimmer than the # mbp i 'm only giving it # starts for now because it seems like it 's a great sleeve , but i still need to test it out i do n't like how the flap folds over because it adds width , but on the plus side there 's not a zipper like on the neoprene sleeves that could scratch up the computer update : my wife says the pattern on the front looks girly i may take it back for a more <unk> product , but there are n't that many cases out there that fit the retina or air really good as this case does i agree with the other reviewer that it is a bit noisy when opening
i really like this sleeve for the price it fits my retina mbp perfectly and feels like a sturdy barrier between the mbp and the external environment it is sleek looking , soft on the inside , and it does n't add too much bulk easily fits in backpacks , briefcases , etc . . the only real con is that the velcro that seals the sleeve is very strong and therefore very loud this is probably good from a protection standpoint , but it is very bad from a & # # ; discretely pull out my laptop in a board meeting , library , or classroom & # # ; standpoint if it were n't for the very loud velcro , i would have definitely given this product # stars
bought this for my dell xps # ultrabook fit the computer well , but the case is taller than the laptop so there was some space left over overall , it is a pretty good sleeve there is not too much padding , but the shell should protect laptop from scratches , but not hard bumps or drops the flap is velcro , and that it keeps the flap closed very well i personally do not like velcro , so i ended up replacing this with a sleeve that uses magnetic flap
this case was gift and the recipient was very happy with the appearance and structure the only thing we 'd wished was different is that it had a convenient place for cords but its definitely very sleek and techie
i got this case for my ultrabook -lrb- samsung ativ # -rrb- it looks great and fits my laptop perfectly the only problem i have with it is that the velcro is very loud when opening the case when i 'm at my college library or somewhere quiet , it can draw attention when opening it other than the sound issue , it is still a great case and an amazing value at the current price -lrb- sub $ # -rrb- i would buy it again
the protection level is very strong with this product i would like to see on modification , a place to store your cables for recharging would be nice then again you would probably loose the thin non-bulky style that attracted me to the case it stays closed , is easy to grab and hold very nice case , but i challenge you to open it quietly
for a mac air # ' such a well made case it just feels like a case <unk> would have my only problem was that if you have a cover on your mac , prepare for the struggle this case is made to be the only cover your mac will need ; any additional girth will make it difficult to <unk> your mac from the case i 've owned this case for # weeks with a hard cover on my mac yeah it 's broken in some , but the fit is still quite snug
good quality , attractive , durable , <unk> but contains pretty loud velcro i would definitely recommend it , but not for people who need to open their laptop case in quiet places all the time
i buy things like this on impulse every now and then realize how limited they are in their use . e.g . there is no room for the charger in this so this is pretty good if you want to carry your mac for like # hours but not when you are on day trips or even going to work i know it 's my fault which is why i am not rating the product lower , but the product does have limited functionality compared to say a backpack
firstly , i must note that case is not compatible with the non-retina macbook pro i purchased two of these ; one -lrb- black -rrb- for myself and another -lrb- pink -rrb- for my girlfriend they both look phenomenal and are adequately <unk> resistant they fit the new # & # # ; macbook pro -lrb- with retina -rrb- very well ; i honestly doubt there is a better fitting case -lrb- regardless of price -rrb- for this model however , the non-retina macbook pro gets stuck , and i mean stuck , in this case and is simply unusable as other reviewers have mentioned , there is an obnoxiously loud <unk> sound when opening i have found this quite uncomfortable when taking my computer out in certain settings -lrb- e.g . , <unk> , library , etc . -rrb- <unk> the oddly loud velcro , i would have given this product # -stars overall , i would recommend this product to anyone with a macbook pro -lrb- retina -rrb- or a macbook air
clean and modern looking , wipes clean , provides moderate protection when travelling , but not so much as to be bulky pretty sure it wo n't help in the event of a long fall got it on a goldbox , i doubt i 'd pay $ # dollars for it otherwise
i like this case quite a bit ; i ordered it for my # inch macbook pro the first time i tried to put it on it was like trying to stuff a <unk> , but the second and <unk> times were much easier , yet still difficult i do appreciate that it is tight however , and i expect that it will loosen up more it feels very secure , and i like the fact that it is water proof be warned , however , because the velcro is <unk> loud and is sure to draw attention from any surrounding people
the good thing about this cover is the fact that it 's rain proof my sony vaio pro # & # # ; fits perfectly inside i did n't give the # th star because it does feel very plastic , not something in the high grade category
i have had this sleeve for a couple of months now and it has done a great job protecting my zenbook it fits wonderfully -lrb- i do n't have any other case on in -rrb- and is great for carrying my zenbook around my laptop has also fallen a couple of times while in the sleeve in the case and everything was fine i would give it # stars if the velcro were not so loud there are times i was afraid to take my computer out during class because of how loud it is , but for day to day activities , it 's fine
great case , however , like everyone else is probably saying : it can not be stressed enough how ridiculously loud the velcro on this case is opening it in public is always so much fun -lrb- <unk> -rrb- cause everyone instantly turns to see what that noise was i have taken to simply tucking the top flap in so i do n't have to even deal with the velcro anymore
i like this case for the most part it has a <unk> inner lining , laptop just slips right in over it , nothing around to scratch the laptop -lrb- like a zipper -rrb- outer shell is a flexible rubbery material slides into and out of backpack easily very good choice of materials not the biggest fan of the velcro i think they went overkill a little if i get to class late or want to take my laptop out it sounds like the building is coming down -- really <unk> pull on the velcro
phenomenal . ! ! ! got this for my toshiba ultrabook also purchased a cover case that slips onto the laptop -lrb- snaps on -rrb- <unk> the price i think $ # . # free shipping . . . $ # plus in retail outlets ... $ # . # @ other online sources very sweet ! ! !
this case fits my apple macbook air # -lrb- # model -rrb- inch like a glove it could probably fit other # inch ultrabooks but not thick laptops when closed it completely seals off the laptop from outside environment due to extra material that is hidden in the inside case this case is scratch resistant and partially impact resistant due to the hard material on it also it may help absorb some of the forces of impact if you were to drop it the case is water resistant so if you spilled coffee on the case or had it sitting out in the rain for half an hour i feel it would be fine i doubt it would last more than five seconds if it were <unk> under water this case offers superior protect for a fraction of the price jump on this if you need a case for your # inch macbook air or similar laptop
after extensive shopping around and comparison , i chose this for my new macbook air # inch it is strong , has no zips to deal with -lrb- velcro -rrb- and is water resistant because of the way the lip closure is built really if you dropped water on the case it likely would n't get through to the laptop , but lets avoid testing that theory it 's also fairly sleek without too many fussy details so i think both men and women will like the style i do n't know about other laptop sizes but it fits the macbook air # inch perfectly a good buy if you live in the uk as the product with shipping was about # which was much cheaper than buying it in london arrived weeks earlier than the estimate i got at the time of ordering
the case is slim and still provide enough protection i like the hard edges , which will help to reduce impact when the case is dropped on its corner it 's also a lot cheaper than similar products in stores
this is a great cover every bit as nice as the thule covers that cost significantly more i use this with my chromebook pixel i do n't worry about dropping it or it getting rained on
one of the best over there fits my new mac pro # & # # ; # version <unk> and seems was made from good <unk> the only negative thing is the loud sound when you open it in a quite please , but later you will used to it
this case fits perfectly for this macbook it is not too soft perfect to carry around colour is great . -lrb- maybe not a colour for a male -rrb- good looking too would recommend it
this is a great case for your mb air , really protects the computer from just about everything i would not have a problem buying this product again or <unk> anyone pick this up for their computer
product is obviously very well constructed sure , the velcro is loud , but it is a very reasonable trade off for water resistance just make sure to check the actual dimensions of your laptop my sony duo # is # . # inches across -lrb- screen size # . # -rrb- and the fit was ridiculously tight , to the point where i was concerned i would hurt my laptop taking it out amazon is great with returns , though , and this product deserves # stars even if it would not work for my particular laptop
this is the best case i bought so far for my mba # & # # ; # & # # ; protects very well all around the edges and has padding on back and extra on front side velcro is nicely fit tight , and overall very slim must have if own a mba ! ! !
for my previous laptops , i had to -lrb- eventually -rrb- buy a leather laptop bag because the ones made of fabric tore within # months leather bags are waterproof , but they are slightly too heavy for my preference i needed a bag for my mba and this is great i have been using it for a few months and it still looks like brand new it 's light and waterproof ; great alternative for leather i am thankful that my bag came a week earlier the mba was really fragile
this is a great case for computers it is solid and very secure like other people have mentioned , the velcro is a bit loud but it is very useful for a tight seal this case will fit a # inch macbook pro , but it will be tight overall , a great case especially for the price i would recommend it
i love the durability and thickness of this case it feels much more resistant to water and liquids than a neoprene case , and sturdier and more protective as well it was a good price as well
perfectly fits my # inch retina macbook and i dont use any case on my laptop , but seems like even if you have a case on the sleeve should without any
i absolutely love this case it makes you feel safe that your laptop is inside the only downside i found was the velcro slightly noisy when you 're opening it up in a study area
it is a tight fit for my macbook air # inch when it has its hardcover case on it , but it fits i put it in my backpack , it is comforting to know that my laptop has extra protection at this price , a great deal
gotten it to house my sony vaio duo # , n it fits it like a snug n it 's water proof at this price <unk> , <unk> else can i ask for
this case fits like a glove for my # inch sony vaio touchscreen ultrabook it is thin enough that even with the <unk> , my ultrabook takes up very little space in my briefcase
got it with lightning deal for # . # love the case , since i 'm always afraid to get my laptop wet when it 's raining this case is water proof perfectly and it can even fit my # late retina macbook pro even it has a plastic case on it
a measured improvement over the thule gauntlet case <unk> are sewed on instead of being glued on the <unk> - nice low profile fit for mba and series # - great build quality - waterproofing is a nice feature for added assurance on rainy days - pricecons - vecro is really <unk> in all , solid buy for the # . # i paid would pay regular price for this piece
fits my macbook # retina display perfectly , even with a hard shell case now i feel confident that my investment will be protected when i carry it around in my backpack , etc . i 'm pleased
amazon sells this item cheaper than case logic does i have a hp spectre ultrabook and this is hands down the best case you can get for it i throw it in my back pack and it is very reassuring ! ! <unk> some people hate the velcro * but i dont mind it i do see it loosing its
i love this case it 's light and fits my # & # # ; macbook air really well i feel confident that the durable material will protect my computer from liquids it 's easy to open and close , and the felt lining makes it super easy to slide the computer into and out of
i spilt water on my last mac book pro in the bag pack so this is the safety guard for my new mac book air it 's hard to find <unk> and water proof sleeve for mac book air , but this one does them both the sleeve is light , chic , fit perfectly with mac book air , does n't take much space in my bag on top of that , the price is reasonable love it and hope it comes with more color
feels durable and solid overall a little snug on my macbook pro # inch but it fits with some slight maneuvering one thing is that due to the high quality velcro , its going to make a very noticeable <unk> sound it 's not that big of a deal but in a quiet environment like a library you will probably <unk> a few people
i had initially planned to purchase the thule branded sleeve however , after reading some of the reviews i opted to spend a little less on the case logic sleeve this is for my son to take his mba to school in his backpack i can confidently know that along with his books and other school work his mba will not get banged up the velcro holds the sleeve tightly closed and the cushion seems sufficient , yet keeps added bulk to a minimum
the case logic <unk> # offers moderate protection at an affordable price i purchased this product specifically because it is well padded , water resistant , and welded -- qualities i did n't <unk> in similarly priced cases the build quality of this case is top-notch it is a welded case , important both for its water resistance and structural durability stitches hold the main body velcro in place , but the seams are tough and the stitching is not loose anywhere the velcro underneath the flap is welded into the flap itself it fits snugly around a # `` macbook air , and the velcro closure holds it firmly in place the `` loud velcro sound `` that other reviewers mention is , to me , quite subdued it is not a bother at all i trust soft velcro -lrb- more than metal zippers -rrb- to keep my computer scratch-free
after trying out a variety of cases that were too <unk> for my late # & # # ; retina macbook pro , i finally turned to this case and it has worked great the case fits the mbp very snugly , but it is not difficult to close the soft lining works well to not scratch the aluminum of my computer the flap closes very tightly , and is loud to open , but i 'd rather it be loud then have my computer fall out of the case
i was looking for some case for my mbpr # ' hopefully , i decided to buy this one and it was a great decision this case perfectly protects my mac moreover , water proof is a great feature here , i do n't have to worry about small moisture on it
when i looked at the picture , i expected it to be kind of stiff and tough it 's much better than i had expected and the material is wonderfully waterproof it looks modern and sleek fits my laptop like a glove there 's a fold inside of the cover -lrb- velcro -rrb- that secures even more protection i dig it
its very discreet and passes as a document folder so it allows me to carry my ultrabook without fear of being robbed it has a <unk> look despite the material it does not look like leather at all , but the rugged surface and design makes ir professional
the fit and finish is good but what really disappoints me is the shoulder strap clips the make an annoying clicking sound this bag would have been # stars if if this problem did n't exist kind of disappointed
a nice looking case with a good feel the only weak point i have found is the zipper the main zipper does not zip anymore it stopped zipping after about a month
this case is made of good quality material and is put together well the laptop fit 's in snug and is a little difficult to get out sometimes <unk> after time it will be easier
i like this bag well enough although i am no longer employed so i do n't have a need to have a huge amount of extras to carry around i mainly use this to carry my laptop when traveling it does not have all the extra pockets that some larger bags have a business person may not like this bag as well for that reason it has a padded interior pocket for my kindle fire hd which is convenient as i always take that along also all in all i am very happy with this purchase
i like the design , very spacious , durable , the only reason i give it # stars because just i wish the material would be better it already show a clear the sign of use just by couple days . the shoulder traps and plastic piece of the trap material are cheap
very impressed with this laptop / tablet case its has a fine fit and finish to the stitching as well as strong manageable zippers main laptop compartment fits my dell inspirion # . # inch very well main compartment contains additional sleeve for tablet with cloth lining front pocket has padded lining with multiple additional storage pockets shoulder strap and clips are strong and briefcase handles are wrapped with a padded neoprene material that makes for a comfortable grip great product from case logic
strong sturdy bag with enough space to pack your headphones or extras definitely a good bag to choose if in doubt the outside finish is very nice and you can either wear it with the long shoulder straps or if you can choose to hold it by the short handles
i 've been looking for a suitable carrying case for my # & # # ; hp laptop this case appeared for the pictures to be & # # ; beefy & # # ; enough with padding for protection , <unk> not being too bulky ; and it is it also featured adequate storage for the extras that accompany my unit it was attractively priced too i have other case logic items , so i was n't worried about the quality of the item a very satisfying purchase it arrived quickly from the vendor
this is in no way a laptop bag . it is more for notebooks and ipads also , if it is indeed a laptop bag , amazon or the seller must indicate what the dimensions of the laptop that would fit in this bag would be in this case , netbook sized laptops or just simply put , netbooks and ipads . i am returning this item since my # `` laptop wont fit
we bought this bag as a companion to the <unk> # that was too small to carry a dslr camera or a laptop we took both on a trip to uk / scotland , and were very pleased with the relative capacity of each the construction is fabulous and the security features very reassuring
i bought a pacsafe # metro bag before , and put it on top of my bike rack , and it touched the tire the friction carved out a hole i decided to replace it with a bigger and newer model the # <unk> is bigger , but still compact enough to put it inside my backpack -lrb- airline can only allow # max carry-ons -rrb- i like the bigger size , and the strap is easier <unk> my shoulder -lrb- more flexible now that the shoulder pad is velcro open and i can put it right on the metal adjustment bracket the cons are minor - wish the bag has more organization pockets , and perhaps a cell phone holder some where external very nicely built bag , and the peace of mind when i travel to a pick pocket friendly country
this bag is just the right size and shape for commuting to work with a tablet or laptop , a newspaper , a folder or two and book to read on the metro it 's lightweight yet strong ; comfortable shoulder strap pad to distribute weight if you happen to pack it full like i do front pocket under flap and two side pockets nice for easy access to telephone , keys , wallet , small # liter water bottle , small umbrella etc . . overall a great practical bag
i just received this case today , and while i was pleased with the color , this case is very cheaply made the real problem , however , is that there was no protective packaging on this case , so it arrived already broken i even tried using superglue to fix it and it did not work i will be returning this case , and i do not recommend buying it
the product looks great but it does not fit in my white mac book i 'm in trouble cause i bought all the accesories to my mac in the same color ! ! ! ! ! i am reallly really disapointed .
the case was too big , did n't even fit my laptop and very disappointed now i have a useless piece of plastic in my room laying around i want my money back
the case was very poor quality , within a week some parts of the bottom half of mine broke off and now i ca n't even use it if you move your computer around a lot -lrb- take it to <unk> -rrb- i would not recommend this
this is absolutely ridiculous it does n't even fit on my laptop i just got it in the mail today and it 's too big to stay on it the color is nice but seriously not worth all the hype do not get this if you want a good fitting case this is for the # inch white macbook , right so frustrated and definitely returning
i was super excited when this came in the mail i had been looking for an affordable cover for a while and thought i had finally found one turns out its affordable for a reason pieces off the bottom cover pretty much just started <unk> off after a week or so i kept finding little <unk> in my bag it finally stopped snapping in so i returned it
i was really excited for this cover but i was quickly disappointed when not even two days of having it on did the whole bottom part break apart it 's a shame because the color is so pretty i keep it on for the color but the bottom piece is constantly falling off since the tabs that were meant to hold it together broke off
i expected this case to be rubberized and to look like the one in the photo when i received it , i was really disappointed with how cheap it looked and how it was hard plastic , not rubberized at all or anything like the one shown
this cover works really well and looks great it really helps protect the computer i did see one fairly serious problem with this cover i found that the shiny gloss of the mac book -lrb- white -rrb- actually got really scratched up from the cover so , if you plan to always use this cover that 's great but i would not suggest just using it for a week then removing it because there may be some scratches on your computer
the color is beautiful , really <unk> blue , my computer looks very nice however , the quality is not the best , the bottom broke like # days after i got it i am still using the top
it is an ok case not as good as the ones for mac aluminum 's but it does its work in protecting a little bit the out side of the computer however it accumulates to much dust under it and if you do n't clean it often the same dust can scratch the sensitive plastic that apple built these white macbooks the color was nice
the color is great but the bottom part of the case has broken off in three places near the back side of my computer which is pretty disappointing i would n't say that it 's high quality
it fits perfectly on my # inch white macbook but it 's not as it appears in the picture the pink is a deeper pink which is really disappointing would have returned it but i 'm selling my computer , case included so it does n't matter much
it definitely protects the computer but it gets really dirty and it allowed dirt on the inside a little bit as well . it also doesnt click perfectly onto the
after using for a while it is breaking at the clips i was surprised it was so <unk> it was good for about # months my computer is getting old and shows wear and need a <unk> one <unk> if i can find a different brand but it was n't branded
this case is a beautiful color and i love the way it feels , but on the top corners of the screen bit , the smooth rubber thing is peeling off also , it smudges very easily so be
well actually they did n't have the rubberized pink ones but the seller contacted me and told me they were out and gave me the hard plastic i think my sister would have liked the rubber better but the plastic pink worked
this is a good buy for the money the color is between a sea foam green and a tiffany blue it is true that the apple logo does n't show through when it 's not on ; however , this was n't a big deal to me i 've had better quality cases -lrb- harder , more durable plastic -rrb- , but this one seems sturdy enough overall , worth the purchase
the case came fairly quickly and i easily snapped it onto my macbook the case covers every corner and i 'm completely happy with it the only reason i would n't give it five stars is because the case is actually different from the given pictures the top of the case has two grooves on the sides showing up on my macbook i thought the case was supposed to be completely plain but it does have that one downside other than that , would recommend this case to any college student like me when i carry around my baby back and forth to class
great hard plastic cover for macbook it is great quality and a gorgeous color i like that it is not see-through like other covers - you can see the apple logo perfectly -- when lit up
i got this case very quickly , so i 'm very happy it fits my older macbook perfectly the color is pretty close to a tiffany 's blue so overall its exactly what i wanted
i am very pleased with the top case customer service i had ordered the wrong cover model and when i explained the issue to the seller they offered to replace my cover with the correct model type their response was prompt and they were pleasant to deal with the new case fits perfectly and <unk> nice
i bought a very expensive speck case and the side broke i researched a lot before purchasing another case and decided on the topcase rubberized hard cover this case is wonderful and the color is beautiful i have a white unibody macbook and it makes my laptop <unk> it protects very well and i like the feel of the rubberized coating , it has more grip than the speck case did
it is great - it did fit my daughters computer - although it was n't for her exact model - but she loves it ! the color is almost tiffany blue and looks great
im so in love in the color . so bright and true from the picture . i never thought it will be so good looking fast shipping and <unk> also
this case came i was sooo happy i went to try it on and it was like too big it didnt click or hold my laptop i contacted them telling them they said send it back but we cant send you a new case i would <unk> like to give them # stars for service they returned my money and everything fast
i purchased the ` green ' colored case for my # mac i love the way it looks it 's more of a seafoam green that matches the picture in the product description which i 'm happy about fits my laptop perfectly has little slits on the bottom of the case for ventilation and you can still see the apple logo through the top of the case it has a nice frosted look to it the mouse pad that came with it matched the case i got a seafoam green chevron one instead of the black in the photo i 'll buy from them again
this is a great case for our mac , fits perfect and is very well made would highly recommend this i did a lot of searching before deciding to go with this case , price and quality are hard to beat
the image here is deceiving the blue is a much more <unk> blue , it was like the blue of the cap of a blue sharpie it 's also not that well made i 'm sure it 'll do the job , but the second i opened it i decided to return it i wanted something that would look nice on my macbook pro but this did n't look cool at all and looked cheap i went to the apple store and just spent the $ # and got the good case , which i might add is ridiculously good it may not be worth $ # , but you know what , its much better than this case here
i have no problems with it at all my computer does n't get too warm or anything it fits on perfectly ! the smudging issue really is n't bad at all they come off if you rub them with your sweatshirt or something i would buy another cover from this brand
i have had this case for almost a month , and it seems to work well i take my mac nearly every place i go , and it inevitably gets bumped around a lot there are no signs of wear or tear on the case thus far , although i am waiting to see what happens if i spill something on it hopefully that wo n't happen , but with my luck it probably will seems like a good product
there is a slight nick and if i catch it just right i was cutting my hand until i filed it down otherwise , the product looks nice , fits the computer well and seems to protect the outside surface
this case worked great not a perfect fit , but pretty darn close with everyone around us having macs , it is great to be able to identify his computer easily and due to him being so rough , it is protective we love it
at first i thought the fact that the back of the bottom piece not being covered would be a problem , but it works out great i would recommend it to anyone
this case is great it fits my macbook perfectly it was a little difficult to snap on , but i would rather have it be a tight , secure fit than loose what i like the most is the color -- its unique and the <unk> makes it subtle
