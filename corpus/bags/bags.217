both the top and bottom portions of the case fit well there is a cutout for the second microphone on the left side of the notebook the top part of the case came with a few scuffs , otherwise i would 've given # stars the keyboard cover fits well and is flush against the keys ; my only complaint would be that it blocks the backlight i did n't bother using the screen protector since i see no situation in which i would scratch the screen
i love this new hard case for my laptop it snaps right on and was n't complicated at all looks just as picture posted as for the frosted i 'm not sure if that means it will eventually peel off but it is fine for me especially at this price the keyboard cover is really what the brought my rating down it was scratched up and does n't align with the words on the keys exactly it is also pretty stiff maybe i need to get more accustomed to it anyway i do recommend this product
so far it works great the keyboard cover fits great and i have the macbook air # model i did n't use the screen protector , i thought it was <unk> but i really only wanted the computer cover and the keyboard cover and i have gotten really used to using the keyboard cover and typing i think for the price , it 's great
the case provides a good protective coating for my macbook air and it adds a lot of my favorite color i could n't ask for more the keyboard cover took some time to get use to , but the mac is new to me anyways , so everything was very new the cover snaps on easily and the keyboard laid over the keys and do n't move at all definitely worth it
fits perfectly on my laptop . it is a little hard to get off when i want to clean it but i just use a credit card to slide it underneath and it helps
it 's great , i did n't have any problem fitting it into my macbook air although the color is a lot more opaque not much of a baby blue , but more like a light teal which was not a problem for me , i actually like it
i was very impressed with the speed and accuracy of the delivery <unk> the product actually arrived before the promised date , the color , even though not deep enough is pretty to the eyes , it feels great and looks great i 'm a very happy camper
fit perfectly my macbook air easy to remove -lrb- which is not the case of my previous moshi : it took my more than # minutes to remove it , however , loved it too ! ! ! -rrb- lightweight as well , should be consider if you have to carry on your laptop all the day
for me , this rubberized cover is a must for my mac i 'm not delicate with my things , i 'm a little rough and gosh , if you could see how dirty your keyboard gets this keyboard cover is such a must if you want to maximize the life of your computer
i ordered this product and hated it i loved the color , but it did not fit at all the top was to big and the bottom was to small . i do n't recommend this product
the color and everything was nice on this product my mom bought it for me and yes i have a envy that fits the description the main problem is that it did not fit i am highly disappointed a waste of excitement waiting o this thing and now i have to go out of my way to see if it can be returned
i am returning this product as it did not fit the computer as it stated , and appeared damaged very disappointed as i bought it for my daughter as a birthday gift
very poorly made , and although in product description my laptop was listed as compatible , it did not fit at all it cost me $ # to purchase case , and $ # to return it ... definitely not happy
i 'm very upset i bought this and it did n't fit my computer i even checked the reviews and matched it to the model number , yet when i received this , the top was too small and the bottom too big -lrb- the sizes were off by centimeters -rrb- it was like a poor children 's tale without the happy ending needless to say , its being returned , and i am still without a case for my laptop . : / the color is pretty though
everything i thought it would be makes my computer have some style the bottom gripper is really great , as well as the kick stands keeps my laptop from heating up since the fan is off the ground
must be the bottom of the line swissgear product still , expected the minimal quality uneven sewing ; the straps are flimsy ; not enough pockets ; in fact the tags brag a pocket for mp # player , but they really meant for you to use the same pocket as for the tablet i was about settle for all of this , because it fits my budget and the size is right : can easily slip in my # inch laptop , with the extended life battery sticking out the back but the broken zipper on the front pocket broke the deal returning it , since amazon.com does n't even have it in stock any more
i was excited about this bag until i loaded it up the lack of pocket options for small stuff means all that & # # ; other & # # ; small stuff you tend to carry just gets thrown together in a pile extra batteries for mouse , <unk> for shoe <unk> , gum for airplane - all just accumulate at the bottom of the one organizer pocket either i am going to have to do some sort of small bags in the pocket solution , or go back to my older green swiss gear laptop bag that i love and has more pockets just throwing everything in this one pocket bothers me
bag is somewhat long and narrow , and the <unk> zippers open too little of a flap to have great access to what 's inside that is especially true of the pen organizer pocket - that pocket is well designed , but most of the organizer pockets remain hidden with the zipper fully opened quality is decent <unk> the lower pocket up and designing its flap to open more fully would go a long way toward improving this design for a $ # dollar bag and free shipping it rates an & # # ; eh . & # # ; overall
i was expecting more storage pockets , but this backpack is a bit larger than my last and seems more rugged definitly will get my use out of it , especially for the price zippers are also larger which helps make it a bit more durable than my last too
the shipping is very fast the bag is very nice good <unk> , nice materials , adequate space i really like it the water bottle can be put at the side bags
this back pack is value for money , although it suits for # inch laptop i think it may fall short . the laptop was touching the edges on the top while closing the bag .
it 's a pretty cool bag looks secure , love the extra tablet sleeve and the padding the only thing is i 'm a girl and this backpack is just huge , i really like it but i 'm too ashamed to walk around campus with it : / my laptop is about # inches extra space is good but sigh it 's still four stars as it will be awesome , more so if you are a
i am very happy with this purchase it is what i wanted : a laptop backpack weighing less than # pounds and spacious enough besides , i could n't get a backpack this good at our local walmart -lrb- living in a small town -rrb- at this price -lrb- less than # -rrb- just got it and hope it is durable
this backpack is great - my # & # # ; laptop slips in with room to spare the pockets on either side for a water bottle are well placed and there 's even a pocket on one shoulder strap for my mp # player -lrb- i 've got a small mp # player -rrb- the seams appear to be well sewn , a well made pack imo wish i 'd purchased a backpack like when i purchased my last pack carrying a load does n't feel like i am i use the pack for everyday use , not just carrying my laptop and so far i got nothing bad to say - the pockets are room enough for my jacket and digital camera
i have always known this swiss gear brand for a long time to me , it would of always costs more than the other brands well , i finally bought it , and i am very happy with it with my old backpack , it feels like my laptop , is weighing me down but not this one , i feel like i can put in some more stuff , although i would n't dare myself
love this backpack laptop bag lots of space for everything you need and much more would recommend to anyone looking for a good laptop backpack with lots of space and compartments
this bag totally blew my expectations away after reading the reviews my expectations were not very high but once i received i was surprised of the size and the comfort of this bag we travel a lot and it is convenient i would recommended to everyone including my boss , who has one now ! ! !
got the backpack for several days and it seems to be very durable i like the design for separated storing spaces for my ipad and my # & # # ; laptop sunglasses holder is one of my favorite thing about this backpack
i have a similar backpack that i have used and abused for # years and it its still in great shape purchased this one for my son who was leaving for college and was very pleased with the appearance and size
i was n't expecting the backpack to be so large , but after a week or so i got used to it this bag is great if you want to fit a lot things into it i take it to work and am able to fit my laptop in the compartment , my lunch , some notebooks and gym clothes and running shoes so there 's a lot of space
purchased because my daughter wanted a purple computer i actually noticed the computer because amazon showed it when i looked at the purple case i bought the computer because it was cheap when the case arrived it was clear that it does not fit i contacted the seller and they said the only option is to return it to amazon the seller really needs to provide more info on which models actually work with their products and amazon should stop recommending <unk> products
i got two of these one was obviously a return that should tell you something right there i do n't expect them to last if they were priced as throw a ways that would be a different story besides the quality there is also a design flaw when you open the notebook without using the cheap & # # ; retractable feet & # # ; the notebook rocks the reason for this is the front pads are larger than the rear ones so the weight of the screen lifts up the front of the notebook as you type if you are expecting the same quality and durability as your phone case like i was then you will be disappointed
i was so happy when i found this hard cover for my vivobook case because i could n't find it anywhere else the shipping came super fast and it fit my laptop perfectly i couldnt ask for a better product if your looking for something light weight , but protects and adds beauty to your vivobook laptop you should get this <unk> mcover case ! !
this case came in and was no where near the one for the machine i bought the color and the composition of the material does not look anyway like the
this does not fit the item it was recommended for we got the laptop for christmas and this came separately and did not fit at all it was not worth sending back i would recommend asking the seller for <unk> of fit prior to purchase
it was delivered early it was nice and bright and looks great on my desk it has a pop up feature allowing air to flow through the bottom of the computer while you work
bought my grandsons a pink asus laptop and saved $ # over the price of a black laptop i purchased this orange cover - a favorite color of the boys - and i think the $ # i spent for it may have been the best $ # investment i have ever made in a product purchase
fits my wifes asus q # e perfectly provides good protection with a pretty small impact in <unk> covers corners , ports remain open for use the only issue i would mention is that the bottom , where the & # # ; feet & # # ; flip out , creates a small bump , even when the feet are in the closed position this changes the center of balance of the computer when set down on a hard flat surface if you have the screen tilted pretty far back and set the computer on a hard surface , it will rotate and fall on the back of the screen once you flip the feet out it is perfect and solid so in summary , flip feet <unk> , when using on a desk , and do not <unk> them when using the computer in your lap , and you will have no
i was so looking forward to the new case and keyboard , but i have had nothing but problems with this company i ordered it six weeks ago and it has yet to arrive the company says its in route , when i track the package it says no details available amazon said it has begun my claim , but i really wanted the item for the price i paid what to do , what to
after a couple weeks of use , the keys start falling off would be good if it was any quality it also does n't close well enough to let tablet sleep , so runs battery down fast
<unk> mailed me the wrong case / keyboard for my nexus # gen # tablet they do not provide <unk> return labels -- even when they are at fault i shipped the product back at my own expense via usps and , for # + days , there has been nobody at the <unk> office to accept the package if you do n't want any headaches , stay away from this seller
complete garbage ! does n't last a month before the keys start breaking and when you type the keyboard types duplicate and extra characters was a christmas gift complete waste of money . it looks good on the outside but not durable at all again , keys start to go missing on the keyboard no aggressive or hard use when you type extra characters appear on the screen
it does n't charge properly or work well , feels very cheaply made for something that 's $ # the case itself is nice , but the keyboard stopped working for no reason after the first day
i like the keyboard on the downside , i have to cable both devices for charging and i had to <unk> new holes for the camera front and back it 's not made for the # nexus otherwise i would have given it # stars
this is a good product the keyboard is a bit small , though probably as large as it could be given the overall size of the nexus # easy to install bluetooth <unk> easily and connects reliably cover protects the nexus well feels very durable
i bought this for my wife who emails , plays games , <unk> , etc on her new tablet she loves it the bluetooth connection always works for her , the case holds the tablet securely , the closure is secure the overall appearance is top scale a very good buy
my wife paid $ # for the same thing at <unk> electronics -lrb- <unk> the same without the brand -rrb- very cool , well made very leather like , awesome price and came way sooner than estimated or expected highly recomended by me i work at -lsb- ... -rsb- as a senior engineer so i 've seen it
the only thing i disliked about this case was when i put the bottom half onto my chromebook , the touchpad stopped working it would not register a tap , so i <unk> and thought my chromebook had suddenly gone <unk> i took the bottom of the case off , and it works fine now that 's my only beef with this case , it 's a pretty color and straightforward nice for adding a personal flair to your chromebook , but definitely not going to protect it very well
looks a little meh , but protects my chromebook very well love the expanded rubber feet on the bottom and the built in kick stand . it folds in very nicely doesnt add any type of creek to the product an easy way to protect a great product even if it looks a little
so i purchased this to eliminate the dents and scratches so far so go color is modern this is not a drop protective case so be mindful helps avoid bumps and bruises
this is what i was looking for when this model cam out almost a year ago now , but nobody made the hard case the <unk> scratched up so bad from just being in my book bag with nothing in it ... at least this case came out later than never
i love this case the color advertised is exactly the color it shows up as when installed on the chrome book super easy to put in , just clicks into place i love it bought purple also , but am in love with the
it clicks right into place and stays on , it looks really clean and neat , and it has # feet that pop out of the bottom to prop the computer up a bit if you like
i like this cover i had a hard time deciding on the color because there were a few that i really liked i 'm happy with this one and i get complements on my chromebook all the time i kinda wished it covered the spine since mine got a little scratched somehow but i can see that being a bit more difficult to incorporate that into this design no matter , it was my fault i 'm sure i still think i will buy more in other colors
i like the aqua color and it snaps on like a mobile phone cover it keeps my chromebook free of scuffs and scrapes while giving it a bit of color it fits well and i do n't even notice that it 's not a native part of my chromebook i do n't think my chromebook runs as hot as my old notebook but the cover has legs to elevate the device so that it gets good airflow too the cover has been snug and secure with daily use over the past month and it was shipped ultra fast too
i was worried that a cover for my chromebook would <unk> the chromebook 's light weight , which is what i love this cover is so durable and lightweight i love the color , and it fits like a glove you can not even tell it is a cover the rubber feet on the <unk> corners are great , and everything about the way this was manufactured makes it a perfect cover i love this item
i love this case , and am very happy with it i am especially happy that it has the little feet on the bottom that make it tilted when they are up
love the color , love the fit -lrb- it 's somewhat see-through so you can see the logo through it -rrb- it makes me happy to pull out my pretty chromebook and use it it seems like the chromebook is a bit more sturdy to open and close when it 's on be careful though that it stays firmly clipped on when i first put it on , i did n't attach it firmly and mouse pad did n't work right i thought i was going to have to return my chromebook until i figured out what was going on i like this so much that in the spring time i just might have to change my chromebook 's & # # ; outfit & # # ; to a nice spring color
i bought two of these for my high school kids ' chrome books they like them said they were easy to put on and have stayed on well , and seem to do a good job of protecting their pcs
should have listened to everyone else before buying this case i ignored all of the comments about it smelling awful but it in fact does smell like some sort of chemical was going to try and just deal with it but it is virtually impossible as the smell is so strong you can smell it from inches away
this is a nice case for a tablet pc but it will not fit a notebook pc i have a asus notebook computer and it will not fit the description says it will fit but it does n't again , this is for tablets only
overall , it 's what you would expect fits my macbook air but wish it was a tad snugger it 's reversible , which is nice - my turquoise blue sleeve will reverse to black it arrived pretty smelly but a wash in the sink with soap got rid of that there were n't really any better looking options for this kind of sleeve on amazon when i bought , so i 'd say go ahead
admittedly , i have only had this case a day i can tell you it is as described and feels like it will do the job it fits my samsung google chromebook like a glove the color is better in real life vs. the pictures here the only thing that i dislike is the smell it smells awful very chemically i hope that over time the smell dissipates
the case fits perfectly it comes with a small pocket i am guessing it is for the charger ? -lrb- but it is a little small for the charger cords to fit in -rrb- only complain was that it smelled awful when it first got here i had to let it set for a couple days to get rid of the chemical smell
i have a google chrome book - acer & this sleeve fits perfectly i really like it for how much i paid for it but i do have a couple of issues - it gets <unk> on it easily other than that it 's was a good buy
i always feel like cases/sleeves get scratched and nasty over the course of time , so i do n't purchase high dollar protectors anymore this product is cheap , but does not seem to be low quality if i find that i need something new in a few months -lrb- hopefully not -rrb- , i can turn around and buy something else and it wo n't be a big deal
the color is super hot pink , somewhat true to color from what you see on the listing other reviewers were right about the smell -- it takes a couple weeks for it to go away i use this to cover my mba # & # # ; when i 'm taking it to places , and it does a good job i would n't trust this case if you are prone to dropping your things -- this sleeve is guaranteed to not offer protection against dents overall , it 's a good buy if you need something to protect your mba against dust this sleeve fit true to size for my mba # & # # ; , even with a plastic case on
great little case and perfect for my google chrome book it 's light , easy to wash and adorable wish it had a pocket for my power cord but other than that it 's a great case for the price
my asus # . # & # # ; touchscreen notebook fits perfectly a bit snug , but i prefer it that way good quality construction and the <unk> bag that came with it holds the charger quite well when traveling
yes , there is a smell but it wears off over time we have a lenovo yoga # inch model and it fits like a gem , nice and snug great value , great purchase
it fits perfectly i can now place my laptop in my big bag without <unk> about it getting scratched or dinged up because you as a mom i have everything but the kitchen sink in my bags
i bought this to protect my laptop , the asus vivobook x # <unk> # t # . # & # # ; , on a trip to germany it is a snug fit , but it works - the <unk> port on the laptop sometimes caught the lip when <unk> the top , but i started to make it a habit of sticking it on the other side the lip takes a little help to get over the end of the laptop , but it is a good fit the case has n't shown any wear yet , from this exercise of stretching over the laptop
i have a dell inspiron # z # series and it took so long to find a cheap , but durable laptop sleeve that would easily fit into my backpack while i walk to class i was unsure if this sleeve would fit , and it fits just a little snug but all over good choice
it is a sleeve my chromebook fits perfectly it has a flap covering instead of a zip or a velcro and i wasnt sure about it at first but have decided i like it the only problem is that it does n't get used much since i 'm always using my chromebook
love that the logo stands out and it 's a steal for the money i recommend it because sometimes backpacks or bags do n't have much padding and this helps a little
this slip case fits my acer aspire # . # computer perfectly it 's not too tight and not too loose sure it has this weird & # # ; new plastic smell & # # ; when i first opened it but unlike other reviews it went away i do n't think it 's intended to protect against drops or bumps but it works great to keep the computer from getting scratched when it 's in my backpack
it does n't fit the yoga # lenovo laptop , and even if it did , it would damage it where it connects and bend the hinge if you go to tablet
looks like a nice product i 've ordered two of them now the first one was for the yoga # , # . # & # # ; it was too big so i returned it and ordered this one that was supposed to fit the yoga , # & # # ; it was the same exact same one i just sent back this is getting really old it is costing me more to return them then what it cost for the actual product too bad this company ca n't give a correct and accurate description
this does the job of protecting the yoga , but it is difficult to even to get it into tent mode and various modes the case/cover is too thick for the yoga to be utilized in any other way but the laptop mode i worry if you keep this on and decide to put the yoga in various modes other than laptop , it 'll wear on the hinges quickly
great cover at a fair price and yes , everyone is right , its just thick enough it wo n't let you open it completely for full tablet mode i end up usually leaving the bottom piece off
i bought this sleeve because i needed to use it during this weekend , but my surprise is that it simply does not fit in my # & # # ; macbook pro retina ! ! ! ! do n't buy it if you have a # & # # ; macbook pro retina ! !
thought it would look ok for a guy but the felt look vs flat gray is better for a woman , and it was slightly loose with a tight front picket for the vga dongle
felt feels a synthetic and cheap , although the design is nice and for the money is n't terrible very tight fit , but i guess that is what you want customer service is good with this company
obviously this isnt the highest quality sleeve but it does its job well . the black strap felt especially cheap although the sleeve will protect your macbook well . also , my macbook pro retina fits perfectly inside
i got this case for a macbook air # & # # ; i have a speck case on it that is rubbery but very thin . it wo n't fit even if i take the case off , it is a tight squeeze and is difficult to get in and out so other than it not fitting , it would be the best case , but unfortunately i ca n't say that . it 's okay , but could be made much better
it keeps my # & # # ; retina macbook secure enough , and i like the smaller pockets it comes with , but i would prefer that it zipped instead of tucked into the black elastic strap it is pretty durable so i am very happy about that
based on pricing and the size of my new macbook pro the easy acc has been a great addition to my minimalist lifestyle it helps prevent the laptop from getting scratched , and provides a good mat to set it on , when using on a table definitely would recommend this to people looking for a lightweight , minimalist
not the fanciest material not the most <unk> looking but i like it i have a # in macbook pro retina display it fits very well feel like computer is protected and wo n't get scratched by a zipper for the price , it 's an excellent purchase
it fits nice and snug on a # . # in macbook pro retina reasonable price to what is out on the market the elastic strap for the flap does n't seem to be the best mechanism friends have other felt sleeves that closed with a magnet or a button
this sleeve looks and feel super nice ; much nicer than the price would lead you to believe it fits my # macbook air # in a little tight maybe a little too tight it has loosened up a bit since the first few times using it , but it still seems just a hair too tight how tight it fits the laptop will certainly <unk> some it does take quite a bit of effort to get the laptop out of sleeve additionally the smaller pockets are almost too small to be useful not big enough to hold the ac cable it can handle some pens and a <unk> even with the minor <unk> , the sleeve is still more than worth the cost
first , this feels like a quality product the felt is super soft , and there 's enough padding where i do n't think that anything that i can reasonably expect will damage the laptop within however , this came up in my search results for a sleeve for my new lenovo yoga # pro it did not fit it was close - so close , i wanted , i thought , almost , if just ... - but it did not fit if it had , i 'd be really happy
i was looking for a minimalistic sleeve that was n't too bulky so i could throw my laptop into a bad or backpack i have a # . # macbook and it fits perfectly it 's a bit snug at first , but i also have a hardcase around my laptop there are two pockets sewn on the inside which do n't seem to hold much but i can fit my headphones in the smaller pocket and my external harddrive fits into the larger one and i can till close it the only thing i do n't like is that the material frays when you pull on the bottom of it to get the laptop out but , nothing some scissors ca n't fix
i give # stars because this is one of the only sleeves that i have seen , that fits the mbpr # inch tightly it also has a couple of pockets which come handy , and is a good price but , it is a weird felt like material , and feels wired and cheap also the flap that covers the front of the sleeve is very long and is held down by an elastic strap this set up is ok , but i do not think it is the best i would rather have a sleeve with a zipper for the money this sleeve works and it is one of the only ones i have seen that actually fits the mbpr correctly
this is a pretty nice case . very fast and simple to put the macbook in and out i think the one problem i have with it is the aux pockets do n't seem to be good for anything they are a very strange size not for pens . or the cloth used to clean screen
i had recently purchased a samsung # & # # ; chromebook # , and was in need of a case for it , so after measuring it , this case looked like it could be a perfect fit i took the chance and ordered it , even though it says it 's for the macbook pro retina , but it actually fits the chromebook # like a glove very happy with this purchase
this is of good quality and definitely fits well on my macbook the sleeve is very snug and i also have a kuzy pink hardcase , however i like it like that i find this to be a good investment as i generally bring my laptop to school and enjoy the extra protection to make sure that my heavy investment is safe i would definitely recommend this product to anyone looking for a cheap sleeve whether or not they have a hardcase
i had a hard time finding a sleeve that fits my pixel but this one does the trick it 's simple , clean , and has just enough space it does n't really fit the cable , but i do n't like it in the case anyway
fits my mac book air perfectly a little snug at first , but i easily stretched it out by hand i feel that my computer is secure and safe , but the sleeve is very slim - easily fits in my tote bag plus the extra pockets for miscellany are great !
i ordered this one for my new laptop it is not expensive , but it looks great . it has two little pockets also , u can put some index cards or other things in the pockets
looks high end and really just beautiful my husband says he gets compliments on it all the time the fit is great and it protects well without being bulky like other protectors he 's had it for a year now and it 's <unk> badly , but i think that 's because he keeps it in his backpack i will probably order him another one soon since i know he will not want anything else
