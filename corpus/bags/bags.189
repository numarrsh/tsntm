the color is great , fits well on my macbook pro # i have purchased a shell on ebay and it was horrible i did not like it the main reason for me buying , was because i wanted to save money however , after the older case was damaged , i found this case and it was approximately the same cost , and this case is a ton better
the color and texture were great , but i just did n't like it the case did n't fit in my travel case either i passed the case on to a good friend though , and she loves it ! there 's nothing wrong with this product , but if you 're more of a slip cover person , stuck with what you know
i really love this case it 's not a crappy , flimsy , plastic one and i love the color the only thing i do n't like about this is that fingerprints do n't rub off well
this product has made carrying my computer around the house so much easier it fits my macbook pro well and stays on it 's very well made and sturdy the rubberized finish makes it easy to grip the cutouts on the bottom allow for good airflow for heat dissipation the bottom <unk> keep grit from scratching wood surfaces the only drawback for some folks might be that when open , the back of the computer ca n't be extended as far back i do n't find this a problem however additionally , i feel more relaxed when my # yr . old grandson uses and carries my computer around the house
buyer beware ! ! these covers are not rubberised at all they are instead simply just hard plastic when i tried to fit mine to my mac pro , the cover did n't fit well at all and left my laptop being incredibly bulky and with many air pockets the case appears to simply be a mould that is far from the comfortable , snug intent of a rubberised cover topcase are being incredibly difficult with the return and are <unk> to pay for return shipping which means i would be paying more for shipping than the cost of the item i hope other buyers have a more positive experience but i certainly wo n't be buying anything from topcase again nor would i recommend them to any friends or family
at first i love it ! it looks good and fits well but within a few weeks i notice the it 's cracking up on the edges and it 's getting worse with time i have n't hit it anywhere or drop it or anything my computer just sits on the table i do n't carry it anywhere ! just imagine if i do i am very disappointed the case is suppose to protect the computer and without any effort it 's falling apart = / now i will have to buy a new case ! =
i carry this in a well padded backpack it sits on a desk the rest of the time the corners have already chipped off and i have no idea why
purchased in april , falling to pieces # months later both front corners on the base are cracked , # of the feet are now missing case is not abused , just normal wear & tear which a case should be able to handle that 's kind of the point i think the rubberized finish was nice -lrb- while it lasted -rrb-
i had purchased this product thinking it was for # inch macbook pro but instead i received a # inch cover this item also offered other items for free which i did not receive
this cover case didn ` t fit on my computer , even if i checked that it was the correct size and style product the color in the computer looks like fluorescent yellow , but actually it it 's egg yellow it is horrible
waste of money started cracking at stress points within a month at first thought someone had knocked my macbook around realized this was not the case when cracks started showing up in other places . unable to get resolution from seller spend a little more and get a better product
i have bought two topcase hard case covers for my mbpro and have not had any problems they both lasted a long time through school and work i bought this and received it in a timely manner the problems i have with this topcase rubberized hard case cover is that it is rubberized and was broken within # days the entire case is broken , cracked , and missing pieces within # days of using it i am highly dissatisfied and will not be buying another topcase rubberized hard case cover
product did not fit my new # & # # ; macbook pro w / retina - length and width were fine but height was much taller so case could not snap in but since it was cheap , i gave to a friend who has a two year old , thicker model
i bought this cover and looked great the first month but the quality is not good because the material is not silicone and the cover is pit at the corners like a glass i am very careful with my computer and only use it at home simply cover it began to crack as pressure my recommendation is to get silicone or other
love the color , love the feel ... but the corners are chipping after # months of use i have traveled very little with it , so it does not seem to be wear and tear , but more poor craftsmanship
this case claims to fit the latest macbook pro , but the fit was extremely poor for a new macbook pro purchased in early # we tried to put the case on for upwards of # minutes , but the fact is it was about a millimeter too small all around the only <unk> feature of this case was the nice seafoam green color , which matched the pictures we decided to return the case , and instead picked a speck case , with which we have had positive experiences with in the past
i first ordered this case for a macbook without retina display -lrb- my mistake -rrb- , and topcase sent the correct one no questions asked i mailed back the wrong case i was eagerly awaiting my new case to come , and i am just not so happy with it the top fits fine , the bottom does n't fit as well as it should it 's incredibly difficult to clip on , on the slim chance it clips on at all there are very cheap looking cushions on the bottom part of the case as well , which i predict will fall off within the next week or so -lrb- just guessing -rrb- the service was great , they were very quick to respond to my return request , but i just do n't like the case itself
the case that i received was decent it does what it needs to do , which is protect my macbook pro the bottom part was missing one of the # white cushions additionally , the top portion looks weird it looks like it may be discolored
the case is a good case and covers my # `` macbook pro very well it snaps in place and stays in place it has a soft rubber feel the only reason why i gave it # out of # stars is because the edge of the case where your hands rest while typing is very sharp it makes it a bit uncomfortable when you rest your hands while typing
the case is beautiful and not too bright of a pink it 's more of a <unk> and shy pink the texture is a soft rubber coating on plastic just good so you ca n't scratch it but the case cracked soon after i bought it thankfully topcase had wonderful customer service , and reached out to me to assist me definitely will be buying from them again . i 'd say # star for customer service but # for product
the mac store almost did n't take my mac for repairs because the top would not come off we used their tools to take off cases and everything , but it did n't budge great quality for the price unless you want it to come off
i liked the case at first , but the corners chipped after just a couple of weeks super disappointed , because now the corners not only look stupid , but they are unprotected and after just over a month i 'm looking to replace i think the black matte looks cool though
i really love the color of it , i 've gotten so many compliments it also has a really great fit i 've had it since the summer , but it 's already cracking i 'm afraid i might have to buy a new one already , but i guess i ca n't expect much at the price it came at
love the case but after having it just a few months small pieces are beginning to break off of the bottom of the case - so far i 've been able to superglue them back on i 'm very careful with it so i 'm not sure why this has happened four different times so far
color and quality was great for the price . unfortunately top cover was defective and did not fit to a macbook pro # & # # ; properly left side of the top cover was small i ended up returning the unit . thanks to great amazon customer service
after checking several cases for my macbook , i settled on this solid blue design the fit is excellent the molding process turned out a uniform surface for the cover , and most of the descriptions of the cover in the listing were accurate it comes in a variety of colors and patterns , but it is not in any way a & # # ; hard case & # # ; cover it is a rubberized cover that fits the macbook there is no hard liner inside of it , such as you might find in an otter box case since apples uses the metal cast , in part , to dissipate heat , i have kept a close watch on processor temperatures so far , my concerns seem to be <unk> put some color in your mac , or you can send in your own photos to have rubberized cases or decals made for it
the case fits pretty nicely on my # mac book its a little more on the plastic side than rubber which is ok for the price , it 's a good case i thought it would be more `` rubberized `` than it is and the apple logo is not cut out but it does shine thru the case it arrived quickly
i just bought the green color case and it looks so much better in person than in the photo shown above the actual color is a lot brighter in person and more of a mint tone it is very cute and i recommend the green or tiffany blue color
i 'm completely in love the product the colors looks really nice on the laptop and is really smooth to the touch it fits perfectly and is easy to apply the only reason why i put # stars is because is came with a defect on the front that looks like is damaged but you can barely see it and you definitely ca n't feel it so it 's ok other than that i 'm really happy with it
compliments , compliments , compliments everywhere i go , people just <unk> over this blue case it has developed a little crack on the lower corner but it 's very small and barley noticeable i 've had this since june and i am really happy with this case
due to a unclear description , i ended up with a wrong product -lrb- macbook pro vs macbook with retina display -rrb- top case sent me a return <unk> , and then shipped the right product i am a satisfied customer
love the color and how easy it was to put on great quality from what i can see only thing i did n't like was there is a little ridge on the computer from the clips where you put your arms when typing it is a little uncomfortable when typing for long periods of time otherwise i love it
the case came promptly , and my children <unk> the color it is a matte appearance it is a bit tricky to attach to your computer it does n't have the `` feet `` on its base like other shell protectors , but my computer has n't had an overheating problem
texture and color are great ... the top fits snug and not exactly right ... it 's a bit too tight these things are so cheap i would n't be surprised if another one fits a tad differently the bottom fits great , but there are little clamps at the front that hold it on that might bother some people 's arms when typing my buddy has the speck version and that thing is n't nearly worth the extra cash
i love this color and its texture it has helped to protect my laptop , but after nearly a year it 's cracking and chipping on the corners so lack of longevity loses a star otherwise it 's awesome
product fits great , the colors look good there was a little damage done in the shipping process on one of the edges , but it is n't bad and can definitely be ignored because of the items overall quality
this shell is gorgeous on my macbook it came a couple days early , and when i opened the package i was pleasantly surprised by how pretty the color was it 's a soft <unk> green , not a mint green like i had suspected it looks really beautiful , none the less when i put the shell on my laptop , it was a little difficult at first i could n't really figure out which direction the top piece faced , and in result the shell got stuck and ended up leaving a tiny scratch on my new macbook even though it was a pretty <unk> mark , it still frustrated me being that i tried so hard not damaging my computer in any way overall , i 'm really happy with this product it looks so good , and is staying on perfectly there are n't any popping sounds when i open or close the laptop either , which i 've noticed some people saying about similar cases
this cover fits very nicely and offers good protection the only <unk> is that fingerprints seems to show up easily on this , even though it is a <unk> plastic but overall , it is very nice and gives a good sense of protection for my mac
this item was great and exactly what i wanted compared to the rest of the products available the price was great the only <unk> about this product -lrb- which probably are on all the products of this sort -rrb- are the clips that secure the case to the computer they stick up near the track pad and rub your arm i would definitely recommend this product though
i have had this for over a year and i love it the color is gorgeous and i never have to worry about marring my beautiful laptop - even though its own beauty does n't show it has lasted through some very hard wear
this product came in # days before it said fast shipping love this case for my # ' macbook pro it 's see thru so your apple logo shines through the case ca n't beat the price love this case
this is the exact color i was looking for the fit is nice , but there is that extra & # # ; lip & # # ; on the bottom cover that can dig into your arm , but its not too bad for the price and the excellent fit i can deal with a little bit of a lip i have used to have a speck case on my previous macbook pro and it did fit a bit better , but none of their colors were as nice as this and they are double the price also , make sure to take the case off and clean it and the compter when dirt gets caught in the case it can rub and rub on the soft aluminum and cause a small scratch or <unk>
it feels just as good as competitors and looks sleek and sexy it adds minimal weight and thickness but protects your macbook with out looking tacky and shiny oh and yes ... the apple shine through just perfectly i am very happy with my purchase quick shipping and good packaging
i bought this case because my speck case , which i had gotten less than # months earlier , had already cracked in the back corner after deciding to shop around , i decided to buy this case instead of buying a new speck one i like this case a lot more and it certainly costs less
the color is spot-on tiffany blue i was hoping it would be a tiny bit more translucent , but when my computer is turned on the apple logo shines through very clearly which is all i was really worried about the feeling is very nice , smooth with a nice grip the plastic is hard but has a little bit of give which is exactly what i was looking for snaps on very easily , the edge does stick up a bit in the front but it does n't bother me very cute and classy <unk> look for on the go
i purchased this cover for my daughter 's new macbook pro she loves it the fit is perfect , we feel more confident that the computer is safer from drops and accidents , plus it looks great we are # % satisfied
i ordered this case on the # th of the month with a little <unk> because of the mixed reviews it arrived on the # st which was <unk> before expected arrival the case is a thick plastic and soft to the touch the color is exact same as tiffany 's , to a tee it fits perfect with no snuggle room i also love that the apple sign is still visible through the case when lit up some people complained that the bottom case scratched their arms resting on the computer , this is true , but its really nothing serious or overbearing the part that may scratch or <unk> your arm is the clip that holds the whole bottom case on , so it 's really inevitable as of right now i 'm in love with this case
great case , snaps on easily and seems to be a good protector for macbook i also have a soft case to put over this one for traveling and extra protection
my purple mac pro cover arrived today and i could n't be <unk> is absolutely gorgeous ! ! it has a nice glow when i open the laptop i also ordered the keyboard cover , love that as well thank you so much for the awesome products read other reviews ; people reported the bottom coming off of their <unk> has to snap , an audible click , for it to be on
i was so excited to find something like this for my # & # # ; macbook pro it is so easy to install and it keeps my outer case free of scratches when i have to transport my laptop , it makes it easier and more secure to hold on to it really looks nice also i highly recommend this product for any # & # # ; laptop
first off , super fast shipping came in a week earlier than expected secondly , -lrb- as many others have mentioned -rrb- the colour is gorgeous ! ! the material is smooth to the touch , but it is prone to getting a bit dirty so i make sure to put my laptop into a case before putting it into my backpack so happy with my purchase , thank you ! :
i had a blue one on my old macbook and that machine is not dead this one is much more <unk> great grip , keeps your macbook from sliding all over the place
it 's honestly pretty perfect and i got free shipping with the prime thing . the only thing is that one of places that that case is supposed to snap on , wont snap on but it still works fine the color is gorgeous just a tad more green . but the color is tiffany blue -lrb- so if you get the keyboard , <unk> match : -rrb- -rrb- its a great product . :
the first backpack had a broken front pocket zipper -lrb- seam poorly stitched -rrb- returned and reordered the second arrived today , and the main compartment zipper does not work returning the second and will not reorder i wish that were not the case - it has good storage and design but , obviously the workmanship is questionable
it does it 's job well for the first couple of weeks but , does not hold up well . we bought it this year for son 's sophomore high school year due to all work now being on macbook , there are no books or heavy items to be placed in the backpack except for the power cord the third week into the school year , the zipper , in the notebook compartment , messed up so that only one zipper works the <unk> week into the school year , the lining in the middle compartment started unraveling now it 's december , four months into the school year , and i have my fingers crossed that this backpack will last until school is over in june
my son wanted this because it 's <unk> it was his present , so i could n't return it , but i should have the top main zipper sticks in both directions i 've tried to examine the teeth to see if they are flawed , but they do n't seem to be i 've just run the zipper back and forth repeatedly to try and get them to ` loosen up .
a # . # & # # ; laptop fits in the laptop pocket but that 's about the limit the inner pocket material seems a bit flimsy but we think maybe , just maybe , it is water proof to protect the items inside -lrb- ? ! -rrb- there is a music player pocket and hole in the top to feed a headphone cord thru good shoulder strap padding , though we have n't taken it anywhere significant yet to put them to a real test deep side water bottle holder overall i really like this backpack but only gave it # stars because of the inner material
my # year old loves this - very durable and well made lots of pockets - it would be great for older kids too - very roomy great choice for boys that love army stuff
this is a very nice bag much nicer than i expected the one thing that was n't mentioned in the reviews is the key and lock on the front of the bag the key does n't seem to fit the lock and i ca n't figure out how to open the lock it would n't be such a big deal but there 's a little zipper compartment behind the lock that would be handy
love this bag although it may look it i wish i could fit more in it without undoing the sides in addition , they should have made the computer section a bit bigger , but all in all good
very stylish bag and can accommodate a large amount of items i use it as a everyday work bag and have received many compliments this bag is much larger than you likely will imagine , i can fit my purse , laptop , lunchbox , and shoulder sized tote bag without issue
do n't buy this it 's flimsy , no cushion , hard to zip , and just cheap do n't waste your cash on this if you are trying to protect an expensive computer not worth it
purchased this for my new laptop and i was very disappointed this is just # pieces of material sew together no padding at all do n't waste your money amazon was great on allowing me to return it
probably the only thing i have bought on amazon i was unhappy with i have a thin # laptop barely fit , material was a pick of cotton no padding , but it shipped in a timely manner only reason i did n't return it was i was going some where and needed to protect my laptop
this case has zero padding the printed picture is great , but if you 're looking for something that protects your laptop , this is not it it 's basically just material sewn together , so no thickness or buffer to really protect a laptop i 've ended up just leaving in the thin foam it got shipped with on this inside which makes it a bit tough to zip up , but offers at least some protection on one side of the laptop i will probably end up buying a new case
it is not as expected i thought that there would be some padding on the inside and there is n't any at all it is cute and my daughter was pleased
the case is great to transport my laptop with me to and from work and home and the university in my backpack and even just to carry around it has been a constant great fit and protection very disappointed that the velcro came unglued after only a couple of months of ownership this product is perfect so far except that the velcro strip is only held on by a thin piece of double sided tape , and just came right off i 'd give it five stars otherwise maybe they could change how they manufacture that part ... ca n't recommend it otherwise bottom line : it would be great ... except the only thing that could come apart did fix that , and i love it
this is a very good case cover for the macair it is very thin and small like the macbook and adds no bulk at all however , its made of a strong rubber / plastic material and due to that is not stretchable so it grips the computer very <unk> and sometimes it becomes very difficult to take your laptop out of the sleeve also , if you have any usb dongle or other attachment to your computer , its not going to fit in this sleeve overall , great quality and design , but it comes with its flaws for someone who doesnt use lot of dongles / attachments , its a great product
i like this , but you ca n't fit a # & # # ; macbook air with a thin hard case in this you need to take the macbook air out of the case for it to fit without getting stuck i 'd like it if the gauntlet were a little bigger and fit a macbook air with a thin plastic case to protect from scratches other than that , great product i 'd purchase again
i like the case a lot , but eventually <unk> it to travel use and not constant or daily use ; which would change if they make a version of the case with two <unk> # -rrb- make it just a tad less snug it is not always quick to pull the mba out -lrb- and the snugness <unk> fading of the sticker i have on it but not a big deal -rrb- # -rrb- i 'd like a <unk> version so that i could pull out the mba from within the bag it is in more readily and additionally not have velcro ripping noise each time lo and behold , there is a gauntlet # . # sleeve without the full flap i 'll still use this one for travel especially as it is waterproof
i use the # `` macbook air in my truck and i wanted something what would protect it from that type of environment and it does very good at that there really is n't much padding inside the case but i new that when i purchased it but what is does have is soft and the computer fits in the case snug with no movement i have n't had any problems getting it out of the case there was another reason for purchasing this case we travel frequently on our motorcycle for long periods and i wanted a case that did n't take up a lot of room because on the bike you need all the space you can get as far the power cord , mouse etc , i keep those in a separate place <unk> on the truck or on the bike
this case is just the right size for my microsoft surface pro # my surface has an incipio feather case and ms type cover # keyboard , and it still fits nicely this sleeve offers a good level of protection , with it , i can put my surface pro in my backpack and not worry about it getting beaten up
the carrying case is very helpful , but a little snug the scanner fits fine but not room for much more we put the install disk in the case with the scanner so any of our employees can take it off the shelf and go
this case keeps the scanner and cables very tidy and secure it 's a nice tight fit and feels like there is plenty of protection for general travel however , the price , i think , is too high for what you get , but it is a great fit , which is something you would n't get by using something not made for the job hurts to buy but painless to use
the case works for the scanner i rated it a # due to cost since this is a mobile scanner you really need a case the price of the case is really high since we will be using it on our sailing <unk> i needed a case , therefore stuck to pay the high price for it amazon was the same price as everyone else this is the first item i have bought from amazon that was priced the same as other <unk>
good quality , my only change would have been to make it accommodate the <unk> # wireless adapter also ... but that 's no bid deal i probably wo n't use the <unk> # much anyway
this is not some cheesy , cheap <unk> bag this is a quality , cleverly made , sleek case padding on all sides , easy to use and carry , simple to slide scanner and cables in and out worth every penny
this case fits the canon image <unk> p- # <unk> perfectly if you transport the scanner frequently , this is a must buy in order to protect it and keep it looking new
as i prepare to travel more , this case is great for keeping my portable scanner portable and safe even at home , i keep the scanner in the case instead of on a desk
if you are purchasing a personal scanner , this carrying case is a must have it protects the scanner as well as keeps everything needed to use the scanner -lrb- cords too -rrb- in one convenient location
i have nothing but praise for the canon p- # carry case it protects the canon p- # and is large enough to hold the scanner , power cables , usb data cables , and the optional power supply the zippers and fabric are n't stressed at all when the scanner and its cables and power supply are inside material quality is high , as is the construction of the carry case
i do n't know if i 've ever been so happy with a case before , but it 's just big enough to fit the compact scanner and is super easy to use i enjoy how quickly i can throw the scanner back in the back with the cords and everything is ready to go and tidy the handle is also great for carrying it around i have it hanging on a hook by my home office desk too so it 's ready to grab anytime i need to scan something on the go
i am glad that this was included free with the scanner that i purchased , because otherwise i would have essentially been forced to purchase it the scanner fits perfectly and there is even extra room in the form of a divided space for the cords this is a must-have for anyone who purchases the scanner , which is a very nice piece of equipment itself
i got this for free under the promotion i will never have purchased it at this price though it is well padded and very sturdy and roomy to handle the scanner and all of its cables
its good for notebook/laptop and few documents not for carrying everything in only one place the bag looks pretty well cons - the shoulder blade does n't rotate , so if its twisted can cause some pain the handle is very <unk> , does n't balance well
affordable and sleek , it gets the job done for a reasonable price the handle is a little weird , as others have mentioned i did lose an old iphone # to the bag though , which sucks i had the phone in a front pocket , under the buckled flap , and assumed it would be secure when i picked up the bag , the iphone went for a long jump and sadly , cracked i blame myself mostly -lrb- how foolish to trust an iphone w a # $ bag in an easily accessed front pocket ? -rrb- but it put a bad taste in my mouth fortunately , my laptop is much more secure
yes that is exactly what i 've just said i was in complete <unk> sure enough bag handles laptop fine , but why the ipad sleeve can not be closed and secured is really <unk> potentially this bag can rack up easy damage in $ $ $ hundreds other then that i like the look and size
i bought this bag to lug around my computer and work stuff i absolutely loved it at first - all the pockets and space i need - even for my # inch dell laptop and it was extremely lightweight unfortunately , the lightweight also seems to be a curse after only # months it has already developed a number of holes in the outside pockets and inner lining has ripped from seams
unfortunately , this bag doesnt have enough depth to it to actually put things in it i also wish it had some zipper pockets on the outside i can barely put my lunch and files in here
this is a pretty good laptop messenger bag ; a bargain at the price it holds a lot of material without getting too bulky my only complaint is that the shoulder strap is a little thin
i ordered this looking for something multi-functional , to hold items such as my laptop , with optional items like a # ds or a kindle the bag has enough compartments to hold everything with no problem , and the bag is stylish and lightweight , but with enough padding to protect your valuables my only complaint is i wish it had a compartment to hold dvd 's in it i work in it and i use a handful of dvd 's with tools on them regularly , which my old laptop bag had , and this doesnt
this messenger bag has a huge capacity and is very light weight it is almost perfect but for # little issues ... it 's possible for rain to get inside if the bag is full because the top flap is a tad to narrow when extended and the shoulder strap seems to get easily twisted other than that it 's great ... love all the pen , key , compartments i now really use it all the time ... just remember to put an umbrella in one of the bottle holders in case of rain
comfortable , stylish , <unk> it 's a little bulky and i do n't like that the straps do n't have individual rings so that the strap can rotate to different positions like some other bags
unless the bag is clipped closed , you can not grab it from the top handle without everything opening and falling up pretty good quality for the price - and it looks basic , professional and works well for my husbands work bag
the bag is well constructed -lrb- even with the plastic latches -rrb- i would expect this bag to perform up to the reputation of targus it is well designed i wanted a simple messenger bag to tote around my macpro from home to the office and to school , and that is exactly what was delivered con : the company that fulfilled the order does n't get high marks from me the bag is in fine condition it just arrived with the tags torn off , as if someone else had been using it i did not order a # nd hand bag or a returned item i ordered and paid for a new item and it felt like the item was # nd hand
size - the targus drifter messenger is very roomy , with plenty of room for an oversized laptop and other items , such as writing pads , utensils durability - the case is made of a very tough nylon with padding that will provide solid protection for its contents material - the exterior lacks a professional finish , and is aesthetically much more appropriate for a student than a professional
i have an asus # . # ' and it fits perfectly in this bag . it is a very good product and the quality is also very good . it is very convenient to carry
love , love , love this one of the best lap top carriers i have ever owned love the flat bottom which enables me to set the carrier down without it falling over , as another carrier i had , did sturdy shoulder strap which allows me to adjust the fit it to either my size or other family members the material is easy to wipe clean and unlike many laptop carriers , there is plenty of space inside for me to include my kindle , ipad or paperwork as well as connection cords if i want to plug my laptop in places for pens and even my cell phone highly recommend this laptop carrier far better than what i expected
i use this bag for school , to carry my laptop and accessories , as well as books and notebooks for one class it works great i could also see using it as a carry-on for travel ; it could easily hold my laptop , kindle , and flight necessities this bag has handy compartments under the flap for pens , cell phone and other electronics , etc . it also has a <unk> laptop section as a short woman , i appreciate the adjustable strap , and as someone who carries this bag around a lot , i appreciate the padding on the strap really , my only complaint is that the color is boring this bag has held up really well so far i 'm very happy with it
i actually use this as an <unk> case , and put all my accessories and tools in the front pockets , and my music in the back pocket it 's good quality and looks great sometimes i accidentally buckle the strap inside the front flap and that gets annoying ... but that 's just about my only problem with it
