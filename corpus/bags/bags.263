i ordered # cases -lrb- one for me and one for my daughter -rrb- because of the price when i <unk> them i was amazed at the quality this is a case that i would choose again and tell anyone who needs one that they ca n't get a better case at any price
this sturdy laptop case affords plenty of space for storing laptop essentials as well as a # `` laptop the pockets range in size from small enough to house your usb thumb drive to large enough to store documents the shoulder strap is padded and is fully removable , so it wo n't get in the way if you want to use the handle only the exterior is a # <unk> blend , while the interior is # % polyester the product was made in china the tag describes the exterior to measure # x # . # x # . # `` , while the laptop section is described as measuring # . # x # x # . # ``
this bag has it all and at a price that is pocket book friendly i got this as a gift for my sister for christmas she has a # . # `` dell laptop computer and the previous bag i got did not fit this however fits perfectly ; not to big nor too small - just perfect not to mention that it has all these great storage options and different ways to carry the bag i just think she will like this better if it were green on the outside oh , well i guess we ca n't have it all , but other than that this is great to have for yourself or give as a gift
i 'm impressed with how well this suits my laptop and the other accessories i carry when traveling lots of space with many divider <unk> it is well made and i think it does a very good job or protecting the laptop this is the only case i have ever bought for a laptop so i ca n't give a <unk> review however , as i stated , it is well made , versatile and does the job price was very fair for what you get , at least when i bought it
i recently purchased a new dell laptop with a # `` screen without thinking about the fact that is will not fit in my current computer bags i visited a few of the large box stores that <unk> in office products but thought the selection was extremely limited and prices were high i purchased this bag and have been very happy with it the price was right and the bag was exactly what the manufacturer 's specifications said it was
very light , durable , has a lot of space , and comfortable to hold it also has a great look , and i 've been complimented on it a few times in # week occasionally , i 'll have a couple problems with the strap getting <unk> , but this is my only problem worth every penny would suggest to other people
i gave this case a five star , because it deserves it my dell inspiron # r -lrb- # . # inch screen -rrb- has plenty of room to fit inside and is padded enough to protect the laptop there are also a bunch of other areas inside to store the <unk> , mouse and a ton of other stuff yes , i would recommend this to my friends buy one now
i really like this laptop bag it holds all my usb <unk> for my camera , ipod , phone and my laptop it has # inside pockets for memory cards and blank cds/dvds -lrb- one pocket is more shallow than the other # -rrb- the outside material seems durable and resistant to most spills i love how it holds all my <unk> things <unk> so that i do n't have to search the house for one cord ... yet it 's light enough that my arm does n't feel like it 's breaking side note : my # `` laptop fits well in there ... you could probably fit one a couple inches larger too overall , i 'm very pleased with this purchase
this bag is nice i can fit my # & # # ; laptop and power cord in it , no problem i like all the compartments to keep any paperwork and extras organized definitely happy with this purchase
i am very happy with this laptop back for my dell xps # -inch laptop it fits well in the bag with extra space to spare it actually has about # extra inches of width that i could use to put the charger in , if needed as i personally use it , i do n't need that extra space , but it is there if needed in the front pouch , there are plenty of storage compartments for my needs overall , very nice laptop bag and a good price i would buy it again
the powerbook # `` fits perfectly in the main section there is plenty of room for an assortment of cords for computer , camera and iphone the strap on the backside for securing atop rolling luggage is robust and convenient this case is well designed , functional and appears as a professional case the carry strap is strong and adjustable
i have only used the product once since my purchase , when i went on vacation i was able to pack both mine and my husband laptops , i placed a hand towel between the two , both the cords , my ereader and it 's charger in it along with my cell phone charger everything arrived safely and in working order
i recently purchased this laptop case this laptop case is perfect for my laptop i was pleased that it has enough room for my laptop , papers , and charging cord this is a very well made case for the money this is just what i needed .
i knew i had to purchase a case when i bought my first laptop my # laptop fits perfectly in this stylish caselogic bag , and it is very easy to pack my wireless mouse , portable hard drive , and smart phone charger the shoulder strap is more comfortable than expected , but i find it more practical to use the handle on top of the case to carry the bag a co-worker of mine had a caselogic bag for his laptop before i purchased this one , and i will continue to purchase caselogic products for my electronic devices i would like to see a bag with hardshell exterior and padded interior for more protection , but this is a high-quality bag that i would recommend to anyone with a large screen laptop
very good case very strong and durable i would give this # marks out of # can hold all accessories + enough room to hold # more ipads . . <unk> logic simply rocks very trusted brand
i looked long and hard to find a case to fit my # & # # ; laptop and this one has not disappointed me i take it when we go to warmer climate in the <unk> and it travels and wears well has ample storage
this case is very well built , and fits my # + lb laptop with its large measurements : # . # `` x # . # `` x # . # `` - # . # `` i placed the huge power supply in the front zipper and it closes just fine i like that it has a very secure and comfortable shoulder strap , the back has the strap to place on the handle of your carry-on , which not every laptop case has materials and zippers are of high quality the handle is comfortable and secure the main compartment is adjustable so the laptop would be snug if it did not fill the entire space
it 's got great storage and simple design i carry a number of cables and paraphernalia to interface to various types of equipment , yet i wanted something that was convenient to carry on a plane this case is perfect it 's roomy without being bulky tough zippers with easy to grab pulls the price is a bargain i 'd buy it again in a heartbeat
this product is without a doubt worth the price and will fit a # in dell computer has plenty of storage space interior is well protected would recomend this to my friends or anyone who was looking
case logic makes great products and in my opinion , this is the best case you could have if you own one of the larger laptops it 's got just the right amount of pockets and other compartments but , it does n't go <unk> like a lot of the cases i 've seen it 's well designed to do the job efficiently quality and simplicity is what i like about the design very affordable so it 's worth the price because it 's all quality and value
i have a toshiba satellite # . # `` laptop and was finding it impossible to find a decent case -lrb- that was n't a giant briefcase bag -rrb- to protect my laptop on the occasions it leaves the house the # . # `` laptop pretty much fills up the main inner compartment , but at least it wo n't be sliding around in there and it offers more padding than a neoprene sleeve the power plug , which for this particular laptop is also pretty large , fits in the exterior zip pocket , and there is also room for a mouse and a few other small computer accessories again this is not a `` do it all `` bag for the business person , as it is not a briefcase bag however , if you are n't transporting the power plug , you could fit some file folders in the exterior zip pocket but if you want something to protect your laptop from being bumped around during transport , this is a great bag
i had no problem with this case and the rain really does n't get it i also bought a slim case for my computer so it handles very well to protect my laptop
we ordered this case to enable us to carry the # . # `` laptop as well as its cords and usb mouse there is plenty of room and it is easy to <unk> it is n't expensive and does the job we need it to do i would recommend it ...
this case fit my # inch laptop perfectly i love the extra zippered pocket in the front for any paperwork i need to take with me this is good quality and i feel my laptop is well protected
after visiting bestbuy and finding not a single decent case , i am happy i ordered this case online it is serious , solid , and well made if you care about protecting your equipment , this is the case it does not have lots of secret compartments but it perfectly accommodates an over-sized laptop , power cable , and perhaps a bunch of documents the materials are high quality and durable nothing less of what i have always gotten from case logic -lrb- and no , i do n't work for them : -- rrb-
i needed a case for my laptop , so i ordered this one i did n't understand that the # inch case meant that it would hold a bigger laptop than the # . # inch screen size i purchased , but it will work
it 's very tough to find an oversized laptop bag but this one takes the cake i was a bit concerned that this would be a flimsy material or cheap looking but the reality is that it is a very nice bag for oversized laptops the material is nice and has that <unk> of stiffness and flexibility that is crucial for this kind of product the bag is a little bit heavy especially with my laptop in it but what oversized bag is going to be light when fully packed i was able to easily store my laptop , power cord , bluetooth mouse , digital camera , business cards , marketing materials , pens , and even some snacks and gum for people with large laptops i do n't think you 'll find much better products than this
i like the size , the fit , the pockets , the cushioned interior , and the durable outer shell i have a # & # # ; dell laptop that fits w/o being cramped and it does n't slide around either
ive been using this bag for a while and its still holding up like the first day it has enough room for a # inch laptop , its large brick charger , mouse , phone and ipod charger , and accessory cords fits msi gt # and asus g # easily . should fit any # inch laptop easily
i am very pleased with this product i ordered it for my hp envy dv # & # # ; laptop it fit perfectly i really like the velcro adjustment partition piece inside the case it adjust so that your laptop does not slide around inside the case whatsoever the extra compartments are convenient it looks great as well i recommend this case great bargain compared to similar product prices at best buy which is where i usually shop . :
i love the bag my only issue it that i have a # . # & # # ; laptop and i should of looked at a smaller one <unk> they make me bigger i guess so you can add other stuff in there cus ther is still like # & # # ; on the side and # & # # ; on top when i put mine in
this case is everything i thought it would be very professional looking , holds all the necessary items i need to do business on the go lightweight yet sturdy priced well for the quality
best laptop case i 've ever owned -lrb- granted it is the only laptop case i 've ever owned lol -rrb- but seriously , i love this thing i also love all the compartments ! !
it was hard finding a case for my # . # laptop , it seems that not too many are made for this size put this is a big and with lots of space and room for other items i was surprise on how nice it really is , i may be buying another for my other laptops i would recommend this for anyone that is looking for a nice bag
i love this briefcase in fact , i have recently purchased a second one as a gift this bag truly reflects the quality of caselogic light as a feather , its wire frame , <unk> padding , and great storage features are a big surprise the strap has <unk> buckles on the sides , so the strap stays straight on your shoulder -lrb- allowing for the best comfort -rrb- the bag itself is a nice water-proof material that has yet to have torn in the past # months all in all , this is a great buy , with a fair $ # <unk>
bag arrived on time and was exactly what i expected it to be from what i saw online the bag is roomy enough for my computer and quite a few files as well as cords , mouse , camera and other odds and ends not too heavy even
i bought this case for my grand daughter the laptop fits well and there is a lot of room for other things such as the charger and mouse for the price i ca n't find anything to complain about it looks well made and should last for a few years
i bought this case to fit my son 's # in asus gaming laptop it fits perfectly with power cord and wireless mouse great quality , great price not used daily , mostly for carrying when traveling away from home would definitely recommend to family and friends
the padded compartment fits a macbook pro or macbook air with plenty of room for magazines , paper , ipad the other pockets provide enough space for power supplies , books , headphones i 've used it as my only carry-on without missing out on packing space much lighter weight , slimmer and more stylish than the backpack it replaced if i <unk> by bike in the rain , this would not be my choice , but i do n't , so i like it
i bought this bag for my girlfriend after looking at many different bags this one seemed the most convenient for carrying a # . # `` laptop to the university and back the laptop is secured and protected by a foam-like material , and there is enough room for the charger unit it has some more spare room for additional things such as papers and pens , but not enough for a medium binder it also seems that the material this bag is made of , is of high quality , which can be used for a long duration
bought this to house my new # . # inch dell , and it works wonderfully i have room in the front pockets for the two part charger cord , my wireless mouse , a screen cleaner , and lots of space left over for a notebook and papers
i use this bag for my # `` macbook pro and it fits perfect with plenty of room lots of padding and an excellent shoulder strap i love it see my video review here : -lsb- ...
i love this laptop bag i use it for my # `` macbook air the first stm bag i purchased was the ipad bag that looks just like a smaller version of this bag i loved that one so much that i had to get this one as well it works incredibly well - quality materials , great protection for the computer , and comfortable to carry it comes with a shoulder pad that i do n't use -lrb- it 's removable -rrb- because the strap is perfectly comfortable without the added padding i was initially worried that there would be too much room in the main laptop compartment and my computer would be bouncing around there is extra space in there if you are using it for the air , but it still cushions it nicely and it does n't really bounce around overall , very satisfied , and i 'd recommend it
bought this bag a little over a month ago , and i really like it it has plenty of pockets/compartments , it 's perfect for carrying my ipad # and some of my books it looks great and , so far , has held up nicely
it 's inexpensive , but the lines are clean and the design is refined i use it to transport my # in macbook pro to and from work it protects the laptop really well and leaves room for my kindle , a notebook , some pens and a file folder i 'm a huge fan of this bag , especially at the price
i needed a bag for my alienware m # x laptop i wanted something light that still provided room for the power supply , a single file folder and the charger for my mobile device i looked at countless bags before settling on this one and it is perfect the only thing that would improve it would be if it had a small handle at the top instead of the little loop of canvas
this is very cheaply made the design is nice but i do n't feel safe putting my laptop in it because it is made of a very thin fabric with very little cushioning so it does n't serve the one purpose that it 's supposed to serve what a waste of money it also has a very bad petroleum smell
laptop sleeve was nice when it arrived , made well and design did n't seem to be the kind that would peel off however , even though it claimed to fit my # `` laptop , it was just barely too small to fit no way it fits up to # `` laptops return was painless
the case was exactly what it looks like in the picture it was very thin though the zipper ripped as i was closing . this happened about a year after i bought it
product `` technical details `` says it 's # . # `` w x # . # `` d x # `` h in the interior my computer is a `` # -inch widescreen `` which is # `` w x # `` d x # / # `` <unk> i think the height makes it so that you ca n't stretch it to fit inside thought others might like to know before they buy other than that the item seemed good ; just could n't fit my computer into it
when i purchased this on-line my reason was that it looked hip and had that -lrb- what i thought -rrb- was some sort of <unk> design i had looked at the ones in the <unk> where they had all these covers in bright colors and <unk> monkey faces on them - sorry , i am not a <unk> however , upon receiving it , you realize the design is a lot more `` <unk> `` that it looks on screen - yes , my next purchase are going to be better <unk> this really is not a quibble just a warning to other <unk> who are not <unk> <unk> <unk> and all that other <unk> my only true worry about it is that it i wonder about the padding i discovered the hard way with my pc of # years that putting it in a suitcase <unk> to boston airport is not a good idea - cracked screen the covers in the apple store -lrb- the ones with the monkey faces -rrb- all seemed to have more padding i took this on a flight recently to los angeles and my wee macbook was just fine i just wish the <unk> design did n't give me as many odd looks
- it certainly looks good - it 's light and easy to carry around my pro - it fits perfectly - it does n't have awesome cushioning , so i would n't go around dropping my laptop anytime soon so if it 's cushioning you 're looking for , go for a neoprene all in all , i 'm quite satisfied with this product i do n't have a speck case so it prevents from scratching the underside of my laptop when i take it out of the sleeve -lrb- because i place it on it ! -rrb- i would definitely buy it again , given a choice it 's light , portable and it 's quite appealing , aesthetically
this product has held up well the only issue i had with it is that the zipper piece had came unhooked but i just put it back on and pinched the piece back together as far as the material it has held up for over a year and i still have no issues with it falling apart money well spent
i absolutely love it it is soft and fits perfectly i just got a hardcase for my # -inch macbook pro and it still fits into the soft sleeve it 's like a glove would buy it again anytime wish there were more different designs and i 'd get several just so i can change it around
this case is pretty and seems to do the job just fine looks like it is made pretty well and is a reasonable value for the money it does n't heavily pad the computer so , if you are wanting big protection , this wo n't work but it provides a nice sleeve to protect from scrapes , dirt , etc .
let 's be honest a lot of these cases are overpriced in the stores and do n't look nearly as nice as this one for five bucks and some change i definitely got a steal received it in two days and it fits like a glove i am not big on <unk> so this is perfect for those penny <unk> out there looking for a bargain that actually matches its description
i bought this case sleeve for my new # inch macbook pro it fits in it perfectly the price is very good and i love the design of the sleeve
i got this sleeve for my # ' macbook pro and it fits like a glove i absolutely love the color and design on the sleeve , and it 's also not so big and bulky so it fits great in my backpack when i take it with me to school
it was exactly what i was expecting now , do n't think that if you drop the computer or smash it against a wall that it will be safe this will protect it from scratches when you are shoving it in your bag with other books and things it 's exactly what i wanted
i wish it came with a handle or something , but other than that the material is nice and sturdy you definitely have protection , <unk> , and great aesthetic quality with this carrier i love it !
this is a great case if you carry your laptop is a bookbag or other bag . does n't do a whole lot to protect the device itself but it is stylish
you will not receive what is pictured on amazon the bag is swiss gear but does not have the same number of gussets nor type of wheels pictured also did not come with the pictured and advertised computer carry bag
i bought a swiss gear rolling bag for work the wheels are not nearly large enough but that 's not the big problem ... the big problem is the handle system this is my second bag and the second time the handles broke there was a # year warranty ... but oh my ... did they give me a hard time they did replace the bag ... but same problem a little while later ... the handles either stick in the up position , or worse ... the collapsed position the covering on the handle fell apart this company obviously does not make cases for everyday use no more swiss gear for me shame ... the rest of the bag was ok
i have had this bag for over a year now and am getting great use from it i travel a lot , so having something that can keep up is important to me
i have bought several bags in the past year wheels tend to wear down and fall off - so far - this has been a very large durable bag worth the money
the shipping & handling was great the case is big along with the handy laptop bag that slips <unk> on the carry handle it is well built , roll smoothly & very convenient i bought it for # day biz trips where the capacity is ideal & i take everything on board the only drawback is the lack of mini pocket on the laptop hand bag other than that , great product for great price
this is perfect for the samsung series # -lrb- np # c -rrb- it 's a snug fit and is about # `` wider than the computer but in my case , i 'm also able to fit a verizon usb air card alongside the computer , so the extra inch or so is fine as others have mentioned , the magnetic clasp is n't that strong , but , it really does n't need to be assuming you 'll be carrying it under your arm , there 's no way it 's going to open the leather seems fine to me - for this price , you can get two just in case the first wears out !
i just bought this for my brand new macbook air # `` and i absolutely love it it 's really sexy looking and i feel safe having my computer in there it fits the slim design of the air perfectly and still holds a good shape it does get dirty easily , but it is black and the leather is n't real it 's a unique and stylish design and i ca n't wait to rock it around school
for those that buy a <unk> and wish that it came with a decent case then you should purchase this it is the perfect size the cover is kept closed with a magnetic clip and so if you put too much in it will not stay latched otherwise this is a good product
well , it 's designed for macbook air # `` and macbook pro # `` i think it 's fit for macbook pro # `` but , i did n't try it anyway , it 's like envelope pouch , i recommend it for macbook user
well , it 's been six months since i bought this for my macbook air and it 's been holding up pretty well not the best quality as far as materials are concerned , but it works it fits the # `` macbook air perfectly i store my laptop in this and lug it around everywhere without having to carry a backpack when people see it and ask me what it is , i say `` it 's my laptop . they always give me a puzzled look that 's the best part about this sleeve , it 's very inconspicuous people would never know there 's a laptop in there it looks like a file folder containing paperwork that nobody wants it 's a lot better than those neoprene zippered laptop sleeves that thieves always have their eye on
i purchased this sleeve because i had trouble finding anything to fit the new # `` - diagonal samsung <unk> # ultrabook it arrived promptly in a box with air pillows to protect it -lrb- not a cardboard envelope as other reviews have said . it fits the computer perfectly with just enough room for the clasp to close looks professional and fits in my purse great
i bought this for my # `` macbook pro the laptop fits perfectly , the case looks nice , it has a very functional magnetic clasp as well as a good solid feel to it my one issue with this product is that it has a terrible , powerful odor i 'm not entirely sure what to do to get rid of it , but it 's not pleasant at all
this is a very good laptop sleeve for the price the leather is nice , but the <unk> are not real leather a mac air is probably the best fit for it as your laptop needs to be quite thin if you want the magnet of the flap to stay in place i am satisfied with this purchase : it 's definitely an excellent value , all other leather cases are close to $ # i recommend it
so glad i purchased this product and at such a great price it 's a great fit for my macbook pro -lrb- # . # `` -rrb- with or without its protective case the leather is n't of the best quality , but you get what you pay for
i was n't expecting much from this sleeve , but i really love the look it 's a little bit wider for my macbook pro # `` but it fits nicely i highly recommend
i had such a hard time finding a decent , non-bulky case for my yoga # pro all other # & # # ; cases are slightly too snug for this ultrabook i purchased this # & # # ; case and it fits perfectly , you even have room for a pen or something to fit alongside it if you want case looks great and is a great price
i use this case to carry my dell xps # other reviews only talk about the use with a macbook , but it fits my ultra book perfectly gives a clean and professional appearance
maximum measurements for inside pocket width inside : # . # & # # ; -lrb- # mm height inside : # . # & # # ; -lrb- # . # mm depth inside : # . # & # # ; -lrb- # mm -- with laptop in the bag is about . # & # # ; -lrb- # . # mm put a inspiron # laptop in there had to use # hands to get it in and out the first few times now it fits like a glove and slides easy exceptionally light , slim , and classy
i brought this for my new macbook pro , the one without retina display -lrb- the one with the cd slot -rrb- , and it fits perfectly ill admit , like one of the other reviews said , the magnetic clasp is weak , even when the laptop is n't in there but its stiff and sturdy , and protects my laptop well the inside is also soft , not a scratchy material . : -rrb- it looks great as well . : -rrb- happy with my purchase here
although i do not own an apple macbook , this sleeve fits my <unk> notebook computer perfectly the leather outside looks stylish , and this sleeve is well constructed it will last for years the price and delivery were also excellent
it fits my macbook pro # `` computer perfectly it is not too small , the magnet that keeps it closed works perfectly , the quality of the material on the inside and on the outside is great , and it looks amazing i would absolutely recommend this case
i am in law school , so i wanted something professional without compromising style and functionality the magnet closure makes it easy i do not like zippers . furthermore it fits my # inch sony vaio with room to spare i keep an legal pad and a pen along with my laptop , and it fits fine i would recommend this to everyone everyone is always <unk> that it is a laptop case , because it looks so nice furthermore , they are surprise i got it for under # bucks
i bought this bag a few months back at first it looked very nice and stylish , however being made with ecofriendly materials it gets dirty quite easy and with prolonged use the seams tends to come loose near the leather trim on the
this bag is really nice but the flap stops short of fully closing due to where the velcro and fastening clasp are located , which is too high it needs to be located closer to the bottom of the front of bag comfortable and stylish
normally i am not one of the users who buys accessories online , unless i touch and feel and see them this was my # st online accessory purchase and i must say this was a great product this bag has enough amount of space for a # inch laptop , although i must say that the bag will close properly but the <unk> strap wo n't exactly match the place where its supposed to stick leaving that aspect aside , it is a great bag , looks cool and trendy and must buy two thumbs up . . ! ! also i got it cheaper on amazon than the price which was actually listed on ebags
this bag works well for my use the color is great the construction seems strong and supportive there are plenty of pockets to hold a several accessories this bag has a carrying handle as well as a wide , single shoulder strap -lrb- not backpack style -rrb- i have a hp pavilion g # laptop with a # . # `` screen that fits -lrb- almost -rrb- nicely in the bag the only exception is that the securing strap does n't quite reach the velcro patch going over the laptop but the outside flap cover has a velcro and magnetic button to secure the cover i 'm satisfied with this bag , its usage , and my purchase
i bought this bag primarily to carry my laptop in it has a separate compartment for just that and it is really well padded it fits my # in macbook pro even with a sleeve on it overall , the bag has lots of small compartments to store other things -lrb- phone , keys , pens , folders , etc . . . -rrb- and i love the colors of the bag it goes with everything it also has a wide strap which is really comfortable for toting around a college campus i am extremely happy with my bag and i highly recommend
this <unk> protector works well works well as a sleeve to provide a little protection for carrying a computer works well to keep the heat off my lap but other things i have work better i use a bag to carry my computer and i have a portable table to use my computer on , so it never goes on my lap if someone wants to combine those two functions , this sleeve will do that but i suspect most people , like me , will prefer to use other things for both functions
my pet peeve with my laptop computer is how it heats up my legs and lap when i use it <unk> has <unk> the notebook sleeve , a simple , ingenious product that is designed to keep both you and your computer cool one side of the sleeve features a soft cushion , so that the computer can rest comfortably against your lap the other side features a <unk> <unk> material that distributes heat to keep your laptop cooler as well a zippered edge hides a <unk> lined interior to accommodate your laptop or other items the interior also features a hidden handle so you can easily carry the sleeve and your laptop this notebook sleeve is # . # inches , so it will not accommodate older , larger laptop or notebook computers the device is a nice alternative to those electrical , plug-in <unk> devices designed to keep your laptop computer cooler this is light-weight , very portable , and handy for use around the home , in the office or classroom , or on-the-go i can see students especially enjoying the sleeve for its portability and effectiveness in protecting your computer and for its cooling effect
this sleeve fits my dell notebook easily it does keep my lap cool -lrb- not that my dell gets that hot anyway -rrb- and does provide a nice solid base to put my laptop on overall i feel it delivers as advertised i am not so sure this is a necessary accessory though it does not fit my adapter inside which would have been nice since maybe then it could double as a case . i still need my laptop case and now inserting this sleeve <unk> of my computer then shoving it all in the case is a really tight fit which necessitated taking other items out of my case i also find it cumbersome that you have to take the netbook entirely out of the sleeve to use it if you travel a lot this may interest you although i have # laptops i rarely find myself actually putting them in my lap at home perhaps for use in an airport or car etc . it would be more essential
if i get into the zone i can write for hours without stopping i like to be comfortable when i 'm working and this notebook sleeve works for me i can place my notebook atop it and write wherever i want to which is wonderful because i get bored always working at my desk so far , i 've used it for four hours straight , and it helped reduce the heat that my notebook generates , plus it 's comfortable on my lap if i should have any problems in the future , i 'll be sure to come back and edit this review
i find this very useful to set on my lap while traveling on a train and a bus also as a passenger in a car . my legs did not get all sweaty and it held up great against bumps in the roads as well it <unk> my laptop nicely and takes seconds to pull out and put back in . overall a great product ... .
after # months continuous use , attache -lrb- # -rrb- lock hinge broke , handle cracked , mount eyelet -lrb- shoulder strap mounts to -rrb- , pulled out & inside fabric material , pretty much disintegrated i did not get the long time use , from this attache case , as i did , the one i replaced , after using # years i will not purchase this type again
i bought a zero halliburton after i bought this case there 's really no comparison where as this case will still work , and was slightly larger than the $ # + zero halliburton case i bought it also lacks a few features and solid construction where it counts , the locking mechanism i ended up keeping it , -lrb- or rather not returning it -rrb- and gave this to a family member who liked it well enough everyone 's happy
getting into a business that will require me to transport sensitive documents and materials , i needed a harder shell aluminum briefcase with locks i love everything about this case - color , design , locks , handle , etc . except i wish that it was maybe an inch deeper i did a fair amount of measuring and knew exactly what i wanted , and i feel that this case was not as deep as i expected it to be i can get around that , so overall i enjoy the case
i bough this to replace my current laptop carrying case i needed something <unk> with a synthetic lint-free liner and this was the best option i could find for under $ # my colleagues were impressed and have all started buying new -lrb- and often more expensive -rrb- cases there 's just something about the appearance of solid brushed aluminum it 's no zero <unk> , but unless you 're in the market for a $ # case , i 'd recommend this modest alternative
if you did your homework looking around amazon for an aluminum attache you know there are tons of them and they all look good nobody want to be that one who tells others what not to buy based on your own experience gladly , this is not my case now looking for an attache that will make you look good , well build and fully functional ? look no more
it is exactly what i needed , and , is exactly as advertised it is well made , very sturdy it is obviously a halliburton knock-off , but at one fifth the price classy design , both inside and out i carry tools and <unk> for testing precious <unk> considerable weight , for a case this size no problem - the case carries all of my equipment with no problems the only change that i made was to remove the internal straps used to secure a lap top computer . , and also , i do n't use the external carrying strap great value for the money best purchase i 've made in a long time
i ordered this case because i am a general <unk> and i have gone through # leather covered cases that have fallen apart i was looking for a case that would hold up to the abuse i put it through on a daily basis this case is both tough and stylish and i am happy with my choice i find it a little smaller inside than the others i have used but that helps me to clean it out more often , which is a good thing the case looks sharp and i often get <unk> down at the local <unk> yard but i just joke that it 's a bomb . lol one weak point seems to be the latch operation it has always been a bit tricky but if you take your time to close the case and make sure it 's seated evenly it works ok the combination lock works ok and the latches hold fine other than that i did slap a <unk> decal on the top of mine so it 's a no brainer when i open it overall , this is a good quality case and i have already put it to the test
