this is a perfect bag for a netbook i read reviews of it before i bought it and the # complaints presented i believe are positive attributes first the interior color is light blue and helps in finding what you need in the bag or pockets second the single handle is adequate for security and much more convenient to get open i would n't change anything about this case i have an <unk> netbook , a digital camera , and a remote hard drive in this case
this case fits my netbook very well it is as advertised and has a carrying handle some of the reviews are negative re the single handle but i have not had any problem carrying the netbook while stored in this case it does n't hang straight down because of the single handle but i do not find that to be a problem for me i would suggest using the netbook for a while prior to buying a case because of the number of optional accessories one may decide to purchase although this case does have some space for accessories i would get a larger case if i had it to do over it holds my accessories such as dvd drive and mouse etc but there are a few other items i would like to add to the collection and the case would not hold them bottom line is that this is a very nice case and may suit all your needs but if you are an <unk> <unk> you may need something a bit larger
this case is of very high-quality construction and has an amazing amount of room for a netbook , mouse , connecting cables , external <unk> and a notebook and papers the shoulder strap works fine and the single strap for a handle is no big deal -- it works fine i absolutely would recommend this case to anyone needing a good-quality , protective case for a netbook and accessories it is as nice or nicer than cases i saw in retail stores at twice the price or more
pro : shoulder strap , large enough to hold netbook power supply and mouse and many extras holds my eeepc # he with no problems well padded and resists water , front compartment will hold my cell phone , lots of usefull compartments cons : you ca n't use the netbook in the case , only one handle <unk> : if you want to carry your netbook with accessaries this is a good choice , i could even fit my cd/dvd burner in this bag
nice looking bag with plenty of room for my mouse , battery charger , pens , phone , notebooks , just what i was looking for bright blue interior makes it easy to see in the bag picture does n't do justice to this bag
this was exactly what i wanted it fits my ipad with room for my notes and things all the things that normally fall to the bottom of my purse have handy pockets for storage in the zippered side compartment and its even a little smaller than the purse i was carrying before i ordered it compact and organized , professional look and feel , it 's perfect
really , i like these cases i purchased the first one for my dell netbook and accessories the case has lots of pockets for storage i liked it so much , that i purchased a second one for my other electronics , i take on trips with me oh , you will read about the ` single handle ' on it well , my solution to that is to slide the should strap through that single handle , to make it hang straight , while carrying it around that works great , trust me , you will love it i highly recommend this case
i like the design of the bag very much it 's compact and easy on the commute , and it does a nice job protecting both my laptop and the contents however , the fabric is developing frayed edges around the most frequently used zipper compartments where i put things in and take them out again i 've never seen this kind of wear on a quality backpack given the price , i should absolutely not be seeing it with this bag i 'm very unhappy with the resulting frayed appearance if i had bought the stupid thing at wal-mart for # bucks , i 'd feel differently ... but i did n't i bought a relatively expensive bag with the expectation that i was getting a quality product that would wear well for years , as have most of my other bags as it is , i 'll be lucky to get a year out of this thing before i get disgusted with the frayed appearance and toss it for something better if you 're looking for a compact bag that will stand the test of time , look elsewhere
if you want compact and not very big backpack , you 'll love this one enough space to put all your daily needs and walk around or bike with ease and if you travel a lot and use airports , the x-ray feature will make your life <unk> when you pass through airport security the only thing that i miss is better zippers that are waterproof , or some kind of a extra layer that will prevent rain from entering the backpack
this bag is very well built but i expected a little more room the prostyle light backpack is actually larger than this and can accommodate more stuff overall very happy with the purchase just which there was a bit more space , it is a travel bag after all
this is the best backpack i 've ever owned it 's compact , but i never have problems getting everything i need into it the <unk> feature is fun at airports most people have n't seen them , so it was fun showing off to my travel <unk> and other <unk> . : -rrb- i highly recommend this backpack
i travel regularly and needed a replacement computer bag i got this one based on the reviews at first i thought it would be too small to be a good bag but it has proven to be better than my previous bag the one thing that always surprises me is the weight if you travel through airports enough with a computer bag slung over your shoulder you are familiar with that pain at the top of your shoulder from lugging the laptop around well this bag is so light , that feeling has gone away completely and the padded strap makes the impression more <unk> it is a very comfortable bag in addition , i like all the compartments where i can stow away different items based on use i like that and helps things stay organized
i was in the market for a briggs and riley glide <unk> backpack case that 's ~ $ # this one is very similar and has the same capacity , but obviously for less $ $ i like briggs and riley as the quality is good , but brenthaven is not bad either so far ... the brenthaven is an excellent bag and as good as the glide
the backpack is very comfortable to wear tsa agents are now aware that x-ray friendly backpacks exist and so going through security is easy lots of space to store stuff
if you are looking for a bag to hold everything you own , or for school , this bag is not it i 'd agree that it is a little bit on the small side and it would be nice to have had some external pockets for a water bottle or umbrella still ... a very nice , light , well made bag i discovered something , not sure of it is by design or not yes , the bag butterflies open , but you can also use that area as a large , separate , zippered pocket i 'm keeping a compact umbrella , gloves , and a pair of # s ear <unk> in there shoulder straps a curved and do not require a sternum strap , a big surprise intelligent and well made if you are looking for something to carry what you would normally put in a attach & eacute ; case , plus a laptop , this is it
having gone through about # different laptop bags over the years , set out on a mission to find the perfect bag the brenthaven <unk> is it smart organization - not too many useless pockets , not too few minor drawbacks - no water bottle holder top handle could be a bit larger and beefier they could add a side handle such that it can be carried on its side truly a fantastic
i 'm sorry i bought this it 's not the quality of the pack , but the design i do n't like i do n't think i 'll by another backpack on line it 's too personal of a purchase the main problem is there is not enough little pockets , outlet pockets , exterior pockets , compartments the computer pocket is fine , but should also contain within that same zipper compartment to put other things not enough space also , for the main compartment is too small and there is only one interior pocket to separate things i need a pack with a lot more compartments
i was a bit disappointed by the space management of this rather large backpack -lrb- # `` x # `` x # `` -rrb- the non-laptop compartment does not accommodate more than a # `` binder which seems like a huge waste of space i am also not sure if this rather bulky and rigid backpack actually fits under airplane seat in front of you but i doubt it on the positive side it does have several compartments that help keep smaller stuff organised the nicely padded and <unk> straps make carrying comfortable , though i felt they squeezed my neck a little the backpack looks very durable and the general butterfly system helps you to go through airport security quickly without having to unpack your laptop i eventually bought thecase logic # -inch security-friendly laptop backpack -lrb- <unk> # -lrb- see my review there -rrb- which i felt was superior in terms of space management , functionality and wearing comfort
i really like being able to go through the tsa checkpoints without having to pull stuff out this is a huge <unk> -lrb- took nearly # minutes off my average trip through tsa so far -rrb- however , this bag is much more limited on space than my previous brenthaven bag which is kind of a bummer the internal organization is quite nice and it does make very efficient use of the space that is <unk> the bag is extremely well made -lrb- typical brenthaven engineering -rrb- and in general , i am quite pleased with it it 's expensive compared to other bags , but , the durability and exceedingly good overall design -lrb- <unk> , space efficiency , organization -rrb- is well worth it in my opinion
granted , the bag is big , but for a guy that travels with a lot of stuff , i think it 's awesome i had a swiss army backpack that i really liked but it wore out i got it replaced under warranty and the new one wore out even faster i think the accessory pockets are better with the swiss army bag , but that 's my only dig on the brenthaven i 've taken one international trip and it 's holding up well i had n't even realized how much more comfortable the straps are until i put my old swiss army bag back on all in all , it 's a great bag that really protects your computer
i had previously owned a tumi thinking that i had the best now i know that i <unk> for what i thought was good and the brenthaven is both better quality and much better price all the features are very cool , <unk> the <unk> to leave my laptop in the backpack through security highly recommend for those that do not need a brand that says you <unk>
ok , so this backpack wo n't win awards on the <unk> if thats important to you look elsewhere but if you want a plain -lrb- but <unk> designed -rrb- case to sling over your shoulder -lrb- and maybe even buckle up for running across the <unk> -rrb- look no further i 've had a previous generation of this backpack for almost a decade and i can confidently say that the quality rivals that of military grade stuff the seams , threads and zippers are all solid and the canvas is top notch -- no cuts or holes after dragging this thing through hell on # out of # <unk> its fallen off a bus in <unk> , been <unk> by a few <unk> <unk> in australia and generally faced more ice , mud , dust and overhead compartments than i care to think about sure , its worn but its every bit as functional as the day i bought it and the several laptops that have <unk> the bumpy ride along the way have opened every time unaware of the <unk> they had crossed
this bag fulfills everything i need in carrying my # inch hp laptop in the way of perfectly positioned pockets that allow me to carry all accessories and power pack as well as business papers this is all i carry on the airplane but , almost since i got the bag , the zipper on the compartment where i keep my laptop keeps failing , opening up completely i find that by sliding the zipper back and forth , i can get it to shut and stay shut , but a quality zipper would have been a better way to build this bag
wow , this thing is really tiny we bought it to lug around a # `` netbook it will definitely store a # `` laptop , but not a * whole * lot else maybe your powersupply and a mouse there are two main compartments , and two zip pockets on the outside flap -lrb- read : not big pockets -rrb- that 's about it i would have preferred a bit more compartments it is so small , it only looks fitting on my wife as a man , when i carry it , it feels so small like it just does n't look right hope this helps
purchased the backpack in # and still as good as new the design and construction materials are the best i 've seen since in fact , i returned to purchase another to <unk> some elements for use as a smaller sling bag -lrb- not for laptop use -rrb- casecrown , if you ever read this , please bring this brilliant backpack back into production and if you 're feeling especially kindly toward your fans , also make a slim sling bag of standard paper height and width
i bought # bags from amazon all at once and tried them all they were all too big this is a tiny bag , but it holds a lot through very clever design i would have easily pay more than twice the price for this bag - it is that good in fact , i am seriously considering buying another and just keeping it in storage in case my current one ever wears out and they are no longer making this bag
i got it for my asus # . # netbook it 's not super snug there 's a little space around the top but it makes it easy to put in and take out i got the green and it 's a little brighter in real life than on the screen
it 's a netbook sleeve basic , but all i needed i got the blue color , it 's very pretty seems as though it will protect my netbook nicely i wish the edges were a little less bulky so it would take up less space , but no big deal
for the low price , you ca n't go wrong i especially love this blue color the material is not as soft and good as say , an incase sleeve for the bigger notebooks , but for the price i 'm not complaining
it was a really good fit for the acer # . # -lrb- # -rrb- netbook model with the larger # cell battery it wo n't fit much else , however and has no pockets i had to disconnect my mini mouse from it but i was able to slip it underneath the netbook and close it quite easily it is a good looking case with good padding but no handles of any kind at least it fit as i know many models that say they do , do n't
ordered a pink samsung netbook for my wife , and wanted to add a bit of flair with a nice case only glitch in ordering this was a discount that did n't appear upon checkout as advertised all was taken care of with a single email , and the discount was applied this zipper case is very nice , and sturdy without being bulky what originally came with the netbook can best be described as a dust cover my wife loves the pink color which is also insurance that i wo n't be stealing it from her to go show my buddies . :
this sleeve for the tosiba netbook is great it fits perfect and stays protected with a thicker case i only wish it had room for the power cord , but since the life of the battery in the tosiba is # hours <unk> n't even had to take it with me unless i travel
i ordered the be.ez la robe sleeve for my # . # inch acer one aspire netbook and it is a perfect fit it is stylish and well made and a bargain for the price i did a lot of research and shopping before i purchased this sleeve for my netbook and this was by far the best deal for the price i would highly recommend this product for its thick padding which completly protects the netbook and it 's brightly colored too two thumbs up
i bought this for my wife 's new samsung nc # netbook it fits perfectly and she loves the color great protection for the netbook and stylish too very satisfied and would buy again
this backpack only lasted three weeks and both the zippers broke i do n't take it on long extended periods either i only go from the house to the car , which is only maybe # feet , and then from the car to work , which is only about # feet so this thing was not misused at all i would not recommend this backpack to anyone stay away whatever you do i had no choice but to buy a different brand and threw this one away
i must by for anybody needing a large backpack for a large laptop my only criticism is the price could be better and it didnt come with the rain cover ... as promised
this backpack is perfect for my laptop plenty of pockets and room for any accessories you may need it is very stylish and looks great the only problem i have had is that the first one came with a defective zipper the new one has good zippers and i am looking forward to using the pack for a long time
seller never sent item i sent email asking for item and got a response that it was on it 's way . # weeks <unk> , the item still had n't come i filed a complaint with amazon i was then offered a refund or to wait longer for the item i asked for a refund i gave the seller a bad but truthful review they tried to <unk> me to retract the review with a discount on their other items like i would get those items do n't know about the bag , but do n't use this
<unk> this for my wife , s toshiba # . # inch but it is to small you must take the battery off for the bag to close , so it is worthless to me
this is absolutely adorable fits the acer pink <unk> color matches to a `` t `` . while the side pocket provides space for both your <unk> wireless mouse , it does bulge out causing it not <unk> so cute i do love the look and feel of the case
this little bag is quite the sweet look with its dressy and soft faux alligator shell it 's padded appropriately throughout , with special attention on the cushy `` bottom . it has a pair of short tote handles and a nice matching -lrb- pink -rrb- shoulder strap that tucks easily into the zipper side pocket as with many computer bags , though , the side pocket it not deep enough to hold the power cords without serious bulging if you 're looking for a dressy and stylish bag for your <unk> , this bag is an excellent choice and it 's the perfect match and fit for my asus net book , also light pink
this is first off very pretty pink , sturdy and easy to use i enjoy it immensely i 'm new to <unk> , it was suggested by a fellow <unk> and the price was absolutely unbeatable !
could n't have bought anything better i love it it is very soft , the pink is really pretty the case holds my laptop securely and safely i had a case before and the way the handles were attached -lrb- both on same side -rrb- i always thought the thing would unzip itself but this is much
i bought this gorgeous little bag for my pink sony vaio w # i had doubts it may not fit in the bag , because of the large battery of this model , but it 's perfect and i love it the bag itself is impressive and convenient i recommend it
this is such a gorgeous case the color is beautiful , and it works great with the netbook i have this case in both silver and navy , but this red case was unfortunately damaged by glue under the paper label strip i had to return it since the glue ruined the look of the case and i can not use it this is very unfortunate i hope this problem is <unk> up the manufacturer needs to stop using this paper label a chocolate brown version i had ordered previously also had this same issue
the product itself seems good but the finish on this netbook case gets completely ruined by the packaging there is apparently an interaction between the packaging paper band and the finish on the case the color from the case <unk> into the band and leaves a permanent discoloration on the case where the band has been in contact this is completely unacceptable if you 're buying this case for its looks do n't do it you 'll be very disappointed by the discoloration
this is a really sharp case for my netbook , however , the packaging was faulty so i will have to return it let me explain -- the metalic <unk> case was <unk> by a # inch wide strip of cardboard with `` casecrown `` printed on it and it came in a plastic bag i took it out of the bag and ripped off the `` casecrown `` cardboard to find that the cardboard had lifted the red color off of the case now i have a really nice case that has a # inch wide strip of color missing i really do n't know why this happened , but i am disappointed otherwise , it is a really good quality case
it 's a good , fashionable little case the only thing about this one is that i think it 's better suited for an # `` netbook because a # `` is a bit too short for the top straps to keep it in place so if you have an # `` , i highly recommend it
this bag is really gorgeous and my asus netbook fits in it very well with just a bit of room to spare around the edges i just got it so i ca n't comment on its durability the issue with the label pulling off <unk> has been resolved , at least in my case and perhaps permanently there was no big cardboard label across the bag and just a small tag label instead i 'm sorry that so many others experienced that issue , but i am grateful to them that their complaints got the issue resolved
i was expecting some sort of flaw in the material , but i could not find any flaws it is beautiful and fits my white asus # . # inch netbook like a glove the cord fits in the case , which is all i need i am very satisfied !
<unk> is my favorite color , so this is great it is a rich color and is well made and easily cleaned i bought this for my kindle it slides around a bit as it is too big , but i can leave the cover on the kindle and also put my cord . light and other <unk> all in this case i like that it has a shoulder strap for when i have too much else in my hands and can not carry everything at once
i 've had this for three -lrb- or four -rrb- years now and it 's as good as new it holds my mouse plus ipod and cords and goes wherever i go
i did n't know what to expect based on other reviews stating that the case showed up damaged from packaging take heart , prospective buyers it seems that whatever packaging flaw existed has been resolved my case is gorgeous deep metallic burgundy , like a rich candy apple red i 've only had it a few days and have had numerous compliments it 's not just pretty , either - it appears durable and well-made based on my initial inspection a definite must-buy if you 're <unk> , go ahead and purchase with confidence . # stars
i snagged this bag for the netbook i bought the wife to take to europe -- hoping she could carry the computer and use it as a purse as well the bag is a bit small to make that happen , but it does work well if all you want to do is carry your netbook and a few accessories forget carrying lots of accessories -- a smallish ac adapter , power cord and a small mouse are a tight fit strap adjuster often moves when you bump it the circular carabiners attaching the strap can open on their own , causing a nasty drop
the case is good quality but it 's too tight , not room enough for carrying everything -lrb- charger , mouse or extra battery -rrb- i do n't use it anymore because of that if you only want to carry your netbook this is a good choice , but if you need room for more stuff i really do n't recommend it
it 's a very effective bag it is light and has enough space to house my tablet with its sleeve which has a keyboard attached it also has a separate pocket for accessories and all pockets are zipped the only snag with it is that the latches on the sling buckle rings are not stiff or firm enough so it lets once a while i had to a little tape to keep the latch in place on both sides apart from this yes it 's a good buy
this case fits my ipad # and wireless keyboard perfectly i like the way it hangs vertically , sort of like a purse it 's not too bulky but i can also fit my kindle or journal in there if i need to -lrb- but not both without it being too tight -rrb- the only thing i would change about it would be the way the strap attaches to the bag itself the rings come open too easily and it almost came off my shoulder yesterday because the strap slipped out of the latch without my knowing i 'm confident my ipad would have been unharmed because of all the padding , but it 's still <unk> to think it would have hit the ground if i had n't caught it i will keep a little closer eye on those rings from now on all in all , i am very satisfied with it and would purchase it again if i had it to do over because i could n't find anything else that fit my needs so perfectly
i like this bag when i need to take everything with me but when i do n't , i just use the neoprene sleeve my netbook came with i would n't mind an over-the-shoulder version of this , but again , it 's a good little bag
i needed a small and easy bag to carry around both my ipad and kindle dx around and this was perfect simple and straightforward just what i needed
this is the only bag that would fit my netbook i like the messanger style well padded and durrable you have to keep an eye on the circle clips that hold the strap on if you bump them right it will release the strap . needs a bit more room in the front pouch for the power cord
i have a asus eee # <unk> i wanted a snug fit and this is too big it is made well , and looks nice if you want a loose fit in order to put other things in such as the power cord , this should do it belkin makes a couple of sleeves that fit like a glove
it 's cute ; but there is no place to put the cord it 's just a <unk> with no pockets somebody should make this really clear ahead of time -- and to think that they <unk> a price reduction from some # $ to about # $ it 's worth about # $ and probably cost # cents to produce
i like the case a lot but it is a little too big for the # . # netbook it is cute and i now use it to transport my external dvd player
i 'm not one to write a lot of reviews , but my sister and i both got this case for our netbook the zipper slides very easily -lrb- like melted butter -rrb- at first , but then it gets pretty rough within a few weeks and sadly , both of our zippers broke after a month or so we 're not rough and we do n't really take our netbooks anywhere enough to <unk> this much wear and tear it 's a great product , just not very durable
this product is everything as advertised looks great , fits perfectly , zipper is heavy duty and does n't look like it will fail after a short time really good value for the money
this product is definately <unk> it keeps my netbook well protected in my bag from books and all sorts of things the zip is easy to use and the style is n't too fancy but the case does the job well i would recommend this product to anyone who does n't want to spend a fortune and gets the quality they want
got this to protect my i-pad while in my backpack on the way to the gym and while traveling i-pad fits well and it does what i was looking for for a very reasonable price my wife has had a similar targus <unk> for her motorola tablet for a couple of years now and it has held up very well
i bought this sleeve for my netbook and for the first couple of weeks it had a really bad smell i tried leaving it outside to vent and it did n't really help a lot however , after about a month or two the bad smell went away and it 's a pretty good sleeve now it seems thick enough to protect a netbook
this sleeve does what it 's supposed to : it protects my netbook from spills , nicks , and dust while it bounces around in my backpack it 's not a replacement for a typical laptop case ; it does n't have any handles , pockets , or additional padding the zipper seems decent , and it has n't broken yet in a few weeks of daily use i would buy one again for $ #
i like the case it holds my asus netbook without a problem there is no where to put the charge cables or my mouse , but since i carry the netbook in a bigger bag , it works out fine the only problem is the rubber smell i 'm hoping that it will go away with time for the price , it was well worth getting
others have stated well the condition and uses of the sleeve i will just let you know that i got this sleeve as part of a bundle with a mouse and usb hub everything was great ... except for the color the picture on amazon appears to me to be sort of a black and a dull blue color this is not at all the case it is black and a hideous bright aqua <unk> color i spent about # minutes coloring over the colored strip down the middle and along the borders with a black permanent marker but because of the material it did n't work amazingly well but its ok now the sleeve smells a bit like marker , but that 's my fault i really wish i would have taken a picture before doing so so that you could see just how terrible the bright color is maybe i just got a different one than the picture shows , in either case its unacceptable
i bought the item hoping it would fit my toshiba mini nb # -n # it fits inside and can fully zip up but not without a bit of stretching it is n't a perfect fit with the battery pack sticking out as it does but it works without the battery back , it fits fine i 'm sure the case fits fine with other netbooks without a battery pack sticking out
i bought this for my new asus # pe netbook it fits it very well and i like the blue stripe against the black color , it looks great it was a good deal at under $ # , from amazon
this is a great little case for my hp netbook -lrb- model mini # -rrb- it fits perfectly if i insert the netbook upside down , with the battery at the top the only thing that would make it better is if it had a zippered pocket on the outside to hold the charger
does everything that it 's supposed to do fits an asus infinity with keyboard an external pocket would be nice -lrb- so i took one star off for not having it -rrb- but the again , for # bucks you just ca n't beat it remember , this is a neoprene sleeve , so you 're getting some protection if you 're looking for bulletproof protection , find a different type only have it for a few weeks , so i ca n't attest for its durability if that becomes a problem , i will update in the future for now , it appears to be of pretty good quality
i was looking for a second sleeve for my netbook to carry it in when space is at a premium i already own <unk> zamba neoprene sleeve designed for # . # inch netbooks <unk> # us -lrb- yellow -rrb- which is extremely cushion-y but also adds bulk this targus sleeve fits the bill as the neoprene is rather thin and hardly adds any bulk at all as a matter of fact , it actually might be a bit too thin my asus eeepc # <unk> fits easily , with room to spare on top but the netbook does slide around in it a bit and together with the thin material i am not sure that it provides really good protection in case of a hard drop of the briefcase , etc . the targus zamba definitely gives me a much better feeling with regards to that however , this one works well for the purpose i bought it for - an overstuffed <unk> with not much room to spare so if that is your concern , too , this is a great sleeve if you are looking for premium protection , i 'd recommend the targus zamba instead
this case is well-made and is the perfect slim case to protect my gateway # . # inch netbook i was looking for something to protect my netbook without a lot of bulk , this case does n't have handles or a carrying strap and is perfect for slipping inside my bag or briefcase it does not have room for the power cord or any accessories if that 's what you 're looking for
i have tried several bags for the toshiba nb # this is , by far , has the <unk> fit it also feels much lighter than other bags totally recommend going with this one
i use this case for a samsung netbook i have and love it it completely protects the delicate computer from scratches and other damage and adds very little weight or bulk to the pc i use my pc constantly for work and slide this case onto my pc several times a day with no signs of wear at all the zipper is heavy-duty and makes for easy removal of the pc when needed i liked the case so much i bought another one in red to use when -lrb- and if -rrb- this one ever wears out i would handily recommend this product to other buyers , just make sure your computer is sized correctly to fit
i love the colors on this case , and i love that it protects my eeepc from harm but most of all , i love that it 's less than $ # and works just as well as the > $ # models a best buy , in my opinion
the case was exactly what i needed when i purchased my notebook for my daughter it is very durable and secures the device from elements i would recommend this for anyone who needs a good protector for their notebook computer the price was very reasonable and the shipping was quick
this case fit my toshiba # -n # <unk> netbook with a # . # `` screen without problem i looked at others and most seemed too tight a fit for me the charger and cord does not fit into the case , but that was what i wanted and had anticipated i would call this fit perfect the simple black case with black stripe is inconspicuous and does not draw attention to it the unit appears well made , but only time will tell how it holds up this was an excellent choice for my netbook
i bought this laptop sleeve at the same time as my netbook it is very versatile because of its stretching <unk> i carry cords and other equipment with my netbook and everything fits either in the case with my computer or in the outside pouch
my friend just gave me this case because she had no more use for it and it fits my transformer prime tablet with the dock just great i was hesitant to buy this one when i was looking around for a case because of the dock adding some thickness when attached , but it fits just perfectly
i bought this for an asus tf # t tablet , without realizing the case was designed for a netbook so , it 's a bit large for the tablet but i kept it anyway better too large than too small i put my tablet in this case and toss it into my backpack nice item , no problems after # months of use
pro - great price , good looking , not bulky , <unk> - holds multi -lrb- slim -rrb- <unk> -lrb- netbook , ipod , dvd/cd burner & cord con - lacking extra pocket - would have been nice to have extra zip section in or outside to <unk> devices otherwise i like the
i bought this case at the same time i bought my acer aspire one d # netbook my netbook has a # . # inch screen and a very glossy , metallic purple finish i love the finish and wanted to protect it the case was a little big , which i did n't like too much at first , but now i 'm okay with it it also had a bit of a smell to it , but that has completely gone away i think the one i got was very new and had only been manufactured recently so it was still a little chemically smelling i recently purchased a # -cell battery for my netbook and to my surprise , while other reviewers could n't fit their netbook into a sleeve with the huge battery , i can it makes my very happy that i do n't have to buy a new sleeve the zipper is smooth and very sturdy feeling , and the outside is soft to the touch i wish the center stripe was purple to match my netbook , but i can live with the teal
i purchased this case for my toshiba netbook i 've always been a fan of targus , and i am extremely pleased with this case the neoprene is a great touch , and it fits around my netbook perfectly the case smelled a little & # # ; funky & # # ; when i first received it , but the smell went away in a couple days honestly , i was expecting that since it is neoprene , after all overall , this is a great case that wo n't break the bank i will definitely be buying more from targus in the future
bought this case for my wife 's samsung n # slate blue and white netbook colors match very closely great protection plus color compatibility made this a perfect purchase for her new netbook purchased both netbook and this case from amazon
this is a great sleeve - it 's nicely padded but not bulky , and it fits both my mom 's acer one and my asus eee pc perfectly -lrb- not at the same time , of course -rrb- the design is also attractive , and it does n't scream `` there 's a computer in here ! all in all you wo n't find a better sleeve for this price
i was looking for a soft cover for the samsung notebook we were going to buy and did n't want to spend alot of money -- this was the perfect solution black , trimmed in `` aqua `` , it 's actually looks good too the price is hard to beat quality of the material is very good for what you pay i 'd buy it again
bought this for my # yr old daughter to go along with her # . # acer netbook on christmas for $ # you will not find a better bargain out there the neoprene is thick enough for minor protection and abrasions but thin enough not to add bulk it looks better in person also it 's deep black with bright blue trim nothing wrong with black/blue in my opinion
i searched throughout the holidays for a netbook case for my son 's computer , he was getting for christmas found the targus <unk> case on amazon , and what a price it fits perfect , great quality , and best price in town highly recommend this product to everyone
let 's face it - if you 're like me , you were looking for a cheap netbook case to protect your investment the color scheme is hideous but it works i bought this for my dell mini # -lrb- the # -rrb- and it fits rather snug and for the price it ca n't be beat what 's not to like
i bought this for my wife great design and functionality but the quality is <unk> she used it every day to work and it begun to show serious <unk> of wear on the handles -lrb- thread coming off -rrb- after a couple of months now it 's been a year and the exterior has many scratches as well i need to buy a new laptop tote
i was so excited to find a large stylish vegan laptop bag this exceeded my expectations larger than i planned , but perfect for my needs it holds my work folders , my college textbook plus my # `` macbook pro & accessories perfectly hidden pockets are everywhere you look - great design padded laptop section with velcro closure , quality zippers everywhere else slings nicely around the shoulder with <unk> metal bottom nubs to keep the purse bottom off the floor ; these are efficient enough for a <unk> floor , but i would n't chance it on a bathroom floor i honestly ca n't think of an improvements i would make
this bag is beautiful and big i can put my mac , a text book and a bottle of water in it when i was walking around with it , some girls come up and said `` hi , your bag is cute ! i think it 's really lovely and i like it a lot the only problem is that it 's a little heavy when you carry so many things with you i think a laptop is ok though at first , i worried that the white bag may become dirty very easily , but the fact is , it keeps clean very well , even though i put it on the ground a lot
this bag is amazing solid construction , easy to clean and it fits my dell xps # - # . # `` screen like a glove i searched for days for the right bag both online and in shops the only other bag i was even slightly interested in that would have fit my big laptop was $ # this bag fits everything i need - i even bought a small purse that i can take to the cafe on my lunch , coffee breaks or to run other errands thanks acme made

i 've had my tumi for almost # years and it looks brand new that 's the best part this bag is durable and super roomy i can easily stash an extra sweater in there for the airplane ride but why so heavy is beyond me when i travel with it - it only rides on top of my roller suitcase the bag alone in heavier than my laptop and the price tag is pretty steep
