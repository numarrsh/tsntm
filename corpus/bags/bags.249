for what this costs , you really ca n't beat it as an ipad case it feels a bit snug if you also have a silicone cover on the back , but even with that , i was able to slip it in fairly easily without the silicone backing , it slips in effortlessly and would be great as a day-to-day case with the backing on , it can be a bit <unk> , but is more than adequate for the occasional vacation or business travel -lrb- which is what i needed it for -rrb-
this case is great and fits the ipad like a glove very good deal for the price the only downside is that if you have an <unk> or a <unk> cover on the ipad as i do , the sides will get stained in a # `` strip at the top of the opening its , i 'm assuming , from the piping on the edges , as no other part of the skin is stained i do n't blame kensington stuff like this will happen
first i would like to say that i liked this backpack for as long as it lasted it worked very well with my roller bag and tucked easily under the seat in front of me on the airplane the lenovo t # fit nicely and the bag is well organized the problem is that after only four months of use the top handle ripped lose this handle dose take a lot of weight when it is being picked up or put in the overhead in the airplane , but it should be designed for this as it a laptop bag and laptops are not light
i loved the concept of this backpack and it worked really well when i went through the airports however , i also used it every day to tote my laptop and papers to work and the strap broke after about # months i 'd look for something more sturdy
unlike other companies in this space , they do n't stand behind their work i bought mine for the features but when the zipper separated from the pack i was told i would have to pay to have it repaired because the warranty had expired i 've owned other packs that were repaired for free # years from the date of purchase so , buyer beware
i used this backpack successfully to carry a macbook pro and an assortment of audio equipment on a # <unk> international trip the security-friendly features worked properly in europe and the us , and the pack fit in overhead spaces on small regional aircraft , which is a main reason i bought it the padding is quite good -lrb- less so on the sides -rrb- , and the compartments are well-designed , although i found the many small interior pockets of limited utility the construction seems generally on the light side ; a bit of the exterior stitching soon began to come apart , and i wonder how well it will hold up over continued use recommended , but perhaps not for rugged , heavy-duty travel where reliability is critical
also great for people with back pain although i have only had it for a week , i am very pleased with this purchase the backpack is comfortable to wear , easy to open for security screening , has enough pockets to help me stay organized and seems to be rugged and well made -lrb- metal zipper pulls !
i purchased this bag so i could avoid having to put my laptop in a separate tray going through tsa checkpoints not only does this bag work as described , my first time through airport security , the tsa agent actually unzipped the fold flat zippers and laid the bag on the belt for me another big plus is this bag fits under airline seats much easier than my older wheeled laptop bag the sleeve that allows it to fit over wheeled suitcase handles is great too
i am actually looking at the bag now and am proud of it it has quite a few compartments and a dedicated space for a laptop the quality is good , the look is hard wearing and
this backpack is very light and small , but it fits perfectly a # `` laptop it does n't have many pockets and it should have more protections on the <unk> for the laptop protection is only on the front and back and good ones , but not at the sides
the backpack is very roomy , kind of plain but functional i would have liked to seen more small to mid sized pockets for items such as travel documents & a small zipped pocket for a cell phone , thumb drives , etc . i hope it lasts up to its `` limited lifetime warrenty `` i looked at a lot of computer backpacks & what sold me on this one was the padded laptop area i would purchase it again
wish it were a little bigger , but it 's big enough , especially for a thin notebook goes through airport screening like a charm that 's why i bought it , and just unzip flatten out and pass through and its less headache than unpacking to a gray <unk>
this is a well made and spacious laptop backpack however , i had purchased it for more than just carrying a computer the padding is ultra thick and protective this <unk> from my purpose in getting it it is great for laptop carrying , but is limited in its capacity to carry <unk> things , such as clothing
i bought this bag as i completed school and wanted to carry it during interviews and travels its a great bag to have with well padded laptop section it looks professional and business class the inner pockets of front compartment are great to put in files , books , pens and wireless mouse overall an awesome product but i would rate it # . # as it lacks some base padding for laptop <unk> - its a laptop bag and it must offer all protection to laptop from impact the base padding in bottom of laptop compartment is absent which makes laptop more prone to impacts while keeping the bag down and shoving it in cramped compartments of plane may be case logic can offer a simple pad with foam for this issue i seriously hope they offer a separate pad for bottom or add padding while making the bag itself
i have been using this bag for # years throughout undergrad and grad school , daily carrying a laptop , power cord , multiple notebooks , at least one textbook , utensils , and minor electronics at all times other than some minor wear on the bottom , this backpack is just as good as the day i received it if i could change anything , an outer pocket for a water bottle or fluid <unk> would be fantastic i 'm not fond of putting my liquids in the same space as my papers and electronics at the $ # i purchased this for , i would highly recommend this
this is a great laptop bag very functional without looking too <unk> or utilitarian the padded laptop pocket offers great protection and there is plenty of room for files and binders in the secondary compartments the accessory pocket could offer more slots for pens , etc . , but the amount of dividers is manageable i wish the bag had a water bottle holder on the side and a ipod or cell phone holder in the strap for easy access , but overall , this bag fits my needs as a business woman and traveler it 's very comfortable and the weight distribution seems to be very balanced i can set my full backpack down onto the ground and it does n't tip over the security checkpoint feature is very convenient , considering the hassles of airport security overall , this is a great bag
i 've had this backpack for almost a year now and am extremely happy with it i 've gone through numerous airports , including international ones , and have n't had any issues with security i love the padded laptop compartment which is the perfect size for my # `` dell studio xps there is plenty of additional space for laptop accessories , books , etc . like other reviewers mentioned it is somewhat plain , but it 's such a good case i can overlook that
i 've purchased quite a few case logic cd/dvd binders and holders in the past , and was always impressed with their quality i did n't know that they moved into the laptop <unk> area , and these items carry the same level of quality i like the heavy duty backpack straps - my straps are always the first to tear on my bags , and these look strong and sturdy the entire backpack is covered by a # year warranty , so that certainly offers piece of mind the biggest innovation to the backpack is the ability to fold the backpack flat without removing it from the bag for x-ray inspections at the airport it 's so simple it 's brilliant only a few downsides - as someone else mentioned , a little splash of color would have been nice also , # -inches is an odd size for a laptop , seems like they could have easily accommodated those with # `` laptops for just a marginal increase in cost
this back pack has been living up to the hype i have used it for several trips -lrb- in and out of <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> -rrb- and going through security was a breeze lots of storage space and the sleeve for sliding a carry on luggage handle through is great i have been very happy with this back pack so far
i travel a lot for work and i never check my luggage clothes , shoes and stuff go into my <unk> carry on and everything else -lrb- my laptop , papers , books , folders , etc . -rrb- goes into this backpack the butterfly style of the backpack gets me through security quickly , i have never been asked to take my laptop out of the bag i keep my travel documents in the same pocket for every trip so i am in and out without any delays and the backpack is streamlined ; the lack of extra loops , straps , and exterior pockets helps me slide the bag under the seat ahead of me without getting snagged on seat parts on a side note , one of the side zippers broke off after more than a year of -lrb- hard -rrb- use and case logic replaced my backpack under warranty
i gave this to my husband to try out , he did n't touch it at first then he had to go on a business trip and he took it along now he uses it all the time , he 's even started taking it to work instead of his briefcase every day , and it takes a lot for him to change his usual <unk> it holds an amazing amount of stuff , and dh said it was much easier to carry through the airport it went through security easily , it 's well designed there with the folding out and lack of overlapping it seems durable , it 's almost `` <unk> `` in its roominess , it looks professional , and it 's convenient we feel it was a good choice and well worth the price one last note , dh has a # inch laptop , but it still fits in this even though it says it 's for # inch models i was worried about that and willing to take it off his hands if his computer did n't fit : -rrb- but beyond being a little snug , it 's fine for his # inch laptop
i have had no problems going through the <unk> with this bag , so far it 's been screened # times and each time , no questions asked great purchase if you travel alot
main advantage of this backpack versus swissgear , is the ability to attach to luggage handle its also more professional <unk> disadvantage is no side pouches , such as for water bottle but advantages outweigh disadvantages i have only had to go through # <unk> since i received it last week i opened the backpack clam shell , did not remove my laptop , and it went through tsa fine , no questions asked i like the metal zipper pulls , and have had no problems with the zippers
i have n't had the chance yet to take the bag through the airport , but even as an everyday backpack it 's great my favorite part is that the excess nylon that you use to adjust the shoulder straps is rolled up and tucked away with velcro so you do n't have these ridiculous straps bouncing around everywhere
i was looking for a backpack which has back strap for the luggage , which is checkpoint friendly , and which looks nice and professional this bag is more than that , as it has so many pockets , and all that included in the nice design i am so happy with it , as even more expensive bags do not have so many useful functions
i took a trip in january after the attempted christmas <unk> of that flight to <unk> and despite increased airport security this bag scanned through as advertised with no problems looks nice , convenient compartments , as professional looking as a backpack can be and fits well under the seat in front of you
this is my second carry on baggage item it worked well at airport security it also carries a large amount of stuff and is comfortable to carry the shoulder straps work well the compartment organization is good it is an excellent value for the money it is better than my over the shoulder bag designed to get me through airport security
i never thought i would say this about a backpack , but this product really `` <unk> `` me the bag is split into two sections -lrb- though they do not separate : one for your laptop and another for your accessories a zipper splits the two , when opened you can spread out the bag and put it through the airport x-ray machine on the front of the bag is a zippered storage area with a plethora of compartments to store your goods there are some really thoughtful design touches : the adjustable shoulder straps do n't dangle since they 've added velcro to hold the slack in a nice little bundle between the two compartments is a hidden zippered pouch to hold your passport or cash there is a <unk> which allows for you to slip the bag over the handle of carry-on `` rollaboard `` suitcase so you do n't have to wear the bag all the time all in all , i would highly recommend this bag for the business traveler ... as long as you do n't mind wearing a backpack
i thought this product was just what i needed for my new dell # . # inch laptop i was so excited when it was delivered i showed everyone my laptop cover like it was the best idea ever unfortunately , it did not fit i sent it back i like the idea , but it needs to fit as stated my computer did look good for the very short time i tried to make it fit
quality is good , but it does n't fit my # . # `` laptop the left and right of my laptop extend out a bit from the side of the leather amazon should provide exact measuring size of the item so customers would know the item 's <unk>
i have a # . # screen computer and it didnt fit very well it keeps coming off at the two bottom corners i wish i knew how the other reviewer got theirs to stay on because at least two of us ca n't good looking but poor execution
wish that amazon had included a detailed description of the dimensions because my laptop has a # . # screen but it did n't fit it did n't fit length-wise because it was too short but width-wise it was too big however , the leather was beautiful and soft while the bottom is a mesh and lets your laptop breathe so it does n't overheat if it had fit , it would have been perfect
having traveled in the past with backpacks approximately # cubic inches , i was pleasantly surprised that this backpack held about that much yet had great organization and structure most pockets are of ample size , but no one big pocket -lrb- for something ridiculous big , i.e . a wii system in the box ! -rrb- it is well padded , many small pockets that keep everything well and slides easily onto my rolling carry-on luggage my big disappointment was the top handle broke recently , about # months into using it i wrote to customer service , and after one week , still no reply so , i guess i 'll have to figure a way to use it without it
mine broke after less than three months of light use not durable enough maybe that 's why it was blown out at $ # i paid more for mine but saw it going for that on <unk>
i 'm very <unk> when it comes to doing research on items i consider for purchase , but for some reason i could n't find a single review for this backpack at first glance , i did n't like how plain it looked but i watched a couple featured videos and the practicality of the design won me over i just received it and i have to admit i 'm really impressed it 's constructed really well , very sturdy and do n't get me started on the genius of the design i ca n't remember being this satisfied with a product in a long time i do a lot of <unk> touring and i 've been known to abuse my travel gear , so i 'll be sure to come back and write a follow up in a few months i have a feeling it 's going to do just fine
what a great backpack it has so many pockets and storage places i now have a place for everything i carry it is evident the design was well thought out the laptop protection case and lap desk is genius in addition the full size cord case will help stop items from <unk> at the bottom of the backpack highly recommend this case
when i received this in the mail , i was kind of shocked because in the picture i clearly remember it being grey , not black after <unk> the product description again , i realized that the color of the bag itself was not part of the description the only colors mentioned were the colors of the pockets and lining on the inside , which i could care less about i really wanted a grey bag , and in the picture , the bag is definitely grey , not black so i 'm disappointed with that aspect but i was also shocked at the amount of storage space inside the bag , not including the laptop compartment so , sigh , i will keep the bag because it will definitely be wonderful when traveling but i really did n't want a black bag
i picked up this bag to hold my dell m # laptop this particular laptop is # . # `` across -lrb- not diagonal -rrb- and pretty hard to fit in most cases it is tight but doable the rest of the bag has good features and storage and i was pleased with the lightness when fully packed the front pockets are a nice touch as well i am somewhat concerned about the handle grip as it just has a vinyl like material that probably will tear at some point
well made with quality materials and nice zippers this bag should hold up well over time would prefer a little larger compartment area but i carry a lot of extra supplies with me most people would probably be very happy with the amount of space available in the interior of the bag definitely would recommend this item
this fits my asus g # vw , but barely the laptop sleeve is just big enough for the # ' # `` laptop you can really load the bag up , to the point it is quite the beast to haul around the airport after a couple months of use and regular travel , you can see some signs of <unk> due to the pull of the strap carrying the # + lbs of misc gear nothing that <unk> the integrity of the bag , just a little wear although i do not see myself every using the headphone hole on the front , that pocket is nicely lined to protect a phone from scratches
definitely a good quality laptop carrying case for a desktop replacement keep in mind since its designed for a larger laptop , it 'll be heavier overall with all the extra things & compartments it has room for a few folder slots , card slots , pen slots , etc . nicely made & even better that its supposed to checkpoint friendly -lrb- which i have not yet checked out btw -rrb- worth the extra bit of money for something you know is durable
i purchased this carrier for my boss and he is very pleased with the layout of the bag and the various storage compartments this bag is very airline security friendly in that it opens flat for scanning without removing laptops , tablets , etc . he highly recommends it for anyone looking for this easy to use , easy to open carrier
i am very happy with this laptop case it has a lot of pockets which allows me to store all of the laptop accessories as well as my personal items , so that i do not have to carry a purse i like the checkpoint friendly feature which allows you to open the case flat and not have to pull out the laptop at tsa security checks the luggage slider allows you to slip the briefcase onto your rolling carry-on , which is very convenient , but it also comes with a sturdy shoulder strap there is a narrow zippered pocket that runs along the top of the case which is really great for storing your license and other small items to which you need quick access , but need secured from loss the only drawback of this case is that the large front pocket closes magnetically if you overfill the pocket , the magnets will not align to properly close however , there are a lot of smaller pockets and slots within the larger pocket to secure things i would just be careful not to put anything valuable loose within the larger magnetic pocket i can not yet comment on the long-term durability of this case , although it appears to be well-constructed , and made of durable materials
i had seen the great reviews this laptop carrier bag had received on amazon , so i put it on my wishlist i had all but forgotten it when my wife purchased it for my birthday when i opened the box and pulled it out , i was just about overwhelmed by the size : surely this is going to be too big , i thought well , i thought wrong i have a # `` dell laptop that i only use on the road and it fits perfectly in the laptop compartment the other compartments are nicely laid out and i especially appreciate the rigid dividers to protect documents plenty of room for two large books , documents , laptop , charger -lrb- s -rrb- , phone , and other <unk> needs great birthday present
i discovered that finding a carry-on bag for this large laptop was very difficult , until microsoft 's worked to the <unk> top this bag is sturdy and has enough ancillary <unk> features to make this on highly desirable thanks , microsoft
this is a smaller than usual backpack but it fits two small textbooks and a # `` laptop it also keeps smaller items organized i gave it four stars because it would be nice if it included am umbrella or drink pocket but overall its a great
this backpack is amazing it 's so pretty , well made and the material is great also , i love the fact that it 's a `` slim `` kind of backpack ; everything fits perfectly inside of it and it does n't <unk> out at all love it , love it , love it ! :
although this is meant for a laptop , it does work well for my folders and books for my classes the compartments are just right size and i love that i ca n't overstuffed it it allows me to carry a bearable amount without killing my back i love this bag and would tell my friends to buy if they ever needed a new , stylish backpack
i love this backpack this is perfect for me my # inch laptop , notebooks , pens , wallet , <unk> calculator , phone and laptop charger all fit i love how small it is and that it is not bulky i 'm very happy with this purchase and recommend it to everyone the color is a bit darker than it appears on screen
this is a very awesome product everything it was said it would be the price was also very reasonable the backpack has ample padding for protecting one 's laptop and other valuables the shipping and delivery was certainly fast
i thought this sleeve would be a little more roomy inside , because i do n't like the fact that you have to push your tablet in i do n't mean to say that the tablet should fit too <unk> inside the sleeve , but not as snug as it does besides , you barely get a -lrb- very -rrb- small space for your art pen the quality of the sleeve 's materials is very good , and it does protect my tablet from scratches and maybe small falls -lrb- i <unk> n't go as far as testing this haha i wish the sleeve had handles and an outside compartment attached , to carry the tablet 's usb cord and art pen or maybe even other accesories i do n't think i would recommend this sleeve to my friends i 'd tell them to look for a # -inch laptop sleeve , as they are a little more roomy and maybe even cost less
construction is well executed , my tablet fits great and is protected i 'd like if there was a bit more room or outside pockets to house the accessories overall i recommend it
listed product size is incorrect at # . # x # . # actual outer size is # . # x # . # `` packaging says for tablets up to # . # `` x # `` -lrb- intuos # exact size -rrb- simple looking but it appears to be well constructed the intuos # fits but it 's really tight on the sides it 's a soft case and will protect the tablet from bumps but with its tight fit i 'm not sure if it will protect well against drops if you 're like me and do n't need to take the tablet on the road much this case is fine if you take your tablet on the road a lot maybe get a case that offers better protection
it is just a sleeve , seems of good quality , but a bit tight -- not easy to get the tablet in and out some extra pockets would have been nice seems durable , good quality materials bought it for cousin , not for own use , just tried it on tablet
as the other reviewer said , a tight fit but not in a way where it 's hard to move in and out but its more of a secure fit than tight it has slots for the pen and the pen tips also , roomy enough for practically any usb cable
the sleeve for the wacom intuos # is incredible the material used is pretty neat , lime green on the inside and black on the out pretty handy when you have a laptop and need to toss your tablet into something protective
i love this protective sleeve for my wacom it is soft , cushy and i never <unk> worry that my tablet will get scratched or banged up it even has a <unk> holder inside i keep my cord and pen and tablet all in one place
i think this because my experience was different then other reviewers it was not a tight fit the intuos # fits perfectly however , there are not little pockets as another reviewer mentioned just one <unk> attachment that the pen can slide into no areas for other accessories i also really like the material it is made out of i could see it protecting the tablet much better than other foams
i had no problem getting this to fit -lrb- it 's tight but not a difficult squeeze -rrb- these cases are great i had previously gotten one for my husband 's wacom and when it came time for me to upgrade i almost tried the other brand popular here on amazon but i 'm glad i stuck with the be.ez i do n't worry as i 'm <unk> around nyc that anything will get broken in my bag
great looking , great storage and utility , great price , but , flawed handle it broke after one week and i had to return the bag to the seller who was very cooperative i received a refund promptly upon return i was really disappointed to have to send the bag back i received compliments from several people about how nice the bag looked when the handle from bags such as these break , the bag becomes worthless to me considering i purchased it for its ability to be wheeled and not carried i subsequently purchased a different bag at <unk> with a functional handle i would have given this bag # or # stars but i will have to rate it lower because of my experience with a flawed handle
overall i like the <unk> it a pretty bag and functional for my purposes * the delivery box was totally over sized for the merchandise shipped and was <unk> upon delivery whoever packed the <unk> failed to wrap the bag in additional packing materials the bag was shipped in the original <unk> box which contained two units and was <unk> to ship me one unit * the first time i used the roller bag one side of the black handle pulled apart from the metal i had no choice but pay for repairs locally as i did n't have sufficient time to return the item to the vendor and request replacement as i was leaving on a trip within a couple days grateful my local <unk> repair guy could fix for under $ # <unk> * the bag is a little too wide to roll thru aisle on southwest airplanes and had to be carried sideways
i wanted something other than a black laptop rolling bag and i could not spend a lot of money this red kenneth cole bag is a great size , in a wonderful red color , and it rolls wonderfully a really great bag for the money my back no longer hurts
ordered this bag because of the looks of it when it arrived , i loved it even more great quality and my # inch laptop fits in it it also came with an external laptop carrier -lrb- too small for my laptop -rrb- but i used it for my netbook i can fit all my daily junk in it such as : my laptop , school books , cords , papers etc . the handle is sturdy and has two adjustable levels , i love the size of the wheels and the different compartment spaces great bag , great buy
and , after some heavy usage , this rolling case is still going strong not a rip in any seam , not a dent in any wheel and it 's as beautiful as the day i bought it i can not say enough how much i love my case the zippers are heavy duty and trust me when i say they will hold what you put in them i used this for college and now that i 've graduated i use it for a weekend bag it has been to mexico , new <unk> , and chicago completely worth every penny
i got this for work since i had to carry my laptop and <unk> worked perfectly for the office and on trips it 's also very sturdy even when i had to take it through the snow still looks great
this bag was too small for my # & # # ; macbook pro it barely fit inside , and the way the top of the bag is constructed , it would be a struggle to get it in and out of the bag easily
i chose this bag as a work / school bag i love the style and the pockets but i was displeased with the fact that the leather was scratched and had marks on it upon delivery for the cost of this bag i expected it you be in better shape there was no return label or shipping information inside the package to request a new one i wish i knew that the bag had scuffs and scratches in the leather prior to ordering if it didnt have any cosmetic defects i would love this bag
the bag is excellent i would have given # stars , but the bag came with a warning about materials that cause cancer i was advised to wipe down the bag and it should be fine
i received it practically the next day and i will order another one it is perfect , not that heavy and very stylish i definitely want another the compartments are great to organization different things
i have been looking a long time for a bag that will hold my huge dell precision # & # # ; laptop this one showed the best promise based on raw measurements the tsa bag is much smaller than the case , so that was a disappointment it does fit in the slot without the tsa pouch , which works okay but leaves the laptop exposed if you forget to latch the single <unk> strap over the opening , the computer slides out and goes bang when the bag is <unk> over the storage is adequate , but the pull handle is cheesy and loose i expected a much more beefy extending pull handle if you <unk> it by the pull handle , you 're probably going to ruin it after a short while
i bought this bag to replace my very well worn swiss army icon model that is similar this bag is pretty light weight , and when i read it had a laptop bag that was easy to remove for tsa , i guess i assumed it was actually inside the bag it is not there is a gap for the bag for the laptop , which means that without the bag there is a gaping spot in the middle of the bag also less than ideal is the proportions of the separate compartments on either side of the gap i 'll use this for my daily commute , as it sits in the back of the car i did use it on the airplane last week and found the proportions and placement of the compartments very <unk> choose a different bag
i have purchased a number of rolling laptop cases over the years while the overall bag is satisfactory , the handle really needs serious improvement it is the <unk> handle i have ever seen on one of these bags
purchased this bag to replace my older leather one although this one has room for some clothes it is to big to fit in the over heads on smaller planes therefore you need to remove your laptop and check the bag the bag holds quite a bit but it is heavy i returned it for another one
while , overall , the case is good ; has plenty of room and is easy to fit into overhead storage bins , the telescoping handle does n't always lock in it 's highest position i find myself having to stop frequently and yank to get it to lock into place it seems to be the cheapest part of the case it 's mostly plastic i read all the reviews on amazon prior to buying and did n't notice anything about the handle maybe my case is a fluke but it is annoying
i bought this rolling case when it became necessary to limit carrying my stuff through airports and such the telescoping - handle tubes appear flimsy but have held up so far it does have good storage and it will certainly take some getting used to over my old case i do wish that the new case came with a padded shoulder strap and d-rings for times where there is no option but to carry the bag it does fit in overhead storage bins of the small commuter planes i have to use but you definitely need to remove your laptop before doing so would i buy it again ... maybe but not until i really looked elsewhere
well built and has multiple locations to separate items price is good for the quality received . the handle and wheels are perfect for the traveling person which the user of this case is
at first sight i felt the bag appeared to be too bulky -lrb- sort of clunky -rrb- , however , i really like the bag and use every inch of the space provided i wish the zippers were of better quality , but i appreciate the ease of <unk> - good wheels otherwise , i am very pleased
have now taken the case logic bag on several local and one airline jobs , and it works for me durability is a question that only time will answer , traveling can be hard on these bags the organizer functions of the bag are satisfactory the convenience of using the computer case to pass through tsa is nice the clothes section can be used to hold a few books to read or a noise <unk> headset , and on my last trip i put my running shoes on either side of the books i took you can squeeze a <unk> umbrella into the handle compartment the case is on the large side for airline travel , will not fit under the aisle seat of a boeing # standard body aircraft , but will fit under the middle and window seats getting stuff out of the bag in economy <unk> with the tight seat pitch these days is possible , and certainly easier than my previous bag
the case has many cool features and is very logically laid out wheels roll freely main drawback i have noticed is the handle did not extend all the way the first few times -- but i have since worked it out also the opening for sliding over my rolling suitcase handle is a little tight but that is much better than loose the tsa laptop sleeve works like a charm
this laptop bag has roomy compartments , an easy to use and retract handle , and a removable laptop security bag the removable security bag is handy for transporting a laptop to meetings i am able to stow a usb mouse , notebook and file folders along with my laptop in the bag it would be nice if it had rings for a shoulder strap , but the handle on the top <unk> there is ample room in the front and back compartments for file folders or a change of clothes for an overnight trip
this case does exactly what i wanted it to i am a little concerned about how loose the extended handle is , but it works well so far and has no issues
i have used this case for # weeks now and it seems to be a good case i do like the easy security laptop feature i travel internationally with it and it held up well so far lots of places to put things the only thing so far i do n't like is the placement of the handles as it interferes with easy access to the two main zippers
i really like the overall design of the case the only negative is that the structure for the telescoping handle is plastic and seems rather flimsy with lots of flex to it not sure it will last other than that , it 's great
this is a great case everything can be organized with little effort only problem i had with it , was the handle did not extend out far enough for me i am # ' # & # # ; and the handle is just to short to comfortably pull behind me other than that , it is a great case i highly recommend it to a person under six feet tall .
the quality of the actual case is fantastic it is sleek and sturdy i 've already gotten a number of compliments about it my only concern is the telescope handle some times it seems to stick when extending it and i also wonder how it will last over time
i choose this bag because it was the best one that had a removable sleeve that would fit my # inch computer without having to fight to get it on the wheels should be a little larger to prevent the bag from touching the floor , the metal zipper on the <unk> does not slide easily , i have to <unk> at it the bag should have a shoulder strap for times when it is raining or the terrain is not wheel friendly i like the many pockets , i can find a place for everything i recommend this bag for any one with an overnight business stay , you can carry your office supplies , laptop . business cards and a change of clothes
this is a great case and the bonus is the tsa security case where you do n't have to take out your laptop it keeps it safe and secure i 've even just traveled with this tsa case alone very durable , wheels durable , many compartments to fit pens , markers , <unk> , notebooks , files the back side you can use it for your clothes when traveling but i have actually used it for my bulky files or binder -lrb- s -rrb- and fits just fine in smaller planes , where the overhead is small , it was a challenge to fit but can easily stow under the seat other than that , i would definitely buy this case again
i bought this as a gift to my father who travels weekly this bag is perfect he only has to pull out the laptop cover and the rest can go straight through it 's super sturdy and perfect for his needs he even uses it to <unk> himself when walking through the airport like a <unk>
i ordered this bag for my husband who carries two computers when he travels . . he had to have all his heart meds in that bag along with files and other personal items it is strong , looks good and rolls without a problem i was thrilled since i had purchased a `` leather `` bag about six months ago and it was simply not what they advertized i would say for anyone who travels for business , this is the perfect bag
we bought this laptop case a year ago and it still looks like new it 's great for overnight trips it fits everything you need for that purpose i have packed my husband 's shoes , clothes , laptop plus other little things in it i convinced my hubby to get one , but ones he got one he said : why did i wait so long to get one of these it fits his # inch alienware <unk> in its sleeve when we travel together we put both of our # inch laptops in it i put mine in a different sleeve for extra protection -lrb- mobile edge # . # -inch large slipsuit -lrb- black -rrb- which i also highly recommend
this is a great travel bag it easily carries back up hard drives , cables , papers , you can stow away business receipts , passports etc . the laptop slips into a <unk> in it 's own case where it is secure and can easily be pulled out <unk> into an x-ray <unk> at the airport i found it fits easily into <unk> on planes , even when stuffed full great wheels and handle make <unk> of transporting that cumbersome business gear and a couple changes of <unk> everything else you need for short trips i just lugged it overseas , on planes , trains , subways and automobiles , along streets and rough ground what a delight <unk> have to carry my kit buy one , it 's well worth the money
lightweight but very roomy i feel this is a really good buy for the money my daughter is a new attorney and i bought this for her so she can take her files and other necessary items to court with her without having to rely on heavy shoulder straps this case rolls which will make her day so much easier
this rolling case has lots of storage for both the laptop and also bulky notebooks purchased it for an attorney to take to <unk> and it holds it all was concerned about wheel life and the wheels have shown no wear the attorney prefers this unit over more expensive leather rolling case
i had gotten a pinched nerve from lugging a # . # laptop around in a backpack style case , this bag has saved me much pain and seems to be very roomy and sturdy highly recommend this bag i love the fact that the handle is very long and i do n't have to hunch over to grab it
i read all of the reviews before purchasing this laptop case and did n't have any of the problems others had mentioned it truly makes travel and getting through the airport so much easier no more sore shoulder carrying a heavy laptop case long distances and from gate to gate or to the claim area i really appreciate the large rear compartment that is just the right size to pack a <unk> change of clothes and toiletries the second pocket easily handled my two cell phones , passport , pens , keys , kindle tablet , and so much more the middle pocket is perfect for files , power brick , power cord , earphones , etc . best purchase i 've made in a very long time ca n't wait to use it again
it did n't fit my dell # . # inch laptop but other than that the bag was very nice be careful if you are needing a bag for a # inch laptop the case runs a little small
i bought this for my daughter for her christmas gift i believe she will find it to her liking she works a lot from home and needs a case that will hold all her office things she needs at home and this should do the job
my travel has picked up a lot lately and i was looking for a case that <unk> help through the <unk> and give me great storage room and this case does just that a wonderful case and i would buy it again
purchased this product to hold my dell xps # . # inch laptop the laptop compartment in this rolling case did n't even come close to holding my laptop , and the other compartments in the bag are configured or constructed to make it impossible to use them to hold the laptop if you read other reviews indicating that this case will hold a # . # inch laptop ... do n't believe them it wo n't
looks good initially but this bag <unk> very durable within a few months the bottom started to rip i guess when it 's being pulled it somehow rubs on the ground
