i 'm writing this review to <unk> praise kuzy for its customer service i had ordered the orange cover for the new macbook pro # retina and after more than two weeks it had n't shown up in the mail i contacted kuzy and their response was fast , <unk> , and amazingly <unk> rather than argue over whether usps had screwed up , they apologized and refunded me ... followed by the kind words that if the cover would eventually show up it 'd be their pleasure to offer it to me even more amazing is that after more than # weeks the cover did arrive and it 's now installed on the macbook i write this review on it 's very bright -lrb- good ! -rrb- and fits well
this product is fantastic bought it as soon as i <unk> the retina mac fits like a glove , has n't come off since it looks nice , sleek , gives me a good grip on the laptop as well recommend this to anyone interested in buying
bought this to protect the $ # mac with retina display , that i <unk> up the money to buy my daughter for college we looked around and she loved the color and it fits like a glove it is transparent enough to still show the apple when the computer is open , which she thinks looks cool also purchased the keyboard cover from the same manufacturer and it works very well should protect the keyboard from spills or crumbs when <unk> and working on the computer
love it for my mbp retina i sell my computer every few years and this will help keep it free of scratches and dings snaps on with ease and adds very little weight
fits perfectly to the new # + models of the mac book pro my only complaint is that you can see fingerprints on the cover pretty easily on the black so i have to clean it more often
this cover fits my macbook pro just perfectly i purchased the great bright blue color and love it , what a great variety of colors to choose from fits easily and offers the protection i was looking for
cover was as advertised fits very well and easy enough to remove if necessary one of my hdmi cables bumps lower case and sometimes i take the bottom half off i like the protection it gives from scratches and such i would recommend
the macbook has an aluminum body and it is very susceptible to little nicks and dents so i needed a case to protect it from getting them , the kuzy a # is perfect for that job it snaps on without any problems , does n't block the fans and it still keeps my laptop thin two of the rubber feet did come off from the bottom but the case still protects it from sliding so much i also bought the kuzy silicon keyboard cover so dust can be easily removed between the keys
i am a huge fan of purple , and i love this cover it fits great and most importantly for me it is not smooth as a mother of two , i need to have a little more friction since things are not always easy to hold onto when the man child jumps about and knocks into you my mother has a different brand that is not as good a fit for me as this is the color is wonderful and makes me happy every time i see it
this is a simple hard case that works fit is perfect big deal for the new slim macbook pro design is that the <unk> does n't significantly increase the width of the computer my other mac is less than a year old and has never seen a case , and the exterior is really messed up the kuzy has done a great job of keeping my new mac stay ` new ' . if your looking , do n't stress , this case does the job do n't go without a case ! !
great cover for my new macbook pro retina cover snaps on easily and fits perfectly the color looks great and you can still see the apple logo when it is lit up through the cover have n't dropped my laptop yet so not sure how good it holds up in that sense and hopefully i never have to find out my only complaint is that the rubberized cover tends to have problems with attracting finger smudges if your <unk> are sweaty or oily , be prepared to have to wipe and clean the cover if you plan to keep it crystal clear
it 's inexpensive , but works very well fits like a gem and allows my macbook pro to vent perfectly it does not feel cheap in your hands it is slightly rubberized hard plastic do n't be afraid of the few bad reviews this is a great case ! !
had a long hunt to find a case that did n't have those little tabs on the back as they snap off so easily i went through # of those kind this one fits perfect on the bottom piece without those breakable tabs to hold it in place
i received this case in the knick of time i had been recently sporting another rubberized hard case from another company and to me this one blows it out of the water it is slick and stylish and my favorite part is that it is soooo slim not only does it look great , but the texture of the case lets you know that it is in fact well protected with my other case one small drop cracked the bottom portion , however , when my little cousin dropped this laptop there was not even a scratch grade a performance and # stars
i just wanted to say that the product fit perfectly around my new mac book pro retina i was concerned that because this mac was so new that somehow it would n't fit right , but it did fit perfectly and it does look really sharp on it again i have the # -inch macbook pro with retina display for those of you looking to save some $ $ on a good cover
listen carefully , if you install this case properly you will be blown away by its perfect fit i have the new retina macbook pro and it fits like a glove
the color is exactly what i wanted ... bright orange it 's easy to put on there was # little tiny scratchy areas that really was n't all that <unk> until i had to write this review ... just took a nail file and filed it down a few times to make it smooth so happy i purchased this case i live in hawaii where everything is a little more expensive i think this case is just as good as the speck 's brand no regrets , an awesome case & price i would highly recommend it to anyone who is <unk> to buy name brand products -lrb- like myself , glad i took a chance -rrb- ... this case does it 's purpose and the color is fun & <unk> <unk> kuzy ! :
when i ordered this product , there were not many choices to cover the retina macbook pro , so i went with this one to say the least , i was not disappointed the case is hard and rubberized , which feels like it would save my mbp from a fall , but it does not add significant bulk to the laptop i think this case gives my mbp a unique look and feel as well overall , i 'm really satisfied with the product and would purchase it again
no complaints at all this is a very solid and sturdy case i am very protective of my stuff and certainly a new mbp as this is my main edit machine this case is great openings for all the ports and it clamps real well against the computer
this case is great it fits well and keeps it from scratching the aluminum body i would recommend this case to anyone instead of paying a lot more for those other brands you wont be disappointed
i ordered this item and received promptly this cover has design flaw when installed <unk> hot air flow out of the computer it heats up and fans start at very high speed when i removed the cover this <unk> stopped i repeated this several times to confirm this issue do n't buy it it will break your expensive computer
i am impressed with how snug this case fits i was curious how it would be able to stay on so well being such a low profile , sleek computer it does n't feel like it can going to come off on its own the rubber grip is also nice makes carrying it around feel more secure the only thing i would change is including instructions for installation the bottom piece is a no brainer but the top can go on either way one side has # clip tabs and the other only has # i put the side with # on the top so it has a clip where you put your finger to lift open i could see it being an issue if it was on the other way
definitely this case is just as good or better than the case i purchased from the apple store which was made by & # # ; speck & # # ; and cost $ # what i really like about the kuzy case is that it allows my thunderbolt cables to be inserted flush with the macbook pro and not be stopped part ways by the case from being inserted this was the issue with the speck case so the kuzy worked better and cost half as much
i remember seeing macbooks that i thought were black on some reality tv show awhile back , and thinking to myself `` man those look so awesome ! then i learned that they had some kind of case on them with a little searching on the internet i was lead to find this kuzy case , and thought i would order it i can not believe how beautiful it looks -lrb- i love matte black -rrb- and how low-profile it is -lrb- meaning that it barely adds any bulk at all to the macbook pro retina display model that i have the price was great -lrb- i think i paid around $ # -rrb- and it 's exactly what i was hoping it would be i love it it keeps your macbook protected , and also makes you stand out -lrb- at least where i live -rrb- and look like you have a black macbook only two complaints # -rrb- the shipping took quite a long time -lrb- i live in canada and ordered from amazon.com because it was n't available through amazon . ca -rrb- and i could n't track the package # -rrb- the matte finish shows oily hand prints and whatnot fairly visibly , so i need to figure out the best way to keep matte finish things clean
this is a very good case for the macbookpro retina it offers protection against minor bumps and you do n't have to worry constantly about <unk> the laptop against the wall i like the fact that it has rubber padding in the bottom it is totally worth the
this cover fits my new macbook pro with retina display perfectly , it looks great , feels good and seems to cover the computer nicely it adds almost no weight and size to the laptop and it still fits into the thule <unk> # `` macbook sleeve even with the added cover i do n't care about this at all but reading the reviews a lot of people seem to care the apple logo still shines through
i absolutely love this cover for my favorite -lrb- right now -rrb- device those who complain about the cover being loose , have n't finished snapping it on the fit is perfect and it does n't add bulk i am still using the same sleeve i used before i bought the cover this is so nice and the black looks so sophisticated this is a great buy
nobody can <unk> how great the <unk> looks , but in the other hand , they can be very <unk> , so this product helps a lot to keep it nice and protect it from having <unk>
i ordered this one immediately after i got my retina mbp on july kuzy was the first one to provide hard case cover for retina mbp and i chose this one because i thought the black color is good and actually it was good and i used this one now with my retina mbp the quality is good and firm and it is still very thin i do not worry the case will make my retina mbp become mbp ... the appearance
this is my second kuzy for the same macbook i had the first for about a year and it was n't showing any signs of wear and looked great while providing good scratch and ding protection i would still have my first kuzy , except that i damaged it while removing it from my macbook so the laptop could be <unk> i 'm looking forward to years of satisfaction with this cover by the way ... it 's quite simple to attach , and a bit tricky to remove
the case fits amazingly , it clips on much more securely than the speck case i used to have the color is great , and i have n't had to remove the case to clean my computer at all it keeps crap out
i was super nervous and skeptical about buying this product , but absolutely love it ! ! ! the color , texture , and look fits so perfect i am insanely in love with this case for my new macbook pro
very good case , it does what it is supposed to it is worth the price . check it out yourself however some features are lacking , it is still a good case
have had my kuzy for two weeks bought it for my macbook pro me # ll/a retina # . # & # # ; the kuzy covers all but one small part of a corner of the laptop even with the <unk> hard shell added took a while to get here , but am satisfied with it to my knowledge , this is my first kuzy product
the case was made of what i thought to be a flimsy plastic at first it snaps easily onto the exterior of my mac book pro the bottom piece has rubber feet so the laptop does not slide around and air can get to it love the color
this was for a brand new laptop and as we all know , you want to protect it from any dings or scratches this case was exactly what we thought it would be it is protective , true to color , easy to remove when trying to remove it to clean it , it was hard to unsnap making me very comfortable with knowing it wo n't just slip off i would recommend this
i purchased this case along with my mac and i have to say i was lucky to have it on i dropped my mac a foot away from the ground i thought that was it for my # week old mac i checked the case and i checked my mac and i have to say , the case worked like a charm there was no dents or anything the bottom sides of the case took the impact and broke a bit , but that was fine considering i spent over # k on this computer it is really good quality i am going to buy another case because i need to replace my bottom cover
i got this case for my computer before my computer even arrived what a great choice , its a lightweight case snaps on perfectly and looks fantastic i love how you can still see the apple logo through the case
bought it for my daughter who was going off to college for some added protection she loves it and even put a decal on it no drops yet to test its protection but it definitely makes it less slippery to hold on to
love this sleek case so much i bought another for an older , scratched mac i have it fits my mbp retina very well -lrb- although it is kind of hard to put on at first -rrb- and looks great i have the black one i love the rubberized feet on the bottom -- my computer does not slide around at all when on a smooth surface i do n't think this would protect it much if the computer were dropped , but it will keep it looking like new which is why i bought it an added bonus is the rubber feet !
i really like this case so far it seems to fit well and protects the mb pro from scratches i also like the feel of the cover , which is kind of a matte material so it wo n't slip out of my hand easily i 'm not sure why i would pay the # $ at the apple store when this seems to work just as well
not too much to say other than it 's a good protector , and it fits my macbook pro retina nicely i gave it the full # star rating because it delivered on all promises at an average price point
this is an amazing case its easy to put on and take off to clean it feels really nice to the touch , its very soft and extremely durable i love this case and definitely recommend to everyone
i did like the case , it fits perfect , but not the exactly the color i was expecting . writing this review for an extra case but <unk> , i did like it
after spending way too much on a new mac book pro -lrb- # inch w/retina -rrb- , i thought i 'd protect my purchase with a simple cover this was just what i was looking : no loud designs , transparent , does what it 's supposed to do the cover snaps on quickly and you 're good to go there are vents on the side that match the vents on the side of the laptop , as well as <unk> vents on the bottom , so <unk> should n't be an issue rubberized feet help keep the laptop in place when on a desk or table the top cover has a smooth texture ; it 's not & # # ; rubbery & # # ; , it 's just right , just like everything else about this cover i 'm glad i bought it
this is <unk> ' easy to install , is n't going to come off too <unk> , and while it wo n't protect you against a fall , it 's going to protect against getting scuffed and wo n't slip off a table just do n't get orange because that 's my color
if i could give this product a negative rating , i would the bag is attractive and protects the macbook but the handle tore off from very limited and <unk> use within # week i am currently trying to return it for a refund save yourself the bother
i really like this case it 's not bulky , it provides some protection without being a full hardcase , and it has room for a few things in addition to my # & # # ; mbp the problem is that it 's falling apart now it should last more than # months , i think one end of one handle strap is coming out of the seam , and part of the zipper seam is falling apart i 'm trying to get it replaced by lacie but they 're telling me to go through amazon amazon 's return window has expired hopefully lacie will do the right thing
but it is very heavy i would recommend using this for short commutes but not for traveling it added an awful lot of space and weight to my luggage on a positive note , the macbook fits well , it is durable , and i like having the side pockets on the inside and outside
on the plus side the product appears to be well made , it is inexpensive and the supplier ships promptly but there are few things that detract from this case the first thing you notice is the the strap that keeps the pc in place is permanently sewed in place if you wish to use the pc in the case you must remove it from under the strap probably more concerning is the lack of space for the cords and power module that are standard <unk> for lap tops these days if you do n't have much peripheral hardware and do n't mind the fixed cross strap then you will enjoy this product a little velcro and a sizable outside pocket would make this a wonderful case
nice good looking product but has a con the material rips and gets warn . i used it for # day the side of my laptop bag ripped so i sewed it back i hope it doesnt rip anymore
the carrying case does its job i have no complaints about it at all i really like the pockets inside it so i can put my work inside it and not have to worry about it getting all wrinkled up
it was bigger than i thought it would be but that 's my fault i would assume for not reading the dimensions it 's sturdy on the outside , too , but seems a little shallow / lacking in padding inside there is also a good amount of room to throw a book in here or something if you 'd like but overall , it 's pretty good : has a strap , a little roomy without being super big , and has a little <unk> pocket on the outside
i like this case a lot the only reason why i 'm giving it # stars is because when i opened it there was a stain on it and it had the <unk> smell , but other than that it 's good
the carrying case fits the product description to a `` t `` . it is <unk> to carry with the strap or the handles and the reinforced corners will protect my machine the price is right
i bought this case for a macbook air and was hoping it would fit alittle more snug inside my guess would be that this is ideally for the mb pro however , it does fit the air and an ipad with a leather case/stand nicely , so it depends on what you are toting if you need space for other things this has it , if not , the mb air does slide around a bit the quality is decent , it is sturdier than i expected for the price , and i like the option of having a shoulder strap -lrb- not easy to find -rrb- all in all , i would recommend this case with the <unk> mentioned caveat i will be <unk> mine with some foam
i needed something to get my macbook pro safety to and from work everyday but i wanted something that was n't bulky - this is it it is super protective and it even has an inside pocket that fits my ipad as well exactly what i wanted , great product , super durable and adjustable for carrying
i find it difficult to find a case that can fit my computer perfectly at a reasonable price , and this one is awesome i love that it is padded inside and firm outside so i know my computer is protected it is extremely light weight and portable i would certainly recommend to others and <unk> in the future , though i have a feeling that one one i have will last me longer than my computer probably will
this case is exactly as described finally , something that is completely right in function that does n't cost $ $ $ actually , the cost of shipping was almost equal to the price very pleased and would highly recommend
you will like this the same way i do very very nice much sturdier than others i have had or seen dont be fooled by other cheaper or more expensive ones go
had the bag for three weeks daughter is in # th grade and carries alot of books and laptop in bag previously had a normal backpack and it was so heavy i thought this was the perfect option within # weeks the straps for the backpack ripped great concept but poorly made
i purchased this backpack for my granddaughter the first week the zipper on the large compartment broke i took it to a shoe repair to see if we could have another zipper put in and was told it was not worth the cost of repair
inside lining ripped after # months of use lousy customer service , need to file a claim , retrieve warranty card and receipt oh , did i mention i need to ship this back on my own dime , so that they can inspect it spend the extra money and get your rolling backpack at <unk> or llbean , where their rolling backpacks lasts # year and there customer service is far more superior it 's all about the service
my daughter was thrilled with the backpack because it looks great but it broke and we 're only # month into the school year i should have waited to buy it right when school started so that i 'd still have time to notice its defects within the warranty period
the backpack comes with a warning label : it says the fabric on the backpack contains a chemical that -- in at least the state of california -- is known to cause cancer based on that warning , we returned the backpack -lrb- and amazon accepted the return without a problem , which we appreciated -rrb- the bag itself seemed sturdy , not too heavy to carry , and spacious
i was very excited to get this backpack because it rolls and i have the matching luggage set i used it for the first time on a business trip last week and the zipper broke the laptop compartment is not sturdy at all i put my # & # # ; laptop in the compartment -lrb- the details state it will support this size laptop -rrb- and it does not hold the laptop well at all in order to zip it , you have to hold the <unk> in place it 's very flimsy this also affected the pocket in front of the laptop compartment , which is where the zipper broke i attempted to unzip it to put a folder in and the zipper came off track leaving that pocket useless although i like the style and the fact that it rolls , i would n't recommend it if you 're going to use the laptop pocket
i bought this bag to lighten up my load of college books it did n't last long the inside shredded between the two inside pockets it is probably made for someone who only carries little to nothing
we bought this for our eleven year old daughter and saw the reviews of it deteriorating prematurely . # months after i bought it , it 's got torn zippers and the handle broke so it 's now unused i was hoping we would be an exception to the rule , but we were n't i never contacted the company or amazon as in the reviews it looks like it 's a # day warranty , so not worth my time we 'll try and find something else for now , she is back to a regular backpack
i purchased this for my daughter to use at school and after only one month of use the wheel has broken off the backpack and there was only a one month return policy now i have to purchase another one to finish the <unk> of the school year with not happy at all this item was suppose to be sturdy not the one i got wo n't buy again
bought this rolling backpack for my daughter for her first grade she started using it on august # th after a month one of the main compartment zippers stopped working , it wouldnt close , we kept using it with the other zipper but it also broke before it was even october it is not worth the money , there is no <unk> and you will end up buying another bag anyways do not buy this ! !
i loved this back pack bought it for my # year old it worked for less than two months and it broke do not buy this back pack if you value your hard earned money best part , amazon did give me my money back
this backpack looks great , but broke on the # th day of school this year since we did not really use it until school started a couple weeks ago , we went past our month allotted for returns to amazon i was trying to find the manufacturer 's contact information , but that is near impossible i think i own a $ # useless backpack with a broken zipper , and no recourse if you purchase rockland luggage make sure it is <unk> when it breaks within the week
this is a poor product which i do not recommend to anyone the strap has failed and i only purchased this product one month ago my daughter had average use of it at best , nothing overloading or crazy it 's a great idea but the straps are cheap junk i just inquired about returning this item but it says i can no longer do so because it expired on march # th so basically , they warranty the return of this product for # month ! about how long it took for the strap to break i paid $ # for this and i am not a happy customer
i purchased this backpack for my # year old granddaughter she loved the looks of the bag and was excited that it could be rolled however , she used it as a backpack most of the time and both shoulder straps broke within two weeks of receiving it fortunately , it broke within the time i could request a refund do n't buy this bag expecting more than something & # # ; cute . & # #
i purchased this backpack for my # year old thinking that it should last at least half the school year the zippers on the main compartment broke after # months of mild use i wish it would have held up as it looks cute
bought this back pack for my # year old daughter after two weeks , the handle would not come out of the base i sent it back for a full refund i 'm not sure i would purchase another from rockland luggage
not finish the # st week , the <unk> does not come out my daughter was so sad about it as it looks nice i wish i could find one that is not made in china
i purchased this bag for m # yr old who started school on she has used it for # school days and the strap already broke the stitching on the clip came right out and the strap disconnected from the bag i have no box to <unk> it in and hardly any time to sort it out this is also the most expensive bag i have ever bought one of my children and she has no other , to send it back now means i have to buy her another bag in the interim
i purchased this backpack for my # year old daughter less than # months later a wheel broke off i am unable to replace the wheel i am unable to get any information from the <unk> as they do not have a website , email or phone number luggage pros can not help me as they are unable to give me phone numbers links etc . my daughter loved this backpack but very frustrated as i have spent hours trying to replace a wheel total waste of money will not buy anything from rockland or luggage pro again
the zippers -lrb- both of them -rrb- for the main compartment stopped working i bought this last year for my # nd grade daughter she did not get to use it until about # wks ago when her school started . # wks in and the zippers stopped working i 'm off to find her a new backpack
within two weeks the stitching from the inner lining frayed , so it 's now one big backpack and not one with a front storage compartment otherwise everything else is in good condition since i purchased this item prior to the school year starting , i was not able to <unk> because it was past the deadline
the bag seems well constructed but the zippers are clearly inferior the zipper to the main compartment broke after # months and the bag is completely useless now
the bag came and it is pretty but only lasted a few months i got this for my # year old daughter and the bar started to bend . so there goes money down the drain had to buy a new one
i bought this to alleviate carrying a bag backpack for work , and still use it because it gets the job done i still like the fashion aspect , however , was displeased with how quickly the inside tore that is my only complaint i do n't recommend for high impact usage
this inside lining of this ripped on the second day of school we had to return this product loved the color and print but the quality for the money was not good
i bought this bookbag for my # year old to use one of the zippers broke almost immediately on one side then the other broke i wrote to amazon about my experience and the bag was replaced at no extra charge i was disappointed that it was only # months old when it had <unk> be replaced
my daughter really wanted a rolling backpack being she has to bring home a # -inch binder , textbook , and lunch bag every day to/from school thought this was a cute backpack but upon arrival , it is huge she is # yrs old and it completely covers her entire back she is of average height for her age the straps also drag on the ground when pulling so have to make sure to tuck it all in so it does n't wear away
i like that it 's light weight , which is why i purchased it the wheels are very loud and i definitely do not like that at all it 's a bit challenging to load and unload items from knapsack , but my main objection is the wheels are very loud i guess i would recommend to a child who would ' t care if it was very loud
i got this for my daughter who is in <unk> it 's a little big but she loves it the wheels are big and smooth and great quality it would get # stars if not for both large pouch zippers , which have already split apart after only a month since they are both double zippers i can play around with them and get them to close , but this is going to get old really fast and she ca n't do it herself
i picked this backpack out for my daughter while she was away on vacation it was important to me that she would have a rolling backpack this one stood out as one of the prettiest that i have seen without being overly cute my daughter is turning # yrs old and i thought it was important for her to get away from all the <unk> <unk> my wife agreed the backpack is roomy and very sturdy it does not feel cheap and gives the buyer the feeling that the product will last a few years i would like to add that the backpack is constructed to allow the user to use it specifically as a backpack too if the user <unk> to do so i would definitely recommend the product to family and friends
my daughter has lately had to carry a lot of books back and forth for school i loved the design of this book bag it is easy to maneuver and very spacious the note of concern is that it comes with a warning that states that it is made from cancer causing materials i did n't see this warning before buying and would love it the manufacturer offers an explanation for this given that it is not worn , i still let her use , but nevertheless very alarming
this bag is very nice and my daughter loves it ... however it is way too heavy to use as an every day back pack there is extra padding on the back of the bag , but the weight is too much for my # year old to lug around on her back
my daughter absolutely loves her new roller backpack she 's in # nd grade in private school with lots of big books and lots of homework this accommodates all her stuff and her lunchbox too it 's a bit heavy even when empty so i wish i could give it # / # stars but it 's either # or # in here otherwise it gets # stars and i totally would but again
i carry many electronics back and forth to work and was previously using a basic backpack this was causing severe back pain now i can just roll it from my car to my office and back , what a relief i was also amazed at how many things i could fit in it and with the different areas in this bag i can organize everything quite nicely i would highly recommend this product to anyone who has to carry a lot of items use this product before you hurt your back and roll on ! ! ! ! ! : - -rrb- <unk> d
the bag has been useful to carry my laptop and accessories i prefer rolling away than using it as a backpack but if i have two roll away bags it helps me to have the back pack option which i like so far it has been a great friend love the vibrant colors some things could have been better for example , the front zipper can not be closed easily if you have your laptop and a few things zipped up in the back compartment a little extra fabric on top would have helped the laptop compartment is not sturdy so once you place the laptop and strap it with the velcro it flips inwards and you need to adjust other things around it it is worth the money have used it on two trips since i bought it so far so good
i am a nursing student and bought this to save my back it has been great i wish it was a little bigger , but that is something i should have considered before i bought it i have been using it for a year now and it is beginning to rip i do abuse it though
this is a great bag it is roomy , rolls so easy and the handle goes up and down well the only thing i am concerned about is when the handle is up it seems just a bit wobbly so far so good though as long as that holds it is perfect
rugged and appears durable but very heavy my # year old wanted a backpack with wheels because she complained her backpack was too heavy this fits that purpose but now it 's even heavier due to the wheels and hardware rolling it is fine but getting on and off the bus is tough for her she does love it though
my daughter was so excited about her new bookbag it is very sturdy and can hold a lot only problem was about # weeks after we got it one of the zippers broke she can still zip it up but only from one side other than that we love it
good afternoon : i purchase this product last september for my daughter and the to of the handle broke i would like to know if there is some kind of replacement for the handle since the rest of the book bag is in perfect conditions
