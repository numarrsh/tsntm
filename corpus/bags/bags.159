i absolutely love the bag , it fits my lap top amazingly well it looks just like it does in photos except that the fabric seems more `` plastic `` in person -lrb- easier to clean i guess -rrb- the storage compartments are nice my only issue with this bag is that it does n't hold my laptop , books , and supplies however i would like to <unk> that by saying i 'm taking # credit hours and have large books and binders the fabric top wo n't velcro itself with all of my things in it it makes a great bag for easy laptop transport and for a few items
i purchased this for my daughter and she loves it except for the storage pockets which are a little flat she feels like it does n't have a good designated space for her mouse i was going to purchase # of these bags <unk> one for myself after getting hers , i 'm glad i only bought the one because my laptop did not fit in this bag i have a new toshiba laptop and the bag was not wide enough the strap is sturdy the design on the bag is really cute good padded protection
this comfortable and stylish bag has worked wonderful i have been able to cram a lot of books and paper into it , and it has held up its end of the bargain plus , i look so good wearing it
love the design on this bag and how well it is made it is very sturdy and the pockets and places to put your things , are all designed perfectly there is soft material where soft material should be , and zippers where they should be , and even a drawstring to make sure nothing falls out too i 've gotten lots of compliments on this bag and i absolutely could n't be happier the only thing i would say i would change about the bag , is the strap i have it shortened to the lowest point so that it is as short as it can go , but that still is n't enough , and i have a huge <unk> hanging off of me i 'd much rather it be a small shoulder strap , or like that of a regular messenger bag instead , it 's just a little too big for me it straps across my chest , which is perfectly fine , though , and i still would n't trade it back to any other bag that i 've used in the past best bag ever
the laptop fits perfectly inside this case the bag is durable and the design is so cute the long strap makes it really easy to carry and overall it is just an awesome bag
i am quite pleased with this product the bag fits my laptop snuggly and has extra room for everything i need for the road it 's truly my best lightweight laptop bag
first time ordering a latop case and i am very pleased with this product it has a nice wide shoulder strap which <unk> for carrying i would recommend this case
this bag is awesome my laptop just fits in the padded inside pouch but it 's nice and snug love the <unk> fabric on the inside , the strap is nice and thick and does n't hurt my shoulder i would definatly recommend this product to others !
it 's hard to buy material things on-line because you never know what kind of quality it really is but this bag surpassed all my expectations the material and craftmanship of this bag is excellent and fantastic for the price i get comments on it all the time i am thoroughly pleased with my choice and love this bag
this purchase was great and it has been working really well i wish i would have read the width however , because my laptop does n't actually fit , but that was my own fault i love it for books and such though
it 's very roomy had plenty of room for my # inch sony vaio laptop , my <unk> book , my creative writing portfolio , my <unk> books and notebooks , pens , pencils great strong material as well
bought this bag for my # . # `` toshiba laptop the padded compartment is made for a # . # `` laptop so my laptop did not fit into it , but i knew about that before buying my laptop still fits snugly into the bag 's main pocket -lrb- i use the padded compartment for my wacom art tablet instead -rrb- the bag is roomy and there is still plenty of space left over to carry some books or sketch pads the front pockets fit all my laptop accessories , ipod touch , and digital camera with room to spare green being my favorite color , i absolutely love the design of this bag
this bag worked great have a # . # in laptop , and some folders i carried with me on a daily basis for work . kept my laptop protected and everything fit nicely pockets in the front for charger and <unk> . good price , good quality
it 's big enough to carry the laptop and books i feel the laptop is safe to carry in this bag the bag is just a little too big , so if you are expecting something small , this is not it it 's also really pretty and it arrived on time
this product is great the design of the bag and the quality is amazing , worth much more than the cost it is functional and works perfect for me i use it for school and i carry my laptop as well as books and folders it has pocket for pins and misc items i would highly recommend this bag for students as it is very durable
`` i love this bag that i ordered from mygift enterprise the color is beautiful i encountered some problems where it was returned in error and i contacted amazon and they responded in such short time and credited my account i re-ordered the item and it arrived in such short time very please with the product and the exceptional customer service i received ! !
i purchased this bag with the intention of just storing my laptop in it , but found it was even better than i thought inside , there is a seperate compartment that is padded for your laptop it fits my # inch dell nicely and i still have room inside for books the pockets on the outside allow for organized storage of pens , chargers , or software i am more than satisified with my purchase
i love this bag it 's very comfortable , i can bring my dell # `` laptop , charger , mouse , and other accessories in my bag the shoulder strap is very soft and comfortable , and you can adjust it to your size the main padded compartment really protects my laptop and i can use it for either my # `` or my # `` laptop and it works without problems i love the green floral cover , it 's adorable and it looks exactly like in the picture
this looks exactly like what i ordered and the quality is great ! ... padding throughout the entire bag even the pockets and this will be very safe for any laptop and precious cargo plenty of room for all the extras
i found myself laid off at # and going back to college full-time in my english class a girl next to me had this bag in black i instantly fell in love with it mostly for the wide shoulder strap and the look inside and out this bag comes in a variety of cool colors and all at a great price i purchased # bags at target and i hated them for being to flimsy , but this one was exactly what i was looking for in a bag i plan on ordering # more in different colors so i can wash them in between thanks for a great product ,
it looked nice when i got it it fit very well on my <unk> beach <unk> <unk> , which i am enjoying it did the trick for school <unk> , etc . , for college it is handy going to the grocery store it ripped last week -lrb- about # `` tear along a seam -rrb- i am having it repaired at a cost of $ # . # we will see how it holds up
only two things i do n't like about this bag first one is , if this is made to fit over the batteries on the <unk> bike where do you tie it off at on the sides that have the straps second one is the tie down on top should have clips for fast release all in all a good strong bag with plenty of room
love my new bags actually , this is my second set my husband took my first set to carry his battery in for his electric bike that he custom made the # sides did rip <unk> at the seams but it was because his battery was way too heavy these are great bags we make frequent trips to the store and they really hold alot love the sturdy handle and convenient shoulder strap i would definitely recommend this case
this is well made sleeve for a # `` laptop computer , the design seems to be well thought out and it will do just what it 's supposed to do , protect your computer and give it a good appearance other than that , really nothing worth mentioning
looking for a dependable cover for your precious notebook this might be what youre looking for a beautiful black chevron sleeve with a handy shoulder strap for your carrying pleasure it will adjust to your preferred length soft , smooth on the outside , nice and cushiony on the inside a neat and easy to use zipper makes this product as simple to use as can be note that there are no pockets on inside or out one thing to lookout for is the size make sure your laptop is # inches or smaller this is best used for your mini acer types
i have been using my backpack for a few weeks now and it is exactly what i hoped it would be there is a lot padding for the laptop and on the shoulder straps it 's very comfortable and i feel my laptop is protected there is even a pocket for my tablet and enough space for whatever else you may need to carry with you the size is perfect ... not too big or too small and not bulky at all it fits my # . # in hp perfectly
recently purchased a # . # inch laptop , not too many backpacks out there for the size i found this one for the right price pros : comfortable every pocket you will ever need and then some laptop easily fits into its slot
this bag is fantastic wonderful quality , <unk> enough for my huge # `` dell plus tons of paper files , generous padding , comfortable straps with a perfect handle and on top of all that , it was so <unk> cheap i ca n't believe i scored this deal great job hp !
the backpack is very sturdy and well made , it does not stick out like other backpacks yet is has plenty of space and pockets to pack things in and organize your stuff i personally like the fact that it does not have flashy colors but has a low profile solid black color this is a solid buy and it wo n't set you back to much no con 's about it
this backpack is great i bought this backpack because i wanted to get rid of my laptop carrying bag my laptop is # . # `` , and it fits well in this backpack there is plenty of room to put more , including the laptop three main compartments -lrb- one to put the laptop in -rrb- , and many other small compartments within i even tried to put in my sisters # `` laptop in simultaneously with my # . # `` laptop and both fit -lrb- not that i 'll ever need to fit two laptops in it -rrb- this is also a very elegant , well-built , and comfortable backpack with good padding i have n't had any problems with it , at all for around only # dollars , i would highly recommend this backpack
i really love this backpack , i bought it a while ago , maybe a year ago or more and works great for me very good quality product ! i will buy it again for sure ! ! perfect size , not too small not too big , perfect fitting
i bought this for my husband to take with him to afghanistan he used it as a carry on it carried his laptop , snacks and a change of clothes i highly recommend it
the other positive reviews has said it all do n't hesitate , a very solid backpack/laptop case for a # . # `` . i was pleasantly pleased to find an mp # pocket with a headphone out on this great pack also nothing else needs to be added others have not said already go for it , you wo n't be disappointed
item came promptly , but it did not fit well had to stretch it over the corners , straining the fabric another customer reported the same problem which ended up breaking the item i guess you get what you pay for
in reading the other reviews a lot of people said it was too small for the # `` so i though well , it 'd probably be perfect for my # `` then it 's way too big , which provides no protection what so ever after the shipping cost and outrageous restocking fees , it 's pointless to return so i 'm just out the $ #
bought this for use with my ipad the ipad is tight fit on the corners to start with , but after # days of use , the zipper broke , and i could not get the ipad out of the case eventually , i had to tear the case open to get the ipad out paying $ # a day to use the product is not worth it
i ordered this hoping that the fitment issues would be solved by the smaller form factor of the ipad # , but alas it is still a stretch over the corners if it was n't advertised as being for the ipad , i would 've rated it higher it should at least fit the product it claims to be for
its hard to review this item when i 'm not using it for what it is intended for i wanted a zip up small item that could hold my motorcycle owners manual and this fits the order perfectly
i won an ipad and i wanted to make sure that i had a cover for it this cover is funtional it protects my ipad and is just the prefect size there are no pockets and it is n't super padded , so if you are looking for something that is super protective , this is n't it this is good for an ipad that sits on a shelf away from major bumps and jarring
i really wanted to like this bag , but it does n't really work for me since i carry a number of gadgets with me , i wanted something a little better than a satchel for organizing i 've had this bag for a week , and i do n't think i 'll be using it much longer my blackberry phone fits in the front panel , but it 's a bit too snug i have to struggle to get it out , and i fear the constant pulling on it will eventually case it to break i really dislike the strap on this bag it 's too long , even when `` doubled up `` , and i feel like it 's always getting tangled the organizer in the bag is terrific ; i think i 'll look for a smaller one of these to use in my old satchel which i will be returning to
i purchased this bag for my ipad after looking for a slim and lightweight way to carry my device i really liked the way it looked and the fabric was cool , but after using it for a few days there were some problems that popped up first , the seams where the strap attached to the actual bag started fraying almost instantly when i got it i literally took it to the coffee shop , and came back and noticed it the next day it ripped into an unusable point unfortunately after <unk> it and getting another one , i had similar problems with the stitching on other areas literally splitting apart besides that , the iphone opening does n't allow for any sort of case , as it 's too narrow of an opening i used an apple bumper and that was a deal breaker for me theoretically , it 's a nice bag and perfect for carrying around your ipad , but i simply had issues with the craftsmanship and ca n't recommend it
i 'm happy with my bag i read the reviews about the iphone with a case on not fitting in the pocket , but i do n't find that 's true with my bag my iphone and case are snug , sure , but they slide in and out of the pocket easily enough i also like how you can work the touchscreen of the iphone while it 's still in the plastic pouch -lrb- i.e . you do n't have to remove the phone to use it -rrb- the removable grid is cool -lrb- in that it 's removable when you do n't need it -rrb- it has minor stitching flaws -lrb- very minor -rrb- , but for the price it is a very nice bag
this is an awesome bag i am a traveling teacher and use it to carry my ipad # plus a few items i bike between schools when i can and it is very convenient on my bike i do not use always use the grid-it , but like to have it when i decide to use it
i 've been using this sling bag for my ipad # since march it offers good protection and the grid is especially nice to set the ipad against in a shopping cart -lrb- my ipad goes everywhere with me -rrb- a sling bag is crucial to keep it close to you ... and a good reminder to not leave the ipad in the shopping cart , or elsewhere
i love this bag for carrying around my ipad and assorted accessories the board with the straps makes it easy to keep all of the cables together while it all fits quite nicely
does the job of protecting the netbook pretty well , but nothing beyond that would be nice to have a pocket for power cables and mouse but oh well u get what you pay
i really loved the design of this case , it fits but the netbook and the power cable , but i feel like it doesnt give that much of protection to the computer , because is practically only the fabric also it was just # days and one of the zipper closers fell off
i love this case unfortunately it did would not completely zip around my sony # . # good communication and an easy return i would buy another in a moment , if i could find the right size
right now there are not a lot of options for the # inch macbook air , i picked this one because i liked the design and it 's product description was the right size for my mba this cover does fairly well , the only extra room is due to the thinness of the mba that said , i do wish there was a big more padding to this cover i 'm not completely convinced this is the best protection for a mba , but if you are planning to use this cover for a netbook , i 'm sure it will work great
i got this because i was looking for something other than a boring , solid color case for my samsung slate pc it fits nicely - there 's a little extra room on the top , but the computer does n't slide around inside i just wish it had a bit more padding inside , and that the material inside would grip the tablet better -lrb- though i ca n't really complain because it 's meant for a different machine -rrb- otherwise it does its job , is well made , and has a pretty design on it
very satisfied with this purchase the case is well made and does what i need it to the matching mouse i bought is just as pretty and i would highly recommend it if you 're in the market for a matching wireless mouse
came on time and packaged well fits my acer aspire one perfectly two zippers so i can leave my netbook plugged in to charge while it sits in the case love it and would recommend to anyone looking to purchase a case
cute as can be , even comes with a cleaning cloth description says it is for macbook or # inch laptops i have a # inch laptop and it does not fit it would be a snug fit for # inch laptops
i bought this because i wanted a pretty case for my # inch mac book when i received this , the zipper hook fell off instantly it also got stuck before it fell off it did , however , fit perfectly it 's very nice but not for me it 's also not neoprene i returned it
i bought this sleeve for my # `` dell inspiron laptop i was excited for it to come but very disappointed when it arrived because it is much too small for my computer therefore , not usable will be returning also , the color in the picture looks blue and green but the blue is grey
this case is cute , durable , and practical it 's a great way to store my macbook and i love how feminine it looks without being pink when i ordered it , the picture looked different than the case that arrived at my house it looks like they have since fixed the picture , but i was disappointed at first that the design had been changed
i am very happy about my purchase - i like the design and the fact that it is light so that i can just pop it in my bag without it taking anymore space than needed i bought it for my macbook air and it fits
rating is low because my hp # `` laptop is about # `` from fitting into this bag laptop was first thing tried so no comment on how camera will fit in if you want this for # . # `` it will fit but not # `` laptop
i am relatively new to photography , so i do not have a great deal of equipment this is the perfect bag , since i can remove any <unk> dividers and lay it out to hold just the gear i currently have that leaves tons of room for other things ... i can go on a weekend trip and take this as my only bag as i <unk> more gear , i 'll be able to add back in the needed dividers i ca n't imagine getting any other type of bag after having used this several times
we have three kids aged # , # and # i stumbled across the <unk> backpack and it seemed too good to be true now i can take the kids to the park and get great pictures of my <unk> playing without having to look like a nerd , and more importantly having my hands free , which is invaluable with three kids the movable dividers make carrying unusual sized stuff easy my <unk> bag is all black which looks cool i love how multi use it is with the laptop compartment , which i 've doubled as a space for magazines , diaper pads etc . i now have a gift for all my friends with young kids
i really like how comfortable this bag is it feels very balanced and i hardly notice it when wearing it the straps and back are nicely padded and quite comfortable there are lots of pockets and velcro adjustable dividers making it easy to configure exactly how you want it it has a nicely padded compartment for my laptop i fit a whole pack of # aa batteries in one of the side pockets as backup for my flash batteries the main compartment is nicely padded for my nikon d # the top compartment can be used for lenses , flashes , or other accessories overall , this is a great value it is an inexpensive bag , but is made like a much more expensive one
just be aware that this backpack is kind of small to be carried around by a <unk> built grown-up i am an average # ' # `` guy and this backpack makes me look like a <unk> best part is , the store i got it from through amazon did n't want to accept return
this backpack was the perfect size it looks very nice and it appears to be very sturdy however , the handle broke the first time i used it i believe that other reviewers had that complaint , but the overall reviews were very good so i took a shot
the backpack is a nice size with good compartments but the top strap broke in only a few weeks the only thing i 've done with is got to work for a week and one business trip
this is the weakest backpack i 've ever owned it did n't even last one week before the strap broke in my hand at school i returned it , and spent an extra # dollars for a backpack made by toshiba that will actually last do n't waist you 're money , because returns are not accepted after # days luckily , mine failed well within the thirty days , so i got my money back
this is a great backpack its very useful and i can see myself using it for a while . pros # . its got a lot of compartments # stylish & <unk> # . cheaply made # . <unk> <unk> not buy this backpack its terrible it broke and now amazon wo n't give me a refund the straps and the handle broke <unk> i was holding a # ibm in the laptop pouch and it ripped a whole in the backpack and my pc was cracked all over the floor of a starbucks
when i got this product in the mail i started to check it out come to find out the handle on top of the bag was half way ripped off
fits my # `` macbook pro very nicely , along with my ipad and some other books however the straps were already coming apart at the seams just after hours of taking it out of the package and loading it up with my said equipment and walking around with it on my back because of that , it 's just too bad i 'll never use this backpack again because i do n't want to tote my laptop in that bag knowing that any minute , it 's going to come apart better off just spending the money and getting a real quality laptop backpack hey the bag does look nice and compact , but now i prefer functionality over garbage
it <unk> fit my books and has a funny fit when u carry it on your back , tried returning it but had to pay more than half the price i bought it , so dumped it got the swiss backpack now , and i 'm loving it
within # weeks the strap broke , unbelievable ! ! ! i read the other reviews and thought to myself maybe these individuals had a bit of bad luck because there were not a lot of reviews on the product they were right i 've been <unk>
i bought this bag on sale for $ # but i regret my decision after # days the stitching started to unravel in multiple places thankfully i managed to return it successfully and get a refund there is nothing `` professional `` about this product
i love the size and usefulness of the bag but , the quality is sub-par i pulled it up from the ground by the handle on top and it just ripped right off i still use it , but am worried other parts will start to fall off soon i know it 's a pretty cheap bag , but it still should n't fall apart that easily maybe it was just mine that was defective , but i find that to be unlikely i guess you get what you pay for
as soon as you open this guy up , you 'll notice that it 's cheap hopefully , you only got this for like ten bucks on amazon and we all know , you get what you pay for my girl needed a bag to carry around her computer when going to class and it 's low profile , so she liked it a lot <unk> after a couple months of use , the carry handle up top ripped off might not seem like a big deal , but she constantly carries it like that , so as soon as this broke , she stopped using it i guess i got my ten bucks worth ... but that 's about it
quality is quite good , but the product itself is just materials sewn together to look like a backpack it 's very uncomfortable on the shoulder and material is slippery on your shoulder the pack easily slides off your shoulder
this backpack at first looks really sleek and sexy but then you will realize it is really way too small to carry anything but your laptop if you are lucky the material is pretty meager and looks like it would not take much wear and probably not fit you if you have broad shoulders usually amazon has a great return policy but when i went to the return this tiny piece of crap , <unk> technology has ridiculous return policy including # % restocking fee on non opened products and buyer responsibility for postage better off spending more money on something sizable than wasting $ # and i would also stay away from this seller
the bag quality is very very poor , it 's different from what you see on line the first day i gave it to my <unk> sister was the day the handle cut off after i have <unk> to her about american sold goods it was a slap
this is a nice slim pack for those that dont like a bulky backpack room for a laptop , portfolio , pens , mouse , etc . however , the top strap has broken off bottom line , for # bucks its ok
i love the way the book bag looks the only problem i have is that my # . # `` laptop barely fits i have to squeeze the bag shut before i can zip it up which is a pain i just do n't like that it says # `` laptops and my # . # `` barely fits pros - looks awesome - great protection for laptop - very comfortable on your back - price -lrb- only $ # cons - space -lrb- if you have a laptop with the charger in the big pocket then you can only have one small book in the medium one and pens and a # subject notebook in the smallest one - laptop specs -lrb- technically it fits i just do n't feel safe with it i 'm very disappointed that i have to fight my laptop to get it in this bag
nice spacious backpack however the small handle got ripped off in just a few days handling it it also looks like the main straps wont last either as i have already seen some signs of tearing . if the straps and small handle were stronger it would have received a five rating
this backpack really holds a lot of stuff in its three big compartments which was great for carrying my books on campus but before the end of the semester , the top handle ripped on one side and one strap started to unravel so i had to stop using it good for light things , but i would n't put heavy stuff in it for daily use
the part of zip has wore in # month , but still usable it seems the zip is the worst part , plastic and weak all other attributes are good for the price
i love the slim lines of this backpack it 's sleek , and easy to maneuver while commuting on busy <unk> cars it fits quite a lot while not expanding to make you feel like you 're where a turtle shell on your back my only issue is that i 've only had this for # months and it 's already pulling apart at the seems i suppose that 's what you get for something cheap , but i 'm still disappointed b/c this is a great bag in every other way
i received this bag fast as usual through amazon the first few days i had no issue at all with this bag and loved the size and layout of the various pockets just a day ago though i was all packed up and grabbed the bag by the top handle to head out the door and one side of the handle completely ripped free from the bag luckily i was just grabbing this from the couch , but if someone else had this bag hanging somewhere it would have fell directly to the floor and could have damaged everything inside i do not have the bag <unk> or anything either i have my ipad and computer inside along with cords and that is it be careful with this bag if you do choose to purchase it this bag is built for carrying expensive devices and it would be terrible to ruin all your valuable stuff just because of a cheap bag that does not even hold together aside from this defect i have nothing bad to say this bag has plenty of room for all your things while maintaining a thin profile and comfortable fit
not great quality starting ripping at shoulder strap almost immediately i did put it through its paces , carrying # lbs daily but it was only $ # so i stitched it up would not buy again
generally it is ok backpack , but the straps are too wide and designed wrong way , that the do not lie well on the shoulders i think to ask my wife to sew them making thinner the back pack is also quite big for me , as i do n't pretend to use for any laptop but again , it looks nice and build with decent quality
the backpack in design is great if you keep all your college books digital on your computer and you just need to carry some papers you could n't fit # text books in , so it is good for me the bad side of this is the quality of the backpack the top handle ripped off on one side and the sides of the shoulders are begging to rip as as well it was a $ # backpack so i got what i paid for
i bought two , one for me -lrb- an average-sized girl -rrb- and one for my boyfriend -lrb- a <unk> guy -rrb- his fits him well , and he loves it mine really uncomfortably digs into my shoulders otherwise , it is well made i recommend it for the <unk> , but not for a smaller frame
the item is decent , but the first time i used it , one of the seams tore i did n't have anything sharp in the backpack , nor did i overfill it otherwise , it 's an ok backpack my # `` macbook pro fit nicely inside , and the backpack is slim and lightweight
again , the title explains it pretty well if you 're looking purely for a laptop backpack , this is perfect however , do n't expect to fit more than your laptop , charger , and a notepad or two , because this thing is small and one of the pockets lining the inside tore almost instantly i had to buy another backpack for travel , but kept this one because it still looks good an gets the job done in a pinch
i really loved this bag the design and all the compartments were great the size was perfect and it even has two mesh side pockets i think it is a great bag but it lacks in terms of quality the material of this bag is of poor quality i guess that is to be expected of a # dollar bag the straps broke off and the mesh pockets has holes in them i think if the bag was built more sturdy , i would not hesitate to buy it again it needs to have sturdier sewing a bit more padding on the bottom to protect the laptop
main components work zippers are fine , and the shoulder straps seem to be securely fastened to the bag the bag itself has an average feel to it ... about what you would expect for $ # . # it has enough internal pockets for me , and is basically what i was looking for however , the hand strap at the top of the bag came off the first time i tried to pick up the bag with my laptop inside of it it appeared to only be sewn in with several threads on each side , so this is probably why it came apart so easily in fairness though , i do n't really use that function of the bag , and it is n't that hard to just hold the bag normally , but still , it should n't break like that
# -rrb- the backpack is slim and has a clean appearance # -rrb- the backpack easily fits a # inch <unk> # -rrb- the top handle broke off after # week of regular use # -rrb- the side nets are <unk> near big enough to fit a regular plastic bottle -lrb- i can barely fit four fingers in there # -rrb- the backpack shows `` two `` main zipper compartments plus one small front compartment but the `` two `` main compartments are actually the same compartment separated by a small divider in other words , stuff you put in one compartment -lrb- like a charger -rrb- just rolls into the other compartment conclusion : inexpensive and sleek looking , it feels cheap but it depends on your expectations for a $ #
the backpack looks nice and the cushioned straps make it comfortable on the shoulders but the top strap got loose in a month 's time , and threads are starting to unravel for the shoulder straps ... pity i was using it to carry my # inch laptop mostly ... hopefully it will last for another couple of months
i like the backpack i ordered it because my boyfriend has the bigger version , but it has been only a week and the thread is unraveling at the straps i actually do n't know if i want to return it or just keep it
it looks good , had it for a year , no tears it looks great when you wear it , its slim and has a lot of compartments great buy if you need something slim for your laptop and other
i needed a laptop backpack that would work with a # `` wide screen asus for class this looked pretty good so far i am happy with the purchase it looks durable enough and has space for <unk> accessories i tried putting a thicker book in it and it did n't work very well just an excuse not to take the book for class with me . : -
i purchased the bag and love it it has all the space i want and is sharp it is comfortable and my man likes it as well the only problem i had was the `` expedited `` shipping was a <unk> it did n't arrive in # days it was more like # ! not bad but , i was leaving and they did n't get it to me on time . other than that yes awesome !
i travel a lot with work - i 've been super happy with this backpack for my large -lrb- rather heavy -rrb- laptop my only & # # ; complaint & # # ; would be that it often makes my back sweaty - but is there one that would n't ?
this is a good replacement to my previous back pack that i bring to work it maybe compact in size but it fits the laptop and the power cord i am happy with the purchase
just used it for the first time today my employer gave me a new laptop which is pretty heavy this backpack does a good job holding the laptop and it is well padded both inside and out , so it does n't dig into my lower back when carrying it the shoulder straps are also well padded so it feels comfortable it 's also roomy without bulk and has a low profile so i do n't bump into commuters with it on the bus and subway my only complaint is that it should have more internal pockets for holding cell phone , ipod , headphones , etc . . overall , a good value and well made
