i do n't have a lot to say about this because it just does what it is supposed to do the quality is great , the bag is sturdy , and the checkpoint <unk> is easy one great thing about this bag is the little strap on the back to attach it to your roller luggage that 's just genius
i bought this for my gym bag due to me carrying around # lbs worth of clothes and random stuff this strap when i first bought it was so comfortable i 'm a week in and so far so good why i 'm not giving this a # star yet is the easy detachable straps that they give you i 'm very worried that it will just snap in the future with my regular use , but time will tell i will update my review in a couple of months to a # if these easy locking clips hold on tight for right now though , i recommend this strap for anyone that carries a heavy laptop <unk> bag / well any bag
it is good and comfortable just like the descriptions state i would have prefered that it were a little longer but i knew going in based on other reviews that it was a little
well my <unk> <unk> my last strap -lrb- work laptop bag -rrb- and this strap is the replacement i 'm very pleased and i wish the bag originally came with this strap what i like about this strap is the bounce is gives and its very comfortable
what can i say surprisingly thin material bad plastic smell hard to put laptop into the sleeve does not securely close was going to return it , but the return shipping charges would cost more than the price of the product i guess it would protect better than nothing , but i 'm going to get the case logic instead
i am disappointed with the cover although it was a very good price , it does not have a zipper and the smell of the material is terrible if you have problems with smells like me , you will not enjoy it
do not buy if you do n't want to buy another case again i wasted ten bucks or so on this -- you really get what you pay for my # & # # ; laptop fits perfectly in here but after # months -lrb- aka way shorter than my laptop 's life -rrb- , all # corners had gaping holes from the wear and tear the sleeve is maybe # mm thick max , so it 's not surprising it would get <unk> it also provides no drop protection -- when i dropped my laptop , i heard a sharp thump -lrb- not supposed to happen -rrb- buy a neoprene instead that 's what i 'm forced to do now
i bought this to protect my laptop and thought that the lining was much thicker than it is it is very thin and would only protect a laptop from scratches there is barely any padding for bumps in bags or accidental <unk> the size was bigger than my laptop but that is my error i should have measured my laptop that being said i really wanted something thick and sturdy which is not this plus the flip type lid is more irritating than helpful when trying to get my laptop in and out of the sleeve will protect from scratches but not much else
i had to air it out for almost a week outside until it became bearable like other reviewers mentioned , the neoprene is on the thin side but i bought this to protect my laptop from crumbs and dirt falling into the cooling vents when it 's inside my backpack the flap has no <unk> device so i just used some cheap sticky velcro you can buy for a dollar at the hardware store and it seals really nicely
i ordered this product to carry my laptop in the purse the sleeve is a bit thinner than expected , but good enough to be what it is intended for for the price of the product and the prompt service from the seller , i think it is well worth it
update # / # i have n't used this case all that much but the stitching in one of the corners is already coming apart with just over a year of very little use i expect it to last longer fits my # `` asus perfectly good for protecting it from other things in my backpack as well as some cushioning . its water resistant which is good i would recommend if you just need something to keep this safe from the elements , its not a protective case though so keep that in mind
i planned to use this for my # & # # ; sony vaio so that i could carry it in my travel bag without needing its own laptop carrying case however , it is unlikely that i will ever get much use out of this because it feels too thin to actually protect it would be ok for protecting against scratching , but definitely not protective enough for any sort of impacts
my laptop size is # inches and this case does n't fit well to my laptop this case is small if you have a # inches 's laptop , you 'd better buy bigger size case
i chose this because it was incredibly cheap that said , it does an acceptable job of providing another layer of protection i wish i 'd noticed that it was shipped directly from hong kong i would not have intentionally ordered something with such a huge footprint other than that , it works
i have nearly every computer accessory besides a sleeve this was extremely inexpensive at the time i purchased it and i figured it was worth a shot it 's mostly sturdy , though the stitching on one side is already coming loose and i have n't yet used it my mbp # & # # ; fits perfectly inside , though considering the price -lrb- less than $ # when i bought it ! i do n't mind at all
this notebook sleeve does what i need it to , protect my laptop other than that , i think the material could be a little bit better it has attracted lots of <unk> and i can tell it probably wont last another # months of everyday use i would probably spend a little bit more and buy a known brand next time
good sleeve at a good price it is not a super fit , as if it had a zipper , but it does the job given the price , i can not complain it is cheaper than most stores
title says it slightly too large for my # inch samsung thin laptop did n't have a problem with smell after a couple days a great value , would purchase again good to use inside a backpack , would n't recommend for standalone use
it 's very comparable to a way over priced sleeve i purchased for my macbook a year ago feels the same but smells like either paint thinner or crystal <unk> ... not sure
i love this product , it fits perfectly and i love how it does n ot add bulk to the product . i <unk> liked it to be a little more cushiony for protection but overall great product
it 's generic , so expect your laptop , especially if it 's a thinner machine , to fit a little looser in the sleeve it 's still pretty attractive and protective , but just know what you 're getting also , mine shipped inside out , so i was a bit taken aback when it was all red quickly flipping it inside out was the best decision i 've made
it will fit a # inch laptop no problem but a # . # is not a good fit it <unk> around but for $ # bucks not a deal breaker it 's a bit <unk> so keep that in mind if your looking for something like this as a stand only case this sleeve is good for those people looking for extra padding while laptop is in the sleeve while traveling in a book bag
for the price , this is a fine case it is very think , i have an older case logic sleeve that is about double the thickness of this sleeve , however it was triple the price i intend to use this sleeve for when i put my laptop in my non-laptop backpack , so i dont mind that it 's not very thick so for some basic scratch and minimal shock protection in my backpack , this should work fine . for $ # , ca n't expect much more
got this as a gift for a friend when i saw it , it was a little thinner than i expected but still formed a nice snug fit around the laptop for the price , its a good buy
i bought this sleeve for my laptop not too long ago and when it had arrived i tried and loved it 's really <unk> to the touch but i just wished it was a little bigger great but ! ! !
well , that 's one laptop we know this works with i put the laptop in this sleeve and it is snug and secure and protected from scrapes , and that should be twenty words , ok
have my dm # t- # in it fits perfect ! ! i use the micro sleeve that came with the laptop and this case = love the combo it does the trick , keeps the dust out and protects my <unk>
fits my hp dm # t perfectly not much in the way of cushioning protection but the sleeve stays in my backpack to protect my notebook from scratches and crud the notebook slips in and out with ease and the flap can be pulled over for a complete cover
nice cheap , padded , smells like a new car of course i want something like a zipper but i 'm paying dirt cheap for this so what more can i ask for fits my vivobook # perfectly
i bought this sleeve for a thinkpad t # with the standard # cell battery that fits great i read there was smell and it was n't all that bad it just dissipated over time and was never an issue
i carry my laptop around all day in my backpack with other books , papers , and other junk this sleeve is quick and easy to get on and does a great job protecting my laptop from minor wear and tear
for the price it 's a great product it 's not finely made and not high quality but it keeps my laptop safe and protects it if your looking for a cheap sleeve to keep your macbook safe its a great
the color is not same as shown it is not bright , but very dark and disgusting green i am very disappointed -- will return it for sure because it is so ugly
this is a quality product it 's not extremely protective , but for the price it certainly does the job and will protect your laptop from scratches and chips while the design of the cover is very nice , the picture is misleading the cover is not nearly as vibrant as the color shows rather the main color of the sleeve is more of a dark green instead of a vibrant light blue as the picture would make you think
this is one of the few sleeves i 've found to be able to fit my # `` hp pavilion i gave it # stars because the design is not as vibrant as it appears in the picture other than that , it does the job of keeping my laptop <unk> it does n't have any padding , so this would n't work to protect your computer from damaging in the event of falling , etc .
this computer bag showed up today , and i am pleased with it 's appearance and functionality the only thing i noticed , is when i pulled it out of the box it had a plastic-like smell with a sorta nasty <unk> not a deal breaker and maybe with a couple of days it will improve it does fit my macbook pro very nicely
this sleeve fits my dell latitude very well , snug and secure i was disappointed , however , in the <unk> of the colors in the design they are not as brilliant as seen online i 'll keep it , but choose a different print design next time
if you 're looking for a protective case , this would not be a good choice as the material is on the thinner side but if you 're like me and you 're not looking for a sturdy case bag then this is great it keeps my macbook pro safe when placed in another bag with other items i love the colors
the colors are n't quite as bright as i expected , and it smelled bad for a few weeks before the smell finally went away , but it 's still a nice slip case it fits my macbook well -lrb- maybe a little loose , but not bad -rrb- i would n't buy this for sole protection of your laptop , since it is kind of thin i have a hard shell case -lrb- ipearl -rrb- on my laptop and just got this for a little extra protection and for travel for that purpose and for the cheaper price though , it 's definitely worth it
i like this case but now i realize the importance of hardy cases for travel while i use the case without a problem i worry that it 's too flimsy to actually protect in any kind of travel very attractive colour and design
this laptop sleeve was very pretty i love the bright colors unfortunately , it was too small for my laptop it was very well made with plenty of padding to protect a laptop i wish it fit my laptop
people say you get what you pay for but , really , it is n't even worth the price the material is cheap , it does n't offer a bit of protection i returned it immediately on a positive note , the customer service is excellent the refund was quick and seamless
chromebook fits well there is about an inch of case though all the way around the computer flap on front actually makes it thicker than it needs to be looks great now if you use it a lot , the fake leather may not hold up real well i wo n't return it because it was so cheap probably wo n't use it much recommend a case logic case instead in real life , it is not very manly looking -lrb- if that matters to you -rrb-
fits the macbook air really well - no wiggle room the stitching and overall construction is really nice well done much better than expected at this price point it does n't have a ton of padding , but it is a nice balance between a slim case and a protection i knock one star off for the magnetic latch it kind of clicks into place , but unless you get it just right , it does n't latch or hold in place as secure as if it lines up just right it does give a click sound when you get it just right other that that , its hard to tell if it is # % lined up however , it fits the macbook air so well , that i 'm not worried the computer falling out or the flap flying open unless you pull the laptop out , their really is n't really worry about it falling out - even if its not # % latched
fits my # `` macbook air perfectly slides in and out very easily the magnetic clasp works great my best friend ended up ordering the larger size for her macbook pro it 's a great buy
probably should be a mandatory purchase for series # samsung ultrabook this is ideal if you schlep the unit around in a backpack or bulky brief case or computer bag it protects it # % from blemishes and scratches will it protect it from a # foot drop probably not a great idea but it does a great job of keeping it stable inside of a backpack or the like it does exactly what it says it does and it is way less expensive than most of the options out there at retail
i recently purchased a macbook air # & # # ; and needed a sleeve something not bulky and looked nice as well browsing the different kinds , this leather one caught my attention i read the previous ratings and decided to go with this plus its inexpensive unlike others to be honest the leather is nice and does not feel cheap it is made with good quality very glad i chose this one as its sleek and fits perfect
i 've had it for over a month now and it is holding up well i use it <unk> between a series # and # `` macbook air almost on a daily basis for the price , its worth buying another one in case it wears out sooner than i end keeping the laptops i was looking for something to prevent scratching as i lug around the two computers and the sleeve does the job all other sleeves i found in stores were thicker or more expensive to me it looks professional and sleek , though i have also had someone comment on it looking feminine -lrb- not a problem for me -rrb- it does add some girth -lrb- # . # `` x # `` x . # `` empty -rrb- , but it 's still slim enough to be comfortable to carry and even stuff in my purse
i was so excited to open this product up , and the minute i <unk> the velcro it broke the seams broke so everything i opened it to place my laptop in it broke more , i am highly disappointed in the poor quality of this , i hope future costumers do not have the same problem i guess that 's what i should have expected with it being so cheap
it came to me last time <unk> my laptop even broken had the whole on it i sent it back to seller got my money back . the color and the style was the same as this picture
this product arrived on time and in good condition -lrb- new -rrb- i thought the padding might be sufficient inside a soft bag , but i would n't feel safe if the neoprene case was going to be the only source of protection
the item arrived so fast and this <unk> color is absolutely gorgeous ! ! is soft and comfort to the laptop ... also , it came with an neon orange strap for the charger ! ! :
this is a good fit for my laptop but it 's thin & foamy -lrb- not like the higher quality sleeves i 've owned in the past -rrb- so offers very protection i 'm disappointed w/this item
color is not <unk> pink as shown in the picture mine came with a couple of scratches on the fabric as far as a case , it works well to protect my laptop i guess for the price it 's okay
if you are not in a hurry , this is a pretty good deal the case fit my asus notebook perfectly i think your better off spending a bit more and getting it in two weeks i ordered this on # . # . # and did n't get it until # . # . #
based on the description , i thought this neoprene case would fit better on the macbook air # `` model while it is a great color , and for the price , a decent case , the computer does not fit snuggly around the computer rather it is too big for my uses , that is fine , but if you want something to really hug your air and keep the compact nature of it viable , this one does n't quite do the job the fastener is solid , and the case is good quality
this sleeve is not as good as expected the actual color is not as bright as it looks online besides , it is a a few inches bigger than my # -inch mac air not very pleasant online shopping experience but i can still use it just to protect my mac do n't want to bother to return it
the material and padding is kind of cheap but it gets the job done they also shipped it folded and it took a week for it to <unk> its
it fits the sony netbook just fine , has extra pouch on the outside for the charger i did not have a problem with it yes it is made in china , but still good everything is made in china these days
my mac air slips right in and then pops into my purse if you are traveling far and need extra protection , you 'll want something sturdier but as a general day to day cover , it works
this case fits my # inch macbook air perfectly the top opening is perfect for use in my backpack because i do n't have to pull the whole case out to access my laptop
this sleeve is not the most <unk> or the fanciest computer case , but it 's totally serviceable and the color is great i use it with an # `` macbook air and it fits great , with room for my iphone cord and the power cord , or a notebook
i bought this sleeve for my x # base on some other reviews here i had expected this to be an exact match for my x # , but it 's not it 's a nice sleeve by itself , but it 's for # . # `` , not # . # `` -lrb- x # -rrb- i will upload a few photos so you can judge by yourself
i needed a simple , cheap , and subtle laptop sleeve for my lenovo x # with a standard battery pack the laptop fits perfectly - no extra neoprene to flop around with just the right amount of <unk> i do n't think an extended battery pack would fit if that 's your setup
this is a very simple padded envelope for a laptop/notebook or tablet my lenovo twist notebook computer is a tight fit , but it fits , and is nice and neat when closed up great for price
similar to another reviewer , i purchased this for a lenovo x # with # cell battery it is definitely not designed for this size of a laptop , and when i first placed the laptop inside i could not get the velcro to close the sleeve however , with some effort the neoprene does stretch and you can successfully enclose the laptop with this sleeve i imagine with continued use it will become easier to close the sleeve next time the sleeve itself feels well made and soft , the velcro robust i had some trouble deciding what to rate this sleeve it 's not designed for an x # ... but it works , if barely
i bought this for my # inch tablet i wanted something that i could use and keep my tablet in its regular case it does what i need it to do if i take the case off , i know it 'll still be safe
i bought a cr- # chromebook second hand from a friend and needed a sleeve for it this needed to stretch a tiny bit , but it worked the neoprene is thicker but does n't offer as much cushioning as incase does
the title of my review says it all just posting to confirm this for users with chromebooks looking for an inexpensive case the velcro as compared to a zipper actually makes a difference i prefer this because getting my chromebook in and out of the case is very fast and easy there is sufficient padding to protect the computer without the case being bulky definitely a great buy if you 're looking for functionality
simple , inexpensive and adequate a perfect fit for my # . # inch acer netbook an external pouch would be nice , but then it would probably need a handle , so this is better suited as a storage case , and not a traveling bag
i bought this in black for my new samsung chromebook -lrb- which i 'm already running <unk> on ! -rrb- it fits well , with a little extra wiggle room this way , i can charge it while it 's in the case it 's exactly as described -- a cushioned sleeve it looks very nice
read great reviews a t this i cant <unk> its has little grip so i worry <unk> my laptop falling out of my grip and getting damaged must use with a case would n't advise using the sleeve solo
it fits my # inch laptop just fine it does protect my laptop just fine , but i wish it had a place to store my cord its a cool pink color and does provide cushioning it wasnt expensive so i guess it works for minimal protection i have no real complaints about the product
i bought this product for my # -inch macbook pro , and while it does the job , it is a little bit bigger than i would like there 's a lot of extra space , so i feel that it 's not protecting it as well as it could
my # . # & # # ; laptop fits in the sleeve nicely if it were just # & # # ; wider i 'd be able to leave my mouse 's usb in without it hanging up right where the zipper closes still , it 's the best i 've found very good quality
love , love the color ! ! fits my # . # hp just fine and even has room for the charger glad that i found a cute sleeve that was big enough without having to spend $ # + plus ca n't beat the speedy shipping !
the product arrived in time and it was the same color as on the website the fit was just right for my # / # inch laptop i would purchase from them again
i love the pink color it is for my # inch hp laptop it is big enough for my laptop and electrical accessories it serves as a dust cover and desk mat the laptop easily slips inside without any problem at all i purposely ordered the # inch size so there is lot of room for my laptop to get it in and out of the sleeve the pink color is very attractive sitting on my desk table
i 've purchased this twice now i love the look , feel and protection it gives to my mac but it 's been broken twice now it has tiny little clasps that break too easily the price was right but i guess i 'll have to invest a little more money to get something sturdier
beautiful , i just hope this one does not crack like ones on my previous two , i purchased for the air i have experienced no cracking issues on the ones i purchased for my # and # inch pro models cracking , the clips that hold the <unk> on seem to just break off after a few months four stars because of previous issues with the ones purchased for the air
provides a nice feel that avoids slipping when walking with my laptop i also like the perforated material since it allows the base color of my laptop to show through
this case looks really good and has a really solid build despite the <unk> holes in it however it is so solid that it takes me a good bit of time and effort to remove it to clean the computer and remove any small debris that becomes <unk> between them so , in conclusion it looks and performs well but is difficult in maintenance -lrb- not a big deal
this was a real pain to get on i felt like i was going to rip the plastic corner tabs it 's really snug , but i guess that 's a good thing it looks good from a distance , but you notice the stitching and cuts if you look at it close since this is just for protecting the computer while it 's not in use at home , it 's fine for us
was a little tricky to get on , but i do really love it do n't have to worry about my mac air as much since it seems well protected was n't sure it would close all the way , but after a few weeks use it stretched fully get compliments on it regularly
i was n't looking for a specific type of cover for my macbook air just one that was going to last a while i read the reviews and it looked like it might work , luckily i did purchase it and have been using it ever since i 'm not crazy about pink but hey if it 's going to last and does the job , why not
this is the type of case i have been looking for to use with my macbook pro i have been unable to find one i found this one just after i got the computer and love it it protects my computer without adding a lot of bulk or weight it looks great in the pink color
i just received this case and it does not i repeat , does not fit my macbook pro it 's too small and will not click onto the computer definitely returning it and getting something else
it is just ok , not great quality , i got the black colour one and it is always dirty , finger prints as soon as you touch it it fit good , look good but difficult to keep clean it is a bit fragile as well , mine as crack on the top corner
i wanted a subtle case for my # & # # ; macbook pro and went with this one because of good ratings and bargain price it is a very good-looking cover and fits the mbp very tightly i was a little surprised at how snug the fit is ; this made it slightly difficult to put the cover on the computer this was a minor issue and i still give it four stars
it looks nice , top seems secure but bottom seems insecure always careful to be sure it is not going to cause me to drop it i also think it may cause to overheat if i use computer for longer
this case looks cool and gives great protection it feels nice and looks like it is high quality the only problem i 'm having is the little rubber pads falling off on the bottom my computer got a little too hot and the glue that holds the rubber pads gave up so now one of them keeps falling off when i try to slide my computer on the desk i 'm going to try and <unk> it down with something a little stronger than what the manufacturer had and that should solve it overall it 's a great case though
all those things and it fit my # mbp -lrb- early # model -rrb- quite well . the feet on the bottom lift the mbp up so u have more <unk> too which always helps
this product feels great , and looks great the only negative thing about this product is that does pop off from time to time but not frequently enough to bother me
new macbook pro user was looking for something affordable and stylish to help protect new hardware from scratches / minor wear and tear did a search on this product and read reviews before purchasing for a basic protection / everyday use option i say go for it love that it 's see through and the apple logo shines through the <unk> frosted coating just slide it right on and a quick gentle snap and you 're good to go
looks classy , feels good and perfect fit for my macbook aluminum the ventilation is good too that it does not really heat up and with amazon price , a really good buy
fits perfect and you can access every single port it 's not a <unk> color , more like a dark see through color laptop feels heavier feet thingy had some plastic peeled off when first opened , do n't know why ~ * ~ beware ~ * ~ * has a logo on a corner that gets dust in it
i got this for my <unk> macbook and i personally am jealous of his <unk> nice rubberized finish and its a nice black <unk> color all the ports are accessible and the case fits nicely i highly recommend
stylish , sleek , cool ... a nice cover that let 's the apple logo appear thru the cover have had it now for a month and seems to add a fair amount of protection
looking at the images of the product i thought i came with a cut-out for the apple logo , not so nevertheless , it has a nice , durable feel and the apple logo just happens so shine right through the cover clever and nice rubbery feel very happy with the product hope this helps
based on other reviews , the casing is awesome at first i was not so sure about it but once installed the case fits pretty snug it does not feel cheap in a way where it may break or crack the feel to the material is great and it also provides a better grip simply enough , i am happy with my purchase
