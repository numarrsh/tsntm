while this is not the end all in security , i found it very useful on my trip to africa i was able to put two canon rebel bodies and three lenses in the bag i felt confident leaving this equipment locked onto furniture in my tent i was trying to prevent casual theft and this bag did that also , it is light and <unk> , which is really important if you are going to africa i expect i will use it some on car trips
nice pockets for the power supply and cord just enough space inside for the netbook <unk> of slop to allow for the unit to slide around nice double handle with velcro all in all not bad at all
i purchased this case for my wife 's new # `` notebook and she loves it plenty of room for the computer , power cord , and other accessories the exterior zippered storage pockets are roomy and practical the whole case is nicely padded well worth the price
case is very flexible and stretches to fit your needs would have liked one more compartment for mouse versus choosing between mouse and other external item like a portable dvd rom drive
my netbook has a small screen but it is thick because of its heavy duty battery it fits securely in here the larger outer pocket just barely holds my cord it makes the netbook compact and easy to carry around i wish it had a larger cord pocket though - i 'm afraid the zipper will break trying to cram my cord into it
thicker neoprene would have been nice , but my samsung chromebook fits in it perfectly on the large exterior pocket i store my <unk> earphones and charger while in the smaller pocket fits the ac cord i do n't have anything in the inside pockets ; but they are there for a thin notepad , small pen , sd card , flash memory , etc . the zippers may not last forever , but for now they travel smoothly comparing the features and price of this case with more expensive ones , this may be the best deal
perfect case for the samsung chromebook . it has enough room to hold the power cord . the case <unk> fits snugly but not to snugly . it has a handle , perfect for carrying around
item was shipped fast - via usps this case is perfect for storing my acer aspire one # . # `` netbook the front outside pockets will also accommodate the power supply as well as an extra battery like the vast majority of cases , this provides easy transport as well as protection from dust and scratching one of the better prices found very pleased with the purchase
i bought this case to carry my acer # . # inch netbook along with the power adapter , mouse , and external disc drive this case carries all those items perfectly it definitely fit my needs for a small compact carrying case
i got this bag for use with an ipod touch and an apple wireless keyboard , and i must say it exceeded my expectations there is an ipod sized pouch inside and the keyboard fits perfectly
i like the case , the colors are cool and my acer # & # # ; fits perfectly i also like zipper pouch in the front i gave this three stars because the material is kind of thin , and my package took way too long to get here other than that , it 's pretty nice and not a bad deal for $ #
this product is fairly priced and i had wanted a case that zipped from the shorter side or all the way around for my asus eee pc although a great price , i only give it # stars because i had expected the neoprene to be thicker i would n't trust this case for more than a corner bump worth the money but had i known i would have spent a little more for that extra cushion
this is a basic neoprene case that i purchased for my acer netbook i was initially concerned about the size because the product information indicated it would fit up to a # & # # ; laptop , the exact size of the netbook , but it is more than large enough it does n't have any bells and whistles , but it 's an easy and lightweight covering for the netbook so i do n't worry about it when i toss it in my packback or bag
i am a <unk> parties representative and this sleeve is perfect for my acer netbook it is the companies colors and looks good sitting on the table before i set up for my parties ! ! !
really good looking protection for an acer netbook fits my d # even though i have a # cell battery on it it 's a little tight but is ok even with a thin mouse pad stuffed inside with it if i get another acer , i 'll get another one of these
bought this bag for my # `` macbook pro olive green color looks great and gives a casual look to the bag very comfortable on your shoulders and fits the laptop perfectly sufficient space available for an adaptor , mouse , few notepads , important documents , etc . overall a good bag for daily office usage
i was a bit skeptical at first buying a bag online , i was unsure about the quality of its construction and how it would actually look when i would receive it i like the design and the quality is probably better than what i paid for -lrb- slightly -rrb- it was a great value buy
a good shoulder bag , well made better than any others i have had in the past the only downside for me personally is i wish the secondary compartment was a bit larger to hold more than a couple <unk> pads
one of the best products i have ever purchased , their quality is second to none the shoulder stap could be a seat belt , the locks and swivels are great put these guys in charge of our country
i never thought i could love a laptop bag , but i love this one perfect fit for my macbook pro and i 'm able to fit my magic mouse , mouse pad , ipad mini and various pens and paperwork without feeling like something will inadvertently break or get squished very nice and `` sleek `` look to it and definitely seems to be durable for the price , you ca n't beat it
great bag for a great price it 's roomy and fits almost everything i need which includes my daily sandwich documents are perfectly secured and the laptop compartment is roomy and secure enough
this bag is very attractive , and i love that it does n't look too much like a laptop bag -- i feel it 's less likely to be stolen it has lots of compartments for storing accessories , and protects the laptop nicely
based on the previous reviews , i was originally a little hesitant in purchasing this product on receiving my sleeve i found that it held the essential parts - the netbook and the power cord contrary to previous reviews , it does hold the power cord in the main compartment the front zipper compartment will also carry small accessories as a student , who also travels , this was a convenient way to carry my netbook while still having space for my text books and notes in my book bag i am pleased with this purchase
this is perfect fit for my laptop # model i love it very much . it 's just very good and excellent material for protect and good price for money can buy . thank
i 've read other reviews for this bag so i was a little skeptical when i purchased it from amazon my hp mini # fit well into the bag even with the cafe <unk> mouse usb dongle left plugged into the side port i was able to fit the mouse into the side pocket along with my external usb powered cd/dvd drive and cord no , it wo n't fit the power cord and adapter , but that 's why i bought a netbook in the first place so i would n't have to the smell of the material can be a little over powering at first but eventually gets less offensive over time it is a very durable protective cover with a nice handle and i have total confidence in it 's ability to keep my netbook safe and secure under many varying conditions with the hp logo and black color it <unk> with all my accessories
i 'm finally pleased to have acquired a notebook sleeve that actually fits it appropriately this particular sleeve is made for this netbook , and it does a really good job of fitment
the bag looks really good , has lots of pockets for everything has great capacity quite a comfortable fit on the back only thing , as mentioned in the other review , is that it tends to fall flat when you keep it vertical on the floor however , it 's not that big a problem great bag overall
well , the title says it all the bag is great but is really not the same shown in the picture the red accents are more than the ones we see on the picture still this is a great bag , perfect for laptop carrying
i bought this backpack for hiking and i love all the features like sunglass holder , ipod w / headphone slot , laptop pocket , water pockets it has lots of pockets for different items i do n't know why it is n't labeled as a `` computer backpack `` since it has the laptop pocket <unk> says it fits laptops up to # `` the one i received looks identical as shown in the picture unlike the other reviewer
i plan on buying this bag again once i find a way to justify having a second one lol but in all <unk> i 'm a college kid and i 've used a lot of bags in the past this one takes the cake i wish i could have had this in high school gifts my sony vaio <unk> # fx with ample room to spare now i take my laptop with me even when i do n't really need it just because of how convenient it is to carry
this is certainly a <unk> laptop sleeve , but it is not as nice as i expected , for several reasons i thought that this would be much softer than it was on the outside , and i was , frankly , hoping for a little more sturdiness between the outside world and my laptop as promised , the outside is a nice , grey , cable knit wool or cotton i thought that this would be a little softer than it was , and was slightly disappointed inside , it is a <unk> <unk> color i do n't know who would have wanted that color as opposed to a rich blue or a calming green , or even a <unk> black , but there it is moreover , i tend to prefer a little more <unk> in my laptop sleeves , instead of the soft , <unk> -lrb- ~ # mm -rrb- thick foam that lines this on the upside , the zipper does extend roughly # of the way down one side -lrb- not shown in photo -rrb- , making it a little easier to get your laptop out overall , it is certainly acceptable , but nothing overly special or charming
at first it felt weird to use a <unk> case for netbook the design looks <unk> like that in a sweater but once i got received it , it looked quiet good . the padding is very thick and will provide a good protection there is no handle to carry , in case you plan to use it like that otherwise it can adjust easily in any side pocket of a laptop bag or backpack inside is flashy pink , in case that is a problem for someone zipper is very smooth and overall , it looks very stylish too
my inspiron # netbook fits snugly inside this laptop sleeve without a lot of sliding around and it 's a lot more attractive than the plain black neoprene sleeve that i had been using the construction of the sleeve is solid : the inside is a <unk> magenta padding , about a half inch or so on each side the zipper is heavyweight vinyl , with an inch long rubberized tab and the exterior is a gorgeous charcoal gray , thick <unk> <unk> material for the sake of the review , i did my best to make a <unk> in a corner with the tip of a pencil on one of the looser areas of the weave and was n't able to i also dropped some paper <unk> on it and everything brushed off cleanly with just a tap i wish there were pockets inside to hold discs so the cases i have would n't have to rattle around , but it 's a minor quibble
has nice compartments and very similar to a case logic carrying case i had for a # & # # ; laptop however , this was a little bit more flimsy on the padding especially the bottom part which i felt should be thicker since it does not have any other protection like an outside back compartment this does not really fit a # . # inch laptop - it is too snug i measured the case lengthwise , seam to seam , and it was only around # inches <unk> the extra bulge on the outer edge also , it has a very strong <unk> smell that does not want to go away and i 've tried laying it out under the sun to get rid of it with no success am returning this item
adequate for the task to carry the netbook , power cable , ac adapter plug and power brick interior padding not wonderful , but adequate the velcro tabs on the outside of the case for the exterior pocket needed additional tabs to provide a better closure once we put anything other than the power <unk> into it we also added more padding where the netbook is <unk> into the interior ok - and were we not interested in carrying a <unk> mouse vs using the netbook 's swipe pad , it would have been a rating of # instead of #
have one of these cases for a # . # acer netbook and its great ordered one for a lenovo s # touch and the fit was just too tight could get the laptop in the case , but it was a squeeze ordered a different case that would give me more room but , based on the case for the acer have to say these cases are durable and well worth the money only a three star because of the tight fit
- holds asus transformer infinity in the velcro strap <unk> pockets for <unk> - short shoulder strap -lrb- i 'm tall and the strap makes it awkward to carry at times due to it hanging above my waist when worn like a messenger bag
bought one of these for my wife 's asus vivobook # . # `` laptop it is a little bit roomy for this device , with lots of extra storage for the wall <unk> , and other accessories for this laptop , i would have prefer it to be a little smaller this will really protect against bumps and oops over a neoprene sleeve i would have liked to select a color for her that was more `` fun `` , but black was the only thing available at order time
this case is a very good value very nicely made , no junk here i bought this for a samsung nc # & # # ; net book which does fit on the snug side , but it does work very well for that model
as at least one other reviewer said , this did have a strong smell when i first got it now that i have had it for over a month or so i barely notice it i bought this for an asus x # e with an # . # inch screen the fit is a bit more snug that i thought it would be considering it is also supposed to fit a netbook with a # . # inch screen i would have also liked the outer pocket to be a bit roomier for the cost it is a bargain if it fits your device
good bag for my acer netbook could just use a little more padding i 'm not sure if my pc would be protected if it was accidentally bumped or dropped accidentally still an overall good
this case is perfect for my # . # asus laptop , it is a really nice quality case and with the straps , holds the laptop securely in place it protects and i like the outside pocket to hold cord i am really happy with it
we bought this case for our middle schooler to carry his netbook plus accessories to school it is working out very well for him he likes the padded , adjusted shoulder strap the outside pocket is great for and easily accessible he does not always treat his things & # # ; gently & # # ; and this case is holding up well
after reading other reviews i decided to order this and i am very happy i have a # . # acer netbook and it <unk> nicely inside i like that lays down and the whole side opens fully and has a velcro strap to hold my netbook in i do not care for the cases that you slide your laptop/netbook in through a single slash opening it has plenty of room for a mouse and the power cord very well constructed
this bag holds up well and looks great it is tiny just like the netbook i wish it had a little more room , but if you want to keep things compact , this is a great bag to go with
i bought a netbook and needed a case this one fit the bill - literally the netbook fits perfectly , with almost no wiggle room , which is good and straps in well there are numerous pockets to hold stuff , which is also good the one thing i would like -lrb- and probably could have found with some more looking - the internet is too big a place sometimes -rrb- is a slightly larger pocket for peripherals i do n't like wireless peripherals -lrb- i know i 'm in the minority here -rrb- and a netbook needs more than some -lrb- external dvd burner , speakers , etc -rrb- that 's my only complaint , and it really does n't apply to most people , so take it with a grain of salt
i got this case for my new asus # . # & # # ; laptop so i could carry it safe and sound it does that well i like that it 's got a shoulder strap
i bought this case for my new dell laptop computer and i love it it is perfect and the cord fits inside the case as well i like that it is small and not bulky because i also have to carry my purse and a diaper bag , not to mention my lunch bag i would recommend this to anyone who does n't like bulky bags
this is truly a very nice case the shoulder strap is padded and adjustable , while the primary compartment is very secure , and allows you to use your laptop while still held inside there are numerous pockets for accessories all in all , seems to be very functional . : -
although this laptop sleeve comes with a carrying strap , i found that it was ineffective as a stand-alone laptop bag simply because it did not fit the charger in it too well , it sorta did , but only if you did n't mind putting the charger next to the laptop and having a big bulge in the middle of the bag it basically fit my macbook perfectly , and nothing else unless it bulged i would have liked to see an additional pocket on the exterior for laptop accessories moreover , i knocked stars off my rating because i found the the vinyl exterior scratched too easily the scratch marks are very noticeable too but as a laptop sleeve , it appeared very sturdy , although a bit overkill if you are simply going to dump it into a backpack i imagine that this provides ample protection for your laptop if you put it in your suitcase for airline travel though
this case is a large as the macbook # `` and that 's it you ca n't fit anything else in it , except maybe a sheet of paper the size is # . # `` i can not fit a dell latitude e # in it it is a bit on the feminine side , with the wet look design on one side so i will probably give it to my daughter the padding on the inside seems sufficient as does the neoprene and vinyl outer shell it comes with a shoulder strap that can be removed the price is reasonable for this type of protection yet , i will continue to use my leather courier bag as my macbook case
excellent computer case it is very stylish and seems durable it has a nice cushion for my laptop my # inch laptop fits perfectly comfortably but , the ac adapter does not fit in the bag the case is easy to carry and is all you need to carry your computer another complaint is that the zipper tends to get stuck often
i use this as a laptop sleeve and a carry bag the removable strap means it can be useful both ways fits my macbook pro perfectly and is great to cart it around the powercord will not fit , but i did not expect it to if i want to carry both then i use a larger bag using this as just a sleeve for the macbook pro i have had a lot of compliments on the look of it too
i love it the acme ipod sleeve fits my # `` macbook perfectly just what i was looking for i also really like the design , creative yet formal another cool fact that someone might not know is that this laptop case can even be used to accommodate smaller notebooks -lrb- like my # `` msi wind -rrb- what i do is use me current # `` foam dust cover that came with my netbook and put that inside the acme made smart laptop sleeve my little netbook fits like a glove and as a plus , this allows for extra padding in case i were to drop it or bump into someone overall i rate this product # stars it 's priced right , made of quality material , and is even water resistant -lrb- although i wo n't test that last feature unless i have to
fits # . # inch apple computers nicely -lrb- not loose -rrb- would recommend . : the inside is made of a purple very soft fabric with some cushion the back of the sleeve is not the `` wet neoprene `` material it is regular mesh type nylon
note the shine on the upper left corner of the product photo the pattern side is very shiny like patent leather the design is a matte black , but the rest is shiny i think the bag is a little feminine i like it , but keep that in mind my white macbook fits great there is a little wiggle room , but no room for the adapter i like that i can attach the shoulder strap if i want a shoulder strap the inside is deep purple the sleeve is not skin tight , but i think it will still fit into a larger bag to protect the computer
love it and would buy again always get compliments from my friends only thing i would change would be putting the `` acme made `` on the back side and not the design side oh well , it 's still cute
i bought this for my wife to be able to use with her # macbook air # & # # ; it did n't fit at all , and we had to return it the strap was n't very durable looking and the overall feel of the material felt a little on the cheap side it 's so difficult to find a bag that holds the macbook air , and we thought this one would work it was simply too big for it
it is very stiff material when you store cables or other items in zippered pockets they stick out i thought it would be a better product did not meet my expectations
i bought this for my hp mini # it fits the # . # inch screen snuggly i can fit the power supply , cable , and a bluetooth mouse as well the ipod pocket is useless for my ipod classic , but might be ok for a nano i use it to hold a bluetooth <unk> and a usb memory stick i chose this case because i wanted a shoulder strap over all i like it and would recommend it to anyone who needs more than a slip case
i fit my # . # laptop in it without a problem it gets crowded once i add a slim external dvd burner and the laptop 's power supply cords the material and workmanship is excellent good for the price
this is a great little case just the right size for my netbook - nice tight fit storage compartments are very convenient it is also very lightweight i 've looked at many cases in stores and one come even close to this bag
love the look and feel of this case the # & # # ; macbook air fits snugly wish it was a little larger to help protect the corners went ahead ordered the # & # # ; for it but had to order solid black these cool colors in the # & # # ; were not available this is a very cool well made carrying case
here is why i love it small and rugged this is a real good case for a netbook and it really protects it i actually stick the whole case with the netbook in my backpack when travelling . if you are looking for a nice tough but still good looking bag this is the one
if you use a netbook this could be for you the case is well made and very spacious so you can take those extras you always need on the road you have room for your extra mouse , your external drive , net card , sd cards , pens , mp # , ear buds , power cord and ac adapter also comes with a handy shoulder strap and an outside pocket for your cell very handy and priced right
the other reviewers are correct it does look very good , have lots of pockets and you can adjust the strap <unk> the main compartment if divided into two , one for the computer and another for your stuff however the strap is adjusted by velcro ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! this means that my long hair is always getting caught -lrb- painfully so -rrb- in the velcro it is extremly annoying while a good quality bag , i do not recommend this bag because of its strap
nice looking in the picture but i think it looks a bit cheap in reality the strap is way too short if you want to wear it across your chest -lrb- i am # ' # `` -rrb- the strap can be extended by velcro but if you move to longest length , there is exposed velcro band that catches on clothing and everything else i am returning item
i bought this lap top bag for my # . # inch toshiba at first everything seem very nice but the very next day i found the zipper was not functioning i did n't return the item because i was already out of country for a while
this bag was roomy and colorful but i had to return because of function the shoulder strap is actually two separate pieces attached by velcro although my laptop is less than # pounds , the weight of it was too much so the strap never stayed securely this bag is good if you carry paper or other lightweight , <unk> valuables there are better ways to <unk> an adjustable strap that does n't leave the contents in <unk>
it stated out as a great bag after a year of use the backside of strap <unk> is coming off in little pieces that are peeling off i guess it was not meant to last a year i have a photo that posted btw , i use this bag every work day
bag seems really nice - good pockets , great padding for a laptop , nice design however , the strap is held together with velcro although it has a extra loop that seems secure , i did n't really want to risk my work computer with that just holding it up over time -lrb- i find that pet hair and fuzzies build up in anything velcro in my house , making it less `` sticky `` . plus , to wear it lower on my hip , there was exposed <unk> and loop - which i have ruined many a sweater on had to return
it 's ok , but had n't thought the fabric would stay so stiff so long , or weigh as much the padding is great if you 're <unk> about bumping your ipad or laptop , but it 's a chunky bag and could be made more lightweight the wide strap is great but not very adjustable i 'm # ' # , and wish i could have # more inches of length when i wear it cross-body style
i bought this for a overseas trip it was big enough to hold almost everything i needed yet easily slipped under the seat in front of me or in the over head compartment lived up to our expectations
i have a large toshiba satellite laptop , so finding shoulder bags that are pretty and not <unk> is difficult my computer will not fit into the special extra padded laptop holder in the main pocket because the padding on the sides makes it slightly too small -lrb- the bag dimensions do not take this into account -rrb- my laptop does fit nicely right next to that pocket and i can use the padded pocket to hold notebooks etc so they do n't scratch or rub the computer i 've also stored my husband 's tablet computer in the padded pocket and my laptop in the main pocket for transport and that worked well the front pockets are nice for holding pens etc . the shoulder strap is velcro , but it is a tight hold and has a security strap that runs across the velcro to keep it from <unk> the shoulder strap is wide , but at no point is there any extra padding for shoulder comfort the strap is long and adjustable , great for me since i am # ' # `` and like a longer strap so i can put it across my chest while riding my bike overall , a good product nice to look at , easy to pack and carry
my laptop does n't fit in the padded part of the bag , but it fits in the main compartment i use the padded sleeve to store cds and any extra cables i may have very durable and stylish
i use this bag for school it has a great place for my laptop and a separate area for my books which keeps the laptop protected great pockets for pens and pencils , etc . easy and comfortable to carry and it looks cute : -rrb- just wish it had more outside pockets for water bottle , cell phone , keys , etc .
the messenger bag it great i love the detail on the front the laptop pocket is a little snug , but it keeps the computer from getting bumped around there is enough space in the main pocket for a text book and a couple of notebooks the little pockets come in handy too for the remote mouse i bought and some other school supplies
i got this for my daughter who was going back to college and she needed a bag for her computer and books she says it works great for her and she likes the design
the case is great it hold my laptop , school books , pencils , and everything else it is comfortable , stylish , and many people love my bag my only gripe is that the case does not fit my # . # in laptop in the protective sleeve one reviewer mentioned that it would fit my # . # in , and it does , just not in the space for the laptop itself
i used this bag to carry a laptop from alaska to the east coast and back except for having to remove it going through airport security , it was really nice it has all kinds of pockets , which makes it convenient my laptop measures # . # inches wide and , in my opinion , it fit too snugly in the compartment designed for it i was embarrassed trying to remove it , but in my travels , i never saw one as attractive in all fairness , i should mention that my hands are not as strong , due to arthritis if yours are not , i would strongly recommend this one maybe mine just needs to be used more often
very well made bag - this one is far more sturdy than my last laptop bag which cost # times as much the interior is very roomy and it can fit my laptop , my lunch , an umbrella , a book and has compartments for my cell phone , wallet and pens my only hesitation is that it looks a bit young with the canvass material and the large company logo in the front if you need to look very professional , then this is n't the bag for you but if you can be a bit more casual , then this is a fantastic choice
this <unk> bag has been great for me it 's got ample space and plenty of little pockets for me to store those needed items i normally have to dig around in my purse for i 'm glad i made this purchase
bag is perfect for work or fun it is dressy enough to pair with business casual or can be paired with jeans too storage is ok - hard to close completely is you put more than just your laptop and a couple of tablets
i did n't really need this big heavy duty bag for my ipad - but i can put my entire purse items plus shopping items in it , also you ca n't buy a good quality purse these days for this unbelievable price so , this beautiful bag will <unk> for me for a long time glad i 'll have it for traveling , too
this bag is attractive , sturdy and easy to carry i can put my fairly large laptop in one compartment , folders or books in the other , and keep keys , money , etc . in the outer zippered pockets
bought this laptop bag for my daughter who is a freshman in college this year she really liked the styling , i was of course more concerned by how the bag would protect the laptop , on both accounts it has been terrific and the price i felt was very reasonable i would definitely recommend
love the bag it 's pretty , has plenty of space for my laptop and <unk> the padding is perfect for my laptop the best part is the style of the bag really helps distribute the weight of the contents so the weight is not all in my shoulder very happy with the bag
the lightweight but sturdy materials make it foldable yet durable enough room and support for my laptop and my tablet adjustable straps and a nice design add a little flair , it is my favorite bag to take to work
i admit , i ordered this laptop bag based largely on its looks ... what i have found is that it is great looking as well as strong and functional it regularly carries a lot of weight , the seams are well constructed , and a year later it is still in great shape
i bought this laptop messenger bag for my daughter to take to college with her and she absolutely loves it it looks great , and has all the space she needs to carry both her laptop , and additional items that she needs for class there is plenty of really nice padding for protection
really like this bag looks just like it does on the screen nice padding on the inside and extra pockets for phone and other devices , pens , pencils i even squeeze in a water bottle and snacks and it 's cute
i love this bag , it was very inexpensive and looks like it cost a lot i carried my laptop through the airport and it was stylish , easy to handle , love it
my daughter uses this for college and it is all she needs for books , phone wallet everything ! ! ! ! she loves it and it is easy to handle on <unk>
i am an adult going back to college and wanted a bag that was not so business like but also did n't look like i was trying to be # again i think this was a good choice i love it it is exactly what it said it was my laptop fit in perfect along with my # notebooks and folders for class the front pockets are perfect for all my pens , wallet , gum , keys and such it is well made and has nothing wrong with it the material on the outside is very easy to clean ... you can just wipe it with a damp cloth i am very happy with my purchase
i am a university student and i bought this bag in order to carry my laptop , graphics tablet and other <unk> items such as folders and books it handles everything extremely well , including carrying my mobile phone and purse -lrb- what <unk> refer to as a ` wallet , ' rather than a handbag -rrb- in the slotted front pocket my ipod fits well in the very front pocket which easily allows the earbud cord to come out through the zipper , which is useful for times when i wear outfits which lack pockets i recommend this bag for anyone who wants a good mix of style and functionality
my daughter already had the laptop , but had never gotten a case for it being in college , she said carrying it in her backpack was not ideal , really needed a proper laptop case case it very attractive , and seems very well made although this is n't a & # # ; hard & # # ; case , neither is it completely & # # ; soft & # # ; it has a fair amount of structure , so it should protect a laptop very well it 's good
i am extremely happy with with my bag . it is perfect for carrying my laptop and/or books it is very durable and the strap is comfortable as well i am quite confident that it will last me through my college years and then some
this laptop bag is just as pictured and has a nice padded pocket area for my apple <unk> the computer separate from books and other stuff in the bag the padded section of the strap makes it comfortable and easy to carry all day -- i have received compliments on my bag , it has a nice hip look * ! * <unk> . this laptop bag * ! * robin ~ !
this is a great bag , and very good looking sadly , i was n't able to enjoy it for long because my daughter liked it so much , she ` borrowed ' it to take to <unk> with her , and she wo n't be back until december that is a real compliment to the bag
i love this bag it has held up very well i have had it now for almost a year the product was shipped in a very timely manner the details on the bag give it the extra flair my college daughter just loves carrying to class it helps with her load of books . durable , strong and excellent
