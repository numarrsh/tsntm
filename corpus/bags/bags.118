have had this backpack for a couple weeks now and have had an opportunity to put it to some real world use and abuse overall this is a great camera bag it holds my canon xti , separate flash , a # mm lense , a # mm lense , a # mm lense and the kit lense that came with the camera plus tons of batteries , memory cards , etc . it carries and handles it all nicely i can do without all the extra straps -lrb- for the tripod , which i wo n't use much -rrb- but i 'm sure they come in handy for those that need them actually all of the excess straps are removable so that 's probably what i should do i wish the canon logo would have been a little more inconspicuous as it currently screams `` expensive camera and equipment within ! i recommend this bag to anyone on a budget looking for a well designed , quality bag
this is the perfect bag for me i am <unk> an amateur and have a couple favorite lens it is not too big , but has enough room for my things i carry # lenses , -lrb- one on the camera -rrb- and my flash , and still have all the other pockets available
i 've had this back pack for about # months and it 's great very light weight , yet heavily padded to protect your gear i currently have a canon xsi , with kit lens , # mm lens , and my new additions is in the mail -lrb- # mm # . # , yay -rrb- it has plenty of room for accessories and i 've made a small modification to the back pack to very easily carry my tripod next to the top carrying handle i added a strap with a buckle , so i can just put my tripod in the very front pocket -lrb- vertically -rrb- and just buckle it in makes it very easy to get the tripod in and out with out having to tighten any straps i also carry my little sony <unk> camera in this bag with two chargers , a couple extra batteries and a flashlight i 'm very happy with this backpack and i 'm looking forward to filling it up go get one now , great price
my wife and i had been looking for a camera bag for our new canon rebel for several months both of our parents use this exact bag for their cameras and love it my mother in law is a professional photographer and highly recommended the bag my wife bought it as a surprise christmas gift for me i am amazed by the room this bag offers it keeps everything organized and protected , yet easy to access overall a great buy
one of the best items that i have bought it is comfortable easy to carrier and give you the freedom to move around known that you wo n't forget where you left it since you always have it with you i will highly recomend this
since receiving this backpack -- very prompt delivery , too , i must add -- i have thoroughly enjoyed using it for all of my photographic expeditions it is a cinch to open , organize , find , fill -- you name it the design features a side panel that unzips to lift , exposing the contents in a way that makes digging for those filters a thing of the past would i replace it with another of the same style in a heartbeat
good quality and plenty of space for all kinds o stuff as well as places to externally attach a tent and or tripods certainly big enough for my d # and a few lenses plus all the chargers etc .
well , it 's a backpack and it carries all your camera stuff if that 's what you 're looking for , then i 'd definitely recommend this not much else to say , really it does exactly what its supposed to do , and does it well seems like very nice quality materials , and put together strong and sturdy i have an extra battery grip for my digital rebel which makes it a little chunkier and , therefore , more awkward to fit in - but nothing <unk> or unusable ca n't find anything wrong with it , and it works perfectly for what i need - so i ca n't give it any less <unk> the full five stars
i had been toting a regular book bag around with my camera and lens i think this bag is great its sturdy , has lots of storage and i have received several compliments on it
i bought this backpack two years ago to carry all my camera gear , and have been very happy with it i carry my # d , three lenses , and all of my accessories in it , including a couple of books when i travel the quality is very good ; i 've put a lot of miles on it , including mountain <unk> and rainy trips to new york , and it still looks and works great i highly recommend this backpack the only consideration i would offer to someone thinking about this is that with the canon logo <unk> displayed on it , it makes it obvious that there is probably some expensive gear in it
i absolutely love this backpack have tried a variety of other items to schlep around my camera and equipment this takes the cake it 's very light , can be configured to hold myriad items , is of good quality , and even fits my <unk> little body it more than fulfilled my expectations i would highly recommend it
i like it so <unk> <unk> put # lenses and <unk> <unk> <unk> it is little big then it will more <unk> wish to put my laptop also in <unk> it s not <unk> because of the less
this is a great pack for the price most aftermarket backpacks are over $ # but at this price nothing can compare plenty of room for my meager setup so might not be the thing for professionals but for me it 's perfect until i get more stuff
i am so pleased with this camera bag after purchasing a few others only to be disappointed i have finally found the perfect bag for me i have room for my canon xsi body with the # lens attached i also have room for # other lens , my flash ring , extension tubes , lens hood & cleaning kit i can expand the front of the bag to accomodate my # lens as well i love the fact the bag opens from the top thus avoiding the chance for the lenses to fall out i rate this bag as excellent
the deluxe canon camera bag is really a great value it is sturdy and well built it has lots of space for your camera and lenses i currently have two camera 's in the bag - it is that big the interior has adjustable , movable walls so it can configured or <unk> as needed the material is very durable i would recommed this bag to anyone looking for a camera bag
this canon backpack is pretty much the best solution i could find and the price was n't bad also just some minor issues w / the velcro but it 's minor to me and deserves # stars ! i can put so much stuff in this bag w / room to spare ! good buy !
this backpack is very well made and user friendly i has plenty of space for your camera gear and is good for a <unk> bag only improvements i would recomend is a computer compartment
this backpack is an excellent addition to my equipment list it allows me to carry most of what i need to shoot with in addition , using a back pack versus a shoulder bag allows me to carry my equipment , shoot various shots , and move around freely i would recommend this backpack for anyone who is looking for the perfect camera bag
everyone who 's seen this bag thinks `` wow , you spent a pretty penny on that ! well , they are wrong , this camera bag is very affordable , and stylish offers great protection ... and on rainy days , i 'll add in a trash bag liner or something comparable to add that extra safety measure
i was very pleased with the back pack style camera bag i have small children , so for me it is very easy to put it on my back and still have my hands free i was able to move dividers to make all my lenses fit my camera stays put and is well protected i like to leave a lens on my camera body for those times when you need to grab your camera for a quick shot i have the canon # d and it fit very well in the case
i took this backpack with me to <unk> i put two digital slr cameras , one with lens on , four other lenses , an external strobe and a computer in the pack with no problem i left the computer behind but the rest of the gear made the climb to the top of <unk> picchu <unk> <unk> picchu and back down with no trouble i like the fact there are two added straps , one around your waist and another around your chest to stabilize the pack while you 're climbing without those , the pack would shift around and cause difficulty while hanging off the edge of a rock ledge it 's good gear
i bought this backpack mainly because of a few key points : excellent price for the value , fits dslrs with battery grip or larger pro models , fits # mm with lens hood reverse mounted on it very flexible configuration options with velcro internal compartments , well put together overall , and many pockets for your gear i ca n't say anything bad about this bag , it 's very nice all around
i received this bag and was able to fit all my photo equipment in with ease , previously i carried around two shoulder bags i 'm not quite sure why some reviewers complain about the size of the bag , it seems just right for my medium body frame i do however agree that the tripod holder could be positioned on the side and not on the bottom of the bag however this would <unk> the access to the side pockets which i 've used to store misc . supplies and spare batteries in conclusion , buy this bag
i was wanting a bag for my camera that i could take pretty much everywhere i came across this backpack , and i was skeptical at first , but after reading the reviews i was excited to buy it this has space for my rebel t # i , two lenses , my old <unk> digital camera , but still has room to grow i like all the compartments this has because it lets me store other things in them i carried my jacket in the front zipped area , sunglasses in the side velcro pocket , and some <unk> <unk> in the open air bungee pocket this arrived on time and works very well i do n't know what i would do without it when going out with my camera
there 's more than enough room in this bag for a couple of cameras and lens , a couple more lenses , and a flash - and that 's just in the main compartment it 's not built to hold a laptop , but my # -inch macbook fits nicely -lrb- almost perfectly -rrb- in the zippered compartment next to the main compartment the only drawback for the notebook is that the compartment is not padded on the outside there 's plenty of room for other accessories , including cf cards , a light meter , remote control button , etc . definitely worth the money
this product is well worth the money and there is more room than i need for both of my cameras and the accessories the fact that you can adjust all the compartments with velcro is a very nice asset i 'd definately suggest it as i am very happy with it and the speed at which i received it
you can spend a lot more money for such a high quality bag large but not too large holds all of my # lenses , and the body , and a flash , and more
this backpack is sturdy , easily adjusted for fit , and is well padded in the most desirable places i have had mine in numerous locations , and find that the <unk> seal very well and keep the pack sealed under very <unk> and dusty conditions
i use this to carry my camera body , charger , cleaning kit , and three lenses ; it carries all of this nicely , but i 'm not sure i can fit much more it has pockets that hold # memory cards i enjoy the adjustable compartments , and everything feels secure it also has a good fit and does n't bounce against my back as i walk the shoulder straps are a bit & # # ; thick & # # ; but this does help keep the straps from cutting into shoulders
many bags just hold stuff this bag organizes all of your equipment easily there is plenty of space for several lenses , flash the backpack style is perfect -- easy to carry and when you open the pack everything is easy to find right away
i truly love this bag ... it has room for everything i was using # bags and am able to use only this one <unk> is so much room also i own a nikon camera , but still use this cannon bag ! !
this is a great bag for storing , transporting your gear great for keeping all your gear together very nice and comfortable shoulder straps if you are going to be changing lens while running or climbing walls , look for something else if you are traveling and need to carry your gear this bag hold alot and it is easy on the shoulders
the first one was stolen -lrb- fortunately i carried my camera -rrb- i liked this bag a lot so , i bought the same bag again i put canon # and canon t # i both cameras have lens attached also i put a large reflector inside and put a small reflector outside of the bag all fit well in this small bag i could put one more extra lens if it 's not big zoom lens side pockets are too shallow to contain a bottle of water for example i rarely use the side pockets , though
received this product recently and am very happy with product will be giving to a friend as a present and hope they will appreciate is as they hike alot and this will protect the camera now
this bag is awesome has a place for everything and holds so much all the pockets and little places to put things is great and the inside compartments are moveable so that you can adjust to different sized lenses and cameras i would n't trade this for anything the straps are adjustable and it 's comfortable to wear as well
thinking of this bag really nothing bad comes to mind build quality is excellent , it 's very comfortable to carry , good space and basically you can arrange space in many ways fits all my stuff neatly , i do n't have much to carry and basically i 'm using about # % for camera equipment , i also carry my gps and other personal stuff in the bag i highly recommend this product got it for # bucks ! !
i can carry my camera with any lens attached and have the others at my finger tips if i want to change the lens a nice product and i have recommended it to a couple of friends that have a regular camera bag
i purchased this bag for my wife and she loves it the only thing she did was <unk> the zippers when they are fully zipped so they would n't come <unk> good product would up
this bag is very well designed you can slip your dslr right in the top with the lens pointing down or if you have a large flash and you are using a smaller lens , then you can put it in with the flash going down so all you have to do is unzip a little and pull out the camera and it 's ready to go there are also many extra pockets that are easy to get to i carry everything that i own for my camera and a few diapers , wipes , change of baby clothes and more it 's even comfortable what more can i say , i love this bag
this is a great backpack there is plenty of space to carry lenses and other items i 'm very pleased with this purchase great price at $ # . # when i showed this backpack to a friend , he went online and ordered one for himself
got frustrated with the standard canon case for my new eos on a trip - not very user friendly for carrying and protecting your gear especially with airlines hassles with carry-on items the backpak is easy to carry and i know my gear is safe and easily accessible
if you are looking for a larger gadget bag that is easy to take on the road this one if for you it has the room for a strobe , two camera bodies and several lenses plus accessories there are plenty of straps and pockets for you to load down with other gadgets or stuff for a hike
i was skeptical about ordering a bag this big for our dslr since i only have # extra lenses right now , but after receiving this bag it is such a nice thing to have we can now carry our hd canon camcorder as well as the dslr and all the accessories and mini tripod all in one bag safely without anything bumping together and getting damaged the layout is very well done and has just the right size compartments for just about everything you can need to carry with you related to cameras they are also adjustable in case you need to put something slightly larger in one of the spots after years of different cameras and different bags to go along with them i have finally found one that i will be hanging onto for a long time to come
i had read some of the issues with this backpack ; but i have yet to experience any of them i have found this a very good design and i am using the backpack # - # times a week a very good buy for the price
my husband bought me the canon eos digital xti for my birthday last year with two lenses i needed a secure way to carry those lenses as well as my <unk> and camera on vacation i had been searching local camera stores as well as the internet and i found this backpack available on amazon i just used it on our trip to washington dc it was great the padding can be <unk> to fit <unk> lens or camera that needed to be carried at that time the backpack was easily accessible and i could put my camera in when i needed to and change lenses fairly quickly i put the weight in the bottom section of the backpack but , again , the compartments can be changed instantly for personal preference
i 've been looking around for a camera bag for about a month and decided to purchase this bag it is a great size - fits all my current stuff and much room for my future accessories very good quality
backpack is well organized and holds # lenses , a flash and a camera body several pockets to put additional items like cleaning kits , filters , reference materials etc . convenient loops for tripod or <unk> make it ideal for <unk> well insulated also to protect against damage
this bag looks small from outside but it has a lot of compartment and can easily holds # dslr not to mention the price i find it really useful with the strap in the bottom to hold the tripod
i love this packback it makes carrying all of the camera accessories that i use easy as can be its less cumbersome than carrying a regular camera bag it has padded <unk> compartments for most of the accessories that you would need for a <unk> photo shoot its also lightweight
i use this bag to hold my <unk> kit fits camera with lens and room for # more lenses i have a # mm , # mm , # mm , # mm , and # mm and all accessories no other backpack i found held as much
this is a really great bag for the price it is the second one i have purchased i carry two dx bodies and six lenses in the first one the second one was purchased for a fx body ; bigger body but still fit , along with the four lenses
i got this bag for a trip to hawaii the bag is not big big but big enough formy # , # , flash light , small camcorder , # camera body -lrb- one attached and one body by itself -rrb- , all <unk> divider is not sturdy and material is not excellent but has many side pockets because the dark body color , it is not noticeable this bag is compact enough to carry around i recommend this bag
i bought this backpack for a trip and it was perfect i had looked for a camera bag that would hold my canon digital rebel xt with my zoom lens attached in a downward position at a price that would n't break me at the last minute i attached a vertical battery grip to my camera and it fit perfectly in the position i wanted it has # <unk> zippered pockets in the front and a pocket with a flap on each side of the pack that holds a cell phone or battery charger lots of room left inside for other lens or equipment and loops in different places for your monopod or tripod it weighed over twelve pounds when i got it packed and i wore it for a week with no problem this is no lightweight pack and i would buy it again at twice the price
i bought the canon # d to replace my film eos rebel my old bag was n't getting the click i shopped around and what i was looking at was very pricey -lrb- $ # . # and up -rrb- i saw this case on <unk> with some great pics and reviews it was priced reasonably i have a flash and # lenses plus the camera with the <unk> # and it 's lens so far it 's working out just great have room for all the chargers , cables , extra batteries , etc .
this bag provides all of the space that any <unk> photographer could need and a good basic adjustable design i am amazed that something of this quality can be provided for such an affordable price
i decided to go with this backpack style carrier and it was a great decision i have n't used it to it 's full potential as of yet , but the backpack is comfortable -lrb- even for a big guy like me , # lbs / # ' # `` -rrb- it 's got plenty of pockets and it 's really customizable it 's simple to use and easy to carrier only drawback is that it takes a little bit of time to unpack if you want to do some quick snap shots and i wish it were easier to take of canon logos off of it i do n't want to attract and tempt anyone to take my stuff overall , great value i 'm a beginning photographer and i definitely recommend this
this is the best investment i have made to protect my camera and lenses nicely built with enough space to carry my camera , three lenses and my <unk> amazon rocks , love to buy from this site , great customer service
this is a very nice camera bag for a good price it holds many lenses and up to # cameras i love the tripod holder as well definately worth the money

how could you go wrong with a $ # backpack made specifically to carry digital cameras i use it on all my trips and it has never failed me once the pouches and pockets are very handy people complain about there being no protection on the top where the camera is , but like everything else , if you 're careful it it will be ok two thumbs up for me
i 've owned this bag for # years , and have purchased a variety of additional camera bags of all sizes ranging from <unk> packs for light travel to full size luggage i keep going back to this one as one of my active choices because it holds so much , has so many pockets , and is so flexible in terms of how i can configure it currently i use it to carry # <unk> , # dozen batteries , four different sets of remote <unk> , a huge assortment of attachments and <unk> for my <unk> , filters , <unk> , etc . , etc . my bag is stuffed and weighs around # lbs and i haul it everywhere i think i 'd need my flashes it 's not for back packing and does n't have the greatest ergonomic design , but it does the job of holding and hauling , and i love it

this back pack is great for all of your camera needs camera equipment is tucked away in adjustable spaces and well protected plenty of room and space for other items such as wallets , keys and other necessities that you carry on you easy to carry as a bag , over the shoulder or on your back
i ca n't really add anything positive to say about this bag that others have n't already stated better my one <unk> to it was to remove the canon tags to <unk> theft the cloth flap on the front lower right is pretty straight <unk> cut off with a sharp knife the larger canon logo in the center top can be removed by prying it apart with a flat head screwdriver the logo is aluminum with a larger plate washer underneath the fabric there are two heavy prongs securing it that you 'll need to pry apart and straighten the washer under the fabric can either be left -lrb- if it does n't bother you -rrb- , or you can cut a small slit in the fabric from the inside and slide it out two small holes will remain that you can cover up with a pin or patch

this camera bag hold almost all of my equipment - everything i need for any given trip i can even carry my tripod the only thing that is inconvenient about it is that you have to take it off and lay it flat to get anything out of it i use it to carry all my things when i travel , but when going on photo excursions i bring a smaller bag so that i can pull my equipment out with out all the hassle
used the backpack now for a few years keeps things in their place and accessible at all times sturdy and safe way to transport what i need for a <unk>
i like this camera bag and ordered another because i already using one this last one broke at the top seams near the zipper it <unk> the nylon and the inner sponge insulation started to come apart i find this camera bag the best storage and keeps the camera , lens , etc . in a dry and safe
i have had this bag for over # months and no sign of breaking i guess with the few mix reviews i have been lucky so far i will say i am a bit weary if i leave the zipper open a little at the top easy fix is zip the bag to one side all the way to the bottom and it feels extra secure i feel the bag provides adequate protection from the sides , the front has very limited protection other than the firm padding dividers inside i feel it protects my <unk> camera equipment pretty well , but i may purchase a new bag to protect my equipment more once i upgrade a few more pieces great price for the bag
had this bag for a few weeks and just love it it is just the right size for my canon xti with three other lenses and a flash light plus a video camera it is practical and well made for the price paid for it

bag is well padded and holds more gear than any `` normal `` camera bag two cameras , two flashes , and # or even # lenses ... about double what i could carry in my bag ... and that was n't even comfortably too bad they do n't make it in other logos . ; - -rrb-
well made and very practical solution to the <unk> problem of carrying camera equipment without the nuisance of a cumbersome <unk> very good protection for expensive camera and lenses and all at a good price - highly recommended
this backpack holds all of my cameras , lenses , memory cards and accessories with room to spare it is so much nicer to have this than my regular camera bag i take a lot of landscape photos and it is much easier to have my hands free while climbing up <unk> or <unk> to get the perfect shot i highly recommend this bag
compared to the $ # - $ # camera bags out there . this is a quality bargain fits my canon # d , # mm zoom lens , plus other accessories with room to spare and not <unk> at all
i was inbetween this and the similar amazon branded bag , and after looking around at stores and online i decided on the canon bag based off of price and size this bag retails at best buy for around $ # - $ # , and i think i paid around $ # on amazon which is an awesome deal the bag is very sturdy with plenty of movable dividers , and straps to keep things secure and organized its very spacious inside with plenty of room for extra lenses , bodies , point & shoots , or <unk> else you want to stuff in it if you are like me and just getting into slr photography this bag will give you plenty of room to grow with a price that wont take away from your lens budget

christmas gift win my husband has about # lenses , a body , a large battery pack and lots of little doodads this fits it all he had a smaller backpack before that was bursting at the seams , so it was time for an upgrade it 's smaller than you 'd think , but it fits a lot
i was so <unk> when it arrived the bag is too good for that price it has protected pads on all sides , bottom and top strong built materials with water resist coating and its alot smaller than my school bag but has room for all my camera gears plus a very nice metalic canon logo i should have bought it right in the first time ...
canon deluxe photo backpack # eg for canon eos slr cameras -lrb- black with greenish accent this backpack is very well padded , with velcro pads that can be moved about to keep any size camera and its accessories safe i found room for both my film and my digital slr bodies , a flash and several lenses there are also several places for storage of accessories , batteries , a tripod , etc . it seems almost infinitely expandable i also found it very lightweight and easy to carry for those photographers with sore backs , this truly can make the difference between a great day of shooting and a miserable one for the times when i want all my equipment with me , i ca n't think of a better way to carry it i highly recommend this camera backpack
