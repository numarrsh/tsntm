the bag is a great color and it has a great design it 's perfect for my # . # `` laptop , and it even has room for my lap desk that the computer sits on it has extra pockets for all the little gadgets i need to carry with me the inside is a little padded to protect everything , and the slide through fastener on the front makes it safer from pickpockets sturdy , adjustable strap makes the bag that much more comfortable and convenient to sling over your shoulder they have other great colors for the bag too i would absolutely recommend
i used this for my black # `` macbook sadly , it was tough to get the laptop in and out of the case though i already had issues with my cd drive , it got more damaged from having to squeeze the laptop out of the this sleeve luckily i had plans to replace the laptop - but never buying a neoprene sleeve of this design again
this sleeve perfectly fits the # `` macbook pro -lrb- aluminum body . super snug , the computer does n't slip around inside , and a gorgeous color it 's not going to protect against heavy impact very well , but will do a very good job of protecting the laptop from scratches and small dents makes me completely comfortable with tossing my computer into by backpack to go to classes
it fits nicely and protects the macbook well i have n't had it for very long , but it appears to be well made and looks like it will hold up well
two sided macbook pro # `` case i do n't like the case with zipper becuase i 'm lazy . = pit 's been almost an year and i 'm still happy with it i washed it in laundry machine once and it was fine . =
the quality seem very poor when you compared to the brenthaven same model in # inch -lrb- which i bought about # year ago and that one made in <unk> -rrb- if i knew it was made in china i never think about to buy it amazon should clearly tell the customer up front about where the product was make i am willing to pay more in order to get the product made in <unk>
so i recently purchased the # `` version and love everything about it - particularly the craftsmanship the # `` is a bit too small for me , so i ordered the # `` version thinking that it would be the same while it is very good , the attention to detail does not seem to be there do n't get me wrong , very good , but i am returning
i got two of these for sales people in our office they had smaller laptop bag before and complained that they did n't have enough room for their files i hear no such complaints now ! =-rrb- they enjoy the pockets and large amounts of space for files the file separator in it is not quite as nice as i thought it would be but overall the bag <unk> a b + to a - in my book has good laptop protection and tons of space durability wise , ca n't say yet but looks like it would hold up good
i was looking for a ballistic nylon bag for my macbook pro # inch and this one did the trick it matches my other ballistic nylon bags well it has a nice storage compartment for the computer itself , well padded the bag itself is lightweight and still protects the machine nicely the zippers are well constructed , the only thing i wish they would have done is a double zipper on the computer pocket instead of a single zipper but that 's very picky ... they have double zippers elsewhere that work well and the single zipper for the computer pocket is very large and moves easily all in all , a very nice bag , i would gladly buy a second one one and recommend to a friend you ca n't beat the value of the bag for the price on amazon
pretty good bag , a lot of storage - holds all my junk very durable material loosely holds my macbook pro # `` , only seems to protect sides would be nice if there was an add-on sleeve that would better protect mac laptops my last brenthaven bag had much better protection , top/bottom , sides and front/back
first i own two other brenthaven bags and have been <unk> impressed by their quality and longevity my brenthaven notebook backpack has been used every day for # years and it 's still going strong the backpacks have been through countless airplane flights and been subjected to nearly daily commuting by motorcycle but i found that a backpack is not the optimal form factor when wearing a suit coat so decided to get a briefcase my previous two brenthaven bags were made in <unk> , washington so i admit to being disappointed to see the nearly ubiquitous `` made in china `` label on this briefcase but the briefcase seems to be made of the very same ballistic nylon that my two backpacks were made from , <unk> well for durability there are lots of pockets and compartments ; i found no trouble finding a place for my entire `` traveling load `` . all of the zippers but one have two zipper pulls so you can place both zipper pulls in the center of the zipper when the bag is closed and use both hands to quickly open the zipper but for some <unk> reason the zipper for the notebook compartment has just one zipper pull which means that this zipper can only be closed in a single position , with the zipper pull at one end of the bag maybe i will eventually get used to this , but for now , the negative transfer is irritating at the least
many inside pockets room for plenty of stuff it <unk> had a problem with impact and not with water brenthaven is fantastic as a company the life time guarantee is great i had my shoulder strap destroyed because i usually carry many things and the weight is big and they immediately replaced it with a new one i am thinking to buy a backpack and it will be brenthaven
i am very pleased with this laptop tote - a friend had recommended the brand as durable and functional - two criteria most important to me if there was one ` complaint ' it is that the product was way <unk> for shipping while i do not think the shipping charges were <unk> i do feel that smaller packaging would be ` <unk> ` otherwise , well done and thank you
if you have a # -inch macbook pro this is the case you want i absolutely love it it fits everything i have and has room for more it has a perfect place for everything i also carry # lacie # gb drives in <unk> cases and this bag has a spot that seems like it was made for this purpose get this bag you will not be disappointed
i bought this as a christmas present for my husband who is very particular and he loved it it has great padding for his laptop plus holds a lot of other things it has done a great job of protecting his computer
very good bag only downside is that it is n't water proof the bottom of the bag got wet and my contents in the front pocket got wet computer was fine but not certain that will always be the case otherwise bag is great
i purchased the brenthaven # -inch <unk> iii to house documents , portable hard drives , and a brand new macbook pro very simply , it is the best computer bag that i have owned with excellent stitching and rugged yet elegant construction , it is a steal at its current price point numerous compartments allow me to carry just about anything that i need on trips of both business and pleasure i hardly go anywhere without it
when i ordered this , i was a little concerned if it would fit my new hp # `` laptop lo and behold , it fits perfectly i have used brenthaven cases for several years as a `` road warrior `` they have always been terrific with protection , quality construction , features , etc . this case is no different , but they have improved it in the two areas that were a little <unk> , weight and depth the new case is much lighter than my old ones and it is much thinner , making it easier to carry a great computer case , which i would recommend without reservation -lrb- except for those like my daughter who would want it fashionable -rrb-
i had this case for about # weeks now i really like it i had a different one from brenthaven for # years but it was a bit bulky i like this one because it is thin and light
i bought this item several years ago and i still have that version it held up through a lot of use , but just got old i purchased another one to replace it , and i ca n't believe the difference in quality between what they used to make and what they make now within a month or so of use the handle on the top of the bag broke on the older version that never happened -lrb- still have that one and the handle is going strong -rrb- i do n't know what happened but this is not the same item they used to make i would n't recommend this the handle is an important part of the backpack for me , because when i am not using it as a backpack , i use the handle to carry it around -lrb- when not over my shoulders -rrb- kind of <unk> as this is a nice looking item
received the bag and within a couple of weeks the latch fell off now the strap on top is ripping at the seams tried contacting manufacture because it has a `` lifetime warranty `` , but after several attempts by me i have gotten no response bottom line do <unk> buy poorly made and if something happens they do n't seem to stand behind their
i purchased an older model of this bag that did not have a metal marker that indicated it was for her this bag does though it is not obvious by the picture
unfortunately this backpack and its straps are made out of vinyl this was my favorite backpack of all i liked that it was vertical and light weight but unfortunately it is made of vinyl and only lasted about # months i was able to find a leather repair store and they put an ugly patch and stitches to fix it ; it cost $ # hopefully i can get a little mileage but i 'm not holding my breath it is in perfect condition except for the top shoulder straps i could n't recommend this backpack to anyone
i chose this bag because it looked pretty sleek in the image i also was not able to determine the material from the product description , so i went to the manufacturer 's web site unfortunately the makers specs which included leather was not what the bag was made of -lrb- so it makes sense they chose to not include -rrb- the bag arrived on time , in good shape and well packaged but in reality although the bag had a good looking design , it was pretty chunky , materials were not great , and i would have been uncomfortable using it for business had no problem returning it , very smooth process
looks like high quality and very fashionable the only thing is that it 's a little too big for my # `` laptop . wish it was shorter but other than that , i am very happy with this bag
when my computer tote broke , i decided to try this backpack for my macbook pro i think that the computer is much better protected as the padding is really cushy and i do n't have to use a sleeve anymore the design of the backpack is nice , but the material is obviously <unk> i also miss the `` professional `` look because it 's a backpack and i also miss the ability for my bag to be a carry all it 's on the slim side although i have been able to slide in my ipad # or my mini-laptop in however , i can only carry a few small extras which usually include the cords and mouse and a small wristlet as a backpack , it 's comfortable to wear and so far , after a months use , the bag shows no wear overall , nice backpack , but not a business bag
this case is awesome first week i took it on a business trip to seattle and got a complement from a fellow woman executive staying at the hotel i was in i knew i made the right choice it was bigger than i anticipated but it organizes everything very nicely straps are comfy too
my doctor told me i could n't carry a briefcase anymore because of the damage it was doing to my shoulder , i would have to get a backpack i looked everywhere for something that was professional , not too heavy and could be carried like a briefcase or worn as a backpack this product met all my needs , it is good looking , padded for comfort , has pockets for all my things and is light i have gotten numerous comments on it at work i couldnt be more pleased
i was having such bad shoulder and back pain from carrying my messenger bag and felt like a large tote would cause the same issues -lrb- especially when traveling -rrb- i read the reviews for this bag and loved the look so i ordered it love everything about it great compartment for laptop -lrb- i fit both my macair and my ipad together -rrb- i have gotten a compliment on the bag every time i have been in the airport since i started using it oh , and my back and shoulders feel great
my wife 's company moved to a new building , so her two minute walk from the bus became # minutes she has to bring a fairly heavy notebook computer home , together with paperwork , and this became <unk> so she looked around for a backpack this one is exactly right although fairly tall and wide -lrb- it would fit a bigger computer than the # . # inches suggested -rrb- it is thin , so it is manageable on the bus it is very good-looking and <unk> , with the leather flap we used <unk> oil to waterproof it for the rain she reports that it is comfortable and that many co-workers are envious of it she would recommend this to anyone with similar needs
i love this backpack and there are many compartments and surprisingly room for a slim laptop bag the lining is great and the material and quality of the bag are both fantastic
stylish , functional bag i get compliments on this bag all the time the only issue for me is i wish it was n't called mobile edge for her i 'm man enough to carry it though . :
i purchased this backpack # years ago and use it everyday and it is still like brand-new i traveled with it # times -lrb- us to asia -rrb- and it works perfectly i had a # ' thinkpad and how i have a # ' t # they all fit well in this backpack also , their is room for a folder , pens , power cord , my wallet and <unk> bag ! and the good thing it that it keeps your both hands free good for travelling really it 's a great purchase
this backpack is really amazing i commute to work and carry at least one laptop daily , plus a book , cosmetics , etc . it 's very comfortable and fits everything i need when i have to carry two laptops i 'm so thankful i have the bag because it really makes it much easier and does n't hurt my <unk>
i received this very quickly and once i opened it i was completely satisfied with the product the quality of the leather is great and the fact this has a lifetime warranty is even better i work in the technology field and travel to nyc and need to carry my ipad , and other technology items and wanted something that was sturdy , comfortable , feminine and stylish ; this has it all and more i highly recommend this product to anyone that is looking for a leather backpack that will definitely make a statement while giving you everything you need to get around comfortably
i purchased this backpack largely based on the reviews of other amazon buyers , and i 'm very satisfied with it i mostly wanted something that would n't be difficult to carry , and this design is very comfortable
i received this sleeve in the mail today and went to put my computer in it the computer stuck out almost a whole inch when i sent an email requesting return service i got an <unk> message saying the company was closed for the week due to the <unk> holiday so i wo n't have any service until next week
i bought this because a reviewer said it fit the # `` macbook it does n't - not even close from my $ # mistake , measure twice - order once nice sleeve ; however dig the colors , pattern and the price
the design is pretty but it is too small my # . # `` laptop could barely fit and a thread started unraveling immediately my wife did n't want to bother with sending it back and waiting for a new one , because we had to use it for our trip
the size , shape , durability and usefulness of this product is as described ... but it looks a bit different than i imagined the surface is not as smooth as i thought it would be from the photo up close , the dots seem bigger and more colorful but the surface , overall , is more matte and dull i probably would not have purchased this item if i had seen it in person first i will probably resell it on ebay as the seller charges s & h both ways if the item is returned -lrb- ~ $ # . # -rrb-
this sleeve stretches to fit my ibm thinkpad without any wiggle room whatsoever , but it is not so tight that it puts a strain on the zipper or stitching it fits it like a glove if that is what you want , then this is great - it will feel like you have a custom-fit sleeve -lrb- the dimensions of my laptop are : # / # `` x # / # `` x # / # `` when closed -rrb- the fabric , zipper and construction all seem high-quality the background color and zipper are a dark chocolate brown , not black -lrb- the photo labeled `` dot no . # is accurate -rrb- too bad there is not a handle or room for the power cord , that would make it a lot more useful when travelling even a pocket for my <unk> or a flash drive would be nice , too wish i would have waited a few weeks , the price went down $ # or so since i bought it in <unk> , but it was still a good deal compared to what you find in other stores
i was looking for an attractive sleeve for my # -inch laptop , and this works out perfectly the material is sturdy and thick for good protection , the polka dots are cute without being <unk> , and it fits my laptop well i knocked one star off because there 's a slight chemical smell to the neoprene material i 've had it for about a month and the smell has faded , though it still lingers it was really strong when i first got it
this worked great with my # in hp the case is soft and padded and reminds me of scuba suit material however , when i got a # in sony laptop , the sleeve would n't zip up technically , # laptops fit inside , but not well you really have to shove it in there i recommend this sleeve for laptops around # inches
it fits snug-ly it takes a little pulling to close the zipper over my # `` macbook pro , but the material and the zipper have been able to handle the strain -lrb- a cheaper zipper might have been broken or jammed -rrb- my # `` is pretty slim so i can imagine how this sleeve might not fit well on thicker laptops as long as the fit is right , there could be no better sleeve for your laptop
i got this after carrying around my laptop loose in my backpack with my textbooks seems to cushion it well , and it 's nice to carry around individually because the fabric does n't slip out of my hands it 's a tight fit but does fit for my mac book pro # ``
i like this product although it is a little big for my # in . laptop overall it is a good buy and i would recommend it to <unk> who needs a computer sleeve
fits well , padding is good was n't quite sure about the design in person , but it 's grown on me there is enough room to also keep the power charger & cable inside the padding if needed
i love this laptop sleeve i use to when transporting my laptop to and from school and also on airplanes the material is excellent and durable the zippers are sturdy and wo n't easily break the polka dot design is wonderful too there 's enough padding so my laptop -lrb- # `` -rrb- wo n't slide around too much there 's no place to put my charger or extension cord but that 's because i want the sleeve to lie flat i would n't have bought any other product it 's excellent
i read all the reviews and concluded that this was the size to go for my # `` hp pavilion laptop received it today and like it very much , but there 's no way it fits my laptop the laptop hangs out at the zipper end and can not possibly be zipped closed i will have to order a larger sleeve -lrb- # `` - # `` -rrb- , but will not be able to use it with my matching laptop bag strange how the sleeve will fit one consumer 's laptop and not another 's
i loved the style and color of this laptop sleeve , however the # `` did n't fit my dell inspiron # laptop , so i got the # `` built ny laptop sleeve in blk and love it ! it is easy to put my laptop in and gives it a snug fit i feel that my laptop is protected just be sure that you get the right size !
i love my sleeve , the pattern is great and it 's perfect for my needs i do n't have to carry a whole work bag , as this fits the laptop and # file folders without issue
i was concerned that this might be too large for my computer it 's dimensions are - width # . # in depth # . # in height # . # in - it 's a fairly snug fit without needing to stretch and with a little room on each side , but not enough to hold a charger or anything else i am very happy with the fit
i picked this up for my work laptop -lrb- dell latitude , # `` -rrb- and it fits perfectly , which is great because it 's a little difficult to find a snugly fitting sleeve for a # `` computer i 've had built ny cases for my last three computers and i love them the cases offer great protection and can be slipped into any of my other bags for easy travelling fun pattern , too , and great price for a built sleeve
i love the pattern the first time i brought it to school , i got lots of compliments it 's easy to carry and does n't want to slip out of my hand , and it 's also really easy to slip in a bag and carry around accessibility is nice ; could have a side zip but the top zipper opens wide , so it 's easy to slip my laptop in and out overall a great buy
the pic on amazon is incorrect it 's actually the <unk> shaped laptop case , not the handled sack pictured and , it fits my toshiba satellite a # , which is a tablet pc , perfectly measurement wise , my laptop should fit into the # `` , bought it , too small , but the # `` is perfect my computer is # `` x # `` x # / # `` very thick padding , great item
this is great to carry just the # `` laptop with a thin bag that holds apple charger , ipod , ear phones and my passport external drive love how thin it is and there is actually some fun color choices
it was so nice to find a laptop sleeve that was n't just black i got the red multi color striped one my # `` fits in it perfectly and it adds a little color to my room
you can tell by feeling the case that is solidly made it has thick enough neoprene to really protect it , but is light enough to carry on a regular basis the zipper on the top is great and will keep it nice and safe while closed
i love this laptop sleeve ! it 's a rich brown color with <unk> dots on it it feels very well made and fits like a glove i like the <unk> shape overall , excellent purchase
not sure how so many people had positive reviews for this one i bought it to use it as a safety cover for my white macbook i have been using it for almost # months now i feel that it makes my macbook very heavy its not thin , it is quite thick heavy so obviously makes the whole package with macbook quite heavy but its of very good quality if you have no issues with weight then it may be okay for you but i wont recommend it for those who do n't want to make their macbook heavy also i find that it overheats the back of my macbook while running flash and other processor <unk> tasks . fan will start <unk> bottom line i wo n't recommend this product
i was really excited about this product -- it was exactly what i was looking for and from a brand name with good quality products i am extremely disappointed in the feel of the material , it sure does n't feel like leather more like cheap vinyl good fit and design , but it was n't what i was expecting if you 're think about buying one , see if you can actually touch and feel it first
you would think this would be great and at first it looks great but wait a few months and the outer layer starts pealing off and then it looks like crap actually it is crap
after researching a host of protective cases for my black macbook , i bought the macally shell because it seemed like the best for your money that is still available for the now discontinued black macbook it was really easy to put on and take off , but after carrying it to class for a day i decided it was just too heavy for my purposes i would rather invest in a lighter , fitted neoprene sleeve and accept the exterior smudges than have to carry this added weight every time i want to use my macbook in class overall , it would provide great protection if you are n't planning on carrying it very far , but for practical portability it 's just not worth the extra weight i returned it the next week
i have had my mbp for almost # years , and my husband purchased the speck hard shell case for me about # / # years ago the speck case recently had to be retired as # of the front tabs snapped off somewhere along the way and the bottom would not stay on securely any longer just this evening we found this macally bookshell `` leather `` bound shell i put that on my computer and now my computer will not close the edges of this new macally case seem to be a touch higher than the edges of my computer , and they meet before the latch on my computer can meet that is the only real issue i have with this case , but it is enough for me to return it to the store and go find another speck case somewhere else
i did n't know there was macally on the cover , so that was a little disappointing however , it gets the job done and is nice and soft to the touch , but firm to support the laptop i also did n't like that when i got it , one of the corners was scuffed , not a fan of that i 'd recommend it if you need a cover , but be aware , there is the logo of macally on it
the case is a nice leather type serves it 's purpose and protects the computer has a slight grip so you wo n't get any sliding on smooth surfaces only thing is i do n't believe it <unk> to the macbook in the most snug way , but that could just be my particular case all in all a good purchase
it does its job fine , but it is not very attractive and adds weight to the computer the case also adds thickness to the computer , which makes it a little difficult to get it into its travel case if i were going to buy a similar product in the future , i would spring for something a little nicer
i used mine for about a week but ultimately this thing is just too dorky to use let me put it this way : if macbooks were meant to have thick leather covers , god would have made them that way of course , by god i mean steve jobs
put this on your laptop and you 've got a <unk> out laptop like no other the case is black leather -lrb- sexy , or masculine , your choice -rrb- it 's a hard case which gives great protection to your macbook only downside is the weight it makes your laptop much heavier i find the trade off worth it love my laptop cover
i really appreciate the strength of the product it is n't too easy to clean , and it limits the range of the screen opening and when the screen is completely open the fan is left little room to breathe but for what it is intended , a decent fit
easy to install and it fits really well the only problems are traps heat # it covers up the green led that shows the remaining battery charge when the computer is turned off it covers up the apple <unk> the price i would recommend
pro : excellent quality fits great , nice `` grippy `` texture , does the job does n't appear to increase internal heat of the macbook too much -lrb- maybe a few degrees <unk> -rrb- the apple logo shines thru the lid in a neat way true gray/black color - does n't show any tinge of brown or purple when installed on a white macbook if done with some amount of care , does n't appear to have much of a chance to scratch the macbook when installing or removing con : kind of pricey for what amounts to two pieces of plastic can be a bit <unk> to install the lower half -lrb- make sure you do that right , or you 'll have fit problems -rrb- can make the macbook a bit thick for some tight-fitting , neoprene sleeves -lrb- but still usable -rrb- lid wo n't open quite as far as before , which limits its usefulness on some laptop stands but still ok when used flat on a table or , <unk> ... in your lap
this cover has been on my black macbook for about four years it still looks new and has withstood the <unk> that i put it through in college this case is not only durable but looks and feels good
i travel often with my macbook this cover looks good , is holding up well , gives nice padding and protection to the computer 's shell , and does n't seem to have any negative impact on cooling i get many positive remarks as well the only issue at first for me was that my bag has a flat padded pocket for the laptop to slide in i was used to slipping the mac in and out of it very easily with a leather covering , the computer is a touch thicker and much less slick ... so i have to use more than gravity to get it in my bag as i 'm leaving the security checkpoints i got used to that in a few days and no longer think about it much if i 'd bought this when i bought the mac , it would be scratch-free and <unk> hindsight is #
just what i was looking for i purchased this for my partner and i as we travel a lot and did n't want to ruin our computers from wear and tear it is n't the most attractive case for a computer but it is sturdy and does what is says it does
although this product is a bit expensive , it was definitely worth it it helps dramatically on preventing scratches as i have seen on my brothers labtop , which he uses a protective sleeve it doesnt get in the way of using any of the outlets or in closing the labtop
when i got my # `` macbook , i was n't particularly happy with the white color -lrb- i 'm not paying an extra $ # for just another color -rrb- so i decided to buy a black case that would look nice and be functional fortunately , i bought this case , and i am so happy i did this in an excellent looking case very professional looking and looks much better than the plastic cases -lrb- the ones that scratch very easily -rrb- it took literally # seconds for me to put it on my macbook when closed , it looks very good as well the only fault is that the apple logo is not visible , but i do n't really mind at all
fits perfectly my mac , all the ports remain accessible thanks to the precise molding feels very solid once installed , after you snap it on you can forget you have an extra shell contrary to what i have read , this version at least allows the video lid to open completely as without the shell a little pricey but protects the <unk> chassis which is too delicate for dents and scratches and that costs much much more would buy it again
this is the only case i ever bought for my macbook i 'm going on my fifth year and it is only now starting to show some wear and tear it looks like a leather case and feels awesome , i get a ton of compliments on it
first of all the price was a great very fast shipping , it , actually , arrived much early than was anticipated snapping on the cover was child 's play i looks great , complements my macbook oh , so , nicely , even though it the white model it , also does not hinder my mac cooling all , in all , it is a great buy at even a greater price you should not pass this up
not only does this protect well against food , liquid spills , and scratches , but it makes it very easy to hold without fear of my laptop slipping plus it comes off without doing any damage to the laptop surface like some shells do at first i worried about overheating with such a well-padded case , but there have been no problems at all definitely recommend this
i was expected a cover just like a cover for a phone and it was just that - fits very snug and yet comes off easy when needed nice design and
i 've been looking for a case for my macbook for months and have been consistently disappointed with the high priced , cheap looking plastic cases sold by apple while i was hesitant to order this without seeing it first , i 'm so pleased that i did this case is exactly what i was hoping for the price is very reasonable and the case looks great i actually like that the apple logo is covered - it gives the computer a uniform , sleek and professional look i 've received many compliments on it and everyone asks where i purchased it it does add to the thickness of the computer but any case will do that i 've had no problems with the computer overheating and find that the open space in the back -lrb- the case is two pieces -rrb- and the keyboard spaces are more than enough to dissipate the heat the suede lining is also great - i 'm confident my computer is well protected
this is soooo cool just bought a macbook and wanted some accessories based on only a couple of bad reviews i gave it a shot the material is extremely lightweight it is a foam type material that <unk> the notebook well it makes my white macbook look like a <unk> <unk> great work macally !
i really like this shell , it clicks on easily and stays on , and it has a really nice texture that helps you keep a grip on your macbook while carrying it around i 've had people make comments like `` nice laptop warmer `` , but it really has n't added much to the running temperature , and it helps keep your legs cooler if you are using it on your lap the only downside for me is that it limits the hinge movement and how far you can tilt the screen back , but it is a very minor inconvenience overall i think this is a great product
it 's just a solid , beautiful case if you will move your mac around all the time , this case is not slippery and that 's very important , especially for me so i do n't drop it at all
this is a great cover for a macbook it is a hard shell that is cushioned by the thick leather that will protect it from small falls , scratches , and spills there are many more expensive products that are hard plastic and wo n't cushion it and wo n't make it look nearly as good as this does it gives it a very designer look and protective a must for a macbook owner and it comes in other colors great buy for the money ! !
this product will fit your macbook like a glove and it looks great too i 've been using it for over a year and i love it mac 's have a tendency to overheat , but i have n't noticed any changes is my mac 's temperature -lrb- there are various temperature monitor <unk> for the mac -rrb- it 's much better than a sleeve because it 's always on , you never have to take it off
it is exactly as advertised it took # seconds to put on and it fits like a good glove adds a bit of protection to a fairly expensive investment definitely worth the money
i have had this on my macbook since the day i bought it no smudges , scratches , cracks , or marks this case does an outstanding job protecting my macbook and it looks great too
i love the protection shell because it makes my laptop easy to hold on to , and skid <unk> my daughter did n't have one , and her laptop slid off her lap , the couch , and out of her hands and hit the floor many times it fits perfectly , and it looks smart i have had so many compliments on it , and been asked where i got it i would tell anyone purchasing a new macbook to get one of these , without question the only improvement i would suggest is to make a cutout for the glowing apple on top
this very nice <unk> leather cover has kept my macbook looking like brand-new for several years i even got the apple store rep to call over other associates to look at my laptop 's mint condition the corners do rub off after a while , but at least it 's the cover and not the laptop ... that 's what this is for , right ? it snaps on and off easily and does n't add much weight i just wish macally would make them for my new macbook pro
it 's rare that you find a product that delivers more than it offers this protective case is one of them took it out of the packaging , slipped it onto my macbook , end of story rich leather on the outside , suede on the inside all ports and superdrive are clear well worth the few dollars it costs to protect your macbook
i may be a little rougher than most , or just extra clumsy , but this shell has proven to be a great <unk> for my macbook fits snuggly and looks really cool too
i was looking for a a cover for my macbook that would both protect my mac both on the outside of the computer but also the contact between the cover and the computer the macally protection shell was the answer it snaps on with ease for a snug but not too tight fit there are no scratches on my computer from the shell plus the outside is protected from scratches , dirt and even spills it even allows for the heat created from the computer to escape the only complaint is that it does n't come in different colors i would buy this product again in a heart beat
i used to keep my macbook in a neoprene case , but once purchasing the macally protection shell i have felt safe enough just slipping my macbook in my backpack it looks nice , feels good , and has protected my computer from scratches the temperature runs # degree <unk> higher on average , but the case shields your lap from the heat definitely worth it
i purchased this with a amazon gift card to protect my new white macbook after looking at many other types , including skins , plastic cases , sleeves and another leather case , i choose the macally one as it was the most cost effective and had no negative reviews installation was a breeze , i did n't even read the directions -lrb- i 'm male and never read directions . it fits well , adds a look of elegance and certainly protects the mac although it makes the macbook a little `` larger `` , it certainly is not bulky i have removed it several times without any ill effects to it or the mac the only negative i can think of is that it is only available in # colors - black or red ; neither is a real match for the white macbook , but does accessorize it well macally protection shell for macbook -lrb- <unk>
very well made , compact and does a good job protecting your laptop also well thought out with pockets for most computer gear , but it is very small and holds just your computer gear and that is all there is barely enough room to cram in the power supply so forget an external dvd drive i have to carry my wallet , eye glasses and phone in my pants pockets and if it looks like rain , no exterior pocket for an umbrella either
the quality of this bag is excellent and i bought this while on sale for # . # $ i like the design where you put the accessories like mouse , power supply , and even your ipod what i do n't like is once you put your macbook # `` inside , you should be very careful closing the zipper because it will hit the corner of your laptop and scratch it the bag is so exact and no allowance for the macbook # `` targus should put # `` allowance on the top and put small piece of nylon along with the zipper side to protect the laptop from zipper scratch
the ac adaptor makes the flap not lay straight and it has hardly any room @ all for papers very compact but perhaps too much in some places it does fit very snuggly for my sony # . # `` notebook -lrb- which i like -rrb- , but i wish it had a few colors of flare
