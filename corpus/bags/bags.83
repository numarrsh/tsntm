i bought this to carry all my books , binder , pencils , and everything else to walk back and forth on campus this bag makes everything so much easier , and the best part is it 's small however , it 'll hold everything that i need it to i recommend this bag to anyone
i would recommend this to anyone looking for a backpack to haul their laptop i use mine daily and it has enough room that its all i carry , my lunch bag even fits into it
i bought this backpack because i 'm going to college this fall and needed something nice , durable , and <unk> i did some research and this backpack seemed to be one of the better ones i got it in the mail today -lrb- yay for the two day shipping ! -rrb- and it is awesome very heavy duty , with lots of pockets and compartments even the zippers are heavy duty metal and rubber the picture is very accurate to size and the straps and parts of the backpack that touch you are well-padded and very comfortable a definite # out of # for me :
this thing has more storage than i 've ever needed i use it to go from building to building doing network work i can store my laptop and tons of cables , a screwdriver and still have a ton of space left over
this is a very sturdy backpack lots of compartments you can put so much inside this bag unfortunately it was n't sturdy enough for my nephew he is a <unk> who can tear up a steel backpack
my favorite thing about this book bag is when i sit it down ... it stays standing up it has enough room and pockets for my purse , labtop , lunchbox , books , water bottle and a light jacket
i travel for work all the time and needed something that would hold a lot of stuff but would be comfortable to tote around airport after airport this bag is perfect for my needs no matter how much i cram into it , it always fits under the seat in front of me on the airplane typically i keep several file folders full of paper , a # inch bulky laptop , my slim # inch personal laptop , snacks , and even my purse if i do n't feel like toting it around the straps are very padded and comfortable and the back is thickly padded as well i feel that i could drop this bag and my computers would still be protected though it is n't the prettiest or most professional-looking bag , it is very well made i have taken this on several business trips and it still looks new i am very pleased with this product
although the bag is pretty large -lrb- i am # cm -rrb- , it is large enough for a # `` laptop and plenty of other cargo i bought this so that i can walk to work , carrying my work clothes , food , and <unk> zippers are of great quality
this backpack has lots of space and lots of great compartments to hold whatever i needed my work laptop fit comfortably in this backpack with extra space for zipping
this backpack has proven useful as a small carry-on bag for overnight trips that just happens to hold a big laptop it has more room than you might expect and is well-built zipping up around the tight corners of the flaps can hang up the zipper , but it does n't catch or cut anything ; just be aware that the tight <unk> means zipping more slowly that 's my only complaint and it 's a very minor one
i was in need of a new backpack and did some research and found this one to have the highest ratings and it has not disappointed would recommend this to anyone who travels for business very light and comfortable has lots of storage space if i have an over night trip i just use this and it works just fine
i bought this backpack several months ago , but i do not use it every day the bag is of very good quality and i like having lots of storage options from small to large i am a college student and needed a compartment for my laptop , books , binders , and lunch the small padded compartment for electronics on top has been great for my headphones i have found that the bag is very comfortable to carry even with a bad shoulder , although , i try and keep down the weight in the bag to reduce stress on that shoulder highly recommend to anyone looking for a very good quality bag that will hold a great deal
plus , this backpack is extremely comfortable i bought it as a gift for my husband and he says it easily fits his # & # # ; laptop , as well as books , charging cords and other miscellaneous items
i work in <unk> for an oil company i have to load a lot of items and carry them from meetings , to the field , and on travel this bag handles all of my needs and is very well made very happy with this purchase and have recommended this bag to several co-workers
extremely durable , and you can carry everything you need with it i originally bought this as a college student to haul around books , laptop and odds and ends on days where i had class from # <unk> to # <unk> and it did the job wonderfully i had enough room to carry all the things i needed throughout the day with a little room leftover fast forward a couple of years , and this thing is still going strong i use it for work , carrying around a laptop and all the various cables and accessories i need to show up and hit the ground running i 've taken this thing around the world , through airport security and such with no problems in short , this is a great all-around laptop bag that will last a long while
i use this weekly i 'm so happy i got it i used it while on tour with a band , and everything of mine fit somewhere there are a million pockets and does n't hurt my back i use it now on film sets , and it 's nice to have everything with me in one bag
i think i changed my <unk> choices , because it was love in first sight really comfortable despite its sizes , so many pockets to choose from and it 's durable everything you 'd want from a backpack i didnt try yet , but even my xbox might fit with other things i recommend this thing
i bought this backpack for traveling and have been very happy with it the build quality is very impressive , the seems are tough and the oversized zippers feel very solid i also like the rugged carry handle of top , this is the first pack i have owned where i did n't fear it ripping off when i carried it full it has many pockets for lots of different storage options i rarely carry a laptop , but the laptop compartment is good for other electronics since it is padded overall this is a very good backpack that i would highly recommend
bought this for college and i love it holds my laptop , books , water bottles , and whatever else i need in it it 's quite large it has stood up very well for a full calendar year now and i would buy it again wish there were more color options , but it 's a great pack
really well made and convenient for those # or # day trips holds my heavy # . # & # # ; laptop perfectly and can even fit a full keyboard and mouse in other pockets worth it for the <unk>
my girlfriend have <unk> but not targus drifter , so i <unk> her backpack and i real like it so i go ahead order but found targus drifter best cuz plenty of packs etc . i am very happy to have this
i travel a lot and have lots of stuff to take with me - my laptop , cords , mouse , notebook , etc . i also make sure to carry my medicine , kindle fire and some magazines for that annoying period when you are not supposed to have electronic devices powered up on airplanes all of that stuff fits very nicely in this backpack there are two padded areas - one for the laptop , one for my kindle there are multiple pockets and sections to separate and keep all of your travel things separate from work things it is big enough on the bottom that it stands upright when you put it down i could n't ask for more
it is very sturdy and comfortable at the back i carry a monster laptop in the bag , and i dont feel the weight at all -lrb- except when i am climbing <unk> -rrb- it has lots of compartments , you can load all your accessories into the bag easily
it fits my msi # inch laptop and has tons of extra storage for external hard drives , phones , tabs and anything else you can think off i really like the heavy duty cable handle
so far i really like this backpack i 've started commuting to school via bike and subway , and i was not comfortable with my laptop in my old backpack , and carrying around a separate laptop bag was annoying i really like how the pocket for the laptop seems protected from all sides , including the bottom i love having all of the pockets to organize my stuff better i 'm very glad that the handle on the top seems very sturdy i wish that it had a hook closer to the actual back of the bag for hanging it up in bathroom <unk> , but that is my only complaint
such nice quality the quality of the zipper is what i was worried about and it 's great there are so many compartments i got this for college but i 'm sure i 'll use it for way more than that the breathable mesh padding makes it so my back does n't sweat on long travels i love this backpack
like everything about it have n't had it long but the quality looks good the asus # . # does not fit in the & # # ; laptop pocket & # # ; but fits well in the compartment should be fine using the pocket for the power supply
holds everything and is holding up well there is plenty of room for my # inch computer and lots of books too even some pockets for keys and such
my house recently caught on fire and everything -lrb- almost -rrb- was destroyed in the house it was terrible my targus bag was in my room too it was destroyed it saved everything that was inside my passport , my wallet , credit cards , everything i had inside it , was completely safe safe from the fire , smoke , and water damage altogether i love this bag the first thing i did was to go and get another one of these ! :
this case is fantastic i 've carried so much stuff in it all my electronics including my tablet computer and all the cords and chargers and headphones plus my <unk> machine all my meds and a few days worth of clothes how can you beat that well made case with all i carry it still looks new i highly highly recommend this case
i 've had this backpack since june # , and it has seen very little wear minor stitching has come apart on the shoulder but nothing to hinder the use of the backpack i 've used this every college semester filled to the <unk> # days a week one of my biggest praises for this backpack is the double layer of fabric on the bottom , to keep it intact when under stress from heavy materials such as books and large laptops this backpack is a trooper for anyone who can stand the -lrb- less than stellar -rrb- visual appeal
bought this for my boyfriend 's # year old son and it is , hands down , the best backpack we 've ever seen rigid frame makes it easy to pack , and he really does load it up every day for school this thing has taken a beating for # + months already and it looks almost brand new i will alway buy targus brand from here
if you are looking for a travel bag with lots of items to store , this is a good choice for you i used to travel around the globe for business and this is great for me to pack for my personal items which not inside my check-in luggage
i ordered the # inch size as i had read many reviews -lrb- of both this bag and others -rrb- that stated they could n't fit a # inch laptop into the stated # backpack however , the # inch backpack is much bigger than i expected it is true to the measurements listed in the description i have no problem fitting my # laptop , purse , lunch box , water bottle , notebooks , and various other work items into this bag with room to spare so far the construction seems sturdy i was also afraid this bag would be a little & # # ; masculine & # # ; for my tastes , but its really not i am <unk> surprised with this product
# `` laptop fits easily and safely backpack has more than a dozen easily accessible and logically placed pockets engineering of backpack is excellent zippers , materials , cushion placement , handles -- everything is made to last and survive heavy use in any environment the backpack looks classy , too i 'd gladly walk into any business meeting or social setting with it for the price , this is an incredible value
i loved it i never thought that i would switch from a swiss gear to a targus and love it as much as i do it has more than enough space for all my books for school and my laptop
i 've used this on three trips since i purchased it it is big enough to hold everything i need for a weekend trip and had plenty of pockets to keep my books , cloths and electronic devices
this bag is a perfect fit for my # inch laptop , and provides quite a bit of protection for it not just with padding around the laptop , but also the material the bag is made of its even been good in the rain plenty of room for the several notebooks and textbooks i take to class , and the smaller pockets are great for anything from water bottles to keys , phone , and wallet
this has a lot of pockets with plenty of room for multiple laptops , files , and a few clothes it also has a convenient top pocket for a phone , glasses , or keys it is also very comfortable for long commutes i would recommend this product
she loved it but quit school before she could use it i have it now and so far am pretty impressed with the quality but not a lot of use
he is a professor and has tons of things to carry around i purchased it after seeing all the reviews here he loves it and keeps telling me how it has room for all the things he has to take . it has a place for laptops and ipad
i bought this bag to replace an old roll-on style bag and it is perfect for that i had also hoped that i could use it for the daily commute , but it is way too large for that you can pack several days worth of clothing and still have lots of room for computers and tech stuff it is very well built and the zippers feel like they will last a long time
this is the best backpack i have ever owned i was on tour last winter and used it as my primary work bag i was able to carry a computer , all my paperwork , tools , hat , and gloves at all times it 's very comfortable and durable
this thing is a beast , and i mean that in a good way this thing will haul the mail and even a small <unk> not really but you get the <unk> the only problem is you can put so much stuff inside this pack you can barely carry it i have taken this thing international as a carry on and it is perfect you almost do n't need a suitcase if you have one of these there are so many pockets and zippers that you have to remember where you put everything i use it daily to carry my macbook , my ipad , notebooks , chargers , sunglasses , change of clothes , pair of shoes . pens , etc . definitely wish i had happened upon this bad boy years ago cant wait to try it out on some over night backpacking trips
i recommend this to anyone in it that has to even travel around sometimes it is tough and for the price , cheaper than many other bags get this if you have a larger laptop and work in it or you want a bag you can use for a lot of other purposes not just carrying around a laptop
i bought this as a diaper bag for my sister and her husband # years and they still use it durable & stylish ample pockets for storing toys , wipes , diapers , spare cloths , camera , bottles , and everything else they love this bag
got it as a gift she loves it and has no complaints i took a look at it seems to be solid in construction and a lot of storage space
great <unk> got the smaller <unk> the # & # # ; - and it is huge you can put so much in it that it will weigh a ton lots of usable pockets and it 's great for travel and general use would highly recommend it
plenty of space for a <unk> and my gym clothes for a # day trip with my laptop , i can now just bring this bag instead of having a separate backpack and laptop bag plenty of pockets to carry all the things
pros : very high capacity can fit a lot of stuff into <unk> , made of material that does n't wear <unk> <unk> placed and sized zips , pouches , etc . cons : is on the bulky side of
this is a great backpack for any student it has plenty of room for books , laptop -lrb- # inch -rrb- , binders and lots more great for anyone and it even looks great
i just traveled to europe using this bag and it came in extremely handy i was able to pack a variety of items in it and it fits in the over bend on the plane great product !
this is one of the best backpacks for form and function that i 've used i bought it for the works commute but had to find another solution due to the unsightly <unk> look now i use it for weekend trips and it shines <unk>
this is a really nice laptop bag it 's well built , very sturdy , and offers a lot of protection the design of all of the pockets are really nice , ample amount of space to store and carry all that you need and more they really took their time and thought out protection for your laptop , e-reader -lrb- it has and microfiber e-reader pocket w / zipper -rrb- , i-pod , camera , etc . i would highly recommend this laptop bad to everyone ! ! ! ! !
purchased this backpack for my fall college semester so far it has held up very nicely the build seems to be of quality , and there are a lot of compartment and zippers i end up fitting a # `` dell and its charger , # textbooks , binders , notebooks , and a lunch the straps and back design definitely make the weight seem significantly less my only worries come from the durability of the zippers for the price i would say this backpack is worth the money , and time will tell how it holds up but it looks promising now would recommend for the average student
very good back pack for laptop users a lot of pockets to put stuff , different stuff , credit cards , cables , hd drive , dvd etc . minor issue with straps they made them stretchable to compensate during walking with heavy weight . some times it ` s playing against you
this is the best laptop backup i have seen i have the swiss before and it was really bad quality and the zipper was broken this targus is excellent and has pockets galore and seems well
this is an awesome backpack for my laptop there is plenty of room for a weekend 's worth of clothes and my toiletries perfect for when i have to work out of town i liked the durable feel of the construction and the heavyweight zippers i did n't want to spend the hundred plus for a swissgear pack but wanted a substantial amount of protection for the laptop i feel this is a good buy
i buy it because it is very strong , i can put my big and heavy laptop in it , by the way i can put lots of food in it the belt is strong and would n't break down
i am a petite woman who has been looking for a comfortable , all-purpose backpack for conventions and vacations this back pack had plenty of room , enough varying pocket sizes -lrb- i always knew where my items were located -rrb- , and had extremely comfortable straps my laptop `` <unk> `` in the laptop section , so i did n't have to worry about jarring it when i put the backpack down also , the bottom of the backpack was reinforced it 's lightweight yet strong best backpack i ever bought for myself
if you are looking for a durable yet comfortable backpack with plenty of pockets , this is an excellent choice if you need a backpack that can hold a great deal , this one does i am able to stuff it to capacity so i only need the backpack to bring on my commute the back of the backpack has cushions for the shoulders and lower back so it rests comfortably on my back it is constructed with comfort in mind while also giving ample room to fill it and organize everything it is constructed well so i do not have concerns that it will fall apart in a year it is a great value
i love this backpack i used it for multiple trips overseas it has plenty of storage for laptops , tablets or other electronics it has lots of pockets of various sizes , and is well padded accross the bottom for your back , as well as comfort straps this is by far one of my travel essentials when i go anywhere
after searching high and low , online and <unk> , i finally found a backpack with a protected laptop sleeve that my large dell inspiron # r laptop fits well i am a student , i can fit the computer comfortably , a <unk> pad , large school notebook , # textbooks , water bottle , sweatshirt , and still plenty of room to spare this is a large backpack with plenty of padding on the straps and back ; water resistant -lrb- i live in seattle area -rrb- i finally no longer need to carry two bags to school if i want to bring my computer
i bought a high sierra backpack for college and it broke , almost immediately i replaced it with this one and could n't be happier excellent quality , my netbook or tablet has plenty of padding and there are pockets everywhere for anything you need there is even a pocket in the back , the part that fits next to your back the most i have had in it is # books , # med . notebooks and my laptop but it would hold more extremely sturdy , i will have this one way past college
being a <unk> college student with an extraordinarily large laptop -lrb- republic of gamers # & # # ; -rrb- , i needed a larger backpack than i have in high school this backpack got the job done , and feels comfortable when wearing my only complaint is that its shoulder straps have an elastic component which make the backpack bounce if i try to walk quickly , but this is a very negligible issue for a wonderfully sturdy and spacious backpack
i use this for business and has the right amount of space and pockets for laptop , work folders , cables & power cords , and other storage looks professional for a backpack i like the sturdy top handle , and overall well made zippers and easy to grab pulls , as well as the straps for carrying that are comfortable has that extra room for when i travel with family and kids for their electronics , snacks , and other things but is not too big or bulky for travel , more of a mid-sized bag able to shove under seat on airplane , and easy to pull out and access from top <unk> in those <unk> quarters <unk> shape seems to hold more , good design for folders , books , etc . and sitting on ground very happy with this purchase
this is an awesome bag , i can now put everything i need in this bag before i was using one of the targus laptop cases , rather than the backpack this has so much more storage space targus makes a great product
i have had my mobile edge alienware m # x for about # months i love the bag , except the straps are starting to fray i plan to see how well they live up the `` lifetime warranty ``
the only thing preventing a five-star rating on this would be the large compartment zipper gets hung up frequently ; never smooth i 've had to resort to weekly ` <unk> ' of either liquid soap or wax all over the zipper to keep it running smoothly when you travel frequently through security lines , you want things to function as needed that said , the rest of the bag is fantastic and i could n't ask for more it can hold way more than you ever anticipate , comfortable to lug around , and has storage and compartments galore decent product , but they need to find a different manufacturer for that zipper
i like the space and the compartments on it the only thing i did n't like is the zip protector in the middle section that makes the zip get stuck every time opening or closing the bag the backpack its made by a common material , saved by the front that has a hard part anyway , it was what i expected , and it will work for what i need , traveling and working
this is the best back pack i have bought so easy when you go through security at the airport do n't have to pull my laptop out any more so it saves so much more time love the different compartments in it also
if you have an m # x from alienwear , r or r # -lrb- released end of april this year , # -rrb- you need this backpack regardless of some saying its too small for them , its perfect for your gaming setup it holds the laptop very well and has enough padding that it 's neither too bulky or too loose it just feels right , its very well made , and the zippers are much better than most backpacks i 've seen for laptops again , if you invested money in an m # x <unk> , buy this bag and you will be happy i 'm # ' # `` and it fits me very well , and is quite comfortable
this was a christmas gift for my daughter i received it in time for wrapping i knew she wanted one but didnt know what color to pick i picked the one i liked the best and it turned out she liked it too she put it right on her laptop and it fit just right she loves it !
i love the cover it 's a great color and durable the cover is hard to protect the computer but , still sheer so you can see the apple glow i love it !
this is a great cover fits well , easy to put on however , it is not a cosmos product as stated in the description it says osaka on the cover , but fits great
after a year 's use this backpack is falling apart zippers have stopped zipping and the zipper grip has broken off although it has been used a lot i have n't used it for anything too stressful i 'm staying away from targus products from now on
i bought it # days ago it is good so far however , one of its zipper puller <unk> off on the other hand , i do not spent much energy when i carry this backpack even it is full
i still have it the this moment and it has held up since # years ago it 's getting on in years , and i can see the wear and tear it has gone through , but still
this bag is great for students , i can easily carry my large # . # inch laptop in it , the chains are of good quality too , they do n't feel cheap highly satisfied with this product
the product was very good , that 's what i <unk> safe my laptop and tablet and others thank you forthe attention and i hope that i can buy other product in
this did not match the item in the picture what-so-ever it was not rubberized like it said and it was not the same color it was a cheap plastic that probably cost # cents to make i am extremely unhappy with this purchase and will never make one through this <unk> again
it did what it was supposed to , which was protect my laptop so i am happy that it was able to shield from minor potential issues not so happy that it was n't what i expected
i totally love this product i love the rubberized texture it fits perfectly on my computer and it is a super cute color i am very happy . =-rrb- ** update ** i still really like the case , but i am dropping my star rating by one because the corners have almost all begun to crack i guess i am happy that the case took the crack instead of my computer , but pretty bummed that the case looks pretty smashed up on most of the corners i 'm not one to drop my computer often , so i really ca n't say these cracks are caused by anything more than normal use also , the grips on the bottom keep falling off , but thats not a super big deal
i ordered this product because i want to protect my mac from scratches and dust , and i think my money was totally worth it i love this case , even though i thought that the color was supposed to be brighter or stronger , but its a really nice pink
i received this case the other day and it 's perfect looks exactly like the picture and is what i expected it is just like the name brand ones that sell for more than twice the price i bought this to replace a regular plastic case and i like the feel and texture of this case much better
it was a gift so i assume they liked it need more words so here they are it is strange they need detailed comments i guess its for data <unk> purposes so they can sell this information to someone
installation instructions are on a shaky youtube video that after roughly the first minute has no audio many gaps and the <unk> locations did not line up at all for the apple logo to get the logo perfect you have to sacrifice a # in gap with the skin going more to one side than the other lots of little gaps and it 's almost like it was cut incorrectly for the price i would expect a more precision product that would line up exactly and look <unk> had done many vinyl logo 's and even window <unk> and <unk> this was the most frustrating product i have every installed i just removed the product since its since the <unk> are so noticeable and ordered a regular snap on plastic case
i will agree that this skin is awesome ! but , some of the pieces easily <unk> and if accidentally stretched pieces become useless . top cover and bottom cover are great mouse pad and skin that goes around keyboard awesome too would be a better investment if you could order pieces individually or if it came with a warranty like invisible shields would give this product a better review but the smaller skin pieces easily get stretched or their corners do not stick to computer all the time
this is <unk> a sticker for your computer i think for the price i will definately not buy something like this agian once <unk> it does look good but the agian not worth the price
i have an older macbook pro and recently took it in for service -lrb- battery -rrb- unfortunately , the service <unk> put the lid down on a screw or other sharp object , making two long & ugly scratches in the lid i bought this skin to hide those , but ultimately i love how it makes my mbp stand out only # stars because i ended up throwing out the <unk> and keyboard skins they made typing uncomfortable , but perhaps i didnt install them correctly the top & bottom pieces are great , and i 've received many compliments at meetings & events
this cover is easy to install , fits perfect and looks amazing , but when you open the macbook for use it , this cover closes the outlet air so that increase the warm in your <unk> i do n't know if this will overheat the components , but they will get a little warm up
this product looks amazing it even has a functional carbon fiber trackpad cover which surprisingly seems to enhance the performance if you are a perfectionist , or have ocd <unk> like me , this cover will drive you crazy it takes many tries to get it to line up perfectly , mine is almost perfect however , i had to trim the keyboard cover to get it to fit because it stretched out from <unk> it twice minor flaws , but for the money this product should not stretch or require any modification i recommend buying this if you want a sleek , lightweight , stunning macbook cover , and if you can deal with a little imperfection
no issues with putting the cover on , just took some patience the different sections did n't all line up # % perfectly but , they were all pretty darn close look is good , but if you want something that will protect your laptop from a drop or fall from a counter or something this is not the case/cover since this is simply a # m carbon fiber sticker like previously stated though , this cover looks good and protects from that metal wear look from repeated use
definitely makes the laptop look good and you get that extra protection it fits very good the only piece that is n't perfect is the bottom but it is still very close
consistent with the other reviews that i read before buying , this skin is a great asset for my macbook pro surprisingly easy to put on though a little tedious to get it exactly right , it is great looking and sleek to the touch i am confident it will protect my mac for as long as i need
pretty much the carbon fiber skin is sick and definitely worth the money way better than any hard case you could ever buy may not be a protective but looks # %
wanted something that would protect my brand new mac from scratches and this was it it took a while for me to put it on : - / -lrb- maybe thats just me tho -rrb- , but after it was finally on , it was beautiful ive received nothing but compliments on it ive been using it for # months now and its still on my mac with no signs of wear or anything else . & # # ; #
i 've covered two mbps with xgear 's carbon fiber skin , one black and one white i love the look and extra protection this is not thick extra padding it 's <unk> carbon fiber that protects against scrapes , scratches and nicks i take my mbp with me everywhere and there 's frequently no extra room for a padded case with <unk> there 's no reason to worry
amazon had a great price on this when i purchased it $ # . # . pros - well built - thick enough to provide protection - thin enough to fit in the computer compartment of my messenger bag . cons - needs a handle even a small , fabric one would suffice - fits my # `` macbook pro a little too tightly it 's difficult to get the computer into the sleeve without laying the sleeve down on a flat surface
work gave me a new laptop and i needed a sleeve for it the asus aspire s # fits perfectly still slim enough to fit in the laptop compartment of my bag too not the thickest -lrb- as opposed to incase sleeves -rrb- but still great
