many bags and dollars later , and came across this bag it not only has the space and design needed for transporting a lot of design , presentations and electronic equipment but <unk> importantly , it has survived # miles of airport abuse i would recommend it highly
the dual use of this <unk> product -lrb- large , rolling case and simple , small computer <unk> -rrb- make it an ideal choice to handle most any <unk> situations good quality construction at a very reasonable price point
wenger # `` triple gusset wheeled computer case with matching removable notebook <unk> wenger triple gusset wheeled computer case was the best purchase that i have made in months it is very organized and the end result is that i am prepared to take care of business it adds to my personal goal of being an organized person great price for a great product would not hesitate to purchase an additional one
i ordered this bag , because it had many compartments and i needed alot to fit into it it is n't too bulky or too small the price was so much cheaper than any store that i saw it in overall , i love it
this bag is great ! i have had it for about # mos now and it still looks brand new it is well organized , and easy to carry i would definatly recommend it i would have paid $ # more for it , it 's that great
this computer bag is large enough to carry a # . # `` wide laptop , files and optional devices in addition to overnight articles it easily fits in the overhead compartments on airplanes the option to use the small computer bag that comes with the roller bag is a huge plus
i use this bag for work , it 's great my <unk> told me to stop carrier my computer , which i did allot and get a rolling bag , reading some of the reviews and shopping around i decided on the patriot i have not one regret it does everything i need it to , i carry my two cameras , my flip , my consulting notebooks and yes even my laptop i recommend this bag highly
i read all the customer reviews before making my decision to buy the wenger it seemed like an awful lot of money , so i wanted to be sure it was going to last the wenger rolling case has been great for me just going back and forth to the office everyday its durable with lots of pockets to carry around paperwork , water bottles and other necessities i would recommend this to anyone interested in a high quality , durable laptop case on wheels
if you travel alot like me , you will love this bag it has all the pockets you would ever need does get a little <unk> with the laptop in it , i see this bag more at the airport than any other glad i got it
i believe this product has held up well so far it is easy to roll throughout on different surfaces i like all the different compartments to organize my material also , like the extra bag to hold my laptop it is big though , but with it size it can hold a lot of paper and supplies
the best bag i have used so far holds an enormous amount of stuff -- i use it for my laptop and tons of <unk> tests and files i need to take around on site plenty of compartments i 've <unk> it and contrary to some other reviews , the zippers are fine and the handle does click and lock into place properly on mine it also rolls very easily even with a ton of weight in it i have now used this bag for two years in every <unk> kind of weather , dragged it through snow in northern <unk> , dropped the handle in clumsiness as i tripped over my own feet etc . i still keep it overstuffed and throw it carelessly in the back of my car and it is going strong this is one terrific purchase i 've never had a bag last this long and be this trouble free
this computer rolling is just fantastic : very good quality , strong and with a very big room to carry the laptop a complete mobile office and at least # day clothes it 's the best one i have the potomac model for daily use too
she really likes this thing it is small has room for all the power and accessories but not much else . fits small screen laptops . # `` is perfect , # `` is pushing it
i liked this tote so much , that i ordered two more one to replace my bulky tote for work laptop and one for my daughter to use at college it is <unk> lightweight and not bulky , yet it has just enough padding to protect there is plenty of room to carry your laptop and newspaper , pens , memory stick it 's great and the best value for the dollar great price and a great product
this is an excellent carry bag for your laptop i keep my laptop in it all the time to keep the dust out it has a good size extra pocket in which i carry my <unk> modem , cables , ac adapter , and wireless mouse : and i am on line anywhere there is a power outlet in seconds it is fairly well padded , and has a strap to hold your laptop inside the case when transporting you can use the laptop without removing it from the case , which is a great feature i use mine on my lap alot and it keeps my legs from getting too warm from the heat generated by the computer the padded removable long strap is great this is a great value for the price
i bought this item yesterday , and i needed it so badly i chose <unk> shipping it arrived today and it is perfect i have tried it out and it completely fits my dell inspiron # -lrb- # . # `` -rrb- with extra room to spare ! it was an excellent find and it was cheap too i found the same case on -lsb- ... -rsb- and it was about $ # . # this case comes with a bunch of pockets and an <unk> shoulder strap the case <unk> for you to find even more compartments and the actual space provided to place and `` <unk> `` in your laptop it is durable and comes with a life-time replacement warrenty its a very great deal , do n't skip over this one !
this is a really nice computer case it 's just the right size and quite sturdy there is a pocket on the top and a small one on the inside for putting some necessities otherwise , there is just enough room for your laptop we have now purchased two of these the first a few years ago and this year , one to replace it they have received daily use in not just the nicest conditions and held up very well when our current one wears out , we will be looking for the same case again
this bag was not good for carrying a heavy load due to the straps the padding slid to the side leaving the thin side of the strap to dig into my shoulder i like the padding for the laptop and the compartments as well they help me stay organized
of the laptop backpacks that i 've considered , this one <unk> quality and appearance very comfortable to carry , good laptop protection , plenty of room for other items the only downside is some issues with the finish quality that are not expected of a company like samsonite these issues include some stitches that got <unk> , small tears in the inside fabric , etc . however , these are small issues overall
i bought this backpack for my husband and he really likes it he wanted an easy way to travel with a laptop other than a briefcase type bag it 's also great on days when he takes his motorcycle to work it has lots of pockets and organization features i 'd recommend this executive backpack for anyone who wants a briefcase alternative
this laptop backpack is an excellent choice for <unk> who like to carry a backpack the design is simple and the black color gives it a professional look the backpack itself is sleek and slim , with enough room for a laptop , a few files , and some other essentials the bag holds its form very well all in all , a great product
several other people at the call center where i work have these backpacks they protect our laptops and other toys well and are very durable they go back and forth to our cars every day and show no signs of wear recently , one of my co-workers laptop was damaged when his discount store backpack failed it was time for a change i was delighted to discover that from amazon , these cost the same as the cheap packs at the discount stores the only problem we have is telling them apart
so far it is the best for space , and portability however , the top flap cracks with in a year of use i usually cover it with some black vinyl tape to make it last a little bit longer but it looks like crap not replacing it this time solo vinyl rolling catalog
the case 's rugged exterior is what attracted me to purchase it ... but because it is not leather , i 'm <unk> that it is not & # # ; <unk> & # # ; at all i do like the wide wheels that are easily going through all kinds of parking lot situations , including snow and <unk>
i had one exactly like this for years , until it finely gave up the ghost i knew the abuse i delivered to this type of case , over packing , too much weight , etc . and they do very well the only issue is the rolling wheels if held & # # ; too low & # # ; will cause the stand <unk> to drag ground
i was thinking for the price this bag was going to be junk to my happy surprise its a great bag and huge too it fits all my families books for our bible meetings with room to spare my son even `` rides `` our book bag with no destruction
i like the rolling cart very much , except for the locks , one lock keeps getting stuck so i have n't attempted to put in a code , other than that its a great product
i like the rolling catalog case , but i would <unk> the rolling case without the dividers i think i could have included more materials inside the case , putting that aside it was a great purchase order i am really glad i bought the rolling case
the case arrived quickly and was <unk> what my boss wanted roomy inside w/o a bunch of dividers he did need it is used for carrying <unk> size files that are usually very thick
i bought this for my husband who is an attorney he travels from courthouse to courthouse and this solo catalog case allows him to carry along his electronic devices and files with ease it is sturdy and durable , and i feel like the leather will last him for years to come it is an older model than you would currently see on the solo website , but the price was fair for what i purchased
i have been having this case for over # weeks it is very nice , well made an looks like it should cost alot more than it did i use it for all my paper work & things
so far this bag has stood up to several flight with me and i am happy to say that i am happy with the bag i travel a lot and i needed a bag like this
i acquired this bag about one month ago you can clearly see on the picture and you can read in the description that a removable pouch for accessories is included it is also stated on the label that came with the bag nevertheless the bag came without the pouch i filed a claim , but the only thing <unk> is doing , is sending first a couple of emails <unk> for the delay in their answer and subsequently saying that the pouch is not included i think this is misleading the client and a lack of responsibility do n't buy from this company if you want to be sure that you get what they promise
i purchased this bag from amazon in april of this year -lrb- i.e . , three months ago -rrb- i have never traveled with it and simply carry it as a briefcase to work this consists of being <unk> in the back seat of my car to my office otherwise , it is simply carried from my house to my car and from my parking space to my office it is more than fair to say this bag has lived a very gentle life however , the leather is already peeling off , as shown in the user picture i 've added here i realize the bag was reasonably priced , but i would expect it to be presentable for more than three months so , i 'm very disappointed it 's falling apart already it really was a nice bag that i was hoping to travel with but i do n't see this solo bag lasting much longer i 've emailed the company and i 'll post an update based on customer service
i owned a previous version of this solo case and love it when i bought this recent one it looked like same make and model but it is not the same it looks like solo redesigned it and eliminated many of the nice features -lrb- key holder , four pen holder , double inside pocket with mesh see though pocket -rrb- that i had in my previous version they also went from easy to pull zippers tabs to very tiny tabs this makes it hard to open and close the pull up handle was also change and has a lighter less sturdy feel to it contacted solo via their website but got no response to my concerns above
bag is beautiful , rich leather , nice color looks like a product costing # x as much unfortunately , the seam on one of the handles started separating immediately and had <unk> need to find a repair shop
this full leather bag by us luggage was great for travel i used this for six years for business travel and it proved durable and performed well as noted by other reviewers , it is a bit heavy even empty , but the durability and looks were worth it for me unfortunately my bag recently fell when the shoulder strap pulled loose on one side , and the wheel on one side broke off , leaving a hole on the corner i would buy this again , but would look for a model with no wheels . or telescoping handle
i bought this case as a direct identical replacement for its predecessor , which lasted me for # years and # flights , which was pretty good this case is n't quite the same , though , as it has fewer internal compartments -lrb- cheap saving ? -rrb- and the inside smells of animal glue now made in china , so it 's cheap and good value , and it might be as good as before
i really like this bag the color and the leather is really nice and it is very light weight it was shipped on time too i had to return it because i mistakenly ordered the wrong size i wish they have it for # . # & # # ; laptops
the case is made of nice soft leather with rollers and retractable handle fits neatly under an airline seat or in a smaller overhead bin great assortment of pockets for storing files or items
after my last laptop bag was stolen , it was time to search for a new one i checked customer reviews and product details of probably # or # bags i ended up with this one and it was everything i was looking for it 's a hair heavier that a similar product without wheels would have been , but , it has wheels it could easily pass for a `` standard `` laptop bag with the handle <unk> into the bag it looks professional and it works well also , the included laptop sleeve is handy for airports
looked at many of them was concerned about the tipping problem feedback after couple of weeks of usage , i am very happy with this product i would recommend this product for the frequent travelers
i really like the functionality and look of this briefcase i ordered the chocolate one but it 's so dark that it looks almost black when the case arrived , it did not include the removable accessories bag as stated in the description i just went to the manufacturer 's website and sent an email to their customer service they apologized and shipped one out to me immediately so far , i have not had any problems with the bag whatsoever it does n't fall over and the handle works great
i have had this back for close to six months now and using it on daily basis the only issue i see is that when the bag is full , it topples easily when placed on the floor
i should have checked out the weight of this briefcase before purchasing it 's heavier than i expected even without the # lb laptop computer i carry in it it has lots of storage , but when you fill it with papers , etc . it becomes even heavier , of course otherwise , it 's well constructed and will last a lifetime the fabric on the outside is very durable and looks good it has great padding around the computer compartment , which is some kind of foam this may not last a lifetime
it replaces my computer backpack which i was getting too old for the only problem is that it does n't quite fit under the seat in an airplane , so i have to store it up above
<unk> <unk> , i love this bag , and would have graded higher if it had n't arrived with one of the zippers coming loose from <unk> otherwise , classy and perfect for laptops in the # & # # ; range
i have a new -lrb- ish -rrb- # `` macbook pro & thought i 'd go <unk> finding a travel case for it this briefcase works wonderfully well & i really like the padded laptop sleeve very sturdy too the only drawback is that it can be a bit tippy when open and the laptop is removed
i bought this item for my boyfriend as a christmas gift , and he absolutely loved it it really is a great product -- it 's very good quality with lots of <unk> great for business men who carry a laptop and other paperwork with them on a regular basis i have no complaints about this purchase
now , this what i should of ordered before its always best to go with <unk> do n't let it pass due to price <unk> always have great deals and valuable customer service please make sure its sold by amazon because if something goes wrong there 's no worries or hassle well , these briefcase is exactly as advertised its great looking and feels good knowing your laptop is well secured inside these briefcase all zippers and materials are all great quality and even the inside <unk> the cool feature i like that open flip cover closes with ease without you zipping or zippering its kind neat and unique i highly recommend to everyone who wants quality and security for your beloved laptop
i love this briefcase it is somewhat large but it has to be to hold my # . # `` hp computer fits perfectly along with spot for spare battery , pens , notebooks , kindle , and numerous paperwork it looks professional and good for a man but still alright for women as well the padding around the computer is sufficient and much better then any i looked at i would highly recommend this
this is simultaneously lovely , sturdy and roomy with the <unk> addition of great price economy the component construction material seems to be of durable quality also to round out what in my opinion is indeed a premium laptop briefcase
if you are looking at this you already know how hard it is to buy a bag for a # inch laptop this seems well built lots of pockets and not heavy note that it has very little leather on it
i originally purchase this because it looked professional and classy , but it was much bigger than i realize there was a good amount of extra space after putting my # . # `` notebook in , i was hoping for more cushion do n't get me wrong , the tote itself is sleek and looks beautiful , but just not what i was looking for and expected i ended up giving it to a friend
the tote looks professional and classy it has a thin compartment for your files , and pockets for your cellphone , cards and pens after putting your laptop inside , there will still be enough space to put your personal belongings , such as your wallet , <unk> , a paper notebook , etc . i only have two wishes that the top was zippered # that the bag had an additional padded divider to put my laptop in on one side and my personal stuff on the other not having a neoprene case for your laptop would mean that it might get scratched if you put other things on your tote all in all it 's a good tote for the ~ $ # price
i love the fact that this bag has a sleek design , yet has room for my cords and materials to take notes there are even pockets for smaller accessories the straps are long enough to go over my shoulder - a big plus for traveling the is only drawback is that it 's not the best carry-on for air travel i have taken it on one trip flying coach this bag does n't fit under the seat in front of me very well once i had this worked out , i had to make sure the opening was away from me to prevent things from slipping out during <unk> and <unk> a zipper closer would do wonders still i think it 's a great bag overall
i love it ! it is light and easy to carry looks sharp too i have a # `` thinkpad t # x series laptop and this is the perfect amount of space allows you to carry the laptop , charger and notebook and a folder or papers without being too heavy like my backpack was cute pocket for my phone and pens
this is a strangely shaped bag but it works for most laptops the handles are long and it makes the bag easy to carry the bag is also does n't bend easily so it 's great for protecting a laptop there are plenty of pockets and space inside , and the material is very good quality
used the targus ladies essential notebook tote to hold my laptop while travelling around the world , it 's excellent and durable , highly <unk> and for a well priced here at amazon has enough room to hold all the wires , papers , cellphone and other while looking very stylish and lovely handles make it comfortable to carry on the shoulder or even carrying it in ones hand it looks great , if you are shorter and carry it this way it may touch the ground , this is a great buy
bought this bag for my wife price : very <unk> : very sharp , nice looking bag my wife said there are many people said her bag looks <unk> : with cell phone , pen holders etc . # . may be half inch thicker so she can put a binder in the
i bought this in october # i have used it , lightly , most weeks i am not a student , but have a home office that gets transported in my backpack all three outer zippers have failed -lrb- aka the teeth -rrb- by not staying locked together very frustrating when traveling
swissgear will not honor their life time warranty if you do n't keep the receipt or proof of purchase mine is falling apart the stitching on the shoulder straps are coming lose
i just wanted a bag to hold my laptop securely and have some space to store some books for school this bag definitely has ample room but even with nothing in it it 's heavy and bulky with my laptop and just a few notebooks and folders it weighs probably around # pounds when full , it probably would n't even fit under seats on an airplane for a small girl like me it 's unwieldy and i 've not really used it since i 've gotten it , which defeats the purpose so just beware when purchasing , it 's better suited for someone of a larger frame who does n't mind the bulk and weight
the backpack is too heavy remember that the # pounds it weighs is as much as a laptop if i would have realized the difference that weight would have made , i would have purchased an ogio or something else with less weight on the flip side , the extra weight does bring added protection for a laptop i personally do n't see the benefit
i really like this bag and <unk> a lot before i got it for my laptop it is very comfortable but i do not like that it expands out so much i would have preferred a wider bag or one that was n't so large in expanding outwards , which makes it really heavy and hard to use on public transportation like a subway for example
this is a good , sturdy backpack for a good price ; lots of pockets , well padded , etc . good for transporting your laptop through the airport , and i especially like the way it is constructed to stand up when set down on a flat surface drawbacks : -lrb- # -rrb- it is a little oversized to fit underneath an airplane seat ; it will go , but it takes some forcing -lrb- # -rrb- no cell phone pouch on the shoulder strap my last backback had one on the right shoulder strap , and i miss that convenience i also would have liked a clip on the outside of the backpack , and some pen/pencil sleeves , but those are quibbles not perfect , but a good backpack for the price
i have a bulky old # & # # ; laptop that slides in to the backpack without a problem and it 's well protected the pack stands up very well on it 's own , which <unk> in loading and quick access an interesting feature is an open pocket -lrb- that does not have a zipper closed -rrb- in the middle of the pack at first i was skeptical but it makes it easier to quickly stuff in a small clothing items or something -lrb- not valuable -rrb- that you want to grab quickly these packs are all about giving you storage options and this one fits the bill well one thing to note - these packs are n't light so i would n't recommend going hiking with it unless you have a sherpa
i had the pegasus and needed something smaller this was the answer it fits all my daily folders and my laptop perfectly and the ergonomics is great this brand is so good that my girlfriend claimed my pegasus
if you carry a larger laptop , this bag is great i like it for when i travel for work i can fit my laptop and everything else i need to carry on to the plane if it is just an overnight trip , i can fit everything into this one bag keeps my laptop nice and safe not in love with all the <unk> bits and loops , but perhaps someone is using them since i get cold easily , i like that i can tuck my sweater through the <unk> for easy access without having to dig through my bag
it is not quite as big as it <unk> , i can not fit both of my # & # # ; binders in it for that kind of size , you need the far more expensive ibex however everything else is <unk> laid out and handy
the bag has plenty of storage and it 's very strong and durable that said , it may not be the best choice for the new <unk> of # `` laptops i got a new hp pavilion dv # `` widescreen laptop for school , and i was hoping that the bag would be the right size it 's pretty close , but the zippers are right against the frame of the computer when zipped it should be great for # . # `` screen laptops the rest of the backpack is great the quality is top notch , and there is plenty of storage and pockets and mesh everywhere
the backpack arrived just in time to take it as my carry on for a trip to the west coast i have not used a backpack for that purpose and was <unk> with it to replace my usual wheeled small luggage it worked great and i will not be using the small luggage again for a carry on everything i needed was easily accessible which was wonderful in the airports and also in the plane i took a lot of clothes with me in it and the backpack fit easily in the overhead great purchase and great product
# out of # <unk> is the best notebook pack i have ever used the quality is excellent : heavy-duty zippers and strong plastic reinforcements at the bottom the grip is round and comfortable , all straps are adjustable , and there is thick padding on back and straps the pack is visually very appealing and provides great comfort even when carrying heavy loads the side-pockets are a little narrow and long and i do n't really use them this is a great <unk> / <unk> backpack with lots of space
this is a big backpack and can get heavy but if you are traveling and want to store as much gear in as few bags as possible , then i could reccomend this pack like all swiss made items it is well made and has numerous <unk> to hold whatever you may need , i carry my laptop and digital camera in it when i
i know this is a laptop bag , but what caught my eye when i saw this bag in a store is the front compartment and straps it is big enough to hold a bike helmet at last a bag that will hold my <unk> gear for <unk> -lrb- and in between for storage -rrb- there is room for multiple pairs of shoes and clothes a top and front pocket for small items two side pockets for water bottles a great price from a quality brand ; a great combo i have had other wenger bags in the past and love the heavy duty construction
wenger swissgear maxxum <unk> love the swissgear backpack because of its make the inside is soft and cushioned so my laptop will not be damaged in any way , especially when i have to take it out at the airports i also like the straps for my shoulder as i carry my books to amd from classes
i absolutely love this backpack ! ! in the months it took me to find this product i probably tried every other brand of backpack on the market and none of them come close to the comfort , capacity and styling of this bag it is well built i fly from <unk> to ca frequently and carry a fujitsu t # laptop , along with literally a ton of books with my previous bags my back would ache under the weight , but with this one i hardly feel like i have it on it fits perfectly under my seat even on the small commuter plane i particularly like the padded compartment -lrb- intended for an ipod or cd player -rrb- which i use for my digital voice <unk> and camera i also like the way the padding supports the weight yet still allows for the air to circulate - an important factor for those living in hot climates to consider
my son received a similar backpack and loves it my husband found that traveling with his laptop case was not convenient and decided he wanted one like our son 's he is quite happy with it
i recently purchased two laptop backpacks and a leather laptop <unk> all three were swiss army , not certain if all were wenger although the portfolio was top of the line i discovered that the backpack was a better way to go so i returned the portfolio of the two backpacks the maxxum is the one i selected for everyday use it does a wonderful job my office is on the fourth floor and i take the stairs up instead of the <unk> the backpack is definitely better since i live in florida i really appreciate the way the padding can breathe and the suspension system <unk> much of the stress i would recommend this to anyone with or without a laptop
i live on a college campus and have on average three different buildings to go to in a day i specifically got this to cart around my macbook pro # `` and it works perfectly it has enough room to hide a body in and very solidly built as long as you 're not throwing the thing against the wall , you 're mbp will be safe and sound
i bought the exact same backpack couple years back , and it 's been traveling around with me all over the globe this backpack is big enough for a # inch laptop and enough to put a week worth of your traveling belongs in it pricey but worth the <unk> <unk> good looking
i saw this backpack at <unk> coat factory so i bought it , it only cost me # $ they have them tag as luggage i am taking summer classes , i carry my samsung laptop , four to five books , an umbrella in case it rains , bottles of water , and my lunch i still have lots and lots of space to put more stuff in . it has lots of comparments , it has little slots to put <unk> and pens in and more its a great purchase overall , great for college
i think i have had this thing for close to # years now and it still looks great and is near new condition i have abused it through college , a # year trip overseas , and grad school i still use it daily commuting into work zippers and stitchings area all intact the right shoulder strap , just now after almost a decade of daily use , is starting to lose its stitching a little i still use it , however , and it is fine ca n't recommend this backpack enough
i 've had this back pack for a few years i use it to bring my gear to work or carry my laptop when i travel it 's held up really well and i ca n't think of getting any other kind of bag to replace it i might hold out for a sale , but my current bag is on it 's last legs and the shock absorber straps are starting to ware out -lrb- you really notice the difference when they stop working -rrb- i have to admit , i 've abused this bag and its still held up over the years i also hate to get a new one and take old <unk> here to the shed to put it out of it 's <unk> maybe i can fix it
this backpack is perfect for college students you will never have an excuse for not having your books and laptop on you there is plenty of room in all the pockets , and the backpack is very comfortable the straps fit nicely , and the mesh padding keeps your back cool and comfortable the laptop case is fairly well protected , keeping the laptop off the bottom of the backpack by about # inches the only criticism is that it is a little big - and a lot of people seem to have it on my <unk> line : if you want a great backpack for a very affordable price this is your
i generally dont leave reviews for products but i have to say i love this backpack i bought it about # years ago and it has traveled halfway across the world with me , from kenya to spain to <unk> to california and oregon at the time it was on sale and fit my college student needs as a bike delivery person current it has met my needs for almost a year . with a massive amount of pockets i can keep a few extra layers incase it gets cold plus whatever i am delivering unfortunately several of the zippers are now broken so it must be retired i definitely got my moneys worth as i have worn this for hundreds if not thousands of hours with hard use i will be ordering a replacement
some reviewers say it 's on the heavy side , but this is a great pack without a doubt great arrangement of pockets , nice padding , more room than you 'll likely need has a flap and clips do you can put a bike helmet on the back could use some pockets on the straps or waste band has a nice feature where it can stand by itself seems ruggedly made , and that fact that the laptop is held in by a clip buckle is a little safer in case you leave a zipper open on some hiking packs , there are buckles that have a <unk> molded in that 's a good idea that costs only a few <unk> , but adds a key safety feature you never know when that could come in handy
i have had this backpack for about # years and it has been great the durability is phenomenal most backpacks last me about a year because the straps break , but this one is still going strong i would keep this backpack stuffed full and would carry it all day long with me and have had no problems there is a ton of storage space for anything i usually keep my calculator in one of the zip up side pouches the media pouch on top or a `` cd `` player i used it for pencils , pens , markers and other mic . items i would recommend this for high school , college , day packs or hiking there really isnt any cons , i guess the only one would be the lack of variety of colors edit : have had this backpack for almost # years and is still holding up strong and i still use it every day
i work in the it field and this bag works perfect for me there are a ton of pockets and i like how easy my laptop fits in the pocket i am completely satisfied with this purchase
i have to say i 'm completely satisfied with the backpack it has a lot of room and pockets for almost anything , and it 's very comfortable i 'd also like to mention that , besides the backpack itself , the whole transaction went great i am very happy with my purchase
this backpack has plenty of storage space , along with a spot for a laptop if necessary it will accommodate a wide screen laptop -lrb- i.e . # `` wide screen -rrb- it is well <unk> , great for commuting to work on a bike many pockets for good organization and easy access the shock <unk> padding for your back allows air to travel through avoiding the possibility of having a sweat soaked back after using it also makes the pack sit lighter on the back , mine weighs about # pounds fully loaded and this is <unk> the strap across the chest reduces the <unk> strain while using the backpack the price is perfect , basically just the cost of a tank of gas , however no gas needed when commuting by bike
this backpack works wonders for a college student it 's great for techy guys like me who own laptops and other devices <unk> is one of the best brands for backpacks it has stood up to wet floors -lrb- it has a rubber bottom -rrb- and protects my precious laptop the main pouch is spacious and all of the other pouches are useful
this thing has a ton of pockets , it 's comfortable to carry around and cradles my laptop like a baby it 's just the right size for me it could hold either a few books or enough to be my carry-on for a plane ride , but not so much that it 's huge when i 'm just taking the laptop somewhere
after wearing a pack for most of my adult life -lrb- i 'm u.s. marine -rrb- , i 've searched for the best civilian pack to carry the daily stuff in for day trips this is by far the best design i 've seen yet i 've tried many cheap one , ones that i 've <unk> , even old military packs all either lacked quality of construction or were uncomfortable to wear old military packs are nice but lack style and they are green no pack seems perfect but this is as close as i 've found in a # year search good points are the padding , the design of the inside pockets and the straps the only weak spot is the front zipper around the top front pouch
my son just <unk> high school he has <unk> <unk> <unk> a high quality backpack to keep him organized and balanced as <unk> through two samsonite backpacks last year , which literally fell apart , i was very concerned i spotted this backpack in a local store and <unk> impressed with it 's quality i searched online and found <unk> had the best offer now , three weeks into school , my son <unk> and says the backpack is balanced and comfortable to wear we ` <unk> how it goes through the school year i predict good use and no problems
i wanted to follow up the reviewer that said a # . # `` computer will not fit in this pack because of this review , i took my hp dv # , # . # `` notebook to best buy to see if this backpack would be suitable for me my computer fit in it just fine perhaps wenger has made adjustments to the design , perhaps the reviewer got a lemon , or perhaps not all # . # `` <unk> laptops are within the tolerances that wenger <unk> for regardless my # . # `` computer fit in this pack just fine and i will be buying it
perfect size to fit my # . # `` mac and more than enough room for all my cables and accessories , strong , sturdy and comfortable to cary , with a very acceptable price tag
i 've used this backpack for # years . # loose thread the logo fell off from the top handle lots of signs of wear , but nothing broke this backpack has otherwise exceeded all of my expectations , and i still use it today
i bought this after having a sore back from my many business trips and i am so glad i did it sits higher on the back than a normal backpack and is very comfortable the other great thing is it can sit on the floor without falling over
i ordered this yesterday online and it came within a day which i was very happy about i decided that i am going to start walking instead of using my car for exercise and cause gas prices are so crazy lately and are only gon na get worse first i went to staples to see the product in my hands and if there was enough space well there was alot of space so upon me coming into work today i switched backpacks from an older one that was falling apart to this one there was so much room for everything i had and still had room for my macbook pro # `` i am already in love with this product there was good padding on the back section of the bag so many pockets and compartments i highly recommend this bag to anyone looking for a back pack for their laptop
