wonderful hard case i bought one in clear , red , green , blue and purple ; for my kids and wife guess who i forgot to get one for , you got it , me going to change that now the colors are rich not pale easy to put on , a little harder to take off this and the keyboard cover are a great way to protect your laptop another plus are the legs , they elevate the back of the laptop for better cooling and give my hands a better angle at the keyboard make sure you order the one for your model , in this case a # i believe they make one for every macbook and macbook pro model
i could n't believe that i could still find a case in # i <unk> new life into my # macbook -lrb- # ghz white -rrb- by upgrading the ram and installing an ssd and a new battery -lrb- and wow is it worth it . i extended the life of this thing easily by another # years . i wanted to protect the casing -lrb- and its stickers i have all over the laptop -rrb- with a case i have to say . i like the construction of the case and the little pegs on the bottom it feels solid and i feel a lot less worried about damaging the delicate plastic casing plus , the included keyboard cover is a nice addition
this is exactly what i have been looking for put it on my # macbook , fits like a glove and the feet that prop it up are sturdier than expected i recommend this case for anyone with an # macbook who is looking to extend it 's life another # years
one of the best purchases i have made so far fast shipping , was so simple to put together the price ca n't be beat and it really looks great buy with ease of mind . ipearl # . # `` mcover hard shell case for macbook a # -lrb- clear
anyone who has the original macbook # -lrb- # -rrb- , and ca n't find a protective case that fits , this is the one for you ! i went to apple store to see if they have cases for my macbook # , they did n't have any -lrb- too old ! checked amazon , and they had it ! it was awesome and at a great price , so i bought two -lrb- purple and aqua blue -rrb- awesome , awesome , awesome thank you amazon ! the case is easy to snap on . i used to have a speck when i first bought my macbook -lrb- piece of junk ! ! and expensive $ # ! ! i also like the fact this case has good ventilation anyway , if you want to protect your macbook from scratches and have this model macbook -lrb- a # -rrb- you ca n't go wrong !
i wanted a case for my macbook that would allow me to use it while still being protected i 'm glad i found this product that meets that primarily expectation it also has little feet stands that allow air flow underneath the material is plastic but not really hard plastic which i did n't expect , great surprise
it snaps on so easy and feels snug i will update my review if it breaks or i run into any trouble so far , this case is a hell of a bargain compared to $ # cases selling elsewhere edit # / # the rubber feet on the front fell off in the first # weeks no big deal the spring on one of the legs used to prop it up also is starting to go have n't had a problem with it breaking or scuffing my computer yet though still would recommend this case
recently bought the mcover for my a # apple macbook and i love it the cover offers the protection i need against scratches and dings and dents the optional colors also make it affordable to customize your macbook easy to install and maintain
this product was just as described it fit perfectly on my macbook , and easy to put on i did n't have to look up a how to video , it just took me a few seconds this is perfect and exactly what i was looking for
i have had a macbook for a few years now , and needed a case to continue to keep it in pristine condition the fold down feet are great , changes the angle of the notbook , and provides for some cooling space while you are working i liked this case so much i purchased one for my new mackbook pro the fitment on <unk> cases is outstanding this is bar far the best value and fit fitment is excellent , far better than the other cases i tried clearly i should have gone to ipearl first
this wo n't turn your macbook into a <unk> , but it does add a extra layer of protection against bumps , scratches , and dirt plenty of slots for ventilation , and does not obstruct access to any <unk> or the optical disk drive comes with a silicone keyboard protector
i had recently gotten a new macbook , the black # `` # model , and was <unk> afraid of getting marks on it i went on amazon and found the mcover for macbook and i instantly fell in love it arrived quickly and in good packaging installation was a snap and i did n't even know i was able to get the free keyboard cover also that was a nice bonus the case protects and allows me to raise up my macbook for easier typing and to keep it cool will definitely buy another mcover for my other electronic products
protects my macbook great it gives greater hinge movement than other cases i have had it is easy to get on does not create a heat trap well , ventilated especially when prompted up if you want to keep your macbook safe , this is it
received a free clear cover from ipearl after purchasing another cover and leaving a review the cover does a good job of protecting your computer and fits my original macbook very well the legs that come with the cover makes typing much easier and less pressure on your wrists , for those who are typing all day a good product
this cover is for the old macbooks only not pro , air , or macbooks after # i have a # white macbook , and this cover snapped on top and bottom easily it looks nice it 's got a <unk> surface , so i 'm hoping that it wo n't collect dirt and grime like my old clear case , which made my laptop look dingy the feet are nice for changing the angle of your wrists and keeping your computer cooler i also got a free clear keyboard cover overall good deal for the half the price of other cases
the first time i ordered a translucent case , but i received a painted one . <unk> time i ordered a white macbook case , but was given a macbook pro case instead
i ordered this cover from amazon because apple no longer sells its hard shell case for my white # in macbook , purchased fall # i had difficulty finding a hard shell that fits my laptop on <unk> and amazon however , when i saw the specs for the aqua ipearl model on amazon , i thought it would fit but to no avail , a waste of money i could n't even put the cover on the laptop , too small not only did the shell not fit , it is of inferior quality , no comparison to the the hard shell covers once sold by apple for the macbook
i bought this for my # macbook , hoping to shield it from further damage it works absolutely great , if you do n't need to open your laptop with both pieces on a <unk> cracking noise happened every time i opened mine taking the bottom portion off helped
i bought this for my young daughter to protect her mac because she tends to be rough with her laptop it has n't fell off of broke and i bought it well over a couple months ago it 's just the see-through plastic casing but for the price it 's a good bargain
i got my mac as a graduation present in june # this cover says it should work for macs before oct # and so i figured it would work there really is n't any other choices for covers for macs that are # years old while it snapped on the top of my mac just fine , the bottom does n't fit the two little pieces that hold the back of the mac -lrb- near the hinges -rrb- do not snap on the cover stays on , but it creaks which is pretty annoying the cover also adds a lot of weight to my mac i will probably leave it on for a while since i spent $ # on it , but my mac was fine without it
i was so impressed with my service from this vendor from the beginning : i received this item before the specified shipping arrival date the protector cover snaps on perfectly and fits like a glove the <unk> legs and air grooves on the bottom are a nice convenience to date , i 've experienced no problems and i would definitely recommend this vendor and this item to all
this fits my computer -lrb- black macbook # -rrb- nicely and is easy to put on , but difficult to take off this is especially problematic since dirt and debris still manage to get under the plastic and collect in certain areas it also makes the computer more bulky , and the plastic tabs at the bottom have broken off i have since removed the case from my laptop and <unk> it for travel when my computer needs extra protection
the case fits , however it took several attempts to get all the tabs for the bottom case to grip the computer this case is definitely not recommended if you want to change up the color frequently because it 's a challenge to take off
this is a very attractive hard case that snaps on easily , and seems hardy enough to withstand my constant traveling my only disappointment is that this case does n't come with the free keyboard skin that other ipearl hard cases do if protecting your keyboard is important to you , you 'll have to order a skin separately otherwise , no complaints
i was searching for a tiffany blue case for my first generation of the white macbook and i decided on this case like other reviews have said , you ca n't put your screen all the way back which is n't that big of a deal the only concern i have is getting the case on and off i was able to take it off a few times but not without a fight again , not that big of a deal but something that should be mentioned the case is a nice color , the apple logo shines through the back which is cool i 'd say great case for the price
i found this after seeing my macbook was starting to show signs of wear - it came in less than a week and was easy to snap on without struggling fits snug and i do n't think it 's gon na easily come off -lrb- certainly not accidentally case is light , shows the glowing apple on front when on and gives my macbook a wow factor <unk> easy to figure out what model to order too from the description good value and service
case fits like a glove however , i ca n't help but compare this to the incase case i am replacing this case does not seem to be as sturdy at all as it 's not as thick and way more flexible it also does not cover as much of the macbook which also makes me uneasy like i said , only time will tell considering that the incase was about $ # i guess this one is as good as you 're going to get for $ #
i just received the aqua ipearl mcover -lrb- tm -rrb- today for my # . # `` macbook so far i like it quite a bit the aqua blue is very cute and i like the fact that it 's only $ # bucks compared to $ # bucks and higher the built-in retractable feet are a nice feature to this cover , but the only flaw on mine is the right retractable foot squeaks and acts as if it 's on too tight im also glad to have full access to all the ports and dvd slot i would recommend this cover to a student like me looking for a good protection case for there expensive macbook
the cover is hard plastic which is great nice choice of colours i have the typical mac cracks , but the cover does n't remedy that all and all a nice product
... but my son loves it he spent the whole afternoon just looking at it and <unk> happy how cool his computer looks like i guess it was worth the money
i 'm not an on-line shopper and was very hesitate about this purchase my order was delivered in just a couple of days if you are looking for a cover for your mac book look no further not only that it is very stylish looking , it sure serves the purpose
i was very pleased with the ipearl hard shell case for my # . # `` macbook the bottom part of the case clicked in very easily , but getting the case on the top cover was a bit more challenging the -lrb- aqua -rrb- case is well-designed , sturdy and attractive and met my expectations
i got the aqua cover from i-pearl because my brand-new mac -lrb- a christmas present from my husband -rrb- was getting scratched up going back and forth to the office everyday i love the color -lrb- which is why i selected this product -rrb- and so does everyone else at the office i get compliments on it wherever i am and i just love that i do n't have to worry about being <unk> anymore i had a zip-up case but got tired of having to take my laptop out and put it back so this solution worked great arrived quickly , super easy to snap on , love the little feet on the bottom that help raise the angle a bit i would definitely recommend it
i got this cover bundled with one for my hp and i was beyond satisfied with it the color was great , and even though it seems like the square on the apple is a little weird , once it 's on , it looks fantastic i want one in every color they are a little hard to take off but why would you want to this is a great buy , and i 'm definitely going to be buying a new one in the near future
i am very pleased with this product once you attach it to your macbook it is very sleek i also love the color the variety of colors for this product is a great range there are also two pieces of plastic in the back that fold out to prop up the computer this is perfect when you are typing on a high table it makes typing much more easier on the mac i feel that my computer is very protected with this hard shell case over-all , i am very pleased with this purchase
this product is soooo amazing first of all , it was delivered really fast when i opened the package and unwrapped the case , i was so amazed the case looks exactly like how it is pictured and it is super easy to snap on the color was exactly what i wanted i could not be anymore happier with my case
searched high and low to find aqua blue hard shell case for macbook model # a # purchased for my daughter back in # where other hard cases failed to fit this one did like a glove ! great hard to find aqua blue color that my daughter loved and wanted bonus was the aqua blue <unk> cover ! very happy !
i was a bit skeptical at first because the cost of this shell cover is so much cheaper than others , but frankly , i 'm really happy with it it takes about # seconds to snap on , leaves access to all ports , has vents on the bottom , and is a super cute color it also has those really awesome feet that prop it up about # degrees and allow the vents on the bottom to get some air i 'm a satisfied buyer
purchased for my daughter 's new pc and she just loves it likes the blue color she sticks pictures of her friends between the pc and the cover to make it personal
this cover is fantastic the aqua blue goes really well with the white and is doing a fantastic job of keeping my macbook protected it 's also a great price for an older model of macbook i 've had my case for a few weeks now and i am very pleased with how it has worked for me
having an older macbook , product offerings can be somewhat limited and of poor quality when you do find them so i was pleasantly surprised when i received this cover the tabs did n't break off immediately when snapping it in place -lrb- past experience -rrb- , and it fit perfectly would buy from this vendor again ... good stuff
bought this as a gift after my own turned out to be so awesome now , my mother has used it for over # years and she loves it would definitely buy again if needed but the first one was so darn good
this cover was very easy to put on my mac and now i wish i would 've found it sooner so i could 've prevented my computer getting as scratched as it is it has done a good job of stopping anymore scratching from happening and the appearance is quite nice i would give the ipearl # stars , and would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a nice , sturdy cover to put on their mac
i love this case as most of you know , its quite hard to find a shell for the a # macbooks since the new version cam out so i was happily surprised to find such a good one i really like the color and found that it matches the photos provided -lrb- which is sometimes a different color -rrb- the little legs below are also really handy , and i find it very useful whenever i have to do a lot of typing my laptop used to click whenever i opened it -lrb- which was very scary -rrb- but ever since i put this case on it the clicking stopped i 've already dropped my laptop twice with this case , and the case took the brunt of the fall i highly recommend this case
i actually ordered a separate keyboard cover because there was nothing mentioned about this product including it well , there was one enclosed with the case snapped on easily , feet work well , and we love the color nice for this white computer model that gets dirty and does n't hold up well
i 've had my laptop for about # years and just now decided to get a case i feel a lot better knowing that my computer has a bit of protection and i do n't have to worry about scratches i had to get my macbook <unk> at the apple store , and even one of the workers at the genius bar complimented it and said i 'm obviously taking good care of it my only complaint is that it took a while to get everything snapped in place , but otherwise , good purchase
the plastic is great , feels sturdy to the touch , and provides some peace of mind -lrb- in terms of it not breaking any time soon -rrb- but the real <unk> here are the little feet ... yes , the bottom case has two retractable feet that make all the difference they raise the laptop a couple of inches off the table , and provide it with some extra breathing room typing in this position works well for me it 's now routine to pull out these little feet whenever i take the good ol ' macbook to a cafe or the library the price is right , the materials are reliable and worth every penny , and the design is really cool
great product - makes our older mac look so much fun ! apple stores do n't carry this so was happy to see it on amazon was shipped fast and perfect shape would love to get another color one day
i recently purchased this item for myself and i love it i especially love the legs to make it easier for typing on a flat surface and prevent the macbook from over heating i loved it so much , i bought another one for my husband 's macbook
the hard shell cover fits like a dream and i love the feet on the bottom that helps the computer to vent and not get hot however , the unexpected and free keyboard cover that came with it was a nice touch but it was for a macbook pro and did n't fit
i love having a hard case cover on my apple macbook it fits perfectly and serves as a protection for my laptop this cover fits the <unk> macbook , not the new models
just received my ipearl # . # `` mcover hard shell case for macbook a # -lrb- aqua -rrb- and i am very impressed the case fits like a glove and was very easy to put on the plastic is thick and offers superb protection for my macbook the aqua color is beautiful and translucent , so the apple logo is still visible i am very happy with my purchase and only have one regret - i wish i would have bought it sooner i definitely recommend this case
fits perfect for an older white macbook ; color is vivid and bright , the matching keyboard cover compliments well it gave my old <unk> white old scratched up macbook a new hip life
the product is great was shipped out fast and great customer service when i emailed got a quick response back and everything i must say everything was done very
my friend has the older model of macbook , and i was looking everywhere online to find a cover to fit it if you have an older macbook , this is basically your only choice of hard covers however , this is a pretty good cover , the blue was very pretty and she loved it i just wish it did n't have that square around the logo , i do n't like it that much , but it depends on your own opinion if you like it or not the pop-out legs are pretty cool this is the only macbook cover with legs to stand it up
just as the title says ; fits like a glove and does the job the case hugs the computer very well also , the leg stands are nice color is just as shows only negative thing is that the case is hard to take off once you put it on , you better not be planning to take it off without a few scrapes and bruises i had to use my case remover to get it off to clean ol mac underneath if you 're thinking about buying it , buy it it 's really nice and the color is vibrant
i have a white macbok from # and the plastic on the macbook cracks in order to keep my macbook from cracking , i bought this case and i am so glad that i did although it is not rubbery like most clip on hard cases , the plastic was durable and a great color the case is still living strong today
the ipearl cover fits my white a # macbook so well and protects it from all of the scratches i was very thankful to have found this product on here because not many sellers have covers for this older macbook at such a reasonable price
this cover would be ok i guess if we could figure out how to order the correct fit the ipearl # . # `` mcover hard shell case for macbook a # -lrb- aqua -rrb- did not fit you have given us a refund , thank you very much
i wanted a small case to carry around my new asus # he netbook i wish i had read all the reviews problems are exactly as others have reported the case is small and you have to be careful not to scratch the edges of the netbook when closing the zipper besides this , the outside pocket on this case does n't even hold the ac adapter without causing a bulge in the case also , although the case is advertised as having a `` memory `` foam lining , it is hardly more protective than the free carrying case that comes with the asus # he i think the case is a wasted of money , as many others are available
i got this for my asus eee pc # years ago and it was ultimately <unk> the asus , which only cost me $ # , has proved insanely durable it fits in my purse , but not if i carry it in this bulky thing would not buy again will continue to buy small , inexpensive computers that i do n't care about beating up a bit much more practical for me
this case looks great in the photos but , when it comes to functionality , it 's not worth the price yes , it 's true , the memory foam is a nice protection feature but , the side pouch does n't hold much of anything , has no depth - because of the `` flat `` base , and the zippers scrape the corners of the computer i actually had to push down on the netbook in order to zip the case shut i 'm selling this one , and got another case with excellent protection , and much more room sorry , folks at asus , you missed it on this one
does not fit a ten inch netbook etc . too small and snug , i feel the zipper since it fits too tight for a ten inch screen could damage your pc device
this case does n't fit very well for asus eee pc # ha when you put your netbook into the case , zips scratchs the corners very horrible also , it is not deep enough for # cell battery i would not recommend this case for asus eee pc # ha even it has the memory foam and the front pocket -lrb- very useless after you put # ha in , there is no room for other things -rrb- , but the size is not really what i want i need to buy another case now
this case is well made , the front pouch is nice , materials seems to be of good quality -- all in all i would give it # stars except for one thing it 's way too tight i can barely squeeze my asus # ha into it the zippers are extremely tight around the corners and i worry about the stress this might place on the netbook hopefully , it will stretch a bit and loosen up some i can see no reason for the case to be so tight , they could have allowed a little more room in the corners and it would have been perfect update # : it did stretch a little , enough to be usable , but it 's still a tight fit
this leatherette case was a little bit bigger than the # . # inch netbook -lrb- asus eee # he -rrb- that it was purchased for a little sloppy on the corners for workmanship but much better protection than the stretchable case that came with the netbook the front pocket is really only useful for either the power cord or an external <unk> drive , not both but it is easier to carry around , even slides into a briefcase zippers are well-made , no problems so far
the case is a great fit for the netbook and very protective it has a simple , business casual look to it as well the only downside is that the power cord and a/c adapter do not fit too well in the respective pocket on the top of the case -lrb- as pictured . with the addition of a small <unk> mouse , space is cramped and limited
after looking for a case for the acer aspire one netbook , i found this # -inch case i 'm glad i did this case looks good , and has a convenient pouch to fit a power cord , mouse , and earbuds four straps hold the computer in place inside the case -lrb- two clear plastic straps at the top , two black elastic straps at the bottom -rrb- a netbook fits snugly inside , with sturdy padding for protection removing the netbook from the case when stationary is recommended to avoid overheating also , when carrying , always zip up both sides of the case , and get a replacement power cord shorter than the one that 's included with your netbook for an easier fit in the pouch this is a good choice at a good price
it 's a tight fit at first but the case expands after a few weeks of use adapter fits in side pocket , also snug , i worry about screen damage but maybe i 'm obsessed overall good case
bought this for my asus # he this is a great little case for any # `` netbook i use the outside pocket for my wireless mouse , a gps receiver , and the occasional jump drive the case is built well i was worried the clear straps that hold the screen would be distracting , but no , they are n't access to ports on both sides is no problem , except the sd card slot is under the right side bungee that holds the keyboard in the case , but that 's just my # he it great , just unzip it , open it up , power up , and start computing
asus eee pc # ha # -inch netbook premium memory foam pouch case with front pocket - -lrb- black this small padded case is the perfect traveling and storage companion for the # inch asus netbook the netbook fits it nicely , and the small storage pouch can hold the powercord and owners manual so far , durability of the case seems very good
i just got my case on saturday and my acer # `` has been in it ever since fits great with the # cell battery the pocket has room enough for the power & small mouse i do n't usually carry my external dvd with it anyways no problem with heat issues , when using acer in the case , i do turn it off before zipping up the case though great for working from multiple locations as i do
this is a really nice carry case protects your <unk> from scratches just leave it in the case all the time , it unzips & your labtop sits open like if it did n't have a case the labtop does ` nt get that hot no need to worry about getting to hot in case the extra side pouch on the side of the case is really nice for carrying extra stuff like wireless mouse , jump drives , passports or ac power cords
this little carrying case for the # `` mini laptop is perfect for stowing not only the mini laptop , but has a zippered pouch large enough to hold the ac adapter as well as a mini mouse it 's compact and keeps everything you need in one place so you can carry your mini laptop anywhere with ease
i looked around for a carrying case that would offer a little protection , fit exactly right , and have a pouch for the ac power supply and a small mouse i did n't really like what i was seeing until i saw this one it fits perfectly and is the best case i have seen for my asus # ha it arrived # days after i placed the order you can not go wrong with this
this product holds my laptop and power cords and slim external dvd rw and plugs for that too this also has little spots to secure the laptop to the case so it does not slide around inside of it they were very fast in delivering the product
fit my asus eeepc perfectly along with cord and mouse in outer pocket but it bulged out pretty good good quality for price , good foam padding inside
this bag is fine if you do not want to carry a laptop in it with other things as soon as you put the laptop in there , there is no room for anything else i am returning it
i really was excited to receive this laptop bag in the mail it 's very cute and has lots of space to store stuff other than the laptop itself the only thing i was suprised to see is that the inside of the bag is light brown color i had assumed that the interior would be black like the outside of the bag not too big of a deal though overall , i love this messenger bag
this is exactly what i wanted it does not have a lot of extra room for anything other than my laptop a a thin notebook , but that was what i expected from <unk> the earlier reviews it is well made and travels well
i spent over an hour choosing a bag for my brand-new dell laptop , which measures # inches this bag , at # x # x # inches according to amazon , seemed to fit the bill unfortunately , amazon 's description is wrong when my laptop would n't fit , i measured the bag , and found it 's barely # inches on the outside there 's a targus hang tag that gives exterior dimensions at # . # . # and laptop compartment at # . # inches , which seems accurate , so i do n't know why amazon has wrong dimensions yes , i 've reported the bad description i 'm going on a trip tonight and now i ca n't take my new laptop , so i 'm pretty unhappy with amazon plus , i have to start all over and hope that the next bag i order from amazon will be accurately described -lrb- there 's no selection locally for my size laptop . do n't pay any attention to the stars -- amazon 's site would n't accept this review unless i put * something *
does the trick not at all stylish but no one at tsa and none of the other people at the airport seemed to care holds extra stuff so the heavy laptop and brick become only part of the weight it will lug
this is a nice little bag besides a roomy , padded pouch for your laptop , it has a good amount of space for books , folders , pens , etc . our hp # us -lrb- # . # `` wide-screen -rrb- fits with ease no issues going through airport security either just unzip the middle and lay it flat on the screening belt went right though in <unk> , phoenix and chicago
i am a <unk> consultant , so i carry around my laptop , files and folders , extra hard drive etc . this bag allows me to fit all of these comfortably my only <unk> i would have preferred a compartment for my laptop that would allow it to sit horizontally instead of vertically but that 's a personal preference other than that , i am satisfied so far now lets see how long it will
i looked at probably ten bags online and at costco etc . and was very happy to come across this bag as it is just what i was looking for plenty of room for a # `` laptop and for a ton of other stuff just took it down on a business trip and it was perfect for carrying on to the plane
just right pockets for storing gear it fit my # `` laptop snugly and <unk> , like an <unk> shielding her hundreds of fragile <unk> i was able to unzip and lay it flat to go through airport security # times with no problems shoulder strap is wide and comfortable eventually i will customize this bag with stickers that contain <unk> yet off color <unk>
the product is great i needed to replace my computer bag because of a broken zipper i had seen this type of bag in a <unk> magazine -lrb- not this exact one , but bags with the same concept -rrb- , and i searched for a similar product on amazon -lrb- better price -rrb- first of all , the zippers seem to be really strong , so no issue there next , the storage pockets are designed well i 've also gone through airport security now a few times and this is really the great selling point it saves so much time and aggravation in the security process so , great bag , great storage , and great through security just like they advertise big thumbs up
this is a good quality case and you can tell was designed properly for airport travel first of all , the way the case unzips in half is perfect for going through security and not having to remove your laptop from the case secondly , the pockets are well designed and divided to carry a lot of material and still keep it organized and easy to get to the easy access pockets on the outside are great for putting your boarding pass and a pack of gum in for quick accessibility , as well overall , very well constructed , comfortable to carry , and everything stays organized highly recommend ! !
this thing is light and huge , can comfortably include all essentials for an overnight trip , if you do n't mind the shoulder weight enough cushioning for a # & # # ; laptop compartment -lrb- with room to spare -rrb- and tons of pockets for hiding valuables the zip-thru capability makes it very convenient at domestic airports , no need to remove laptop -lsb- just note that almost all foreign airports will still require you to remove the laptop -rsb- have used this for maybe # yrs and love it
this bag makes the airline screening process easier and faster than before because it is checkpoint friendly there are plenty of compartments to carry cords , equipment , folders and small books or magazines it is well made with comfortable straps and handles and very nice looking with extra features to attach it to your carry on easily i bought the larger bag to fit the # inch pc and they are not that easy to find this bag worked as advertized in airport screening for a trip to canada so i am very pleased with it
if i have any long distance travel to do , this is the case that i would take i can put most everything in it and not worry about breaking stuff getting through security is a breeze
i 've had this brief a little over # mod and still ca n't believe i paid so little for it i keep expecting something to break or for it to suddenly turn ugly ive gotten so many compliments on it thank you mcklein usa keep up the great
this is a perfect briefcase for a small laptop -lrb- # & # # ; -rrb- plus a couple of files and more the leather is not the most luxurious , but for the price it 's nice enough i love this bag
guys if you do n't like lugging wallets , phones , sunglasses , keys , and a host of other things in your pockets ... this is the bag for you it 's easy to cary or sling over your sholder and looks dressy when in a coat and tie beats looking like your pockets have the <unk>
the case is very stylish and functional , it compliments my mac book air perfectly i would recommend this bag to any <unk> with an ultra book or mac book air
had wanted a leather carrying case without spending a fortune this case is perfect it 's sturdy , well padded , has room for an ipad , some files , chargers , cables , etc . as well as some personal items fit my macbook pro # & # # ; like a glove if you 're looking for really soft leather , you may not like this one since it 's a bit on the stiff side , but it appears it will hold up well
my daughter wanted a new case for her small laptop that included some compartments for business cards , pens , notepads , etc . this fit the bill very well it 's a comfortable size , has all the necessary compartments , and is an attractive leather case she can carry it & # # ; cross-body & # # ; but it also has a zippered pocket in the bottom to hook on a luggage handle for out of town trips
i use this for my toshiba satellite , a mouse and mouse pad an <unk> antenna , and documents too while it has plenty of room and offers great protection i only wish it had a strap ; it is a bit slippery
bought this as a gift for my mom on a deal the # . # `` asus laptop fits snugly which to me seems like the proper fitment for these sleeves the pockets are useful for storing power bricks or associated hardware overall great quality construction the mouse is <unk> and butter logitech , works perfectly , good precision and battery life the usb adapter for the mouse is not `` nano `` sized , but the mouse has a slot underneath you can use to store it
i bought this for my dell latitude d # laptop i had been searching for a case to protect it , and this one came with a bundled wireless mouse - a total bonus for me the laptop is a bit small for the case , but that 's not so important as the fact that the case is padded and protects the laptop from the occasional bump while in transit to and from work if you need a decent case that will <unk> your laptop , then this is the one for you the mouse has worked flawlessly every time i 've used it , and compared to most of the `` cheap `` cordless mice my coworkers use i have not had any issues with it going <unk> and not working right
