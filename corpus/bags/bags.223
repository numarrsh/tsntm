this backpack fits my laptop perfectly , with a little bit of extra space for other items it does n't carry much else in the main compartment besides the laptop , but that keeps it less bulky has three additional zippered compartments for other items shoulders are well padded , sturdy design , well built i do n't understand the purpose of the snap on the front , though , as the front pocket is not actually removable
i bought a # `` asus netbook this case fits it nicely it also has an additional compartment to load your power adapter andother accessories very compact and usable for travel
had to order the case off amazon.com as amazon . ca did not have this exact model i was looking for luckily i had somebody that was going down to the united states to bring it back for me so i saved the extra shipping costs love the case its padded in all the right places and my asus netbook fits perfectly has the convenient handle on top as well the long carrying strap
i bought this bag to house my netbook on the road , and i can say that it 's holding up well there was nothing about that disappointed me i found the design to be a little less than attractive and , as a person that likes to keep things light , the bulk in cloth a tad heavy but these are <unk> , and they might very well be a feature to you i was impressed with the quality with which the bag was made there are compartment <unk> , straps , buckles and even the zipper seems sturdy i 've tested it quite thoroughly , and have had no reason to suspect wear i would reccomend this product , but have n't used any other netbook bags , either
i travel quite <unk> and needed something for carrying a laptop that would n't hurt my shoulder this backpack from targus is lightweight yet has a pocket for everything i need and works great for air travel
mine gave me # + solid years of daily use with heavy books and my laptop last week it finally gave out and one of the straps broke -lrb- there are a couple tears elsewhere as well -rrb- there are a lot of backpacks on amazon that look far more durable than this is , but they 're also double -lrb- if not more -rrb- the price i just ordered another one it 's not going to last forever , but i 'm satisfied with the quality to price ratio
i bought this targus sport netbook # . # `` case for my dell mini # it 's a perfect fit i am very pleased with this product i 'm not disapointed one bit could have offered a better choice of colors
i purchased this targus model over ten years ago and it was with me nearly daily for most of that decade i finally had to stop using it because the seams were opening up and there was little padding left in the straps i started shopping for a replacement when i discovered that it had a lifetime warranty targus replaced my backpack with a brand new one of the same model it has changed quite a bit since i first purchased it , and yes you can see that they have gone with less sturdy materials over time , but i am not sure that is a bad thing i would not expect this one to last another # years , but then it costs less than $ # so
i just recently bought one of those # . # inch netbooks and looked at several stores for a netbook bag i then checked online and came across this targus bag on amazon i thought it looked stylish and was a great price from amazon so i went for it this bag fits nicely my netbook in its main compartment and its bulky powersupply in the front pocket there is adequate padding surrounding the main pocket for protection the construction feels very sturdy there is a well padded handle or an adjustable shoulder strap for the user to sum it up , i am happy with my purchase
i bought the first -lrb- ? -rrb- generation of this bag when i found myself working a project that took me to the uk frequently it 's a good mobile office -- carries laptop & accessories , papers , books etc . and is comfortable to haul around and quite durable this version is a notable improvement on the first , with more small outer compartments for organizing smaller items and * two * expandable mesh pockets for water bottles etc . zippers are reliable and have <unk> pulls , laptop sleeve is well padded , well done throughout it does n't exactly look like a <unk> 's backpack ; if you 're concerned about ` professional image ' , it might not be for you
tough enough is what it is simple and well padded room for mouse and cords etc . . i would not recommend operating your netbook in the case as the computer requires ventilation and the fit does n't allow for that it may work for a # inch but not for my asus # inch
i picked up this backpack for my work laptop , a # . # `` hp elitebook this is everything i wanted beyond something to tote my laptop around it 's not too ` chunky ' or huge , there is plenty of space for notebooks and binders , and mp # players et al . worth the money
i liked the product , it 's just that we had a hard clamshell case , and we thought this would be similar it 's nice it is just not a hard shell case still it is a good buy
our toshiba netbook fits perfectly into this case it 's a nice tight fit and as a result the bag is not too baggy and easy to carry around the one downfall with this is there is limited space for much else you can fit the power cord in the second compartment but not a whole lot else
this is a well constructed backpack i replace the older model with this one i like the additions of the side pockets and extra front pockets i do , however , miss having the little cellphone pouch on the shoulder strap and the round loop to clip my keys nonetheless this is a very good backpack i use it for work
i love the padding on it its a bit tight on my # . # `` acer netbook , but still fit this bag keeps me organized love the qaulity of the skin i especially love the strip on it very comfortable on the shoulder
cheap and small exactly what i wanted and expected i use it for my asus netbook and have space for the power cord , headphones , lens cleaner , and flash disks was great for flying except for the flight attendant who <unk> <unk> me for closing it and storing it rather than fully shutting it down before landing
bought the backpack to replace a messenger style bag that hurt my shoulders the targus holds my dell precision with extended battery well . it is really roomy , with tons of compartments i knocked it down a point because it has too many compartments that all look alike , and therefore , has a lot of zippers and tags not a problem , but you may end up hunting for something
the perfect case for my samsung n # netbook i had to cut out the useless `` cargo netting `` on the inside , other than that , looks like it is going to be a good durable case for traveling
this backpack was great , just what i was looking for my grandson had one and i was impressed with it it is durable and has plenty of room and is <unk> when i am <unk> it i needed something to take with me when i travel and this backpack is ideal for that
bought it for my netbook ; only minus is that its zippers only go one way , wish it had two zippers instead of one , but what else do you want for $ #
besides being roomy enough to comfortably fit netbook and other accessories it is very durable unlike the other bags that i looked at which only offered protection from dust , this one would cushion the contents within when banged around a bit again great bag highly recommend it ! !
i bought my first <unk> backpack -lrb- essentially the same sport backpack model -rrb- in # and have used it essentially every day for the last # years while in grad school , for work and for travel it served me well and i was really happy with the design , functionality and quality when it was time for a replacement , i was happy to find that targus still made the sport model targus has made some great upgrades to the sport model since # , such as bigger side packets , water bottle pockets on both sides , lined sunglass pocket all the other great features still remain i am completely satisfied with this backpack , its functionality , and quality i honestly have nothing negative to say about it
product received as advertised good quality bag backpack came with a padded laptop / notebook computer bag inside i did not expect this , and was pleasantly surprised to find that it fit my son 's toshiba laptop the backpack itself is of good quality and all together a great value for the price
i own an aspire one # . # and had been searching for a case saw the sleeves but they do n't seem to have a carrying handle have also read some reviews about certain cases that state that they will fit the # . # but the fit is very tight well , i just bought this case at a local retailer and it is great it is all that i had been looking for the # . # fits perfectly , not too tight or loose , and it has straps to hold the netbook in place it has a carrying handle as well as a shoulder strap , and a very nice storage pocket that will easily fit a charger , mouse , etc . the padding is adequate , after all , it is a soft sided case , and it probably has more protection than a sleeve overall , i am very pleased with this case
i bought this item the first time around # when i bought a laptop for college i have used it since then to carry my laptop most everywhere i also used the item as my backpack throughout all of college it only recently sprung a hole in the bag making it no longer a bag i want to put anything in without losing it ! i was absolutely delighted to see that they still make the same exact bag and without question bought it again ! ! love that the laptop case comes out and is n't attached the straps are durable and comfortable it is a good durable bag , looking forward to many more years of use
i really like this case for my acer net book it fits fine the extra pocket holds the charger and a full size mouse it is just what i needed
i 've had this bag for around # years and the bottom is finally developing a couple holes the bag is rather small -lrb- which is a plus for me -rrb- but the external pouches are silly -lrb- the big one flops around at the end of a tether -rrb- i 'm tempted to buy a different bag to replace it , but the fact that this one lasted so long is also a strong <unk>
using this with the acer # . # aspire timeline and it fits very well a good balance of protection vs bulk my laptop has the <unk> bluetooth usb adapter and i have to watch out that i clear the zipper when putting it in the case it holds the laptop , power supply , microsoft bt # mouse and the samsung dvd burner but beyond a few pens or documents , i would n't load any more in it the dvd burner makes it a little bulkier than i like but honestly , how often do we really need a burner on the road a large capacity # . # external <unk> would be just the ticket but look for a thin hd case if you 're creating your own portable hd assembly load up some movies and off you go well constructed laptop bag and i 'm glad i got it but then it is a targus product and i 've yet to have any problems with their quality
this case works great for my new asus # . # `` netbook has large zippered front pocket with pocket perfectly sized for manuals , cds , dvds , warranty paper work , etc . and mesh pocket perfect for ac adapter and other peripherals
this netbook carrier is absolutely wonderful it has a separate compartment where i keep the charger , my headphone , and my mp # player i am ready to work where ever i go i love this bag and highly recommend it
not much to say , other than it is well made , looks very durable , good protection for my netbook it has enough space for all the peripherals that go along when the netbook hits the road well worth the money
i bought mine used and it was still better than most other packs you can find the targus name , means quality i will def buy another one next time i am in need
this is actually my husband 's second targus backpack ... he had the first one for ten years and used it every day the only reason he replaced it is because one of the zippers broke not bad for ten years of daily use -lrb- and abuse -rrb- this one has a few updated features , but still the backpack he knew and loved
i just received my carrying case & a shoulder strap was included i bought this for my new hp # . # `` mini `` ; it plus my cooler base , cords , & mouse all fit beautifully in this case & nothing is crammed together the price is fantastic ; office max sells theirs for $ # . # in a north chicago <unk> ; i bought mine for just under $ # . # incl shipping this is a smart bargain & a great case
this bag is a perfect fit for my toshiba nb # netbook it has a lot of nifty pockets and is easy to carry around it does n't add much weight either i highly recommend it
i used to carry lots of textbooks with this bag i would say the bag is reasonably comfortable with # lbs in the bag i 've flown on # hour flights with this back pack and it 's big enough to keep most of my valuable yet small enough to stuff in an overhead bin
this was a gift for my husband , for his asus eee net book he loves the bag says it has more than enough room and protects better than most others
this case is everything anyone could ever want to transport # . # inch netbook it is stylish , securely holds the computer , seems very well made , enough storage for a mouse and charger and the computer can be used while still in the case there are absolutely no negatives a great traveling companion
this <unk> is very roomy and holds alot of extra items such as cords , papers , gadgets , phone , etc . . if you 're looking for a good case in which to carry your netbook then this will do the trick it is made very well i do n't regret this purchase one bit
this bag does a great job of holding my acer netbook along with a wireless mouse , power supply & cord , external dvd burner a little lumpy , but , hey , <unk> expect with all that <unk> this is my second one ; the other one went to my cousin who latched onto the first netbook and guards it <unk> i 've used targus gear before on my other laptops and cameras ; they do good i could wish for more color <unk> , but the silver and black is quite elegant
this is a great bag for a # -inch netbook the outside pocket is large enough to store the power cord , my verizon wireless mifi , a wireless mouse , a small notebook surge protector and a remote for power point presentations the bag is lightweight and comfortable to carry yet will fit in a backpack if more peripherals like an external dvd drive need to be carried too so far , it is durable and protects the netbook well i wish it came in other colors besides black , though great case for the price
this is the perfect mini-notebook carrying case its <unk> light , has a shoulder strap -lrb- unlike the sleeves -rrb- and has just enough pockets to get the powersupply and other small items in in a nutshell , if you wanted to get a simplicity and weight of a sleeve but wanted it to have a strap and one pocket added to it , then this is your product i have a hp # and it fits perfect
this backpack is perfect for travelling with or without a laptop it 's roomy and has lots of areas to <unk> you need however , when <unk> by tsa , they discovered it tested positive for <unk> they did n't like and , because i had just packed my new backpack , my laptop , hands and <unk> tested positive , too as a result , my entire carry-ons were searched and i was made to wait <unk> & # # ; special & # # ; chemical person while i did make my flight , i was delayed # minutes maybe <unk> was a result of the manufacturing process
i could n't be happier with my purchase anyone that has a small # inch laptop would appreciate the size of this carrying bag it 's not much bigger than my purse i really do like the size
i 've had many laptop cases in the past , and this netbook case is great i 've been using this case now for # years the design allows for the netbook to never have to be removed from the case while using it it is roomy enough to include the fan pad i put under the netbook and a # port usb adapter behind the fan the case also has a zipper compartment in the front i use for the full sized trackball mouse and ac adapter its a great product
a chromebook was put in this case there was enough space for the computer itself , a kindle fire , and also the charger for both items i would recommend it
had one before and it worked great was glad to find another one as other one had for a few years and it got damaged thank you would recommend to others as it is a nice case holds all your supplies and computer too , got lots of room in there
i got this bag in # and while i had a zipper blow out on it i got a replacement from targus i also worked for a company that used these bags for the employees i did warranty replacements for those poor abused bags , they must have dragged these bags behind a car or something and targus accepted any bag and exchanged them without any issues
this is my favorite backpack , i use it for traveling i fit everything i needed in here for a # week trip to europe its great for shorter or longer trips , you can fit so much in it the main reason i like it is because it has so many pockets and its a sturdy build trust me , if you are backpacking or just going away for the weekend , this bag is perfect it also has the belt type strap to distribute the weight off your shoulders
this notebook carrier designed to supply high protection for laptops during transport and presents many details for carrying related stuff elegant look but , weak handle it is torn off after a week i used it to carry my # lbs laptop
it is an amazing bag for the price everything is perfect but one would struggle to fit a book with the laptop i was looking for a bag where i could even fit a book which is not the case but i can not actually complain as it is very cheap
it may look simple from outside view when you buy this , but from inside it has a very comfortable space for my laptop and some more areas to stuff extra items worth deal , if low budget is the criteria ... one <unk> regret this
my # inch <unk> fits nicely and feels secure this is a great case for the money you pay however there 's no room for the cord , so that goes in the front pouch making it a little bulky
this lightweight case was just perfect for my # `` gateway with plenty of pockets to carry associated gizmos , software and papers having both a handle and attached shoulder strap was most handy it made the trip halfway around the world and back without a hitch seller delivered as promised and i am a happy camper
this notebook case fit my oversized # `` notebook there are several padded , velcro inserts to fit any size snuggly there are so many pockets to organize all the extras like power cord , dvd 's , travel mouse , usb jump drive , computer glasses , wireless antenna , etc . most are located in a separate , zippered compartment on the outside of the case for easy access without opening the whole case there are better cases but for the money this one is a very economical choice
this is the perfect carry case for any laptop i bought it for my wifes brand new dell inspiron # it provides the utmost <unk> for any laptop pc , and is very stylish you can <unk> store folders , pens , and other <unk> office supplies as well for the price i paid $ # , it was a steal the best deal i 've seen on the internet thus far
i have a dell inspiron # with a # . # inch screen the computer fits perfectly into the case and is nicely cushioned the storage pockets are well placed and give me all the space i need for everything else it 's a good looking case and comfortable to carry i 'm delighted with it
this bag is smaller than the dimensions that were advertised when i ordered it so i returned it without a hassle and amazon paid for the return shipping it looks like the dimensions have been updated my hp g # . # `` laptop did not fit , but it was close even if it had fit there would have been no space for anything else
the <unk> prob is inadequate , for me . . even in <unk> am not sure if my laptop would survive a fall from a table height . but it will probably survive less than a foot drop
very good and <unk> case ! ... my # & # # ; laptop fix perfect in almost the half part of the case , and i got more space for the cables also the case came with some other pockets with enough space to save other stuffs good material , resistant and clean
i used with my dell laptop when i upgraded to a larger hp laptop years later , my husband took it and used it for his smaller laptop -lrb- which is still in use -rrb-
i have used this bag for ten years -lrb- reordered # times -rrb- i always loved it - had everything i needed when i ordered it recently -lrb- the zipper on the old bag gave up -rrb- i was very disappointed in the new version in particular the strap at the back -lrb- to attach to luggage -rrb- is so tight it does not fit over my luggage and kind of makes the bag
this is my second kensington contour briefcase i loved my first one -- very well made , clever design touches -lrb- multiple pockets , the way the two handles fit into each other -rrb- , and i used it for years until it wore out this new one retains most of the design from the first one , but not the build quality i 've had it for five months now , and a seam on the top near one of the shoulder strap attachment points is coming apart inside the handy top pocket the inner lining is fraying , causing the zipper to catch on it when i open the pocket i gave it two stars because it has n't fallen apart entirely -lrb- yet -rrb- , but i doubt it will last a year for stuff i use every day , quality matters , and it 's <unk> when companies that have made a great product in the past let their quality slip , either to save costs or through lack of attention
i had a kensington contour # -inch bag that i loved , but it was pretty worn and the top pocket zipper was <unk> i 've had it for # years so i ordered another one much to my surprise , this was not the same bag shown in the photo the two <unk> size front pockets with lots of cool inner organizer pockets was replaced by a single large pocket not cool to go cheap , kensington needless to say , i wo n't be ordering this bag again
after about a month i can say that this bag satisfies all my needs i moved from a larger wheeled bag , and this on has lots of space and a place for everything
bag has really nice build quality could have been made by tumi nice padded slot for my laptop and plenty of compartments for accessories and supplies the only gripe is that the pad on the strap is n't adjustable , although it is still comfortable
loads of storage area and pockets laptop is enclosed in a padded area in the center of the bag , well protected fits under airline <unk> problem <unk> use for four years with no signs of wear you will love it
i purchased a couple of these for my kids for christmas , # according to the tech specs , the <unk> range for these things is # to # feet the units we received indicate ` out of range ' when taken <unk> in our house , which is about # feet from the base unit i used motorola 's web support site and asked if it was possible that my units were defective they sent me the <unk> to an <unk> , which told me that the working range for these things is # feet it seems they did not even read my question to add <unk> to injury , their <unk> customer satisfaction <unk> email was <unk> with the <unk> ` <unk> everywhere ' i beg to differ in summary , i do not recommend the imfree
at first , this seems like a good product ... brand name , ease of use , low cost but if the battery goes dead , there are no replacements made anywhere and because this item is so old , motorola no longer provides any form of warranty for this product i bought this item from <unk> here on amazon as a christmas gift and it never worked because the battery was dead and would not charge - as far as the item is concerned , do not waste your money on something that is so old that the manufacture does not cover any longer - as far as <unk> is concerned , let 's see if they assist me with a refund where i do not have to pay return shipping since i paid for shipping to get it in the first place
horrible product for anyone over the age of # , wait why are they even on aim i purchased this product and the connection was horrible , even my little sister hated the design too slow , cramped keyboard and limited functions battery life was also very short i recommend just getting a low end laptop than this piece of trash two thumbs down
i bought this at walmart about # years ago . . for $ # . # ... this price is a rip off overall , the only downs to this product are the limits of # conversations , and no backlighting it 's useless in the dark
i think the concept of this is deff worth the buy i like being able to sit in bed and talk to friends without having to waste money by using my cell phone most may say that the keyboard is hard to type on but i beg to differ once you get the hang of it , its quite easy ! i think this is deff a good buy
i got this last summer , and it worked great , we have <unk> and # computers , so i just leave one one all the time and use it whenever i want the only problem i have with it is that the <unk> battery only lasts # minutes or so , but i 'm sure thats easily replaceable overall great product
i think this product is very usefull because it saves your computer from <unk> the only problem that i had was that every time i tried to put on an away message the imfree always shut off i think this is because i might of spilled a bit of ice cream on to my imfree , but everthing else is working fine the only thing that i wish is that i could make an away message but anyway , it is a great instant <unk> product that is great and i encourage you to bye this <unk> product
we got both of our children , son # & daughter # , one of these for christmas last year my husband & both thought that for the small price we paid it might last a month & then fall apart , but to our surprise , almost a year later they are still working perfectly they are worth every penny we paid for them & more the kids can walk around the house & instant message with their friends it is much easier than a laptop because of the small size which is about the size of a pda we downloaded the software & the base just plugs into one of our desktop computers ; a very easy set up they have the freedom to move around anywhere in our home & sometimes even manage to do <unk> while using the imfree i would say that if you have kids or teens that im a lot , it would be a great gift , especially if you are trying to put off purchasing another computer the imfree would be a much cheaper option
this is the best <unk> bag i 've ever owned ... and i 've owned tumi , samsonite , etc . . despite # years of steady service , my targus <unk> # never let me down only now am i ordering another bag -- the same one ca n't recommend highly enough
i have used this case for over # years , and the wheels fell off several times i bought a replacement screw at the hardware store , but then ended up losing one of the wheels this case has a lifetime warranty so i contacted targus , and asked them to send me a replacement wheel no problem whatsoever other than the issue with the wheels , this is a wonderful case it has pockets for absolutely everything true , the wheels falling off is a pain , but i have noticed that newer cases do n't seem to have the same level of finish so nothing is perfect -- i keep a screwdriver with me -lrb- and spare screws -rrb- just in case
i replaced my old port bag with this one with the wheels the handle finally broke on the old one after years of use i expect i 'll do better with these nice <unk> style wheels
received the item in good condition however , the item looks different from the picture shown the quality is also not as good as what i would expected bad quality compared to the other samsonite bags that i have bought from the stores
i am an attorney and i purchased this bag to cart my files and laptop to appearances i am generally very happy with the bag and felt it was a good deal i can carry files and still have a cushioned pocket for my laptop my only complaint is that due to the position of the handle , i can not keep one of the flaps open without holding it , which makes removing a large file somewhat difficult not a big problem so i would still recommend it
i bought this case after i got tired of all the problems my us luggage rolling case gave me samsonite 's product has none of the problems that the us luggage case had the wheels are reliable they do n't get stuck the case is sturdy the pockets and pen holders are logically placed this is a good buy
i bought this case because , like the previous computer case i had , most of the space is accessible by simply opening one set of locks to get your computer set up you do n't have to unzip multiple compartments to get access to your different components , they are all there in one large compartment it rolls easily , has a good handle , and does have one external compartment for papers , pens , etc . the only thing i do n't like about it is that instead of having one or two accordion <unk> file folders opposite the laptop pouch , is has a couple of removable brackets that hold up regular hanging file folders the brackets are always popping out of the holders and the file folders falling off the brackets when i load and unload laptop accessories it would have been a good idea if they had just designed simple <unk> to keep the brackets from popping out and to keep the file folders from falling off the brackets but since i use the case mainly as a laptop case and do n't carry a lot of papers , this is n't that big of a deal to me
i purchased the samsonite rolling laptop case after lugging around a traditional computer bag and another large bag i have a home office and need to `` take my office with me `` often i needed something with wheels that locked and could hold numerous files as well as my laptop this case is large and fits everything i need it is heavy to pick up when filled and a bit akward for me to carry -lrb- but i 'm short and weigh about # . it beats carrying everything it rolls nicely and , so far , it is holding up well i would definitely recommend it
as a <unk> i have tried # different litigation bags and briefcases to transport binders and files to <unk> and <unk> inevitably the binders do not fit , and i either have to bend the top of my case to close it , leave it open altogether , or simply use a <unk> box this case is extremely room -- enough to hold # <unk> binders and # or # medium binders it is tall enough to lock closed with the binders inside also , never again shall i suffer <unk> while lugging my litigation case hurriedly through an airport trying to catch a flight this thing has wheels , and an unusually sturdy pull handle it also has optional padding to hold a notebook computer securely i recommend this case fully
i ordered this laptop case after a bit of research price was way lower than anywhere else , and it arrived in a few days as promised the only negative is that it says its for # `` screens , which it is , but that forces you to take out the little cases inside that were supposed to store cables , etc . they still fit in outer pockets , so all is not lost
this is the best laptop case i have ever had ! its has more space than any other ive had . has velcro fastening strap to secure laptop into very padded interior of case . plenty of useable pocket inside , big storage <unk> outside inside you can put laptop two or more external hard drives , and much much more
we own several lowepro camera bags and decided to try the laptop case i 'm so glad we did this is an incredible case you can easily adjust the interior for a nice , snug fit for nearly any size laptop up to # . # `` i have a sony vaio # . # that almost fills the laptop area yet , with all the built-in pockets , i still have plenty of room for my power pack , mouse , surge protector , notes , etc . the padding is incredible and gives me assurance that my laptop will be safe i love the padded , contoured carry strap that hugs the neck/shoulder area the hardware and zippers are extremely rugged and durable as long as we can find a lowepro bag for each of our specific needs , we wo n't consider anything else
i bought this bag to carry my # `` laptop it fits snuggly with plenty of compartments for other things it is light weight and easy to carry along with the nice shoulder strap the build quality looks to be good and the general bag appearances is much better then one would expect for the price overall , a great product at an amazing price , do n't hesitate a minute if you are looking for a laptop bag
exactly what i was looking for and a great price , plus ordered saturday delivered monday <unk> service ! i was primarily looking for something to tote a new canon <unk> # printer in as i rarely take the old laptop anywhere lo and behold the <unk> # -lrb- with battery attached -rrb- is a perfect fit in the smaller side compartment so the # `` inspiron can come along , if needed , with room for peripherals the clamshell way it opens is also fantastic , no worries about scratches slipping past zippers shoulder strap has an ergonomically curved pad and handle is stout yet has cushioned grip zippers work easily , hardware has nice look exceedingly well built for the price
i guess a # & # # ; macbook is different in size from a # & # # ; laptop of another brand my laptop wo n't fit in the padded compartment , but fits in the other compartment where you 'd put books and such nice bag though , just disappointed i ca n't use it as i intended
awesome bag ! fits everything including your laptop and has a pocket for everything , only con is the color is a little more like a <unk> green then a yellow compared to this
as a student i was looking for a bag that will secure my laptop and hold my text books the bag <unk> a few compartments that will secure your laptop with extra padding , hold your text books , pens , and ipod this bag is perfect for my needs at an affordable price
could use more padding in laptop enclosure i 'm basically very satisfied with this pack it 's quite well built and appears to be capable of many years of service lots of useful storage space and well thought out comfortable on my back but there should be more padding in the laptop space i added some additional padding to the bottom of the laptop compartment the upper corners of my macbook pro # & # # ; seem vulnerable pressing up against the zipper at the top of the pack my previous pack had substantial padding between the laptop and zipper but i ca n't find a similar replacement so i 'm being extra careful using the mobile edge
i have been using this laptop for over a month now and am very pleased i use if to carry my laptop , converter , papers , etc . , each day to work and it is comfortable hanging over one shoulder or on my back on a few business trips , the backpack has proved sturdy and comfortable when loaded up with additional materials the picture depicts the backpack as purple or blue but the black color is even and professional i would recommend the pack for professionals who are looking for an alternative way to carry your work home each night
i like this backpack a lot and it is very comfortable i have not had the same problem of it falling forward what i do n't like is that it does n't have a place for things like business cards it only has a couple of large , general purpose pockets
this bag is big my new # inch hp fits in it nicely as do about # or so normal sized library books and all the gear that goes with a laptop a little on the pricey side -lrb- i picked mine up for $ # because there are others that will do the job for cheaper , but it 's durable and seems to be put together in a quality way does n't look like it 's going to fall apart any time soon and it seems like a very secure way to carry my laptop around
i like it the only thing i feel like , that there is not enough padding on the upper corners there is a flap that goes over to help the corners i have not yet taken it on a trip , to really try out so i will report back
many years ago my bf got a similar laptop bag free with his computer after years of hard use it was starting to fall apart i bought this for him for christmas and it was great it was a bit larger which is good it had a few more pockets and made of good quality materials great laptop back pack
i have had this back back for # computer it is going on almost # years i use this bag everyday going to work , traveling , etc . it has held up extremely well and is only starting to show signs of wear the zippers have held up amazingly well i can get a # inch laptop , power cord , mouse , ipad , full size head phones , cables , and countless other items in all the pockets i am glad to see the company is still in business and doing well
