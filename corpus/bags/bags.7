i was looking for a <unk> option for mbp , but did n't find a lot of options in the # `` category so far the booq vyper xl # is pretty good it offers a rigid outside that looks thicker than it really is there is also not much extra padding along the corners ; where you need the most protection the zippers are also on the <unk> , although i have had no trouble with them so far all-in-all , i do n't think i would have purchased this sleeve if i saw it in the store might rather have gone with timbuk # padded sleeve for its added protection
as another reviewer stated , i was wary of this sleeve due to some poor reviews of the zippers i went ahead with my purchase anyway and have been very happy with the product the zippers are high quality and move smoothly the sleeve also has a little cloth lip on the inside of the zipper that prevents it from making contact with the laptop i had thought about saving a little money and just getting a neoprene sleeve , but i wanted something with a bit more protection for my several thousand dollar laptop the booq vyper xl # gives me that the only thing i wish it had was a zipper pocket or something else on the outside to hold memory <unk> and possibly the power cord i realize that most people will be using this inside of a computer bag , so this may not be a major issue i use mine with a targus bag and it works great
this is the best case for full protection of you mac book pro . this is not the neoprene soft cover it is a stiff sided case that allows you to put your mac in any briefcase
sleeve far too large for macbook # inch cheap look and feel , details not thought through memory foam does n't seem to make sense -- gets softer when warm , harder when cold , but the macbook needs the same protection no matter the <unk> , no i will return it to amazon and probably go for the incase
i have a macbook pro # . # in purchased in # - and the reality is this sleeve is not a good fit it is close enough to be workable but when you put it in it definitely feels that there is a `` wiggle room `` for the laptop not enough that it is constantly shuffling around , but enough to be annoying i had read reviews on here that said that , but went with the positive ones it is a great sleeve otherwise , but that minor annoyance is enough for me to not recommend it to anyone
had to return the item - the green was incredibly bright , almost obnoxious thought it would be a bright spring green , but it was # s neon would recommend the case , but definitely in a different color
the sides are a snug fit but there is # inch extra space at the top trust me i measured it before you buy this ask yourself if you can live with it for me right now i am not sure
i just bought this for my new # `` macbook pro -lrb- same dimensions as the older # `` unibody macbook released last year -rrb- and was disappointed at the fit of this case the build quality is very good -- i like the inside zipper protection and the foam it 's made out of it feels like it could withstand a small bump or two however , there is a good inch of room inside the case it 's large <unk> wise as well depth wise this case definitely does not `` fit like a glove `` my macbook slides when inside of it , and in general it just makes an otherwise sleek laptop look chunky excellent case if not for a very poor fit
i 'll keep this short , but i just want to comment on a weird quality of the memory foam used in this sleeve i bought it about a year ago and was at first very impressed with the quality and appearance however , over time the foam has begun to break <unk> somehow , especially along any side where you would hold it or grab it out of a bag it 's hard to explain , but it 's like the foam is <unk> in there leaving an empty space where it was i do n't know how long these sleeves typically last , maybe a year is about it on something like this anyway , i 'm browsing amazon right now for a replacement when i saw these and thought i 'd share my experience
so , i was looking for a very cheap sleeve for my macbook since my other had gotten lost the material is very stiff for a sleeve which is supposed to guarantee your macbook 's safety but i am not so sure they market this memory foam as special but i feel <unk> are more of memory foam <unk> than laptop cases in any case it gets the job done
i bought this case because i did not want to spend the $ # for the case at the mac store this case does not fit the computer as snug as i wanted but it still does the job if you are looking for a less expensive alternative this sleeve works
i received this item and my only complaint is that the color i ordered is not the color i received the color is clearly blue and yellow beware if you are ordering this and think you will receive a black and yellow case , you will not
i will leave the more technical descriptions about this product to the other reviewers , since i just want to comment on the color <unk> the color is not what i had expected the <unk> and interior looks to be light <unk> because of this , the light brown color looks like it should be gray , but is <unk> because of a hint of red the best <unk> i can come up with to describe the hue is that it looks like i had accidentally `` <unk> `` a nice gray macbook sleeve with a red sock in sum , if you like brown , go with the darker brown , not the `` <unk> .
i bought this sleeve to use with a sony z # laptop for this purpose it is a bit big big <unk> at # : # ratio for the macbook pro , whereas the sony z is # : # so there is some extra space at the top of the laptop , which is no big deal the sleeve is well designed aesthetically and does a decent job of making sure that the zipper doesnt touch or scratch your laptop the sides are well padded and the zipper <unk> very smoothly however the memory foam padding on this is not as <unk> as what 's in the zero shock case that i also have for another laptop that is the primary function of the sleeve so i would have liked to see it be a bit better on that but this is relative to the zero shock - by any other measure this is an excellent sleeve
this is a great case it does it 's job , but each of the many color combinations lacked the same thing : aesthetic <unk> no big deal though , if you need a case to keep your computer safe , buy this one
i love the material that the sleeve is made out of , extra cushion protection . so far so good . my macbook pro is safe in it , that 's for sure . sleeve is very sturdy
perfect for protecting your laptop , i used it for my mac book pro i bought another piece for a close friend and she seems to like it as well the thick fabric protective layer of the case does its job in very good way my mac in that case actually bumped to hard surfaces a few times but no damage happened the only thing that would make it even better is a little more space for the charger , and would be very good
i am very happy with this purchase it 's not quite what i was expecting -lrb- as far as the material it is made out of -rrb- but it gets the job done i really like the way it looks , and although the inside is n't as soft as the incase cases , it 's about half the price overall i am very happy with this purchase
this sleeve does not fit snuggly on a # in macbook pro as mentioned by other reviewers a little adjustment on the size would have been better some are surprised at how hard the material is , and have given this product a low rating based on this this is actually what is nice with this sleeve it will protect your macbook from higher impact bumps as compared to other sleeves which are just made of ordinary foam if you try to press on the sleeve using your fingers , there will be resistance at first before the material gives in to the pressure from your finger if you prefer softer sleeves , and you would just want your laptop to be protected from scratches , you might have to look for other sleeves if you need protection from bumps , this would be a good sleeve for your laptop
it is a little tougher than i expected , but is by no means made of `` cardboard `` like some other reviewers have stated i honestly feel if i dropped my laptop while it was in this sleeve from a few feet , it would be safe or at least take minimal damage also , the memory foam is fun to play with
the most interesting thing about this bag is the weird foam-like construction covered with fabric it 's sort of like the memory foam used on those <unk> in <unk> , except that it starts off being much more solid i think it does a good job of protecting my unibody aluminum macbook because the rigid foam seems like it would give way in a drop the outside of the case looks upscale with striped brown fabric in fact , it looks <unk> with my rugged backpack the size is just a little too big in my opinion for the unibody macbooks : there 's room in all directions , so my macbook slides around just a little this is a small nitpick , but some people might be bothered by it on the other hand , the slightly thicker white macbooks might be a better fit
in some ways i do miss my neoprene bodyglove case i 've used for # `` and # `` laptops of the past neoprene is soft and has a nice form fitting feel to them and they work well for protection that being said , i still like this one the packaging was a nice surprise with the memory foam sample outside the plastic zip packaging the packaging felt classy and the memory foam itself is interesting as i 've never had this kind of laptop case before it will fit a # . # macbook perfectly - a great snug fit -lrb- i tried my friend 's - normal macbook and the new aluminum case macbook -rrb- what i used it for was the new # . # `` hp dv # t w/ # -cell battery . it fits well snugly with some room to spare on top - just a little -rrb- it protects it well and i kinda like the wasabi color inside . the only con is that it is a little <unk> and not soft like neoprene but hey , if you want protection - this will do . and at $ # it 's a good deal
i do like the idea of this pouch type of laptop bag but it 's so thin that it only fits the macbook and nothing else . maybe a couple sheets of papers but that 's it granted i got it for use in a larger bag so the laptop does n't get scratched up but it could use a little more room the foam is quite sturdy which is nice but then again it also squishes to nothing it could be a little more <unk> to squish this type of foam is probably good for the average person but i work in odd places and am a bit of a <unk> person by nature so i would prefer more substance to the foam i tried this with a friends # `` screen laptop and seeing as this bag is so thin that his laptop would n't allow for the bag to zip up i do like the zipper on it though , it 's a thick <unk> zipper and the tabs are shaped to fit in between your fingers rather well i found that to be an interesting touch
i purchased this cover for a # `` macbook my daughter , wife and i all really like the bright green inside color , while the black outer cover will be easy to keep clean the memory foam seems to provide good protection
i bought this sleeve with my macbook pro # . # inch ; thinking it would not be a great sleeve because of the price i was wrong , i really like this sleeve , it gives your mac plenty of protection the sleeve 's padding is really hard but when you press down on it , you can still see your hand indent , then it slowly goes back to the way it was the sleeve is a perfect fit for the # . # macbook , it is easy to put in and take out overall im satisfy with this sleeve for it 's price would i buy from this company again yes ! =
this is a useful macbook sleeve that does exactly what you need it to do : it protects your macbook from scratches when you need to carry it around it 's thick and padded , making it ideal if you carry your laptop in a schoolbag with lots of books and other items jostling around the problem i have with it is its appearance : with brown plaid , it 's impossible to be more boring or unattractive but a product like this is all about functionality , and like i said it does what you need it to do it 's made for macbooks so i ca n't say how well it will fit other laptops
well-designed and well-made fits my macbook # . # inch laptop very nicely and provides good protection from bumps unlike other reviewers , i have no complaints about the finish of the product the only way it could be better is if it were waterproof
this is everything you need in a laptop sleeve except for the `` style `` factor it 's a perfect fit for my # `` unibody macbook it 's sturdy and the memory foam exterior is pretty amazing it keeps the laptop safe from dings and rough handling even when rolling around in a duffle bag or tote bag , where the sleeve is n't sitting in a snug pocket i would have given the sleeve # stars if it was more stylish - the brown color with the stripes is not particularly appealing and definitely belongs in a bag you would n't get any style points for walking into a coffee shop with it in your hand - that being said , if it 's function over form you 're after , this is the sleeve for you
anyone anyone rating this product low because it does not offer enough protection is ridiculous laptop sleeves offer no protection ; they are for looks and to make notebooks more of a grab and go device if you are looking for protection , i recommend buying a full notebook back i have one made by targus that i use for my # `` macbook pro and it 's fantastic not trying to sound like a <unk> , but do your research before you buy a quality product and then trash it in a review just my two cents
i have a leather laptop case that does n't quite fit my macbook pro # as it was designed for <unk> laptops ; this be.ez # <unk> sleeve fits inside perfectly the sleeve fits the laptop a bit too loose for my taste , but fortunately i got a speck clear shell case along with it the laptop with shell on gets a better fit inside the sleeve lastly , the sleeve does not have much padding aside from the material -lrb- neoprene -rrb- of which is made i would <unk> recommend only if using a shell case with it
in my opinion the the colors are fascinating , the <unk> it 's made of is the best and keeps my macbook safe since there are no handles i found it hard to walk with it -lrb- just take the laptop to a `` walk `` without any other bag -rrb- , adding two handles would make it the perfect sleeve !
bought this for my wife and she loves it this sleeve fits the # `` laptop nicely it is n't too tight but not loose nice firm foam front and back for a solid protection got this for $ # and it is a great buy i gave it a four star because i rarely give five star rating
i have had this case for more than # years and i use it for my macbook it is sleek and functional the zipper works well and never gets caught the case adjusts to fit my laptop perfectly
i just received this in the mail today it fits my macbook pro # ' -lrb- with a hard case to protect it -rrb- perfectly it 's nice and snug with just a <unk> bit of wiggle room i ordered it in pink and it 's so pretty just what i need to carry my laptop on campus and trips back home from university :
this works great and protects well zipper slides easily , and macbook # . # & # # ; fits perfectly only drawback is the red color is a bit on the pinkish side , which is awkward for my son
i like the looks of this bag , but the bag is n't as soft inside as i would like i 'll update in a few months to see how it works out btw , i got it for a hp # . # `` <unk> ... fits like a glove !
i can say that this case is exactly what i expected it to be its a nice pad for my laptop in my luggage that i bring on my business trips although i have one idea , simply add a small handle so i can use it by itself i can not image anyone carrying this all by its self since there is no way to carry it i think this would be an inexpensive addition and would make the sleeve more useful
really like this - the stiffer memory foam feels more protective than the standard silicone cases there is a tiny bit of `` wiggle room `` as others have noted , which i actually like because i can throw a thin folder or a few key documents in there and just carry the case have n't noticed any problems with the zippers it 's slightly <unk> than i would like , but the trade off for increased protection is well worth it in my book appearance is slightly dull , nothing special ... but then it 's a laptop case , not an outfit :
been using this sleeve for # years now it has served me well it is still in excellent shape and has almost all of it 's cushion do n't think i 'll be needing another one because this thing will last me for a long time
this is my first review on amazon although i 've been a regular shopper around here the sleeve is very compact and snugly fits the # inch mbp it has enough padding to protect the laptop from damage it 's got two smooth zippers which is a plus i love the black exterior and the wasabi interior
i bought this case after trying cheaper -lrb- $ # -rrb- neoprene sleeve the previous case was not bad although it could protect my notebook from scratches , it could n't protect my macbook from any impact so i searched another one which can give my mbp real protection if you sometimes drop your macbook , i recommend this case this ca n't perfectly protect your laptop , but at least it give you a protection unlike soft neoprene sleeves
got this for my sister , and she loves it the memory form it is built from is awesome to play with , leaving notes and such holds her mac book just fine and keeps it from getting scratched during transport the color is really <unk> to , but not earth <unk> does what it claims , overall a nice product i just wish they had one in my size
my macbook -lrb- # . # `` screen -rrb- fits perfectly in the sleeve so far its done a good job of transporting it around be careful not to push too strongly on the case or it leaves imprints i noticed this on the sample that came with my sleeve
it 's just great , the materials are top notch however , it 's a little too big for the new aluminum macbook , but -lrb- maybe -rrb- because of the innner material , it does n't move inside
this was purchased for my # -year old son 's macbook he 's happy with the appearance and how it fits and protects his computer he chose the black with orange inside the orange is much more <unk> than the photo shows at first glance the material looks the same as those thin neoprene <unk> , but it 's thicker the description says # mm , which converts to about # `` it 's made of fairly firm memory foam ; it takes a pretty good pinch to compress the material between my thumb and <unk> , and it takes almost a full minute for the depression to completely fill back in so -lrb- without putting it through any real stress tests -rrb- i would say that the macbook is well protected from dings and knocks , but i do n't think it would help much if it got dropped if this were mine i would want it to have a carrying strap or handle , but my son says he likes it the way it is , without one
i love the lime green interior of this great sleeve for my new macbook ... makes me smile when i open it up i appreciate the secure feeling i get when i zip in my computer for another flight or road trip
bought this for my new macbook pro solid and safe protection , just put it in my backpack this sleeve is very well constructed and durable i highly recommend this if you are looking for a great product at an excellent price
based on the pictures and the price i did n't think it would be this attractive or <unk> the material is like foam , when you push it in it makes an indent but slowly goes away the padding is quite thick as well , which makes me feel even more comfortable with leaving my macbook pro in this case it 's not the <unk> fit of them all , but it 's decent and it 's padded enough to where you 're still comfortable with it moving around a little inside i would recommend this sleeve to anyone who wants a stylish case for their macbook that is padded well on the inside and outside
if you 're looking for a review on whether or not this is a great fit for the # . # `` macbook it was designed for , read another review i ordered this for my hp pavilion dm # and it 's a great fit , and the sleeve itself was extremely well worth the $ # the `` memory foam `` thing is no joke , this sleeve is thicker than most and actually seems to offer some form of protection and not only serve a cosmetic purpose
i bought this sleeve about two years ago and it is still holding up it molds around my macbook and provides soft , yet firm protection i am a student and have often carried this to school in a backpack with a lot of books in it , pressing up against it the zipper is also smooth and overall construction is simple but durable
i wanted to be able to carry around my macbook in a regular leather messenger bag this case is perfect for keeping my macbook protected from bumps and scrapes within the messenger bag this allows me to keep just one messenger bag that is n't a specialized -lrb- usually bulky -rrb- laptop bag additionally , the case is attractive , sturdy , and easy to use the zippers are an ergonomic pleasure
this is a wonderful sleeve i 've owned my sleeve for about # years now , and it 's been a perfect fit this sleeve has outlasted two laptops it is now housing my third laptop and doing a wonderful job the memory foam takes a beating , but protects my computer easily i 've also never had a problem with the zipper scratching my computers wonderful sleeve if you 're looking for something inexpensive and easy to carry around
i used to use a neoprene , soft cover but after using this i realize how poor of a decision that was this case is more durable and you can tell it protects better it is a bit of a harder material that your laptop can slide in , rather than pulling it over your laptop stays secure and gives a nice shell layer of protection mind you , you ca n't drop it and expect all to be well
i have a macbook air and have used the incase sleeve for quite some time i came across this be.ez sleeve and thought i would try it it offers superb protection the padding is great it closes securely and going through airport security is easy with it , with no fear of my laptop being damaged if knocked around my only complaint is that it is not easy to grasp -lrb- because of the great padding all the way to the top -rrb- when i need to pull it out of my bag it is a bit more difficult than the incase sleeve perhaps a pull strap on the zipper pulls might help at any rate i highly recommend this sleeve it is small and provides excellent protection
this sleeve has been used with a # . # compaq laptop for many years and it has been as good as one could expect protects the laptop well , has a good , durable and easy to use zipper , and is light
i am using this sleeve for an acer ultra portable laptop and this is a good solution the foam is thick enough to absorb minor abuse and the zippers are heavy duty the edges have a little extra padding , which is nice when you have to carry your laptop around for a while i think the acer i have is smaller than the macbook , so i ended up with a bit more extra space in the sleeve for a few extra documents and a usb stick edit : # / # - after using this for two and a half years , this sleeve still looks new i 've used the sleeve for the same laptop five days a week , to and from work , on business trips , and it has stood the test of time it also has kept my laptop looking brand new i liked it so much , i got the # . # `` black/white version for a new hp probook # . # `` laptop
great style for a great price with good protection for my laptop only complaint would be that the memory foam is a bit on the light side but overall very happy
the la robe allure sleeve is made up of lightweight memory foam that feels like it offers great protection the size is nice , too - it is n't too snug , so the zipper is easy to operate , but it is n't so loose that my macbook slides around in the case the sleeve also has a high quality zipper the pulls -lrb- there are two -rrb- are painted metal , with a contour for your thumb and finger the zipper teeth feel sturdy and the zipper operates very smoothly , without any `` catches . i like this pattern because the neutral brown gives it a professional feel and the stripes give it some style my case has stayed clean , despite being near several dogs and <unk>
i love the way this product feels the foam is firm to the touch but soft enough to keep your laptop safe it fits very well in the new # `` imac pro it 's a good buy and i 'm completely satisfied
i think this is a great case it 's sturdy , yet soft , durable , yet smooth it 's sort of like a memory foam material but a little harder , if you press down , it leaves an indent for a few seconds it protects my macbook pro very well i highly recommend getting this sleeve
i feel very comfortable putting my # `` macbook in this case and carrying it around the material is very thick and my laptop fits snugly inside i would definitely recommend this case
the larobe sleeve is well constructed of what appear to be good quality materials an attractive , simple design provides fairly well padded protection for the macbook most useful for those who will carry their computer in a briefcase or luggage with other items the sleeve does not have any capacity for cords or accessories
works great , its got more of a hard covering then the over priced ones that they sell in the mac store . i can trust it to stay undamaged in my schoolbag
i bought this item thinking it would be pretty great , and to my surprise it is my daughter loves it , the memory foam type sleeve makes my daughter more comfortable hauling a macbook around in the same bag she uses for books it fits the macbook perfectly ... and i encourage you to try it out for yourself
i just received my la robe allure sleeve for the macbook # . # `` screen perhaps this may be too large for the older macbooks as suggested by some of the other reviews , but it fits my # . # `` macbook like a glove it is precisely what i wanted to protect my laptop when i am traveling and it is either stuffed in a backpack or i am pulling it out to go through airport security
i originally saw this product listed on a & # # ; must have for your new macbook & # # ; <unk> , but priced extremely higher than this seller is offering this is a great buy it hugs my # in macbook air perfectly great for cramming it in your backpack & going buy a cheap strap from anywhere -lrb- some are listed on amazon as well -rrb- & it doubles as a great all around case as well definitely worth your buy
very nice , computer slides in easily and fits snugly it has some rigidity to it , a little more than i was expecting , but it should keep my laptop safe from bumps and scratch free when i need to travel or bring my mac anywhere it 's soft and the colors are true to the online picture highly satisfied with this product
this case is awesome ... except for that my cat keeps wanting to sleep on the memory foam other than that , it fits well , and seems to protect my # in macbook pro from harm
was n't too sure about ordering this brand because i had n't heard about be.ez but i highly recommend think of a memory foam pillow surrounding your precious investment it is the perfect protection for my macbook and comes in many colors
this is the # nd one we bought since my kids were taking their macbooks on a trip overseas we love this product it is sturdy , simple , no fuss beautifully designed it held up well on the plane , the bus , long treks this product is priced well and it is hard to beat i recommend it highly to anyone looking for a product that really delivers what is says it is going to do
i needed a light , padded sleeve for my new # -inch macbook pro , and the la robe has turned out to be just what i was looking for the memory foam protects my computer nicely , the zipper works well , and the minimal design keeps the weight down so i can slip the sleeve into my backpack or messenger bag for bike or bus commuting
this is a great sleeve case for the macbook it has a subtle mocha striped exterior which is very stylish construction is entirely out of a `` memory foam `` material which gives excellent protection to the macbook you can use it by itself to carry the macbook or to give your mac an extra layer of protection in another laptop case excellent fit and finish throughout an excellent choice at a reasonable choice
i love this sleeve i have a <unk> case for my macbook pro , and it fits inside this sleeve very snugly it offers great protection i 've used it nearly every week for short trips , and it has yet to show any signs of wear and tear i just toss it in my duffel bag and off i go i 'd definitely recommend this case for anybody looking for a cheap , effective way of protecting their expensive purchase
be.ez # larobe allure sleeve for # . # -inch macbook -lrb- <unk> -rrb- is a cute cover for my macbook it is # mm thick low <unk> polyurethane the cover is called <unk> and it is various colors of brown stripes my macbook fits snuggly in it the zipper looks solid there are no pockets i like that this cover does n't take up much space and can either be the cover or protect the macbook in a carryall bag i 'm thinking of buying another as a graduation present
it is everything as specified . very well padded , no worries about damage to <unk> is more like a luggage piece , a bit heavy for day hiking , but perfect for travelling and storage
this is a fine pack if you 're going to use it primarily for an everyday carry bag the harness system is there , but it 's not as prominent as the lowepro <unk> # if you need a real backpack on a daily basis , i 'd get the lowepro bottom line - if you 're looking for a real backpack and use it everyday , the lowepro <unk> # is a better choice if you 're looking for a daily carry bag and occasionally want to take it on a hike , then the tenba medium <unk> is a great choice
i found out , almost right away , why this is the lowest price laptop case on the internet it is very cheaply made so cheap in fact that the third week i was using it i went to pick it up , and the handle broke i am not carrying a lot of stuff in the case either just the laptop , the power cable , and a mouse that 's it i do not recommend trusting this case to protect your laptop
would not recommend this unless you have a short term immediate need lasted a very short time before the handle broke and i had to search for a shoulder strap
of all the things i have bought and loved on amazon this product is junk i have had it less than # weeks and the handle ripped off and the zipper broke the first week this item is not cheap do n't waste your
came without a shoulder strap ; i asked to have one sent and was told there are none left , so i had to return the briefcase the bag i ended up with cost a lot more it 's too bad
i will probably be returning this item the padding is insufficient to protect a laptop on the upside , there are plenty of pockets and loops to organize other items with the laptop
unfortunately the second one i received has proven some complaints about this product the handle came partially torn where it was sewn onto the material i may take it to see if it can be fixed or reinforced otherwise our first one still fine amazon did us right , gave us full refund i was really surprised and already figured i was out my money
was happy when first received bag but after a week of use , handle ripped off ! -lrb- only carry a laptop in it -rrb- other than that i still use it but back in search for another one the material used is good except for carrying
arrived a lot earlier than stated , very happy because purchased for a gift and it arrived in time great laptop bag for the money half the cost of my <unk> bag and its only a # `` and not the # `` same basic features lots of extra pouches and storage pockets , at this price i would recommend to everyone who is looking for one
not a rough and tumble laptop case by any means , but perfectly fits the bill for someone who is n't backpacking or toting it around a construction site plenty of inside pocket space and the front , outside flap fits the power cord recommended purchase for an inexpensive case for a larger laptop
this is a wonderful briefcase it is lightweight , yet very sturdy , and is very roomy the long strap is very comfortable on my shoulder not only do i carry my books , office supplies and other study items , but i also use it as a lap desk during <unk> , <unk> and classes and it works great i recommend this highly i purchased the brown briefcase , and my husband has a black one which he uses for our laptop , etc . and we are very happy with them
i needed something to hold my ipad , hd phones , cables and charges for mobile video kit for watching downloaded tv . movies when traveling up onto hotel room flat screens also needed shoulder strap for easy mobility since this cost almost nothing it is perfect
i bought this item for my <unk> that started college she had just gotten a new laptop computer that was a large one -lrb- # . # in . -rrb- and needed a case to protect and carry everything needed for class so far , this has fit the bill exactly great product at a great price
after looking at the models in retail stores and their prices i settled on this one for my needs the handle has a rivet reinforcement and appears sturdy as is the shoulder strap however i do not carry the computer except on infrequent car trips out of state
i purchased this case because of price and shipping i was a little concerned with only two posted reviews the case is as well made , and of equal quality material as any i have been looking at . and priced less i also feel it will provide enough protection for my needs but what really has me writing this review is that the case will <unk> my hp # . # pavillion with the targus lap chill mat under it there is an outside pouch that easily handles the power cords , other cords , shoulder strap , and spare battery and still has additional slots and holders so for me this was a great deal
i absolutely love this briefcase my laptop is # inches and it fits right into it i placed my cooling pad and some other things in it and was amazed how everything fits one of my friends saw it , loved it and asked me to order one for him it comes with a shoulder strap which is so convenient when you are travelling
i bought this briefcase because the tote i was using was starting to fall apart . my # & # # ; computer fits in it with room to spare with the side pocket , i have plenty of room for my cords & an extra battery i thought it might be a little cheap because of the price -lrb- since i could n't afford the leather one i wanted -rrb- but i 'm really happy with it
awesome laptop case with lots of pockets has inner case for laptop for extra padding has shoulder strap fairly light case for # . # laptop has plenty of room for all of those extras you need to carry for presentations and meetings
finally , a bag that not only says it will fit a # . # & # # ; laptop and actually does fit a # . # & # # ; laptop i have a # . # & # # ; asus n # <unk> # which is a big and thick laptop that fits this briefcase i can also put the <unk> in the side zipper <unk> with some documents
this bag fits my wide screen computer and i can put my cord and mouse inside has security straps inside as well as extra spaces and two pockets on the outside has a shoulder strap that can be used or stored excellent quality and price
i received this bag in late january , and have used it three times since then unfortunately , while i like the look and overall design of the bag , there is a substantial design defect with respect to the back straps the lower anchor points for both straps have torn completely away the straps are sewn into material that could never be expected to support the weight of a bag carrying any normal laptop , destroying the utility of what might have been a rather nice bag
i see i am not the only one to notice that the straps are tearing off this is a design flow and not a defect on the one that i bought it did last me about # year , but if i were to chose again i would select something else -lrb- probably not kensington -rrb-
i was expecting something similar to another kensington i have , which also has lumbar support and it 's <unk> , but much better and softer material this one is ... <unk> handles are not very flexible and its kinda men 's backpack , , not for both <unk> i did n't like it , but it is ... meh
it 's a great backpack , has many services , lumbar <unk> and great space i think is very heavy , if you sum the weight of your laptop and its accesories , i 'm sure you ca n't carry this backpack for a long time in your back
i had this for about two weeks now and so far i can say that i made a great purchase good and smart design it gives a lot of space it 's durable and it has a lot of support for carrying laptops and books
