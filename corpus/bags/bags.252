i bought this backpack with the intent of storing my laptop and its miscellaneous accessories it stores all that and so much more i like the cushion to the straps on the backpack considering i get a pinch in my neck and shoulder with bags that are weighted i am also happy with the many compartments to hold pens , flash drive , debit card , and other materials which are small so i do n't have to carry a pocketbook
i bought the backpack think that it would be just ok but when it arrived and i opened the package it was awesome i 'm excited to use this item
i have been using this laptop for a month i had my doubts because before i order it , i read some comments that they were not nice from other customers the best test will be when i will travel with my backpack . so far it looks <unk> the price was the

i had an old , leather , stylish , <unk> laptop bag that had seen its better days wanted something contemporary , attractive , utilitarian , with plenty of room for <unk> / etc . , and easy to carry ; this is it it even has enough room for a <unk> and my kindle
i drive around a lot , so i need a backpack that can protect my laptop , ipad , gadgets , books , and everything else i stash inside this backpack is a really nice choice and slim looking at the same time i 'm able to fit a # `` laptop inside , an apple ipad , # books , a couple of notebooks , and the power cables to everything the laptop compartment has nice cushioning to protect the cargo from even the biggest bumps and falls the books compartment has less protection , but i 've never had issues i toss my ipad in there also with a soft cover to protect it the final and smallest compartment is great for storing pens , pencils , charging cables , and more i was suprised that the water bottle slot on the side could fit my fat # oz <unk> bottle too i would reccomend this back pack to anyone who wants good protection and some storage space without looking like you just packed everything into a large hiking backpack
this backpack was what i was looking for it really lets my laptop fit with easy and protects it very well , i would recommend this product to anyone out there looking for one sturdy backpack
this backpack fits my # . # in laptop just fine for its slim look , it has spacious rooms for other gizmos i put in this backpack after the laptop is in ca n't say the padding on the bottom is great but i guess it will do for me since i wo n't be putting down the backpack on its bottom harshly
the design of this backpack is great it holds everything so tightly that it does n't sag down and weigh on your shoulders like most backpacks and , best of all , it keeps my oversized # & # # ; laptop safe and secure without hurting my back
i choose this rating cause it fits for any laptop size up to # inches you can put alot of things in this backpack i take it out with me only for traveling or walking to a library or even at a friends house i would recommened this to anyone who ask for it
i was looking for a quality bag to care my # `` laptop did n't want a <unk> carrying case this backpack is light weight , has numerous pockets and the laptop fits securely good value for price
for $ # , this bag is much more than what i expected it to be it 's sleek and fits my # -inch laptop like a charm love the fact that it has three slots : one for the laptop , one for books , and one for stationery was a tad disappointed with the way it looks but then there 's only so much you can get for that price it 's not a fashion statement , but it 's definitely looks professional and is useful
i love the case logic bags this is the # th one i 've purchased -lrb- all different sizes -rrb- this review is for the # & # # ; laptop backpack my daughters large screen -lrb- # & # # ; -rrb- laptop fits great in this bag she has room in the main compartment for a few books and folders for school the front pocket has a few small pockets and pen holders there is plenty of room in the bag and good padding for her computer
just needed a simple bag to carry my laptop to work and back works pretty well , has plenty of room for laptop , charger , a couple other cables and a notepad and pens it does n't feel likes it 's really high quality or anything but should hold up fine for what i use it for if you 're looking to carry your laptop on a bike ride or hiking or something i do n't think this is the bag that you want my only real complaint is that the shoulder straps are too short to wear it comfortably on my back , i 'm a pretty big guy though
i have had it for over # years now , and i have not had a moment to think about a new one fits my # & # # ; laptop perfectly and keeps it safe too love the small pocket it has in front of the bag its been very handy to stow my phone in there while i am traveling or even some quick jewelry or some snacks i just love this backpack
well , it 's nice and spacious i have a dell inspiron # , a <unk> # inch cooling fan , headset , mouse , power cord , and my kitchen sink and all of it will fit in the bag if you move around a lot it 'll protect your laptop , and you can probably even fit a second one in there the walls of the bag are n't thin , so you do have a little bit of protection ; just do n't try to absorb a cannon ball shot with the thing it is a backpack , so you kind of feel like your going back to grade school , i do n't know if that 's a plus to some of you , but i love it but on a serious note , you honestly can not go wrong with dropping $ # on this laptop bag , spacious , light , and you 've got ta love the hands free
this backpack is lightweight , and the padded laptop backpack has saved my laptop multiple times there is a lot of space in the bag for textbooks , and in the smaller pocket there is space for pens , <unk> , etc . have used it for three years now and still love it

i bought this laptop backpack not quite sure what to think i knew i did n't want the hassle of carrying something over my shoulder , so i went with this option when i first opened up the package i questioned whether or not my laptop would fit inside -lrb- i have a dell # `` -rrb- it fit perfectly my only complaint is i wish there were a bit more padding on the sides , but other than that , it 's great it has plenty of room to put your charging cord and other accessories , or even a book or two
this bag is absolutely perfect for my # . # in . laptop ive been through so many different expensive bags and holders but they just did not do the job or were as comfortable the look is very slick and the bag is thin but very roomy i highly recommend this item
i bought this backpack because i needed a more formal looking backpack to take to work i previously had younger looking ones since i just used the bags i had from college this was big enough to hold my mac plus maybe three to four books i also like the pocket in the front that helps keep my small stuff organized
so far i really like my backpack i use it almost everyday , with a laptop -lrb- # `` -rrb- , folders and etc . it is really light by itself and has many different compartments it seems to be made with a good material i 'd recommend it
i 've got a giant # inch laptop and hated carrying around a case i was looking for a good , cheap laptop case and this was right up there with great reviews and good specs i was reluctant at first but a backpack is # x better than a briefcase case and i love it so far

i purchased this so that i could take my laptop on our recent trip to <unk> it was perfect , as it held my # `` dell with no problems on the way back , i had it stuffed to the max and was even more pleased

i have a large # in toshiba with the external battery and it fits great ! i have extra room even , i was worried it would be a tight fit its larger than it looks the extra zipper compartments are great i can fit files , books , wallet , charger , and more with no problem
it does n't exactly look great or stylish , but it 's very functional it has plenty of well-padded compartments for two laptops -lrb- i assume , i only carry one and sometimes an ipad for my commute into the city -rrb- it 's not at all bulky and has got a slim profile and does n't take up a lot of space behind me which is crucial as someone who rides the crowded nyc subway with it i can get all the stuff i need for my commute in there : laptop , ipad , lunch , spare headphones , spare charger for the laptop , umbrella , a book it 's not cavernous in there or anything , but for the average commuter it 's probably perfect
i got a couple of compliments on this bag , and i was glad i made this purchase instead of a regular briefcase-style bag the zippers do n't get hung up and do n't feel cheap there are plenty of compartments and it easily holds a # `` widescreen dell
this laptop case fits my # inch toshiba laptop very well , plenty of padding time will tell if it is durable , but for now it appears to be well constructed with lots of room for accessories ... i like it amazon shipping -- fast as usual

i read all the other positive reviews here before i bought this pack , and i agree with all of them i took this backpack around europe for # weeks and it served me well it 's got much more space than it appears to have -lrb- i like the person on here who made the <unk> <unk> reference -rrb- and protects my # -inch laptop well the one thing i would add that i did n't read here already is that it does n't look as square as it does in the picture but it 's still stylish and professional enough that i can wear it to work instead of a laptop case very happy with this purchase , especially for such a good price
i bought this bag for my nephew who received a laptop for his birthday i am seriously considering picking one up for myself it is slim , has tons of room and fits a # `` ws laptop definitely worth the buy

i 'm very pleased with this backpack i was concerned by some reviews about fabric tears , and bought it because of the price i 've used it extensively over the last few months and it 's served me well travelling with my # & # # ; laptop in this as opposed to a sleeve has been a blessing
it 's great , when i saw it , i thought it was n't going to fit my laptop -lrb- # `` -rrb- , but when i tried it , it fits great i like this backpack very much

great , i 've been looking for a nice slim backpack to carry my laptop , binders , folders , portable hard drive , card readers , etc . the part i like most is that it 's not ugly i really appreciate the subtle , clean , design as well as the material used i do n't foresee this wearing much , but i still plan to buy a couple extra so i can use this model for life padding is very adequate after # month 's daily use , i have n't noticed a thing i 'm not happy with and for the price , i imagine the # reason not to get this is for size requirement reasons
i 've had this bag for # years now i would say that i have tested the limits of this bag between using it for carrying equipment and supplies for my job while at the same time hauling text books around for night school , this bag has seriously stood up to the test of time if i pick this bag up tomorrow morning and it completely rips apart , my five star rating would remain the same i 'd probably <unk> right back on amazon and buy another one
perfect space for <unk> lots and lots of <unk> i can tell you a story about the little banana that could but well i will look for my next product review about the
absolutely wonderful laptop backpack my # . # `` asus fits perfectly inside the large pocket , and i still have plenty of room to keep my books and notebooks in the additional pockets for school i use this thing almost every day whether its to carry my laptop , school supplies , or both very well padded to keep your laptop safe and sound , and extremely high quality overall
fantastic laptop backpack i 've been looking for a nice case for my dell # . # inch laptop for a long time i was on vacation in utah and the junk one i had broke i took a chance , because i needed something to carry the dell home in , on the case logic value # -inch backpack super fantastic , hands free , tons of pockets , and i put the # . # inch computer and a wireless key board in the computer pocket and zipped it shut all this for # of what i was going to spend for a case case logic vnb- # value # -inch laptop backpack -lrb- black
had the bag for # days , before the rivet that holds the shoulder strap pulled completely out i was n't carrying it every day i had n't been stuffing it full either it carried my # `` laptop , a dvd case , the power cord , a small external hard drive , a mouse , and a composition style notebook
what i received is actually a small case that would possibly fit a kindle or ipad there 's no way that a # & # # ; laptop computer would fit in it maybe this is the & # # ; case & # # ; for the laptop & # # ; case & # # ; ? ? am going to send back and see if it can be exchanged hopefully , the wrong product was sent
i bought this for my daughter for school & the day we recieved the case she put her laptop in it & the strap hook broke off she loved the look of it & it fit perfectly , it was just made poorly it was easy to return though
i have been using it to keep my # `` laptop , # `` tablet , a light binder and a couple small notebooks , and a couple other small electronics , and a few other things <unk> it 's a lot i 'll admit , but i 've had other laptop bags that have had no problem with carrying this much stuff i 've been using it for all this regularly since the day i got it about three weeks into using it , the strap broke off -lrb- and i would always use the strap and the handle at the same time so there was n't too much stress on just the strap -rrb- the metal rings used to attach the hooks to the strap broke in half , so i started using just the little handle at the top three weeks after using that , that thing broke too , but instead it was the leather around the handle that snapped other than that , it 's a very cute bag with a lot of compartments i would n't recommend using this if you 're actually planning to carry things in it , though at least invest in a more sturdy strap
we ordered the zebra hot pink laptop bag for my daughter 's birthday we recieved a couple days before her birthday to discover that even though it was labeled zebra it was definitely not zebra stripes but some sort of paisley hot pink it was too late by then to send back so we wrapped it our daughter liked it ok and decided to keep it i think she really liked the zebra pattern better i would be wary of ordering anything from this seller again
super cute laptop case has lots of different compartments love the front velcro pouch when i first recieved it in the mail , i seriously had to air it out for like a week because it <unk> <unk> bad like plastic
my laptop is a # ' and the strap broke within the second week , not even being carried daily i had to buy scotch guard to keep it clean so far , that is my only problem hopefully i will be able to replace the strap
the plastic <unk> on the handle broke after my daughter only used the bad a couple of weeks she is still using it but the handle is only held together by a small piece
i really like this bag it has plenty of room for all my stuff , and lots of pockets for small things the only thing that prevents me from giving this a five star rating is that the shoulder strap pad could be a little more substantial otherwise it was a great purchase
this is a great bag that will carry your laptop and a bunch of other things you may need the bag is sturdy and has a nice handle the colors are a beautiful leopard animal print i like this bag and would recommend it for folks who need a nice large bag that can carry everything they need
this really is a great case i 've dropped my computer while it 's inside of this and it was completely unharmed however , i 've only had it since august in november , the over-the-shoulder strap broke there 's a handle though , so no big deal , right well , just yesterday , the handle broke too the rubber that attaches it ripped , and then the cloth completely fell apart it does its job , though its a bit pricey i would buy from this company again
i purchased this laptop case for my daughters # . # `` laptop and she loves it there are several compartments and pockets to store all the extras like cords , headphones , dvds , etc . great product for the price

i love this zebra laptop bag it is perfect for any animal print lover its so unique and <unk> . perfect for the diva who likes to stand out in a crowd i have a purple dell latitude and decided to purchase this for my laptop i even purchased the laptop skin to match , along with several other accessories including a zebra mouse pad its so me i have lots of room for the adapter and other laptop accessories it seems to hold up well when carrying with included strap , and also the handle i am sure to catch many eyes with this wonderful accessories , , a true conversation piece , pretty and practical
