i love this stuff and it fits perfectly on my comp . not a problem at all , which i noticed is not the same in other reviews i gave # stars bc the case looked dirty but over all a good product
i really thought that this was going to be a scam and was prepared to send it back right after i got it but it 's real life i was really just looking for a keyboard cover , hard case , and carrying case for my mac so this package basically included a complimentary mouse and screen protector - which was awesome most incase mac covers are around $ # , and most hard covers are upwards of $ # in stores so this package is great everything is awesome except the mouse the tracking speed is pretty slow and it 's very cheaply made but heck , it was essentially free so i do n't really care and i will use it regardless
i just got it today and love it ! ! it fits perfectly on my # something inch macbook pro with retina display the blue color looks a little more seafoam blue then tiffany blue , but not complaining what i do n't like about it is the soft mesh sleeve bag had a strong acrylic smell , but i just <unk> it with some detergent also the mouse looks and has the like you could get it from the dollar store feeling for the future , i would buy it with out the
i love all of it the color is great and everything fit perfect the only thing is the mouse seems kind of cheap and seems like it could fall apart on me but it is still awesome also the keyboard kind of drives me crazy it seems to be a little loose hopefully i can get it to fit better
very pressed with the customer service that was provided i originally ordered the wrong size and they walked me through a speedy exchange love my products as the cover fits like a glove
i absolutely loved this package i never used the screen protector because it just wasnt working for me . but besides that everything was great i received so many compliments from people about my case it 's almost perfect would definitely recommend it to anyone who would need a slim case
fits my # & # # ; retina macbook pro perfectly the colors look great , everything 's exactly as pictured really nice to have a screen protector and key board cover to preserve laptop condition too
this came when it said it would the colors are pretty accurate my only problem with this is the keyboard cover is a little off center and , personally for me it 's hard to type so i just took it off overall great product
love the color and quality the wireless mouse is nothing to write home about but who cares when everything else works great and looks great ca n't beat it for the price
this was exactly what i was expecting ! such good items for such a good price ! definitely worth it ! ! the only thing is that the key board does n't have light shining
the bottom of the case snapped on and functions as it should the top part of the case constantly comes unclipped and falls off the only thing holding it to the laptop are little clips that barely hold on to the monitor , the slightest bump will knock the top cover off would not make this purchase again
the built in stand is great the protection is great but the top cover for my laptop is not straight so it does not stay on properly but overall it does what the description said it would
this was a very nice case and exactly what i was looking for , but it does not fit a # . # hp envy i had absolutely no trouble returning it for a full refund and was very pleased with that process
this is a good case when it is not on the laptop , it appears very flimsy this is not true when it is on the laptop it adds a noticeable amount of weight onto the laptop however , this is the only case i have seen made for this type of computer series it is a good looking case the folds in the back elevate the laptop at a good angle for a nice typing experience the case took quite some time to attach to the computer overall this is a good case and i would recommend it to a friend
i bought this case not expecting much considering that i had never heard of ipearl before my envy goes to school back and forth every day , on the train , and between classes in a backpack full of books that being said it had broken twice in one month where a hinge came off this case seemed to have solved that problem it 's been a good month no damage , and the case feels nice it does add a little weight to your laptop but its well worth it for the protection it offers the stands are also very helpful for typing at a more comfortable angle i highly recommend this case and will be ordering one for my brothers macbook as well
though the pack itself seemed sturdy , i had to return it immediately because it did not fit my # `` dell studio laptop on the plus side , the return process went smoothly
i expected so much of this bag - and it has been a <unk> it is to small for my # . # & # # ; hp pavillion dv # and it it hardly fits my acer # & # # ; . it is a nice bag overall - but will but useless to me
i really like the design and durability of this backpack , with one or two reservations the water bottle pockets come unzipped and allow the water bottle to fall out i had to buy a water bottle holder and install it on one side of the backpack the other flaw , as i see it , are a total absence of exterior loops upon which to fasten items , like water bottle holders the water bottle flaw cost this backpack a star
pack is pretty good i had a larger ogio pack prior to this , and i would like another one or two slots inside the pack to separate papers , etc for work/school well made ... tough to beat the build
very reliable backpack and at a good price which made it even better if you are looking for a good backpack for your laptop with enough room for your accessories then look no further
i am attending a laptop university -lrb- all students receive a university laptop that is used for <unk> . -rrb- and this backpack protects my macbook well it 's a # & # # ; screen , and this pocket has adequate packing for it a # & # # ; laptop will probably fit inside , but check out other reviews to make sure that 's the case has plenty of pockets , looks nice other backpacks probably have more storage for textbooks , etc . but it is a trade off laptop protection for less pocket space for textbooks , notebooks worth it in my
this backpack is perfect , besides the front zipper flaw everything is great but when received the front little zipper in the front does n't close properly due to a stitching flaw great besides that
this is a decent backpack , but i felt that it just was n't roomy enough for my needs . putting a laptop and a tablet in it left little room i wish they had made an additional tablet compartment just behind the & # # ; utility & # # ; portion of the backpack i would have liked it more if there was room for one decent sized textbook or computer book in the main compartment after placing a tablet , and an organizer in it i ended up returning it but if you do n't need a lot of room , and want your electronics safely stored , this is a great option the padding for the laptop was fantastic , and i felt like the tablet spot was decently padded i wish they had made that a tiny bit bigger as well , though it was a pretty tight squeeze for a # & # # ; tablet that had a thin case on it
i have big shoulders , this backpack barely fits even though it 's labeled & # # ; large & # # ; quality is really good color is a lot brighter than it looks in the photo , less grey , more white
my only complain is that normally for most laptop bags , there is a strap which is used to secure the laptop to keep it in place this bag does not have that strap and the laptop inside will sometimes & # # ; bounce & # # ; up and down especially when i am walking down slope otherwise , its good value for the cost of $ # , would be great if it comes with the strap to hold down the laptop
wonderful computer backpack a little smaller in size than my last laptop backpack , but that is what i was looking for this is my # rd ogio product great price for a solid performing product
i 've had this pack for several months now and use it daily for my commute back and forth to work via motorcycle zippers are smooth and have held up well the straps are very comfortable even when fully loaded down and appear to be holding up well this replaced a very serviceable targus bag that had served me well but had seen better days this bag seems to be every bit as durable but more plush , stylish and with loads more usable compartments
fits my dell m # like a glove i even have a legal notepad on the same laptop compartment there is space for my xoom tablet a usb track ball goes in a side pocket i carry the charger on the main compartment and still room to spare seems to be very well made , as other ogio products i 've used in the past
this pack has excellent durability and lots of pockets perfect for a high school freshman this pack gets completely jammed every single day and is no worse for the wear
this is a great bag , bigger than i expected but not overly huge , just perfect it has so many pockets and places to organize all of my things i love this bag i am a big fan
just as i said the bandit # is more than i expected it has plenty of compartments , way more than i can fill i have a # . # laptop and it fits snug , the compartment for it and my tablet is well padded the water bottle holder on the side keeps it secure with a bungee adjustable strap i recommend it to everyone , it 's durable , it has it all most amazing was the quick delivery , i could not believe how fast it arrived
this is a big bag has lots of zippered pockets zippers are heavy duty and well made the laptop enclosure is well padded with a felt like material very soft and perfect for up to a # inch laptop the materials are top notch and very durable for me , this bag meets my needs very well as i wanted a big bag that could carry some overnight clothes , my ms surface , etc .
i originally bought the renegade by ogio but did not like it this one is substantially shorter and lighter yet still fits all my gear without issue i also think this one is more comfortable and seems to have longer straps than the renegade very high quality and will last a long time
i needed a compact backpack that fits easily under plane seats and has a professional look so i can use it at meetings and conferences -lrb- i 'm a <unk> woman with a bad back , and i need to use backpacks rather than briefcases . this backpack is compact , attractive , and well designed in many respects -- lots of compartments , for example -- but it 's not comfortable to wear the laptop compartment is at very back , and , even with the back padding , the backpack is straight and hard with no <unk> as a <unk> i moved my laptop to the center compartment and put papers in the laptop compartment , and that helps a bit i 'm certainly using it , and i appreciate the appearance , compactness , and flexible compartments , but my next backpack will be contoured with more padding another downside is no water bottle pouch , but there are <unk> for that
fits my laptop perfectly , provides great protection for my gear , has all of the pockets my ocd heart <unk> , and it actually fits well i have received numerous compliments on the styling and the fit , the low-profile depth makes it both attractive and more comfortable to wear while allowing organizational maintenance -lsb- not cavernous means minimal shifting
i really , really love this day pack very well designed and <unk> product with multitude of pockets and compartments dedicated to a growing number of items we cary with us these days such as wallets , smartphones , headphones , ids , passports , etc . it 's very light yet sturdy , very compact yet offers plenty of <unk> fits my # & # # ; macbook perfectly in the padded compartment in the back and would probably accept a larger laptop easily i 'd highly recommend it to anyone looking for this king of luggage
my macbook pro # inch will not fit in this the case measures exactly # inches but does n't account for the sewing inside which takes up a little space the case really should be made a little bigger as my macbook is about # th on an inch on the side from going in
bought it for my girlfriend to try and carry her ipad and macbook air # & # # ; while you can squeeze the air into this sleeve , it is way too tight and would scratch the finish ended up returning it immediately ... nice idea but poor
nice protective sleeve to transport both laptop and ipad in one place the fit is snug but i do like that i wish it had a handle seems well made and the color is really nice
i really liked the sleeve for my mac air it fit perfect at first i thought it would n't fit , but it did it is snug i do not have room to fit a second item , but i can place my charger in the
fits my macbook pro -lrb- retina display -rrb- perfectly it 's cute and the material seems pretty durable , although i 've only had it for a few weeks i do n't have an ipad , but i like the outside pocket for carrying pens and papers you have to fold papers to put them in there , but generally that 's not a problem for me overall i would definitely recommend buying this product
i was waiting for a real rmbp sleeve -lrb- i mean , with a snug fit for the rmbp -rrb- that was n't as expensive as the mamba this definitively achieves that , it 's tailor made for the rmbp and the price is low you ca n't ask for more beware : if you have the regular mbp , it wo n't fit in the sleeve i 've seen a photo here of someone trying , and obviously it was n't going to fit
i have the older style macbook pro # inch it was purchase in # so it is not the slim version however the case fits the laptop very well i was looking for a case that did n't give a lot of movement inside & this fits the bill perfect on top of that i can put my ipad air in the outside flap & everything fits really well even tried the ipad with a slim case & it did fit , but was a tight fit was looking for a case that would provide protection while inside my main messenger bag & again it is very good in this respect however i do n't think it would provide much protection if dropped onto a hard surface
this worked great for my computer and ipad , the only downside is that it is a bit snug for the computer , but it still fits and maybe will loosen up over time
this one is not cheap it protected my laptop -lrb- a little bit tight for my old version of mac pro # `` -rrb- and i could put my ipad in it as well
holds my # & # # ; retina macbook pro and # rd gen ipad -lrb- with back cover and smart cover -rrb- exactly like it says you do n't have room for any cables or power supplies this was perfect for what i needed it for
i picked this item up the other day during a lightning deal here on amazon i have been looking for a <unk> bag like this to carry the rails for a camera dolly the width was perfect and the bag looked to be a great value for what i was looking to use it for unfortunately , the bag is just too soft and flexible for my needs the picture on : amazon made it look bulky and substantial , but if it 's not packed to the brim with clothing it wo n't actually look like this i hesitate giving it # stars because for it 's intended use it probably deserves # stars - especially if you are looking for a # & # # ; weekend bag for clothes and shoes for me , i would have liked a some rigidity in the side walls to help it keep its shape during travel
wish they made a larger version of this bag the wide zip open top is convenient and the look is cool a bigger option would have made it perfect but we returned it as it ultimately to small for our needs
i needed a new travel bag for a week long vacation and this worked wonderfully i wanted something that will last a long time and it certainly feels like it 's well made and will last on top of that the soft material <unk> down easily for storage the only down side would be the size if you 're looking for something that can hold a lot but i 'm a guy and it easily fit a weeks worth of clothes and toiletries
after buying this product i bought a targus # & # # ; laptop case for # x the price the targus <unk> much more protection -lrb- its padded -rrb- , more pockets and compartments for your accessories , a luggage handle strap so it can be carried in tow it just a better design for travel , the black <unk> <unk> nylon laptop carrying bag is poor - your expensive equipment can easily be damaged
i bought the grey one and have been using it for # months it 's ok , i like the color and it 's thick enough -lrb- a bit too bulky -rrb- to protect my laptop what i ca n't like about this is that it 's a bit too long , and still there is no space for the adapter make it either long enough to fit the adapter in or make the pockets big or loose enough to fit it , and it would be perfect other than that , i love it that it has a pocket on the back which allows me to put passport and flight tickets when i travel also it 's good that it has a removable shoulder strap
this case seems to be well built additionally , the design allows convenient insertion and removal of the laptop -lrb- using this for the # & # # ; lenovo yoga -rrb- the side compartments are adequate in size to store the power cord , microfiber cloth , and a small wireless mouse i have no complaints on this item
this is one of the few cases i could find for my lenovo yoga i needed a case with a shoulder strap this is a great case with outside pockets that can hold the cord and other incidentals great company that produced it
i tried both this model and the compact and i preferred the compact version the compact version is still # l and has # pocket versus # on this model for some reason the compact version looks less boxy than the regular campus
great product for what it 's worth i love the simplicity of it ... no bells and whistles but it has all the compartments i could ask for my air feels well cushioned and protected , and it 's great for school as well as travel great commuter backpack
i bought this for my daughter who is a flight attendant , lives in <unk> , and <unk> <unk> she specifically asked for one that would not draw attention but would carry all the things she needs to get through several days at a time she loves it it 's got a few hidden pockets that are quite functional the construction is solid and the appearance screams & # # ; quality . & # # ; a pretty good value considering its overall functionality and good but not flashy appearance
i am a <unk> chic fan and have owned # other of these brand bags from amazon over the years unfortunately the grey chevron color bag is of a different material then others that i have purchased the others were made of a high quality fabric but this color is made out of a plasticky -lrb- or plastic coated ? ? -rrb- material which cheapens the look and feel
this bag is very stylish and a great size and color just a fyi it is a shiny material that almost looks water-proof even though i was n't expecting it , i like the feature since i will be traveling with this bag a lot and bringing it to work everyday so i can keep it clean
i can fit my easily my computer , charger , and a number of notebooks in this bag the bag looks plasticky and less sophisticated than the look i was going for it is functional and better looking <unk> light weight than those manly bags that come free from work
roomy , travels well and gets tons of compliments i love the fact that there 's a slot for me to place this bag over my suitcase handle makes traveling with multiple pieces so much easier
this holds an ipad perfectly , but you ca n't put too much else in it i have a keyboard cover on my ipad , which makes it thicker than an ipad alone , but it 's not that much thicker the cushion inside this bad is rather thick , so the ipad fell protected , but it does n't leave a lot of room i can fit a very slender notebook and some pens in the front pouch if you 're just looking to hold an ipad this will certainly work , but then as a ipad case it is rather bulky
it 's made very well , but the downside is that there 's insufficient space for extras such as a wallet and when my wallet does fit in , it bulges out - not very pretty my solution - when i take my laptop , i keep other things to a minimum if my laptop is not in it , there 's room for other stuff
it was nice bag , plenty of pockets and all but once i put my computer and other things in , there was no room for files and papers ended up exchanging this for a larger bag but this is good if you 're looking for something streamlined
i love all the pockets , the looks , the quality i only have to say that it is a bit too narrow once you put in the laptop , a very slim one , the cables , the ipad you are very short of room for even a pencil i could not fir a regular laptop in it it is great for a macbook air or a very slim laptop but even that it is too narrow so if you are planning to get all your work stuff in it , go for something else if you will carry just your air and cables and a few papers , you will be ok
the bag is very nice , but i noticed the corners of the laptop are exposed at the top , meaning rain can get in if you are n't careful also i dropped the bag and the corner of the laptop got dented because there is no padding for the top corners so , nice looking , good storage , not so good protection
just got the bag - little smaller than i expected but overall really like it i did not want a really big bag - something lightweight to take my laptop to work every day with some compartments for paper , charger , etc .
i love this bag it is small and big all at the same time i am carrying an # & # # ; macbook pro with retina , an ipad air along with misc personal items
i really did a lot of research before buying this bag i wanted something that would be as minimalistic as possible while still fitting my # & # # ; macbook air , an ipad in a speck case , and chargers for both it does that perfectly with a little room to carry pens , pencils , passport , and a small notebook exactly what i was looking for
our school system purchased the older model of these when all the kids switched to laptops and my daughters is holding up well i saw this version here and snapped it up great for travel or a trip to <unk> the shoulder pad is a little larger than i expected but all in all it is very sturdy and well lined makes me feel like it is protecting my netbook without feeling like a brick on my shoulder accepts a tablet on the outside pocket
this bag has everything there are pockets to spare and when not in use , the bag is pleasantly slim most pockets are lined i am able to fit my laptop , tablet , phone , pens , usb keys , reasonably sized <unk> book , power supplies , and usb battery backup charger into this bag without looking ridiculous it 's light , stylish , and functional
this is my second stm bag if you like a bag that is made for your apple products , stm fits the bill my macbook and ipad fit perfectly in this bag and there is still enough room for other necessities
i bought this after trying out a ` slim ' bag from apple , which was anything but slim and light this is so light and could carry both my laptop and ipad with room for cords , lipstick , etc . and it looks sleek i might prefer if they made a small backpack version of this , but i am loving it
love the compartments in the front i use them for a flash drive , pen and the key chain clip is nice as well especially if you have a push start vehicle and do n't need to pull out your keys the middle compartment fits my ipad air perfectly and the bigger compartment houses multiple items like battery charger , sunglasses case etc . good buy for
i am happy with this purchase it happened to be the perfect size for me my # & # # ; <unk> is pretty bulky -- barely fits , but it does fit the bag is made of high-quality materials , and just works really well
for months i had been looking for a messenger bag that i could bring my macbook pro and my ipad with all accessories but i also wanted the bag was not so big this bag is perfect ! ! the construction looks great ! !
well constructed yet lightweight holds my ipad air , cordless keyboard , camera , phone , multiple chargers , wallet , notebook , etc . in well protected environment stylishly designed with nice details we 'll worth the money for someone on the go and looking for a professional bag for men
i 've been relying on <unk> core laptop <unk> # years now for commuting and traveling the belkin core is a minimalist , no-frills <unk> by contrast , the case logic <unk> has twice the pockets , twice the capacity , and twice the heft although it comes with a tag <unk> `` light weight , `` everything about it feels beefy to me even the zippers are heavier -lrb- and , as a result , louder -rrb- comparing it to the belkin core is like comparing the macbook pro to the macbook air it 's different because it 's tailored to different needs if you need to carry around , say , a bottle of water and a pair of <unk> headphones in addition to your laptop , the case logic <unk> is a great choice if you just want to sling your laptop and a pair of sunglasses on your back , go for the belkin core
originally for me until ` not me ' saw and it was sucked away like a <unk> <unk> the light weight is amazing for it 's size , heft and sturdiness we use it for airplane travel and it 's a breeze to fit our sony viao and our ipad plus in the middle we put the hp touch , a mouse , chargers and our <unk> gps plus a sweater and sweatshirt if we get cold the zippered pockets are easily accessible and smooth to open and close very ergonomic - liked it so much we bought it for our soon to be college freshman i am hoping the price will come down - it seems a little steep for what it is
i have many backpacks and wanted a backpack that had a lot of compartments and would hold just the right amount of stuff of course this depends on what you are carrying for my electronics , i typically carry my macbook air # & # # ; , ipad air , mouse , power adapters and mini surge protector other than that i like to carry some files , snacks , water and various office supplies this backpack is great in that it is lightweight and is well built i particularly like how the zippers are actually a cord like material rather than metal zippers i always seem to have the metal zippers fail first on my backpacks the only reason why i took # star away is that the backpack can not hold much more than what i listed above while you might think that is a lot , i actually sometimes would like to throw a portable scanner into my bag but it is very tight and usually does n't fit if this bag does n't fit everything you need , then i would also recommend the targus drifter ii which is slightly larger
this backpack is very good for keeping your computer and ipad safe while carrying them around i was using a shoulder bag but i always worried about its safety with my computer and did n't fit my ipad well at all all the wires , etc . were in one pocket so i was always worried about pulling out a cord and accidentally losing my flash drive , etc . this is so much easier and very well planned i can also put clothing and other items in the bag it 's not for long term travel but a day bag really nice and i can put my belongings in a better place
it seems like a fine product however mine arrived damage and as it 's only fulfilled by amazon i could not file it as a replacement , only a return i decided i 'd rather repair the damage myself instead of go through the return process i would buy this again and hope that damaged products are a rare case
this case is rugged if all you need to do is put your chromebook in it , it 's perfect if you need to put anything else in the case aside from a few folded papers , you might want to look at a different one the case has very , very little room in it maybe for a pen , but certainly not for any accessories even leaving my bluetooth mouse adapter attached to my acer c # made it a fight to get the zipper closed i sent the case back , not because of any quality issues , but that the case has zero extra room i would have given more stars , but one of the photos of the case shows what looks like an address book , a usb cable , and a <unk> for something , all inside the case i can pretty much guarantee there 's no way that case would close with all of those items and the chromebook
this is for my youngest daughter to store after use slim is the good point to carry around but the trade off is you can not carry a charger or mouse -lrb- that 's the trade off and i knew that going in .
this is the booq case for an # -inch chromebook , not to be confused with the booq case for the # -inch macbook air make sure this is the one you want i love this case it is good protection for my relatively flimsy samsung chromebook there are other pockets that can hold papers and things i would n't try to fit much more than a business card in there
this product , which is branded for the chromebook , offers <unk> protection for my sony vaio flip / fit # a and costs $ # less than the same product branded for the macbook air # personally , i prefer this version of black with a splash of red than the <unk> macbook version , plus it 's nearly half the price the shell is very rigid and incredibly slim , so it fits like a glove that actually protects your ultrabook booq 's unique ridges on both sides absorb a lot of the shock , while giving the case a very hip minimalist profile kudos to booq for its innovative approach to style and function
received this and immediately returned it build quality was absolutely horrible looked like cheap black plastic wrapped around a thin piece of cardboard -lrb- of which you could see the outline around the entire case -rrb- looked and felt extremely cheap there is no way i would consider putting anything electronic in this and would honestly be embarrassed to carry it around do yourself a favor and find something that at least resembles decent quality
it is synthetic product , not a real leather the edge felt out easily and no padding be careful when using it as it potentially denting your computer when it hard corners
i ordered this <unk> my # & # # ; macbook pro would be able to fit inside this case ; however , i received this package , and it does not fit the case 's width seems to be exactly # inches , and therefore the macbook can not fit inside of it i believe only the macbook air would be able to fit inside of this case it is very , very slim the case looks and feels great , though , but a # & # # ; macbook pro will not fit inside this case
it 's so thin that it offers almost no protection at all virtually any other case is going to be better than this one this is n't a $ # case , it 's a $ # case - at most
i 've been using this sleeve for a month with an asus zenbook prime ux # a , a # . # & # # ; laptop that it <unk> works well with in that month the stitching and corners have frayed i wish i would have spent twice as much for a product that would last me twenty times longer - this product is garbage
i have stickers on my macbook air , and i noticed that after using this product for a couple of days , the red interior fabric was bleeding onto the stickers
i use this case as well as a speck case for my mac it leaves ugly pink / red marks on my speck case due to the lining of the sleeve
this is a thin , low profile case , and quite handsome , but it is not leather pu -lrb- poly -rrb- synthetic leather is a man made material that will <unk> the look and feel of genuine leather but in fact is not that being said , you paid $ # for a case to & # # ; protect & # # ; an aluminum cased laptop , so if all you want is something to prevent scratches , this is it the red & # # ; suede & # # ; interior is nice and helps the laptop slide in and out easily this is nice and snug for the macbook pro # retina this will not fit the larger older macbook pro # that has the cd drive
this is a hard plastic cover i was hoping for a flexible cover i purchased it to hide the many <unk> of my samsung as i bought the unit off the shelf of a big box store
it fits my computer the bottom part is a little strange when using it on a desk -lrb- and without the stand on , it could fall over easily -rrb- so i just use the top half it looks nice . :
the cover came very quickly -lrb- ordered on thursday , received on following monday -rrb- it was exactly as pictured and was so easy to install it just clicks into place your computer is now stylish and protected i love it
the shell is in great quality and the retractable feet is perfect when you have to do work on your laptop it 's easy to take off and put on too overall , it 's a great product that you wo n't regret buying it
perfect <unk> and gives my laptop a los of protection from scratches it also has # stand on the bottom part <unk> gives better airflow , and also better position to wrists
after waiting for the new model case to be released , it was worth the wait the case fits like a glove and provides protection from scratches and minor damage it accommodates for the feet on the laptop so that it does n't interfere with how it fits the additional stands on the bottom allow for better airflow than the computer without anything it also changes the angle to be easier on the wrists pros : protection , airflow , <unk> : none to
this cover fits my samsung series # ultrabook perfectly i purchased the red color and it arrived very quickly it looks great , and the added kickstand offers comfort while typing will definitely recommend to friends
