i have had this book bag for less than a week and i already rate it as the best back pack i have ever owned its light weight , it looks nice and it is very comfortable its not for people who are carrying too many things , but for me its fine
i love the way this backpack fits snugly on my back i 've enough space for a thick # . # & # # ; laptop , its thick charger , a ~ # <unk> waterbottle , portable hard disk , phone , earphones , gloves and a couple of notebooks it has enough space to hold these items and they do n't shake up and cause weird movements or noises inside even when on a light <unk> the zippers appear sturdy and are smooth enough lots of dedicated storage areas so that the space is well manages in all # dimensions the straps dont dangle and i almost forgot that they are there , rolled up and held together , completely out of your way the material and stitch quality is pretty good , too plus , it looks and feels great , compact , clean , simple and elegant was so happy with it , bought another one right away as a gift to my brother
unfortunately this does n't fit either of my hp laptops it 's <unk> so , if you 're looking for a solid caselogic inexpensive case for a particular computer , this would work fine the way all caselogic products do it 's <unk> in color , not flashy at all what with already having briefcase-style handles , it would probably benefit from a shoulder strap attachment at least
i rush ordered the item because i needed a new case for my laptop , but the very first time i used the product , the zipper broke the color is great and i like the side pocket , but it feels cheap - and acts like it
this is a very sleek yet sturdy case i like the practical design for the laptop does n't have much room for anything else , but it does what it is supposed to do , and does it safely
case looks nice and is a great size for my acer aspire s # nicely padded to protect computer and the handles are a definite plus the only drawback is that the pocket in the front is just barely big enough to hold the computer cord and the zipper is a bit hard to open
this is a good place to protect my laptop , the carrying handles are convenient it 's a tight squeeze to fit my power adaptor too , but it does fit <unk> the laptop well , but not much else
my first impression of this case was that it was very classy and professional looking it 's also very sturdy it has no inside pockets where a cord would fit , but does have an almost invisible zipper pocket on the outside where you could put the cord and other small supplies it 's a burgundy color with a slight floral design that 's almost <unk> this is a great case that will make you look like a professional
perfect fit for a # `` macbook pro well made with padding for some protection this a better than a sleeve and less bulky than a laptop case great product for the price , around $ #
i use it for my laptop that is # inches , and it fits fine the only problem is the power cord does n't fit , but that 's not a big deal i also use this for my ipad
there are quite a few laptop sleeves being produced today if you have a # `` laptop , or something smaller , this product will do there 's nothing fancy about it the price is really the best selling point as well as the fact that it comes with handles the padding is adequate , nothing special , and there are no pockets so you pretty much just have the sleeve area to fit your laptop not much else will fit , although if you have a very thin laptop you might be able to squeeze in a folder or two with some papers otherwise , considering the price it 's going for , it 's a good investment if you 're not looking for anything out of the ordinary
i use this case for my macbook air # & # # ; i 'm able to put the changer in with it as well as my mouse and still zip it shut it is n't bulky and there is a nice subtle floral kind if detail on the case that makes it a little feminine without being girly i 've found it to be <unk> made
the case logic uns- # -inch laptop/mac book air sleeve is an attractive and well built soft covering for your thin <unk> book or mac book i was immediately impressed with the quality of construction the stitching and seams were nicely done and the two zippers were sturdy and easy to work i expect this case to be durable as well you get a space inside for your computer and a small side pocket with a separate zipper for accessories like a usb drive or discs works well with my small asus netbook it is very attractive , functional and well made and is designed to do one thing and to do it well ` good job ' case logic
the color and construction of this inexpensive case makes it a standout in a sea of plain black computer covers , the `` tannin `` color -lrb- let 's get real -- it 's burgundy , or maroon -rrb- makes this one understated yet distinctive and the brighter pink pattern of the lining is a secret , happy surprise the case 's stitching also lifts it a step above the ordinary , adding a subtle pattern to the exterior behind the hidden zipper is a pocket big enough to hold the charger without too much of a bulge the padding is adequate if you need to keep your macbook safe during ordinary inter-office travels , and the handles make it easier to haul than a simple sleeve i 'd want something more substantial if i were doing much hardcore travel , but the case is sleek enough to slip into a larger tote , if necessary
nice colour , well-constructed , pocket surprisingly spacious although i would only store slimmer items -lrb- i.e cds in cases rather than bulky chargers or a computer mouse -rrb- attractive design and comfortable handles fits my lenovo thinkpad edge e # very well without being hard to zip shut
i was nervous that this bag would not fit my # `` hp laptop but it fits like a glove very nice fabric and the purple color is very pretty also , the handles are really nice to have i can fit my powercord in the side pocket , but ca n't really zip it shut that 's the only downsize however , it 's a really nice bag and i 'm glad i purchased it do n't be fooled by the mac book air sleeve in the title of this product , it 's great for other computers as well
i was looking for a simple case for our new portable dvd player and did n't want to spend too much money since we were n't planning on using the case that much i picked this one for the price it 's like they took the <unk> material to make this a few week later , the smell is still <unk> but it is not that bad the case works perfect for what we need it for and the front pocket easily holds the charger and remote this is fine if you are looking for a cheap option but if you do n't mind spending the money , get something better
i was looking for something which would protect my ipad # while it is in my griffin survivor case , and this is the only one which fit i could do without the handles , but it works as a cheap , basic case
i got this case for the ipad # for extra protection when traveling . it is larger that the ipad , so the ipad with a leather case fits fine i was also able to put in the power cord and headset in the case along with the ipad
this is a great notebook tote has two sturdy handles , a zippered pouch on the front that is big enough for my charger , mini mouse and computer glasses case ... and zips opens from both sides looks good too i am glad i bought it
this is perfect for my # `` portable dvd player it fits nicely , not too loose or too tight the zippered pocket on the front is just big enought to hold the <unk> <unk> unbelievably nice for such a low price
i bought this for our portable dvd player , and it fits perfectly theres even a little zipper pocket on the top for remote and/or cord very handy and good price i 'm very pleased
i 've only been using this case for about month so i have n't got all my things organized in it , but it has more pockets and pouches than my previous case my biggest worry was that it would n't have enough padding to protect my pc but i think it 's pretty decent at least as thick as my previous inland case one cool thing is that it stands up on its own , as pictured , like a brief case nice wide case with the three big pockets one drawback is that the strap does not have swivel connectors where it attaches to the case the swivel keeps the strap from ever getting twisted once you 've had a case with that you 'll want every case or bag to have those that 's my only knock on it so far my $ # inland case lasted me about # years so i 'll expect at least that kind of longevity from this one
i bought this as a christmas gift to replace a similar but smaller bag the recipient had owned the same brand of this bag , except in a slightly smaller version he 's a grad student who uses it to carry his laptop and a small amount of other necessities to class , often on a bike he really liked the original bag , but it had seen better days the strap is easy to put on across body to make it convenient to carry while riding he was very happy with the extra room in this bag and if it lasts as long as the first one it will be a great buy
since i travel a good deal i wanted something durable , which this appears to be having had it for # months now seems pretty well laid out and fits my # . # `` dell xps laptop with extended battery quite well i have n't tried leaving the laptop in the case since i use the section that the zipped section forms as another compartment for papers or files my one complaint is the strap , which does not have <unk> where it attaches to the case , and sometimes becomes twisted
got this for my boyfriend for his birthday since his old laptop bag was literally turning into shreds i debated going for a really nice leather one that was high end , or going a little cheaper on price to get something decent but not necessarily the most fashionable thing this bag is study , solid and a good buy for the price and i 'm glad i went with this there were a bunch of other wenger bags out there for <unk> but this one the right amount of pockets & space that was n't too bulky but too limited either
i use this everyday to carry my macbook air and ipad has plenty of additional compartments for storage of miscellaneous items including chargers and cables amazing fast shipping through amazon as always
great bag , excellent materials i was ordering as a replacement for the same bad i purchased # years ago i found a number of nice touches which enhance experience particularly improved handles , additional pockets and slightly smaller size
this bag is very nice the quality is top notch and will not tear i the seams and zippers are stiched very well i have had # + lbs in this bag and it has held up very <unk> it looks very professional
i received it today , and was disappointed to find that there was a crease on the front cover , and an indent on the back cover there is also a bad chemical odor i 'm going to air it out , and hopefully it wo n't be as bad however , as i expected , i liked the elastics on the corner that seem to keep the laptop in place like a previous reviewer mentioned , it does fit loosely when opened however , it 's a perfect fit for my # . # `` laptop when closed probably would n't purchase again , but for my needs , it 's decent
just received it today and i 'm not terribly excited it fits my sony vaio very snugly which makes it tough to get it on the laptop thankfully it stretches or it would not fit at all there is minimal padding so there 's very little actual impact protection and it has a very strong chemical smell in short , i got what i paid for wish i had gone with something more expensive - lesson learned
serves the purpose which was to have a light weight , but pretty carrying case that would protect my new mac air the width is fine , but is a bit too long the elastic on the corners is a good idea , but in reality the top left one gets in the way of the icon to close down the screen overall though , good little case
this case has worked wonders for helping to protect my macbook while this soft cover wo n't do any good if i were to drop my computer , it has protected against spills and other dirt i love the elastic straps on the edges that help keep the cover on my computer ; they are easily removed if i need to take the cover off my computer tends to heat up quite a bit while i am watching videos , but luckily this cover does not seem to be effected by the heat while i should have <unk> the design a little closer in the picture -lrb- butterflies are not really my style , i just wanted something red -rrb- this is overall a great product
i loved the look of this case but unfortunately it smelled so awful when it arrived ... and i tried everything to get rid of that bad rubber smell ... to no avail i had to finally throw it out ! i was very sad
i think you are getting what you pay for . there is a rubbery smell as most customers have said but it isnt too bad and you can air it out i received the package # days late , because ups is very problematic when it comes to my <unk> the color looks a little different than the picture . the case isnt extremely protective but its good if you want to carry it in your bag for that extra protection and to avoid scratches etc . .
i bought this to protect my # `` sony vaio from scratching in my backpack when i received the product , it is actually too small for my laptop i <unk> down and looked at the product description a bit more carefully and realized that its interior dimensions were only # . # x # inch , so it may not fit all # `` laptops the product itself is good quality and very stylish i did n't notice any bad smells either just make sure your computer is smaller than # inches or very thin
this is a good laptop case - fit the laptop however , it 's not as thick and sturdy as i would have liked the print looks <unk> online but can come across as a little cheesy in real life
i really enjoy the design of this case but i thought it would be lighter when it came , it was a very dark grey which was a bummer but the quality is good and it has a nice thick padding to protect my laptop
i like this case very much it fits my acer aspire # `` as a glove ! ! yes , it smells a little bit but i would n't say that it 's so bad as mentioned in some reviews and it 's very cute too i recommend this product to anyone
i bought this case originally for my mac , and it worked flawlessly the only thing is , this case is too small for other # `` laptops i recently purchased a thinkpad t # s , and it wo n't fit
product is a little darker than advertised , but it still looks nice mine does n't smell like anything to be honest , i do n't know what the other reviewers are talking about the case is nice and fits my hp pavilion dv # pretty well it 's only # stars because i thought it would be the color in the picture , but i 'm fine with the darker gray too mine arrived with a tiny little dent in it that wo n't go away , but i 'd rather not return it and wait for another one so double check that everything is fine
this laptop sleeve is ok . it protects my # inch laptop when im carrying it around . only con is it should have came with a handle so u dont have to hold the case awkwardly
i bought this mainly because of the art design and indeed it was nice and simple i just want something other than the plain colored <unk> or the floral artsy ones it 's grayish which matches my asus laptop fits fine with the # & # # ; inch size , with a bit room on all corners the padding is similar to regular <unk>
i got this for my # `` hp laptop it 's a pretty cute design and feels like quality material , but it 's definitely too loose my laptop slides around a lot inside the case ; i 'd prefer if it was more snug but it still functions fine as a case
i have a dell inspiron # , and the cover is a little snug it 's working well though and now i can carry my laptop in my school backpack rather than carry a separate laptop bag i 'd recommend this product , just do a bunch of research to make sure it will fit
what attracted me to this item was of course the <unk> <unk> it looks just as it is shown the only negative is that rubbery smell as stated by other customers that have purchased this it eventually goes away , for the most part but you can live with it other than that it 's great
this case fits my hp pavilion # inch with just about an inch on the side it was a little snug zipping the first time , but after leaving my computer in the case for a night it now zips easily i was pleased to see the amount of padding and did n't have the same smell problems that others experienced it is a little darker gray than the picture looks , but i like it even better
i have a # & # # ; acer aspire # t , which fits nicely into this sleeve it 's not a completely snug fit , since the sleeve is not custom designed , but i 'm not picky about a # & # # ; extra bit of room the case has a nice design , is well made , and has very smooth double zippers i mostly picked it out for the design because i wanted something that was n't plain but also would not compromise my credibility -lrb- no <unk> and flowers -rrb-
i bought this one # month ago and i really love this sleeve < # if u do n't mind spending # . # on a sleeve u can go for this one . :
this laptop case is amazing it fits a bit snug on my laptop , but i 'm fine with that it protects my laptop perfectly and i 've taken it to school in my backpack , and i 've had no problems with the case at all it 's pretty and i really love it and i read the reviews ahead of time and some of them said that their case smelled really bad when it arrived mine did n't smell at all so i do n't know why some people 's did overall , this case is really great
this fit my # inch acer ultrabook perfectly i love the cover design , and it 's exactly what i was looking for : something stylish while at the same time , protective it has a decent amount of padding to protect my computer , and it 's very reasonably priced too i do n't think you could get a similar product in stores for this same price
i thought this would be more of a case , less of a sleeve to my way of thinking a case is something that you carry , and is pretty sturdy a sleeve is something that you would use to cover a screen and would go inside a case the person who i gave it to said she would not use it for her ipad since it seemed so flimsy and the handle would easily break frankly i ca n't imagine anyone feeling comfortable enough to use the handle with a $ # tablet dangling from the end but i do think that it would make a good makeup case or a good skin
the sleeve is exactly as pictured , colors true & bright , graphic sharp the seams & zipper are well made it has good thickness of padding , with a kind of foam-like feel to it it is a bit too roomy for my # st generation ipad , i 'd prefer it to be snug
i just put it in the wash and it came out so nice and clean i did buy a leather case but still like this i feel it gives me more security in case i drop it a great purchase and i love the
i received my neoprene laptop sleeve yesterday , several days before stated delivery date i am never disappointed when ordering through amazon the neoprene sleeve is exactly what it says it is and i really liked the design , feel , and especially the fit i had read reviews about it smelling like plastic etc . to me , it just has that new sleeve smell , not a big deal to me i 'm very satisfied with my purchase and the price was amazing
i really like this case for either my # `` tablet with all the cords , earphones , etc . or my # `` tablet it 's thick enough to provide protection from scratches and bumps but lightweight enough that it is n't inconvenient to carry it also does n't hurt that it is pretty to look at
i have ipad # , but got this larger ipad # case so i could carry other things inside , like my kindle the really cool thing i did was take a picture of it and made it my <unk> on my screen i think it 's pretty and durable
i chose this case based on the beautiful colors unfortunately , this case looks cheap and the colors are different from the way they appear the turquoise is actually just a basic blue , and the pink is actually red , in addition to the other shades being different for me , the <unk> and <unk> of the colors make it much less appealing i ca n't comment on the quality of the item because the appearance alone made me not even use this item
i bought this for my # `` macbook pro i did n't need anything too heavy duty since i work from home and just wanted something that i could use when i went on business trips i used it literally four times and the should strap broke off , sending my computer crashing to the floor of an airplane thankfully , i also had a hard cover on my computer so there was no damage , but even for the inexpensive price , this was a complete waste of money
this is a nice case just not the color that it looked like on comp it is more <unk> color then pink but still pretty just not the color i
i just had to pick this up because i 'm a <unk> fan the item smells when you first get it , but it wears off after a few days i like having the option of handles , too it works great for travel because i did n't have to take my laptop out of this case during security however , i really wish there was a pocket for my charger/accessories also , the picture is a little fuzzy , but i like the design so much i do n't really care
i love these cases they have worked for me for # years i do n't use them often but they have held up very well over time and this design is just too cute if you 're taking your laptop to work or a <unk> or anywhere else , these soft but protective cases are essential for protecting them they also fit over the hard shell plastic case i put on my macbook air
love this bag it is so light to carry and i love how the shoulder pad sticks to my shoulder instead of sliding down my arm the design is beautiful and the colors are vibrant
this fits my daughter 's # & # # ; macbook pro retina perfectly nice , adjustable , detachable carrying strap material soft , yet sturdy & durable this is such an incredible steal for the price
i 've owned this bag before for a # & # # ; macbook pro and like it a lot however , this particular model came without the <unk> on the side of the bag being installed sure , there was a shoulder strap , but , there was absolutely no <unk> to attach it to so , <unk> , yeah
i bought this case because i had the same case for the apple macbook pro # `` and loved it however , i did return this case because it was not fitted to the macbook pro # `` as snug as the # `` case was fitted also , i did not like the fact that incase modified the external pockets with a zipper on top of the pockets instead of the flap the flap offered much <unk> access to the pockets for what it 's worth , i contacted incase and expressed to them my <unk> as well i wound up buying the brenthaven prostyle -lrb- tm -rrb- lite expandable sc for my use -lrb- personal and business travel -rrb- the brenthaven is by far the best and most versatile case i ever <unk> while toting around a notebook pc for the past # years
this is a well made laptop bag for bringing your computer , and not much else , to work each morning it 's small size , however , would make it difficult to hold all the things you need when you travel -lrb- even for the weekend -rrb- in short , getting a pair of sunglasses , wallet , phone , and charger into the pockets would be a very tight squeeze , and forget about headphones or anything else
i wish i had purchased this in one of the cool bright colors with the contrasting zipper color but this is just the size to fit my # `` aluminum body computer even with the speck case the pockets for the cords are just the right size to store both in separate pockets and have room for other <unk> it 's comfortable to hold from the pop out handles as well as using the strap cross-body a good buy when i needed it
buy your in case here it 's the same bag and it 's cheaper than the apple store just double check that you are getting the right size bag for your laptop you can verify on the in case website
my first generation ipad in its rubber case fits well in this bag there is also room for the charger and a phone the bag seems to be sturdy and well made it weighs very little and is easy to carry with the short handles or the shoulder strap i also like the gray color with the turquoise accents
i bought one of these for my <unk> , came back and bought another for my laptop pc i like that the bag actually weighs less than the pc and is not bulky like most pc bags the foam construction is thin but more than adequate for going form home to office this is like a <unk> between a sleeve and the usual pc bags
i bought this case for my new macbook pro and i just love it the size is just right and the zipped pockets carry the power cord with still room for other extras i would highly recommend this case for someone looking to have some storage the case is very streamlined , not bulky at all
i have purchased several bags for my mbp they were all so heavy the mbp is a heavy machine and this carrier really makes it more pleasant to carry and the shoulder pad is great after trying # different bags , this is my everyday bag the other ones are now collecting dust in the closet i love incase products
i have had another one of these cases for another computer and i love them the durability is <unk> fabric is virtually stain repellent , and does n't tear or wear at all the clips for the strap are solid metal and easy to clip on or off the case the handles and the strap are made from very high quality seatbelt like material that is so soft to the touch also , the shoulder padding on the strap is so comfortable i can fit my power cord with the extended three prong adapter in the pocket as well as various other extras like a separate keypad -lrb- i do a lot of accounting -rrb- the case , even when stuffed to the brim is still slim and easy to carry
the best thing about it is it fits a mbp -lrb- # `` -rrb- to perfection and therefore makes the computer in case feel smaller than using other cases and i like that the construction is pretty good but not sure how it will hold up one first reaction is the case fabric seems to attract dirt and dust a lot more than my previous case but a damp cloth and all is like new again i do recommend this case i just changed my rating by adding a star . # stars maybe the best snug fitting case for a macbook pro and yes , more money at the apple store so ... get this
i was expecting to be thicker then what i got to me to be able to protect the laptop should be a little more thicker plus the strap is too
i 'm not to happy with the color online the flowers look pink and in person it more red the blue is n't as vibrant in person than it is online the white is like off white , as well i think i 'm going to send it back
i ordered this laptop sleeve right after i purchased my laptop i wasnt sure how it would look because a lot of items you see on online rarely ever look the same when you get them this product was exactly as it was shown and it 's soo cute it 's padded so it will protect my laptop well and i love the fact that that handles can be hidden inside if i do n't want to use them great product !
it came quickly , it fir my computer and its cushy enough so it should n't hurt it if i drop it . not to mention it looks just like the picture so it 's gorgeous
i ordered this because i feel the need to <unk> every electronic device i own it 's very stylish and fun it 's pretty thin so do n't rely on it to save your laptop in a drop , and it could use a shoulder strap , but overall i think it 's pretty great
the style of this carry case caught my eye it 's something i would ` <unk> ' it seems well made , although i have n't put it thru the ringer i love the shoulder strap for & # # ; hands free & # # ; carrying when i have so much to take along it is a bit large for my # & # # ; macbook pro , but i can live with that my only con is that it is rather lightweight material my last case was much thicker which is better protection from bumps and such for the price , i would buy again tho
i was very pleased with the laptop sleeve bag the neoprene material is excellent protection for the laptop and has stylish detail on both sides of the bag the zips are durable & so is the strap this bag is light to carry , yet protective , stylish & friendly on the budget too excellent product by <unk> inc.
i love this case it is very pretty and is made of lightweight neoprene material the only things i would change is that you can not zip it completely closed with the handles out and maybe extra storage for your charger other than that it was still a good buy
this bag is the most <unk> thing of all , is the worst purchase in amazon , it is necessary to describe in the better way of the kind of light neoprene
purchased as a christmas gift product received was damaged and appeared used ; not new searched for a telephone number for product distributor & could only find an address , no telephone number to <unk> <unk> of product barely fits a # . # `` notebook
i thought it would at least have a inside pocket or something but it does n't it looks nice and goes with everything else i got but it is not very thick and pretty flimsy the strap to carry it with is nice but i think if i had to pick again i would have went with something a little more durable
i love the beautiful design on my case , and the cushioning is top-notch for protecting my computer however i deducted a star because it has a chemical odor , i put it through the wash and air dried it but the odor still <unk> -lrb- though it is lessened -rrb- i do n't know if machine washing is recommended -lrb- probably not -rrb- but doing it once worked fine for me , no damage to the design or durability
i ordered this because it had a matching skin and the two together is refreshing and the hidden handle are a treat . i have n't put the skin on yet but the laptop is in the sleeve
ordered it for my mom 's hp laptop very fast shipping the bag is very cute i like the design my mom is happy the material is good laptop fits perfect :
i have had this product for # years now and my main problem with it is the plastic components this has resulted in the plastic clips breaking and i can no longer use the product and have to buy a new one a beverage container would be a nice edition the product is available for about $ # , so the $ # . # asked here is # x the retail price at an apple store
plenty of compartments for laptop and accessories such as notebooks , mouse , cords , power chargers , pens , passport , etc . could fit a change of clothes and toiletries if needed laptop compartment is heavily padded and located in the middle of the backpack backpack is very sturdy , well built and has a coated cable grab handle
whether for everyday or travel this backpack has ample of storage for all of your needs ; chargers , devices , papers the best part is the padded laptop sleeve that 's built in - very protective and makes airport security checks a breeze
this is the second one of these i 've purchased i bought it as a replacement for when the original bag wears out i 've been using this bag now for three years and it has been great it has pockets sufficient for everything i need to take with me when traveling i love for getting through airport security
i 've had this backpack for about # years now and have used it every day while in college it has held up well to a fair amount of abuse the zippers are still fully functional and the straps are still intact -lrb- except for the plastic cover on the top strap that part has partially broken , but has not come off yet -rrb- having said that , do n't <unk> for this . $ # is way too much . $ # is n't bad considering how long it has lasted me
i have a # . # sony and it just did not fit the `` mouth `` i guess you could call it stayed wide open so i did n't feel it protected my laptop very well
i fit this sleeve into my # . # macbook pro and it still have about a finger allowance in it that isnt the main issue , the main issue is that the sleeve has this very strong rubber chemical smell i tried washing it and soaking it with detergent for a day and when it 's dry , the rubber smell still doesnt go off without the smell , this sleeve is worth the buy
i was looking for a neoprene <unk> cover for my laptop because i do n't need a ton of cushion as i carry it in my backpack unfortunately the stitching around the edge started coming undone almost immediately it probably happened so quickly because my laptop is slightly too big -lrb- it 's a # . # `` rather that # `` -rrb- but i did n't think that small amount would cause it to fit so snug it fits it well because the neoprene is slightly stretchy , but the corners of the sleeve are rounded and my computer 's corners are not so that is where the stitching started coming undone i am still using this sleeve and i expect it will last for another few months but i 'll probably have to buy a new one pretty quick , which is n't terrible considering they 're super cheap
for # bucks this was just fine , however the flap remains <unk> and does n't tight back as much as it was without the lappy inside . ideally should be around # bucks will fit # inch without fuss
it fit my laptop -lrb- a thinkpad x # -rrb- well , but it got stretched out and some places the padding wore away that does n't make that much difference because the padding never really offered much protection anyway
the cover is good for the price , cheap , durable and reversible my only complaint is that the red edging on the opening left a red stain on my laptop that will not come out :
