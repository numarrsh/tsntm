i was excited for this to arrive because i broke my other one only time will tell how exactly it holds up but i am giving it # stars because i was disappointed when it arrived it arrived with two small brown stains they 're small , but obvious i 'm not going to try and return it because its not a big enough downfall to deal with that hassle edit : today i also found a larger black stain on the back of the sleeve disappointed that the new sleeve came with three stains on it
i bought this laptop sleeve because i had recently bought a dell xps # with the extended battery it does fit snug with no room for the charger , but it is worth it i believe
perfect and fun for my large large lab top it does have a snugger fit the most , but i know my computer is well protected . extra pocket up front is too small for anything other a file
this is a very nice laptop envelope it fits my # . # laptop beautifully the velcro is very strong and takes <unk> to open my only complaint is that it was shipped in a huge box that was not needed i would like to have some more environmental <unk> from amazon
i bought this for my laptop the size was just right , although i was expecting it to be a bit larger the dimensions said # & # # ; wide , my laptop is # & # # ; wide and it 's a snug fit i do love the bright color and it protects my laptop , which is the main purpose for my purchase
i really like the design on this laptop sleeve it came exactly like it was shown in the picture my laptop is a # . # inch laptop and it fit perfectly i was a little worried before i got this because people were complaining about how the sleeve might be too small , but it fits great i doubt i could fit my charger in there though overall , i really like it
i bought this laptop sleeve for my new dell xps # z i was a bit concerned that it would n't fit in the sleeve but it actually works great the stretchy material makes it a perfect fit , and the pouch is great for my cords it 's very lightweight yet seems durable -- perfect for carrying your laptop in another bag for the price , it 's a great sleeve plus , the <unk> stripe is a great , fun color
my daughter loves this laptop cover it has a <unk> texture and really protects her computer when she takes it to school she also likes that it has a flap for more protection the colors are great all in all it was a great value
ordered this for my hp pavilion # . # & # # ; and it fits perfect ! i was worried it would be too small , but it is exactly the right size . it is not hard to get in and out and i feel like my laptop is very protected there is enough room in the flap for my charger , which i did n't expect . for the price , this is an awesome purchase the colors are so beautiful and it looks like quality material , not cheap at all i highly recommend this one if you are looking !
this laptop sleeve fits my new # . # inch acer laptop perfectly i compared prices , product reviews , and more on laptop sleeves before deciding on this one i must say that it meets all of the requirements i was looking for : snug fit , neoprene , brand new , pocket for cable , not too bulky , and cool design if you have been searching for a laptop sleeve , search no further this is a quality , name brand product
this <unk> laptop envelope is the best ! ! it is made extremely well , and it 's very sturdy without being cumbersome at all i love the front pocket for my wireless mouse and cables it fits my laptop perfectly , and ... it 's really attractive ;
i love this bag they were not accurate with the dimensions , so it has to go back the dimensions is with it not closing like an envelope i bought it to fit my toshiba thrive with the <unk> case the thrive fits in it with no cover very tightly i worry about how hard it is to get out so it is going back if you have a really small device this will work
i use this with my ipad # with the friendly <unk> flexible tpu covers , and the stylus inside the envelope the only thing i dont like is that it is very loud when you open the velcro
i put my mini laptop in this case i love it and you just ca n't beat the price the stitching is very sturdy and the overall quality of the bag is great i will buy more from built
got this for a killer price -- did n't really need one but wanted to add an inexpensive item to my cart to get free super saving shipping what surprises me is how much i love this little ipad travel bag and how much i really do need it and appreciate it definitely a bright , cheery color , nice inside -lrb- pale turquoise -rrb- , and well made i 've been using it a lot
i got this for a # `` galaxy tablet i do n't have a case on it yet , would be a tight fit if i did i left the insert foam that came with the envelope inside and slide the tablet behind it with the screen facing the foam for extra cushion till my case arrives , it 's on back order , this will protect the tablet fine for travel at least
got a tablet or netbook that needs some cushy protection this is just the ticket built ny products are made of the same material as scuba suits and they are tough and well built
i purchased this envelope # weeks ago for my new asus eee pad transformer tf # -a # , first i was worrying about the # . # inch difference , but the neoprene material does fit like glove i am currently enjoying it
i bought the standard ipad cover at the apple store and it works fine , but not as much protection as i wanted to pack into my briefcase i wanted something in addition , not to replace most of the ipad covers are sized to be the solo cover this built neoprene for a netbook works perfectly ! just the right size , just the right protection i was looking for i own several built products and have never been disappointed
i purchased this for my netbook i wanted something i could store it in to protect it wow , was i impressed this is a great protector for my netbook my netbook fits in perfectly i was very impressed to with the shipping and handling i would definitely recommend this seller
i bought this for my wife when i bought her the toshiba netbook she loved the case until it started literally coming apart at the seams she is very easy on anything she uses so it was not because of heavy usage or not being careful i guess you really get what you pay for do not buy this product if you want it to last more that a few months
yes it 's a sleeve yes the toshiba net book will fit in it but what else does it do it wo n't save you if you drop the unit no room for the ac adapter . -lrb- yes i forgot about that when i ordered -rrb- just seems like a waste of $ #
i 'm quite satisfied with this soft sleeve for my toshiba netbook i wanted an inexpensive product that would provide a minimum <unk> of protection when i travel with it although the sleeve would not really do much good if i dropped my netbook or my luggage was crushed , the sleeve does protect it from minor bumps and helps to keep the computer dust - and scratch-free it looks good and it fits like a glove
in terms of simplicity , quality , and value , this product is the perfect <unk> it 's a nice neoprene sleeve that fits my # . # inch toshiba laptop snugly , and has stood the test of time -lrb- purchased it over a year ago , and no signs of wearing down yet !
fits the toshiba mini netbook like a glove , with enough stretch to accomodate a mouse . i wish it had a little loop on the outside to <unk> the charging cord , and might add one , myself
i like this backpack it is nice looking , spacious and strong my only concern is that when you have vaio written on the outside , some <unk> people might realize the backpack carries a sony laptop
i bought this backpack to fit my e series vaio it fits it perfectly and provides excellent padding for my laptop the downside to all this padding , however , is that it does n't leave much space for other items and is quite bulky for every day use this is a big con for me because , as a college student , i need a lot of space for my textbooks overall , it was an okay buy it looks awesome and is great for laptops but it 's not practical for many other uses
i bought it carry things to and from work and on work travel it is very well built but the side clips make it inconvenient to access the front accessory area -lrb- pens , cards , etc . . . -rrb-
i purchased this backpack , based on reviewers who also looked at other laptop maker brands who offer backpacks this one is definitely well constructed , with plenty of handy , ergonomic pockets i can easily carry a # `` work laptop , with charger , and other items in the backpack after taking it on a few trips , i have n't noticed any signs of wear or falling apart - no frayed straps , stuck zippers , etc . the laptop compartment , in the back , is fairly accessible , and easy to pull out the laptop at the airport for security screening since using this , i 've put away my shoulder bag , which i previously used to lug around my laptop overall , very pleased with the purchase would be nice if it were a bit cheaper , but even at this price , it 's worth it
my son just ordered a new laptop he needed a backpack to tote it around he has <unk> me numerous times for this as it of quality material and extremely practical for him
i use this baby for work i love the backpack ! but i just got a new sony viao with windows # and its the worst mistake you can make . but the backpack is absolutely amazing ! !
i travel a lot and was looking for something that i could use to replace my carry-on suitcase and laptop bag for the short trips where i only needed one or two changes of clothes this past week i got to put it to the test on a <unk> trip to the west coast i loaded up my laptop and clean clothes the bag easily accommodated everything without feeling over stuffed it made it through the trip however , <unk> through i noticed that one of the shoulder straps had started pulling away at the top not a good sign i will be taking it back this week
i bought this backpack to carry my books and laptop to and from class , work , or wherever else i may be studying however , the straps on the bag started ripping after having used it for about a month considering the quality of the bag it is not worth the price that is listed
when starting my first year of college , i was looking for a comfortable , long-lasting backpack that could hold my school supplies , laptop as well as my many other accessories although i have used this backpack daily for # months now , i still fail to see any signs of wear and tear i am very satisfied with this purchase and would definately recommend it to anyone looking for a reliable backpack i found this backpack to be very durable and it has no problem with holding any of my heavy textbooks it also comes with thick padding that makes it very comfortable to carry around and a padded pocket that does a good job of protecting my laptop
have had it for some months , and nary a sign of wear holds everything , zippers are fantastic , straps are secure it 's not incredibly stylish or <unk> , but if you want a backpack that will hold all your stuff without complaining , this is a great choice
i did my research and spent time reviewing cases for my new laptop this one was even better than i thought very well made , lots of pockets and plenty of space for everything ... with a very reasonable price you wo n't be sorry if you buy this one
probably the wort money i ever spent on amazon products of this nature <unk> the integrity that amazon is known for i definitely will not encourage anyone to purchase this product from this dealer again ... this bag failed on the very first use the handle came out and to make matters wort it can not be fixed
i bought this bag for business travel at first it appear perfect but soon one <unk> issue after the other <unk> the zipper suddenly <unk> , the telescope handle wobbles and becomes loose , the side pockets falls off , it goes on and on had my bag replaced under warranty now the second one is coming apart
the only thing holding me back from giving # stars is that the inside plastic liner near the top opening is really <unk> plastic that is rather <unk> this can cut you and seems like the first thing to <unk> in this briefcase a more rigid plastic or leather material would <unk> this a # -star product the exterior <unk> is excellent no other complaints the seller is really good ... quick shipping would recommend both the seller and item to all
i bought this bag as a replacement for a <unk> rolling case that i have had for years it meets every expectation for a quality case although i had some minor issues setting the lock -lrb- make sure you following the directions carefully -rrb- , the bag has been a perfect replacement
got this for hubby for christmas he loves it very spacious and sturdy holds up to constant moving to office and in and out of car does n't show scratches from bumps and hits overall i 'd have to give it an excellent rating
photo does not do this justice it is beautiful roomy ... sturdy , nothing bad to say about this case also , for the record ... the color of the zipper is not as `` purplish pink `` as it shows in the photo online
while i am very happy with this laptop case 's asthetics , i wish it opened wider so that the space inside could be fully utilized i also wish that the handle opening was separate from an opening into the main case a few times when it rained my papers got wet because there is no way to close the opening and use the handle at the same time
however . due to handle opening not being separate from the inside it does leave some items placed inside the bag exposed i kept it anyway , but have to be aware of what items are placed next to the handle pocket wished the zipper opened just a little more also
the laptop case has worked so far and i 've received many complements on the ` smart ' look of the bag i really like the bag i do n't get much use out of the front pockets and the bag is heavy to lift when it is full to capacity -lrb- my computer is a few years old and heavy -rrb- even in this digital world i have to carry a stack of papers around which works in this bag as long as i do n't try to stuff a pile of papers over # & # # ; thick since i 've only had it for two months , i can not properly comment on how <unk> the pull is but it has worked so far -lrb- only time will tell this side of the story -rrb- overall , i have been satisified with this purchase
i just received my bag and i am so disappointed my slightly over # . # `` computer does not fit in the bag i am really disappointed as i have been waiting to receive this bag i am hoping i can find another one that does fit . the workmanship seems to be good
it does not fit up to a # . # laptop i was able to make it work anyways , but my laptop did not go in the laptop compartment we were out of town when it was delivered and i was not able to return it due to the length of time it is a beautiful laptop bag though and except for the laptop size and <unk> some of the dividers ... worth the money
overall i love the bag it is built well the only thing i would change is the inner lining is attached by velcro to the bag wall and it comes undone unless your pretty careful not a big deal i would be sure to buy from this maker again they need to sell a wider variety of colors
this bad is very sturdy and it meets all of my needs i use it for my work folders as well as my work laptop and there is still plenty of space i would defintely recommend this bag
i would have preferred a more deeper purple as it seemed on tv , but i 'm happy with it it is huge , which is what i wanted however , i am worried about its durability and how it will play out rolling it so close to the ground it is leather after all i will update when i travel hopefully that will be sooner than later . :
the color is a bit bright , it is not a dull brick red color i is very sturdy , well made , good quality although i can fit my macbook inside one of the padded sleeves inside , it was smaller than i imagined it has several very useful compartments inside for pens , cell phone , etc . it really is very practical the stow outside pockets are very slim , no bulky items can fit . overall a good investment
i really liked this as it is sturdy and can hold quite a bit it has several pockets for your things the wheels seem to be sturdy as well , and the handle is long enough i like this , would like some other colors to have
i need to bring books to weekly meetings and have <unk> <unk> this is perfect for that purpose only slight issue is the fact that the handle comes through a zipper so we 'll see how i handle that in the winter months
if all you need is a bag that you put in a # inch laptop , this is the one it is cheap , <unk> design , does what it 's supposed to do update on # : the zip on front compartment is broken i can no longer recommend it
i like case logic products , this case is good and with reasonable price , however its small and using it is not very comfortable im using it to a # inch toshiba laptop but still not easy to take the computer out of it , i wish it was a little
product arrived very quickly , it was the perfect size for my dell d # laptop was a great fit and was made from good material i am thinking of getting another for my wife 's d # the only con i found was it could use another pocket , but still a great buy
this offering from case logic is n't the best or most stylish # inch laptop case but it serves it 's purpose this is a very compact case meant to carry just the computer , a couple of pens and a power cord bare bones for light travel it 's well made my only grip is that it 's a little too small i 'm not looking for notebook pockets or places for files however , if you have a toshiba or dell laptop like i do with a `` brick `` power cable then it wo n't fit in this case that 's a bit of a problem for me this is really a case for the <unk> laptop crowd
i use this case for a macbook pro # -inch , late # model , and it fits very nice , with room to spare at the top the pocket in front is perfect for chargers or other cables nice quality product , no complaints
like everyone says , i purchased this in hopes of having a bag for my laptop i keep my chromebook -lrb- slides around an inch , however it 's about an # `` computer -rrb- in the big pocket and my ipad in the front the back pocket is just a pocket the front pouch has another pocket , and another , two pen holders , and a <unk> . -lrb- please mind my usage of pocket -rrb- it 's really convenient like a bag should be . . it carries stuff also , the long strap is permanent , and <unk> that 's it
i got this for my # year old daughter to hold her hp netbook that her school provides it is the perfect size and she really likes it it has enough stretch in the zipper pocket to hold her earbuds , flash drive , and power cord only thing i wish it had was a handle on it
i bought this item to give my ipad some added protection while traveling my ipad -lrb- in it 's apple protective case -rrb- fits perfectly in this the back pocket is an added bonus as it holds my stand , cord and earbuds all in one place i had several people compliment it at the airport and ask where i got it the only reason i did n't rate this item a # star is the velcro is very loud and not my top choice for keeping it closed but otherwise this is a great product
my kids bought me a portable speaker for my ipod for christmas i wanted to be able to carry it with me , but did n't want a bulky carry case and i could n't find one i liked i bought this case thinking that it might work and if it did n't , i 'd use it for something else at the price i paid , i could n't go wrong i love it ! ! it is just the perfect size to carry my speakers and it holds all of the accessories -lrb- ac adaptor , old mp # player , headphones and other stuff -rrb- that i wanted to carry around i 'm fairly certain that a small tablet or ereader would fit in this
i just got this case for my hp pavillion <unk> # . # `` laptop and it fits it like a glove the color is really gorgeous in person and the little zippered pocket on the back holds a good amount i have my computer cord , ear buds , laptop mouse , and headphone splitter in there right now for the price , this cover can not be beat functional and stylish
i will be direct i am reviewing this from my wallet 's point of view the product itself is decent quality , and is versatile as described on the product page it would be worth buying at fifteen or less however , one can find very similar products by case logic at half the price or less , at the time i am posting this review i like neoprene , and i like the brand , but i can not recommend an overpriced product if this came with a strap or handle , or extra pockets , i would recommend it but it 's a plain zippered case with a zippered storage pocket , and i would not pay nearly thirty dollars for it
but a fantastic bargain at $ # . similar sleeves sell for $ # in office depot the pocket is large enough to hold the charger and a microfiber cleaning cloth it is maybe an inch or # tall but it 's not a problem for me i have the detachable keyboard , which fits easily into the sleeve i bought the sleeve to protect the screen of my asus when traveling or from cat claw marks at home and it works perfectly for both , and the price is excellent i am not seeing any seam or zipper fails definitely a recommend
i like this product and it seems to be great unfortunately it did not work very well for ms surface pro as it is way too deep for the item if you consider this product for ms surface pro keep in mind that you will have a couple of inches extra space on top of it
the cover performs as advertised it is lightweight , and too roomy if anything it is a quick protector for normal carrying on short trips the only drawback to me is the very feminine color i guess that it 's <unk> , and at less than $ # , i 'm complaining .
i liked this neoprene sleeve so much that i purchased a second one as part of the add on program it was a great price on a good case my daughters use both of the sleeves it has a very convenient pocket to hold cords or cables
i got this case for my asus transformer tablet and keyboard dock -- its pretty much like a mini laptop . it fits perfectly and the outside pocket is perfect for the charger and stylus i am quite pleased with the purchase , and have n't had any issues with the case thus far
perfect for my notebook asus and love small pocket fit for charger the sleeve is loosely fit the notebook so it is not too tie when fit the charger in
i bought several pouches together to test them out and this was my favorite it is a nice color , but i love the thought that went into the design it is a nice thick neoprene with an outside pouch upon opening the outside pouch you see a really neat smaller pouch for your usb lines to keep your cord separate from the plug really nicely done the inside of the pouch itself is done in grey neoprene all of this for $ # and free shipping through prime
this case is perfect for your tablet it 's roomy enough for the bigger ones yet also accommodates the smaller ones there is a zippered outside pocket for your cords so they do n't scratch the tablet it is a great case and i would recommend it to anyone considering purchasing one
this is a very nice protective case to carry around your # inch tablet or netbook it has a seperate sleve for usb thumb drive and cords as well as the main pouch for your tablet or netbook i still would n't want to drop it but i know my device will stand a much better change of <unk> a fall as well as the fact it helps protect your tablet screen from scratches
purchased this to house my # & # # ; tablet it works perfectly the <unk> material is stretchy and forgiving , yet very durable i keep my charger in the outside pocket , and it is n't bulky at all , but fits quite nicely i actually have my tablet in an <unk> case , which i then slide inside this case for extra protection when traveling it fit perfectly and i know it 's well protected plus , the color is great , and the price is exceptional bottom line : i would definitely recommend this case to anyone , for use with a netbook or a larger size tablet -lrb- not the # & # # ; ones -rrb- it 's durable , has very forgiving protective material , and the price is right go for it
gave up on finding a protective zipper case that would enclose my <unk> with its belkin cover this , though several inches too large , is padded enough for my kind of hauling around and the outside zip pocket is a great feature the material is stretchy enough to take the <unk> charger , usb cable , and more i also like the warranty
case logic <unk> # -inch neoprene netbook sleeve -lrb- blue this case logic neoprine sleeve is just the thing if you want something to protect your netbook while you carry it in a soft attache , backpack or whatever it also works well just to protect your netbook from dust , fingerprints etc . while keeping it on your desk , in a drawer or on a shelf this sleeve also has a zippered pouch to fit your ac adapter -lrb- it would be a very tight squeeze for some adapters -rrb- , or another accessory i would n't use this alone to carry my netbook , but i frequently carry a medium sized soft attache , and this slips into one of the pockets and works fine using it in this manner also allows me to just put my ac adapter in another pocket of the attache my netbook is a gateway lt # u -lrb- # . # `` -rrb- and it fits perfectly -lrb- even with the larger # cell battery -rrb- when i use a netbook attache to carry around my netbook , this little sleeve is perfect for protecting accessories such as an external dvd burner & an external hard drive etc . i find it has many practical uses , and for the price i paid on amazon -lrb- under $ # -rrb- how can you beat that i find that case logic makes excellent products , and this is yet another example
i got this for my daughter to keep her boogie board in it 's a little bigger than the <unk> board , but it 's perfect it <unk> he writing tablet the price was perfect , too
it size is perfect for a netbook or ipad the bag that has at the front help you to place all the cables , it 's color is wonderful and excellent material
i know this says it is a netbook sleeve , but i have been using it as a case for my # inch tablets they fit perfectly inside and the charger fits perfectly inside the small pocket i am going to buy more since i have multiple tablets
this is n't a bad bag , but it has one very annoying flaw the way the `` handle `` on the top of the bag is designed is <unk> the shoulder straps come together before they reach the bag in order to form the handle this makes the bag sit away from your back at the top making it very uncomfortable the load does not sit firmly on your back and the handle on the top rubs on your neck this may not be an issue for those with a smaller frame but for me this made the bag unusable and i had to return it
you ca n't beat this backpack with this price wife has an expensive northface backpack that is n't as nice as this one this thing holds everything that i need and there 's still room for more my only gripe is the handle and how it connects at the top of the straps not a deal breaker , but it 's annoying
this has been a fantastic bag so far in the first few months of use can take rough handling unfortunately , the cover of one of the chains came off on a sudden pull ... so that should have been made more robust
i bought this backpack like over a year ago and it 's still in great condition i use it everyday as i am a student love it so much best backpack i 've ever had ... <unk> my current one ever does break i 'll probably just purchase this same one again because i love it so much
super nice backpack lots of storage and pockets pockets on the side are large enough for a gatorade bottle seems to be very sturdy and should stand up to any demand very happy with purchase
i love everything about this backpack it has the perfect amount of pockets , the color is great , and the straps are very comfortable -lrb- but not too bulky -rrb- despite the backpack appearing compact enough for a petite frame , i have been able to jam a lot more stuff in it than it looks i really love the top handle because it makes it easy to grab and go quickly this is my first high sierra product and i will definitely try more of their stuff
i bought this for my adult son who uses it all the time the size is large and the fabric not too stiff like some are , yet it is sturdy enough fabric to be protective he likes the comfort of the straps it looks very handsome and is slightly different from a lot of backpacks in design so it does n't get mixed up when there are a lot of them update : now it is march # the backpack gets a lot of use my son travels in his <unk> and always travels with this backpack -- much of it air travel the backpack has held up and is still attractive this was an excellent buy
i saw some comments about old version without integrated <unk> supporting <unk> luggage what i got is new <unk> , that is great it is big enough for me to travel within # days , no roller case needed
nothing more to say i bought this backpack after i had <unk> surgery needed something to carry all my items in and out of the office and to meetings great quality , adequate space , overall this is great
this item has held up extremely well so far locks and hinges are still tight with little give it is prone to the occasional dent and ding from every day use stuff a laptop in here and this sucker can get a little heavy , but it is manageable with the shoulder strap and handle it took about # month for the ` new briefcase smell ' to go away
has travelled with me to hong kong and back twice and held up very well only complaint is with the quality of the shoulder strap which can get twisted pretty badly within the shoulder pad thingy finish can be a bit fragile , but this is for protecting what 's inside , right
this is a well-crafted and very attractive case , plus it is a really excellent value only way it could be better was if the file folders were easily removable for more flexibility
my husband wanted a & # # ; cool & # # ; briefcase for work and this is & # # ; it & # # ; for him he is hard on things , very hard on things -lrb- he once backed over his laptop with the car -rrb- and he 's been using this case for about # months and it still looks new he dropped it with his laptop and ipad inside and nothing was damaged , not even the case the draw back is that it 's heavy when loaded but you kinda have to expect that with a metal briefcase it has an organizer inside and a large file pocket and also comes with a strap -lrb- but he does n't use the strap -rrb- i would def buy this for him again , he loves it it 's a great value for the money
this one is tough and good hope they make a bigger size the brief case is relatively small in height and does n't fit a lot of papers in it it would be nice if they make <unk> and water proof ones
like all aluminum briefcases , this will scratch you bump it , you scratch it but it looks nice and is well padded and it works great as a <unk> <unk> for my electronics
this case is really <unk> for the money this finish is very nice the locks are high quality the case is very sturdy fits my laptop well -lrb- though # more inch in width would be nice -rrb- i really love the laptop strap on the inside and shoulder strap on the outside it 's a bit heavier than a typical laptop bag , but the extra folder features and security are worth it especially if you are a frequently flier and want to add a measure of security around your laptop and data
it 's always a role of the dice when you find a & # # ; deal & # # ; whether you 're getting something decent or just a cheaply manufactured piece of junk this case was great - very attractive dark brushed aluminum exterior , with a sturdy and attractive inside that 's suited to hold a laptop , accessories , paperwork , and a few pens though it 's plenty sturdy for normal <unk> use , i would not trust this case if you planned to throw it off of buildings etc . for that type of abuse you 'd be better suited with a pelican case with the looks and sturdiness of a # hundred dollar briefcase at such a low price point this one 's a winner
i sometimes need a brief case instead of a backpack to carry my # & # # ; laptop i 've tried leather , <unk> , and impact plastic this case fit the bill perfectly for me it looks sleek and modern without being flashy it has room for files and supplies without being too big i 'm not embarrassed walking into a wall street board meeting with the case as the case is finished with a dark iron finish that is more attractive than the pictures show the case arrive quickly and the price was well below my budget
i love this case is a bit smaller than expected but not too small others complaining about it being purple are color <unk> it does have a <unk> on color but i would call it <unk> it certainly is not the color pictured but it is classy never the less
i was lucky to buy this from a seller for only $ # it looks sleek and professional , it appears to be well made and sturdy and does n't weigh very much i 'm guessing that the locks are susceptible to a determined thief breaking them open with a hammer and <unk> or something equally <unk> , but they are certainly strong enough to keep out the casual or <unk> thief the briefcase easily holds my # `` wide laptop , spare battery , mouse , and charger brick with room for documents and a little more the locks pop up reliably and the hinges seem strong and well-made overall an excellent <unk> briefcase , i 'm happy with my purchase the only thing that would make this better would be a built-in , retractable security cable that would help make sure the briefcase does n't <unk> off if i leave the room otherwise , it 's a great product
i like the look and durability i ca n't get my laptop or other things into and out of the bag with one hand because the bag folds in or closes on itself
