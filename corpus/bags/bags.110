personally i love the bag and have nothing bad to say about it the book bag has enough more for my laptop , its charging cord , college book , two notebooks , and a binder one thin that does bug me , i ca n't fit my ipad in the front pouch
the bag i received had no <unk> to this picture it was cheap leather , with <unk> and <unk> the leather was stiff and had a strange color do n't waste your time the vendor asked for a , picture of the bag i ordered because & # # ; we make a new one after order & # # ; what does that mean they did not even know what bag they had sent be warned about the merchandise and the vendor
the bag was used , had scratches and punctures all over , had white stains in the green interior lining , and had a foul smell i returned the bag , but eventually had to file a <unk> guarantee claim in order to actually receive a refund -lrb- true grit was <unk> -rrb-
much lighter than in the image , and particularly the <unk> which seems to be different leather than the rest of the bag note that this is a small bag my macbook air fits , but only just
this is a very beautiful bag but do n't be fooled by the pictures this bag is more the size of a <unk> purse although the size will not work for my high school daughter that was looking forward to using it , i will keep it for myself to use for a purse it was delivered in a very timely fashion , actually four weeks before it says it was due to be delivered do not hesitate to purchase this but be warned that it is much smaller inside and out than it appears in pictures
arrived promptly as described not made to very high standards - rivets and stitching are crooked there is still glue left on the surface in many places , and there is a noticeable smell i imagined it would have been a strong & # # ; leather & # # ; smell , after reading the prior reviews , but i believe it must be a glue the leather is <unk> thin , as well the biggest disappointment for me was the size , however it is exactly as described so no fault to the <unk> i will most likely use it sparingly as the reviews indicate the customer service is very slow to respond if they do at all otherwise i would pay the shipping to return it it 's not bad for the price , though
# stars because when i emailed the company about the extremely long ship date range , they arranged to get me the bag quickly the bag is described as a laptop bag , but it is too small for my laptop - which makes the bag pretty useless since carrying my laptop was the goal
this bag was an ideal gift for my husband it holds his magazines , bible and tablet comfortably the only downside is the smell it 's been # weeks and i just told him to give it time to wear off -lrb- i hope i 'm right -rrb- the <unk> look and the quality of the bag suits the # stars i would purchase this item again if need be the delivery time was n't too long i got it in a couple weeks which was perfect
i am a college student and for the loads i take at a time at school i am able to fit my mac air and # college text books great bag , great leather
bag is of great quality , my husband loves it my only complaint was that the package was not <unk> none the less , it came quickly and was just what we were looking for
i rated it as a # , because that was the upper limit a rating of # would be more appropriate the workmanship is excellent , and the quick handling & shipping got it to me weeks ahead of time i would happily purchase from this supplier again , and will recommend their products to others
received in about a week after ordering bag does have a distinct smell to it , but nothing that <unk> ca n't handle bag too small for laptop , but perfect size for tablet i love this bag
ordered this in march of # and received it in less than # weeks ! love the quality and craftsmanship my husband is uses it everyday great gift for any man who needs to carry files and a laptop ! thank you ! !
this is not a hardshell case , it 's a thin plastic cover like the cheap cellphone cases the top fits , but the bottom will not snap on the snaps are really tiny and do not seem to support much if you have a black laptop , the color will not show up at all either
the case was hard to get on , yet barely stays on the computer - weird i would not recommend it to anyone the little retractable feet on the bottom are so not sturdy , i would n't use them because i feel like the weight of the computer would break them while it is a nice color , do n't bother not to mention , the edges of the case are sharp they irritate my skin and almost cut it
the top fits perfect but the bottom serves as a tray for your laptop to sit in instead of a cover as advertised it will not snap on also ... the brilliant aqua blue -lrb- turquoise -rrb- color you see on the website is not that color when you put it on a black laptop the cover is very thin and the color turns to a <unk> dark <unk> if it does fall -lrb- i bet -rrb- it will crack the price is way to much for what you get and the false advertising is <unk> i would not recommend this item to anyone that has a dell inspiron #
this is a real disappointment it fits the top of the computer just fine - but the bottom does n't clip on properly when i lift the laptop the bottom part of this case falls off also , and this is my error in not reading the information thoroughly i guess , but i was expecting this to be a soft , gel case like on my cell phone i will be going for a return on this item
i have a dell inspiron # r but it did n't fit i liked it the color was just as pictured it was n't a hard case but a thin material i wanted it so i can put stickers on my computer and not ruin my computer i wish it fit though i would have kept it and not returned it
covers my laptop , i like the lifts for when i am using it on my desk pops on and off the corners frequently when moved around but i guess for the price , it was a good buy will protect from all scratches .
it is a little too big for my computer even though it is the correct model however , it is an okay purchase for those who want to protect your computer
i love the top half of this case , it 's fantastic and fits perfectly however the bottom piece is too large i saw others complaining of this but ignored them thinking they just were n't snapping it on properly , but they were correct in saying it does not fit there is nothing on the bottom piece that clips on , it has pieces intended for that but since it is too large they are useless i would n't reccomend this unless you 're ok with spending # for just a top case
this fits my new dell laptop well its not listed on the list that it fits though if you can put on a cell phone case you can snap this on with no problem
i was a little nervous to buy this at first because of previous bad ratings , but could n't find anything better for a my specific laptop i however love it the color is nice and as shown in the picture both the top and bottom parts fit my laptop perfectly i had no problems with it and would recommend
i bought this because i was <unk> by previous reviews , but i would not recommend this backpack to any college student within a month the straps ripped and is completely ruined it is a nice look and i have received many compliments on it , but it is just not a practical buy check out jansport ! it is worth investing in a good quality backpack :
although this looked good in pictures , once you took a closer look the materials are very cheap definately not as nice as a herschel -lrb- although they also need to work on durability -rrb-
the new backpack smell gave me a huge <unk> and i tried <unk> it so the smell would go away faster it eventually faded away i did not even use my backpack for a full week and one of the straps already started to rip i carried my laptop inside my backpack once , and i do n't think the backpack was able to fully support the intended weight in addition , it 's slightly hard to open and close the middle zipper because the fabric area that covers it always gets stuck
it 's a nice <unk> backpack but it 's falling apart after two weeks of use the stitching on one of the straps is coming loose and i have to fight with the zipper to get <unk> closed
i am giving it # stars because it is a nice bag that is well put together the leather features are nice , and the bag seems durable the zippers are a little stiff , but i think just because its new its got a nice laptop pocket on the inside , the straps are the weakest part of the bag and they feel and look small if you are a tall person this bag is not for you overall i am happy with it
this is a nice backpack but once it arrives it feels super stiff this could be due to its <unk> but i hope it <unk> in soon its stiffness makes it feels as if its made of plastic i think once i use it a few times it will be ok it looks nice
i really do like the bag its cute and there is quite a bit of room when i first got the bag it was stiff and kind of hard to zip , however , as i used it more it loosened up and i loved it i still love the bag , but the straps started coming off a little and it makes me really sad if you do get this bag i would suggest not putting too much stuff in it and if you do do n't use it all the time
i love it , it fits me perfectly and the color is just right everyone was right about the zippers though , they 're a little hard to zip and unzip but i feel like that 'll change with more use overall , a great backpack
i love this bag it was a good price and very study the computer compartment actually fits my # & # # ; macbook pro and all my other school supplies the zippers are a little stiff at first but after using it a couple of times , they loosened right up
i do like this cover because its sturdy , its protective , the tablet fits great in it i also like the way it stands & the closure is tight & holds up well on the stand ... but the only reason it got # stars for me is because there is no opening for the charger because of that , you ca n't leave it charged & put it in the standing ways ... which i hate i like to keep my tablet charged when i 'm at home to charge it up , you even have to turn the cover back , letting dust settle on the screen that 's the only fault i have with it
purchased the belkin product to protect my galaxy tab # its an ok cover but a little cheap looking i would have preferred a higher quality product i ca n't really complain however my tablet fits securely and the strap keeps the cover closed when not in use the cover feels cheap but seems reasonably durable
i needed a case for a dell tablet , and did n't find any that suited me , which is why i got this one designed for the samsung galaxy while the galaxy is # & # # ; and the dell is # . # & # # ; , the case is suited for the dell the stand is <unk> and the case folds two different ways , giving the user a choice of four tablet positions there is an elastic strap that keeps the case closed no bells and whistles , just a workable case in a nice color -lrb- red with a grey stripe -rrb- since i use a stylus with the tablet , the stand is very convenient and slips into my bag when not in use construction seems durable and the cover is vinyl for easy clean up i do n't know if it 's necessary since i have n't had any problems , but the one addition i would make to this case is a more secure closure , preferably a snapped strap
this case fits my tablet perfectly , very compact and snug the frame can be adjusted to provide a great stand for the tablet there is even a strap to keep the flap closed the only drawback is that the case is a bit bulky , but that 's the tradeoff for something sturdy
this is a fine case for the galaxy tab # it looks good the leather feels nice i like the stripe that breaks up the solid color on the front it is easy to put the device in multiple angles for viewing in landscape however , this case lacks one major feature - a magnet it does not have a magnetic closure , so it can flop open that also means that it does not turn the device on automatically when you open the cover this seems like an obvious feature to include and i have seen moko incorporate it into their slim case i do n't know why belkin chose not to do this , but it seems like a glaring <unk> to me
this is a very nice and sturdy cover for my tablet i have since seen one other i might consider that frames the tablet this cover holds my tablet in place easily and l like the fact that when i close the cover my tablet goes to sleep
it 's a nice little cover for a tablet , especially when traveling i mainly like it because it 's more than just a cover you can use it as a stand , which can be good for typing or you just want to view your tablet in that angle , like when you 're laying on the couch sometimes when i use my tablet , i 'm laying down sideways on the couch with the tablet laying upward when i do that i sometime wish the tablet was laying at an angle well , this cover does that perfectly for a tablet so they were very smart to add a stand , because it makes the cover more useful
its a must to have a tilted stand for these tablets because viewing at <unk> increases the quality of the display , not to mention avoiding having to <unk> down which may be uncomfortable also <unk> from <unk> lighting can <unk> the tilt angle is adjustable , and the material is made of <unk> ` <unk> ` material , which makes it lightweight and durable the corners are designed to prevent slipping if its not on a flat surface it comes with a strap to prevent accidental openings and appears to <unk> to protect the tablet from a substantial impact i would recommend this
i purchased this sleeve because it looked so unique and adorable in the pictures i regretted it immediately when i opened the package it smelled like <unk> <unk> , and the smell soon filled my entire room it was not worth the hassle to return it to china and i just threw it away
i got the # & # # ; sleeve for my # & # # ; laptop i have a dell , and they said this is made for <unk> and macs , so i assumed it would fit , but it is most definitely made for mac computers the corners of the case are rounded so my dell -lrb- which has corners -rrb- does n't quite fit in the case - i ca n't zipper it at all if it were n't for this , i would really like the case the design is beautiful and i like the material on the inside , but unfortunately the functionality is most important
i love the cute patterns of the sleeve but it is obviously not of good quality the zippers get stuck more than often and the fabric is probably too thin to lend any effective protection for my macbook
i measured my computer before i went browsing online for a sleeve for it and this case should have fit funny enough though , when it arrived i went from <unk> to disappointment as my computer refused to fit inside the much to small sleeve i do n't know what # inches is where this was produced , but it was not the same # inches as my computer is the worst part it 's super cute and now has no function in my home other than looking nice in a pile
i really liked this - but it was just too tight , took forever to get on and off & # # ; i just got it , was very disappointed and returned it too small for my macbook air # & # # ; i do n't want to say & # # ; i hate it & # # ; - but i certainly do n't like it !
loved the design of the case but the case is clearly too big for a # inch laptop i was a bit hesitant to purchase this case to begin with after having read the reviews -lrb- complaints about the smell and size -rrb- , i should have went with my gut <unk> this case does have an odd smell -lrb- not too bothersome to a point where i ca n't have it near me -rrb- but the case is just too large for my # inch laptop there is about # inches extra length wise and an extra inch height wise which i am not a fan of since i 'd like to have a laptop case that fits more snug this is just too loose for my taste and annoying to have especially when i 'm carrying this my tote bag
i liked the style very much and it fits my macbook perfectly i ordered the sleeve for my macbook but hardly use only because i prefer the hard cover still a good cute sleeve
it was the perfect size for my mac the smell was overwhelming initially but that was not a big deal i would have liked to have a handle and that would have increased my rating to # stars
i like this a lot beautiful , very well built , nicely padded , great fit for a macbook my only gripe , as others have mentioned , is the smell taking this out of the wrapper practically knocked me over it has a nasty chemical smell but , after airing it out for a couple days the odor dissipated and it 's fine now still i have to ding it a star for that
i was looking for an economical sleeve for my asus laptop which measures # & # # ; x # & # # ; it fits with a couple inches of extra room but not enough for the small charging cord to lay flat next to it the cord will fit , but has to sit on top the soft inside will protect from minor scratches colors are a little <unk> in the picture but that could just be because a different run in fabric was used overall , i am happy with this product and would recommend it if you are looking for a stylish , affordable sleeve for your small laptop or tablet
i bought this sleeve for my # & # # ; macbook air the design is exactly like the one in the picture it does have a weird smell to it but but it should go away after airing it out when i put my laptop in there is some space in it could be a bad thing or a good thing you can fit other things in with it , the laptop alone in it has room to move around a lot i 'm not sure if that is a good thing i will be purchasing a case to put on my laptop and hopefully it fills up the empty space
love the print and the inside is super soft as to prevent scratching , its exactly what i needed the average cases that were offered in store were so boring this one is the most unique i 've found it could have a little more padding and a pocket of some sort but otherwise its perfect
i love this case the inside is just what i wanted the only downside , it did not fit my macbook snugly it is a little roomy but i 'm happy with it
this is so pretty and my daughter loves it it fits well and will really help protect the computer not so sure it is water proof but will be a good overall cover
love this case , it 's not your old boring black one and is n't super cheesy either the only complaint i have it that both the leather straps on the zippers came off pretty quickly but i 'm traveling with it , so might be a bit more rough than most
for the price , i ca n't imagine a better product i bought it for my # -year-old sister , who loves it it fits perfectly for her macbook pro the coloring is great and it 's well padded for protection
the choice of designs are beautiful and interesting the inside of the sleeve has a soft inside to prevent scratching i am impressed and i love the <unk> # sleeve
it is exactly what i wanted and the case looks exactly like the picture it had a very odd smell at first , but after letting it air out for a day the smell went away also it fits my macbook perfectly with a lot of protection
i was so excited when i opened it because the cover is beautiful i got compliments from my roommate as i was opening the package and more compliments the next day the colors are just as deep and colorful as in the pictures and the material inside is soft and <unk> does it 's job and fits my macbook white body perfectly
i love my new case i was worried it would n't fit or the colors would be totally off but nope i love it ! and the shipping was just on time with the
i have the new thinner # `` macbook pro , and i was worried it would n't fit as well , but it works great and looks exactly like the picture it leaves a little room for that . # `` or for the thicker version , but it does n't shift around enough to be worrisome some of the reviews said it smelled , and really it only does if you stick your face in it and take a <unk> , and its only new car smell , it 'll go away great purchase for such a low price , i highly recommend it
this case is amazing ! its all soft inside , the zippers work well , and the print is great i got so many compliments . the only thing is that it took a while to arrive , but even so , its worth it
love this sleeve it fits my macbook perfectly and actually looks better than the picture so was more than pleased the only thing i wish it had was a pocket on the outside but that 's an <unk> and not part of the description have had more compliments on the design by everyone that sees it
i <unk> the design , it did smell a little but a day or two after the smell went away it fit snug on to my pro & # # ; just wish it was a little more
perfect fit for my apple looks exactly as pictured and described in the product ad on amazon yes , there is a slight smell to it when you first take it out of the packaging within a day or # the smell was <unk> i would not describe it as a & # # ; smell & # # ; more like the scent when something is brand new and packaged for awhile i highly recommend this product
i got this item for christmas , and it 's even cuter in person the <unk> material feels sturdy and the inside is a nice , soft and fuzzy -lrb- read : not scratchy ! ! -rrb- lining i have n't had a reason to leave the house with my laptop yet so i can show it off !
a lot of people complain about the smell , and the quality of this case yes , the case does smell like a warehouse when you get it , but if you spray it with fabric spray and let it air out the smell is gone within a few days also , i have no <unk> why people complain about the quality of the case it looks just as it does in the picture -lrb- which is really really nice -rrb- and the <unk> is perfect for my # inch macbook air if you like the way this case looks , definitely get it because i am sure you will be happy with your purchase once the smell dissipates
it is quite pungent for a <unk> duration of time , but it 's a great case did n't look too closely when i bought it , and realized that it is more intended for the feminine variety ; however i just tell people my grandmother made it , and it makes for a conversation starter
aside from the trinkets you get on the side , the cover itself is terrible tried for weeks to get the <unk> smell out of the case by putting it outside , inside , every room of the house , <unk> , febreze , etc , etc but to no avail i will be <unk> it unfortunately a very cute design and color so it 's quite a shame
the picture shown of the product appears much more pink than in reality i received my case and it was a <unk> color , not pink like in the picture furthermore , the stylus pens were not included in my package -lrb- although the two cloths were , but they were both white in color -rrb- i decided it was n't worth it for me so i returned it
although this was really pretty , it barely provided any cushioning . & # # ; soft and fluffy lining offers superior protection & # # ; in the description was pretty much a lie it 's also a little big , but it might be because my laptop was thin
case is cuter in person than in the pic , but it stinks to high heaven i have sprayed it with febreze several times and it still stinks stylus 's and cloths are decent
it is not what i expected , but not bad i bought another one a few days ago that was much nicer -lrb- different color -rrb- also this did not include the stylus or cleaning cloth , even though it was to be part of the deal amazon of course made good on this purchase
this case smells bad , i mean bad in order to use this case you must air it out open for at least a week the main reason for not returning it , is that it is a perfect fit for the galaxy note # <unk> # styluses are a good bonus as is the microfiber cloths the great thing about the case is the looks , it is much better in real life than pictures if you have a <unk> # , then buy , but be aware you must air it out , or that new galaxy well smell <unk> & # #
if this case had come with a functional zipper it would have been perfect the colors were cute and vibrant and fit my ipad mini with a <unk> case on it perfect with room to place a stylus
i like this case cause it 's beautiful , but it 's a little loose for macair # ' if you wan na something that can fit your charge or other things inside the case , it 's ok if you wan na something tight to your macair # ' , you wo n't be happy with it
this was great if you do n't already have a case on your ipad already unless , of course , you have a really thin case that still allows it now i bet you 're wondering why i gave this # stars it 's because i found a different use for this instead of storing my ipad in it , i stored all of my accessories for it , such as the keyboard , stylus , headphones , chargers , etc . still worked out great ! :
this sleeve seems to be great quality , and the style is great however , it is a little big for my macbook pro w/retina # in it does n't fit as snug as i would like still a great buy for the price
i had a hard time finding a case i liked but then i saw how cute the design of this case and all the extras it came with and i could n't say no at that price its hard to the case can definitely protect the nook well and the pens are great to use on the tablet happy i bought this package thank you so much
<unk> bundle of canvas fabric <unk> pattern tablet sleeve case bag use for my ti calculator case and extras that go with it like cables to connect it to <unk> . great protection cover for the price , wish i had the larger version for the extras
this canvas fabric sleeve is perfect for travel i do n't use it often so i ca n't attest to how well it will hold up over time but you ca n't beat it for the price
i really love the way the sleeve feels and looks it is very cute , and very functional however , the first couple times i closed the zipper all the way , it got stuck when i tried to unzip it , which was frustrating but for such a low price , it definitely met my expectations
she uses this for a # & # # ; macbook pro it fits in there fine seems to give adequate protection from anything but a drop it wo n't do much good if you drop it there is just not enough padding she was very happy with it
i really like the look of this sleeve , the colors are very bright i got this as added protection for my kindle fire hd , which is in an <unk> case , when i put it in my purse this works very well for this purpose , it 's not too bulky the only problem i have with this case is the strong smell hopefully the smell will dissipate with time
purchased for my macbook air and it fits great -lrb- even with a snap-on cover on the macbook air -rrb- - use it mostly for air travel it did smell awful at first but after airing out in my garage -lrb- i turned it <unk> and left it for a couple of weeks -rrb- it no longer smells my chief complaint is that it was sewn together with the pattern turned upside-down on one side that annoys me
fits my laptop perfectly the zipper just recently started not working , but it 's only sometimes if i just unzip it all the way , and <unk> it up , it works just fine overall , this case is great
i like the case it 's adorable , i get tons of compliments on it i store my surface in here with a premium folio case cover , stylus , and keyboard at first the fit was a bit snug , but it stretches with frequent use i 've never used this kind of stylus , so i do n't know if every touch screen stylus is the same , but this one is only good for <unk> the movement is n't fluid for writing or drawing if it had a better stylus , i would definitely give it # stars
ordered this # . # inch sleeve/case to carry my nook hd + # inch with cover , to give a little extra protection for travel and work case arrived very quickly prettier and better quality than i expected i love the full coverage zip around protection and felt lining perfect size for my device recommend this product and seller very highly also ordering one for my mother 's ipad and cover , exact fit for her 's also , she liked mine so much and the free stylus fits perfectly next to device a + rating to seller ! !
i love this case , it is roomy enough even for my charger and very pretty the cloth and pens were an added bonus , case is well made have had several people <unk> as to where i bought it
i love this i got the # & # # ; because i ordered a # & # # ; of a different brand and it was too small for my # & # # ; nook this fits it perfectly without having to cram it in but not so big the nook slides around inside too much the styluses and cleaning cloths work well also
this tablet sleeve its way cuter in person i love the feel of it and the size some people might find it a look on the larger size but i keep my tablet with its attached keyboard inside it without any issues i love the little things that come with it over all a awesome buy
i got a new smaller macbook and wanted a case for when i travel this one works well and is very colorful only bad thing is no handle or extra pocket i still rated it # stars
the selections of different designs and colors was better than i have noted elsewhere it seemed a bonus to receive the stylus ' and cleaning cloths i am very satisfied my daughter also ordered this item and she loves hers as well
what a cute good quality case holds my ipad and some small accessories nicely cushioned as well good value compared to what you find in stores most of the time
i was n't sure of the material it would be made of but it surprised me because it is pretty <unk> material i have no worries that my tablet wo n't have the proper protection when i am carrying it around i love the design as well it is a must buy for the price and quality , it also arrived rather quickly which i was very happy with this way i could take it with me with no worries
i would have preferred my daughter to get a case that offers more protection while being used , but she insisted on this one and she loves it she loves that it is so soft on the inside to protect her kindle : -
i have previously bought and returned several cases that say they fit my kindle fire , but they were all so tight that it was impossible to easily put in or take it out this case is roomy enough the case is washable on the outside and the zipper is sturdy inside it is soft and protects the kindle very cute design
the case is very well made and very trendy great feel light and comfortable i bought this for an ipad air but got it larger so that i can use my case to carry it and this sleeve to hold it all just what i was looking for fast shipping :
really enjoy the product the only negative is that i thought i was ordering a mini size and when you change colors of the cases the size changes so i just use it for storage of papers for work
i love this case i got one for my ipad mini i emailed to ask a couple of questions and got a reply very quickly their customer service was fast , professional and very helpful i would recommend this case to anyone , it is so stylish and fits perfectly really great product from a great company thank you , <unk>
