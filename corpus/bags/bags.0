this case looks nice and has plenty of pockets for all the other stuff you have to carry around but , if you 're using it for something other than back and forth to the office or have a thinner laptop , there is just not enough padding in here to protect the computer from scratching and rubbing we bought this for my son for school this past fall he has one of those thinner laptops and the cover was soon dented and scratched and the constant rubbing of the screen on the touchpad controls left little white marks on the display while you can blame the computer design some , after we added more padding in the case , we had no more problems on the plus side , the case is durable - nothing has yet ripped or torn off - and it 's easy to spot clean
the pic on this product does no justice to the real thing its very good looking -lrb- black synthetic with a sheen -rrb- , and well designed isnt one of those huge <unk> that people carry the hand and shoulder straps have delicious padding ! ! adequate space for a large computer -lrb- my dell inspiron fits -rrb- , a zip drive , cables , some disks , magazines , notes etc . if your looking to carry bulky files and text books - might not work value for money any day
i have an hp pavilion <unk> # us -lrb- <unk> # series -rrb- and this thing fits my laptop perfectly the front pocket can fit the power supply , an <unk> mouse , an <unk> <unk> , and a headphone just fine there is another large pocket inside that i use to store my <unk> -lrb- it can hold up to # <unk> covers -rrb- another inside raised pocket is large enough to hold my box of business cards and a # <unk> <unk> bottle the <unk> pocket is slimmer but is big enough to hold my composition notebook & a newspaper it 's perfect for my needs and it looks quite decent i would highly recommend it
i 'm very happy with the bag , it exceeded my expectations my # `` toshiba satellite fits perfectly , i 'm using one of the adjustable paddings to better secure the notebook it will accomodate thicker laptops , so if yours is really thin , you might want to look for another bag more than enough compartments for my needs , two big exterior ones for folders or cd 's and a few interior ones for your mouse or power supply great value , i sincerely recommend it
i just purchased this bag and think it 's great it 's a simple bag with room for the computer , some disks and papers or files if you are looking to carry text books or larger items with your computer then maybe this is n't the bag for you i was just looking for an attractive and secure bag to carry my computer in and this bag accomplishes that it offers good protection with plenty of foam padding to keep the computer safely in place there is an adjustable piece of padding that allows you to accomodate almost any size laptop computer before i made this purchase i did a lot of pricing and really think this is a great deal in all the stores i shopped in there was no bag to compare with this one at this price i give it # stars for protection and durability
this bag is fantastic i bought it before i got the new <unk> powerbook , because i compared the dimensions and knew it would fit this is a rather large laptop , so i would imagine that just about any other machine would fit nicely it 's just an excellent product : good materials , sturdy construction , easy to pack alot into it one main compartment for the machine , an external sleeve , an inside pocket , a pocket for cds or cables , business card holder and a couple of other pouches the shoulder strap is comfortable and sturdy i checked around with many different vendors , and thought this looked like a good choice the bag is made entirely from synthetic materials , no leather on this one and it 's a good price definitely worth the money if you 're looking for a soft , slick bag for a laptop
this is a <unk> , cool-looking , spacious , comfortable to carry bag it converts to a backpack and the shoulder strap and handle are super padded bad news : i went through two of these in six months , the second very nicely provided as a replacement for the first by kensington for free they both ripped out at one of the outer seams in the main non-padded compartment i have a haul of a commute via bus and nyc subway and the bag got shoved around a lot the exposed seams tend to snag on any available sharp surface and rip out be nice to it and this could be a good bag , but if you need a bag that can be abused , stay away
after reading the reviews on the page for this page , i decided to see one for myself at a local <unk> the design is great , small and trendy , but it does have several drawbacks the notebook sleve , as others have already mentioned , is layered with a thin piece of felt while it provides a nice and fuzzy place for the notebook , it is thin and suspect to easy ripping second , the backpack straps on this bag are very unpadded and make the backpack rest on the upper back depending on how you like to wear backpacks , this may impact your like or dislike of the <unk> lastly , the bag is small this is not a bag a student can carry wtih all his or her <unk> inside it 's made for a notebook and some accessories , with maybe a couple files or small books for something similar to this but with more space for textbooks , you may want to look at the amazon.com messenger bag
stylish , durable , and convenient one thing i do n't like is the cell phone holder is inside i hope it is on the surface so it can be taken in and out more conveniently the key holder is a failure it is very easy to lose your key if you really put it in because it may slide out of the holder other than these two problems , it is a great bag
i 've used one of these saddlebag cases for # years now i do n't know how i ever lived without it it holds any laptop i 've ever seen , plus allows for ample storage of papers , folders , and even my large <unk> it has great storage areas for power bricks , cables , keys , metal pocket junk -lrb- for quick storage before hitting airport metal <unk> -rrb- and a great outside pocket to tuck away a cell phone or <unk> it is <unk> from backpack mode -lrb- great for moving in planes and airports -rrb- to shoulder strap or handle carry , and the backpack straps hide for a professional look if you carry a laptop , buy this case
i got this case and used it for transporting my laptop to and from school it only took a few months for the zipper to break off as a result of the stiffness of the zipper the zipper is stiff to zip and there is no ease about it all four corners of the bag have holes from putting it in my backpack and constantly using it i only used it about a year and a half and yes i used it with a broken zipper it was still zippable because the metal piece that holds the handle of the zipper broke i recommend this item if you are hardly going to use it but i <unk> do n't if you are going to use it everyday like i do or want something that will last a long time i wo n't be purchasing another
i have a # . # inch laptop and the case is very big for the laptop you should read the dimentions carefully to see if your laptop would be suitable the case itself is very nice soft and well padded for the protection of the laptop i blame the bad sizing on myself and if your laptop fits in the case i would recomend it
this sleeve is not for <unk> it 's for # `` screen laptop computers and swims on my # `` powerbook maybe it 's ok for a # `` ibook , but not a # `` ibook or powerbook as the other review suggests
this is a great product , especially for the price the zipper works well and snaps into place when closed the cushioning is thick but not bulky , and is soft inside and out i have an inspiron # . # inch laptop , and it is a little loose it will probably fit up to a # inch computer wide screens will probably fit poorly
it is not the prettiest of sleeves nor is it the most expensive of sleeves but , it does its job my # . # `` widescreen notebook fits inside fine -- there is still a little room around , but not much -- it does not fit like a glove though it is really nice that the zipper tab can be <unk> down i use this sleeve to protect my notebook inside my timbuk # bag when i have to lug around my notebook
i already have a backpack in which i carry my laptop it did n't have quite as much padding as i wanted and i wanted to protect the laptop from <unk> items i may carry in the backpack this sleeve turned out to be the perfect solution my computer fits perfectly and everything works out great i have a dell with a # `` display , the sleeve fits like a glove and adds considerable padding to the situation this would be a great solution for carrying a computer in a bag not specifically designed for a laptop
i recently purchased this computer sleeve from amazon.com because i could n't find it anywhere here in hawaii i got it within the expected delivery dates i tried it on my sony vaio <unk> series laptop and fits like a glove this product <unk> up to my expectations and i recommend this product for people who like to carry their laptop in their school bag the only problem i got was the tracking info was wrong it was n't amazon.com to blame but it was the usps 's fault for the tracking
make sure your laptop is big -lrb- mine is # by # inches ... it 's a wide screen -rrb- this case adds enough padding to throw the laptop in any bag without adding too much volume
i bought this to use for my dell laptop to bring it inside my backpack to college classes , and so far it has worked great it has enough padding to protect the laptop while inside the backpack but fits around it tightly so that i can slip it inside the pack easily the only improvement would be if it had a small handle on it for when i 'm not carrying it inside my backpack , but i 'll just be buying another case for that after i finish school
this sleeve is just what i wanted to protect my personal laptop it fits my toshiba satellite # . # `` notebook with room to spare i wanted to keep it snug inside of my carying case , and this is just the perfect thing i recommend this for any laptop owner that wants to prolong the <unk> of their machine
i have a toshiba a # with a # inch screen the case logic <unk> # fits the laptop perfectly it provides protection when i put the pc into my briefcase or backpack i highly recommend it as cost effective protection of your expensive computer
it 's a great little case it 's light , and a perfect fit for my dell xps m # i never have to remove the case while i use it because the straps keep it on the laptop all the time unfortunately one of the zipper handles came off the about # day after i bought it the other one has stayed on strong for the past # to # months , so i can use the case it has protected my laptop well , and does n't take up any extra space in my bag
the case fits my # `` ibook perfectly and i love that when it 's all zipped up it looks more like a binder than a laptop however , the zipper pulls broke off within a week of owning it and the fabric binding at the top of the inner mesh pocket <unk> a black stripe across my white computer
it works great for my thinkpad x # , and even stretched to cover the two extended batteries i put on it the zipper pulls kept coming off , even with gentle use if you want a tight fit for a good price it 's ok though i 'm buying another one
this sleeve seems well made and looks nice , but it does n't fit either my ibm x # or x # these are both small laptops , but they do have very square front corners , which seems to be the issue
this will not substitute for a full case , but if you take your notebook and toss it into a bag like i do , the this protective sleeve is for you it 's convenient and easy to work with in any <unk> there are times when you just want to carry your device without the bulk of a larger bag this is the answer it is soft and protective now there are some <unk> that those considering this product need to know it does not have a hard design not a substitute for a hard case you should measure the size of your device to get a really good fit overall i think it 's a great value for the price
i have had the previous version of the kensington saddlebag for several years and it has served me well - until i have abused it beyond repair i have a <unk> lenovo r # , with an extended battery , which is huge and heavy this new design is pretty good i was worried that it might be a little smaller than its predecessor , to my -lrb- pleasant -rrb- surprise , it 's expandable i like the little junk drawer on the bottom , but i wish they would have kept the big pocket that was on the front of the old one it was handy also considering the main issue with my old bag was the backpack straps coming apart , i 'm a bit worried about the straps on this one they 're attached differently all in all - not bad
i 've had several versions of the kensington saddlebag over the years after my cat destroyed -lrb- by scent -rrb- my last one , i decided to spring for a new sb pro having not seen it in person , i took it with a leap of faith that it would be as good / better than the original it turns out that it is in some ways better , and not so much in other ways the new tray is cool , as it keeps certain things safe - but it creates a <unk> in the first compartment where things get <unk> down into the old version had a great front pocket system that made it handy to access pens , business cards , etc . the new one is far more protected , but at the expense of more difficult access overall the bag is very well made , and if you never owned the first one , you would certainly enjoy this version maybe in a year , i 'll revise this review , but as it stands it 's a great product only spoiled by <unk> of it 's predecessor
i was looking for a saddlebag to carry my dell d # laptop this seemed like a good choice with all the pocket options , but it turned out to be too bulky for my needs it would be a great option for a larger laptop and the <unk> space -lrb- papers , folders , gadgets , etc . -rrb- so here are my <unk> pros : well padded , plenty of space , enough pockets and a nifty <unk> drawer that slides out for easy access cons : too big and bulky , i have found that the <unk> draw opens prematurely if it is not completely secured
i recently bought a very large hp pavillion notebook computer , and this kensington saddle bag was listed under `` accessories . i was concerned that it would n't be big enough because some reviews i had read about the computer said no carrying case was large enough to hold the computer this carrying case held the computer with no difficulty , and provides plenty of padding for protection it also provides a number of other useful storage compartments the different straps on the bag , allowing you to carry your computer `` backpack , `` `` shoulder bag , `` or `` brief case `` style are extremely useful i especially find the `` back pack `` straps to be a very useful feature
this is a great product good construction , excellent design , and an affordable price this is my second of these bags my previous one was stolen abroad and i wanted one exactly like it it has plenty of space the sliding bottom `` drawer `` is a clever way to create space and protect the laptop if dropped the hidden shoulder straps come in handy while carrying another bag at airports since it becomes a backpack and the mesh pocket with top and side access is another winner to me , this is the `` transformer `` of laptop bags
i have a # . # inch laptop and this bag holds the laptop snugly and securely i used this bag during college and it converts to a book bag easily with the built in straps one can also use it as a saddle bag i have owned it for years and it never broke in the draw on the bottom i store my power brick i also recommend getting a portable surge <unk> that will fit in there like one from trip lite <unk> lite traveler protect it surge <unk> # outlets -lrb- # <unk> -rrb- for laptop use , direct plug-in #
if you have an apple powerbook # `` , do not buy this backpack although the product is nicely made and attractive , especially for the price , the notebook compartment is padded on the sides and bottom , but not on top there is only an elastic band on top that holds the laptop in place although the manufacturer 's description says that this backpack can hold a # `` powerbook , i suppose it would fit -- but the top of the notebook would be against the edge of the laptop and unpadded if you care about avoiding dents in your powerbook , do not order this on the other hand , if you have a # `` laptop and do n't need a <unk> insulated notebook compartment , i would recommend this bag . # `` is just <unk> it has a comfy gel padding on the back and a sporty look
buyer beware on this product the product description billed it as ideal for students and business travelers i bought this product for business travel and am disappointed though there is plenty of room and a variety of pockets , this pack lacks an organizer to hold pens , pencils , business cards , etc .
pros - its good , strong bag , can be used roughly and carries a lot of stuff . cons - not much sections in bag where you can place stuff which is needed frequently eg . i travel by train so i keep my <unk> pass in the bag i expected an easy to access section where i can keep the pass side pockets are good but not that useful a good decent bag . . am happy with my purchase .
if you need protection for your notebook , and room to carry a variety of other items , this might well be your bag this targus unit has a dedicated sleeve area for a notebook , and has a rather unique zipper up the middle and flap that buckles , ensuring that everything stays steady however , please consider - this is a solid , <unk> of a unit this baby felt heavy when empty if you load it up , as i do , you 'll feel like you 're going off to war - the small , side pouches sit out too far for my taste i 'd like to be able to walk down a plane aisle with this on my back , but each time i 've snagged those little <unk> on the seats as i 'm walking by - the pocket inside the <unk> flap is a great <unk> , but if you attempt to open the pocket while the flap is inverted you risk dumping pens , coins , etc . everywhere
i needed a good way to carry my laptop onto planes and around the e # show in los angeles , ca so i purchased this backpack it is everything i had hoped for in a laptop backpack this thing holds my # inch sager # perfectly and the protection is top notch the bag has room for pretty much any and all business related items you would think to bring it has great construction , roomy compartments , and the overall targus quality you 'd expect i recommend this to anyone except people who have laptops with bigger screens i hear some # 's fit in here , i just do n't know which ones
put this on a wooden table and the case will mar and scratch your table it 's very cheaply made ; may look professional from a distance but it 's likely to come apart if it falls of the airport luggage truck also , next time i 'll buy something without pic foam and just pay to have the foam <unk> other than that , it works might be good value for the money for someone getting started on photo or video or for someone that needs to carry <unk> equipment around
it 's <unk> and survives airline baggage handling the locks are cheap and difficult to lock and unlock with the key ; i did n't expect <unk> but i was hoping for reasonably easy operation the <unk> foam goes the full depth of the box , which makes it harder to create the right shapes for your gear two layers of foam would have been a lot easier to use
i really like the product , the service was great , shipping was right on time everything was great i do feel the product is a little pricey for what it is , but is a good quality , and i have two of them
i have four of these they are great for the money but are n't as tough as the more expensive cases the thin metal edge dents easily and the sides are made of wood panels which soak up water if allowed to get wet definitely not tough enough for air travel but it makes a reasonably priced case for normal wear and tear the foam is the pick and pluck variety and is easy to make exact openings to fit a variety of gear
it is not equipped to be secured at the back of a car seat it is a well-made <unk> carry case for a dvd player or similar device and thats all about it if it had d-rings and straps to go with it , i would have kept it
does not hold a # `` screen portable dvd player as advertised i bought this case for my toshiba <unk> # portable dvd player with an # . # `` screen and it 's too large to fit in this case
i did n't care for this particular bag it 's pretty cheap looking and feeling i had bought two cases for my parents portable dvd players that are much better go for the case logic very nice case
we use on a # `` portable and it works fine . plenty of compartments for storing stuff the only thing i wish it had was a strap to hang from the headrest i <unk> one up easy enough but they could have done it easier and more permanent
i 'm pretty picky , but this bag lived up to the various good reviews i read on amazon as others have said , you can not fit much in the bag other than the laptop itself in other words , bulky accessories will not fit however , you can fit your dell # m with the extended battery and an extra # cell battery as well -lrb- placed vertically next to the computer -rrb- you can also fit on top of the computer a very small wireless mouse -lrb- e.g i found a very small ge wireless mouse , which is n't the best product , but fits in the case -- there are probably several other small mice that will fit -rrb- in addition , there is an outside document pouch that you can fit some papers in -- although a small stack of papers is all that will fit the bag is very attractive and professional and provides ample protection for your computer i would have given the product a # , but the bag is <unk> a little bit of wear on the corners and i 've only had it for a few months
the case is very nice , but it is not a perfect fit for the eee pc i had purchased it as a case for the eee after seeing it referenced in a list of accessories for the eee the case is about an inch too wide and an inch too long for the computer to have a snug fit
this case works very nicely for the acer aspire one netbook computer the computer fits really well and there is space for accessories i am deducting one star because the side pocket does not hold <unk> as well as it could i imagine this would be a problem for dvd players as well it 's not a huge problem but still could be better
i bought this bag for my eeepc # h # `` laptop although the laptop has much more room than it needs on all sides , there are velcro straps to keep it in place there is easily enough space in the same main compartment for # . # x # business papers i bought this case size in hope that about an inch thick of standard paper size could fit , and it does the dvd storage area and its pockets provide an organized area for pens , business cards , papers and other items front flap pocket has side zippers for side access that i have n't had a need for yet but it could make it easier for access in tight spots this section is more than enough room for my ac charger and flash sticks , cell charger , etc . allows plenty of room for my feet when stowed under an airline seat good quality workmanship with little <unk> would have been nice to have a detachable shoulder strap , but not much of an issue
i wish targus made the same bag just a few inches wider my toshiba # barely squeezes in the bag however , it does fit and i was able to mount it between the two seats of our # toyota <unk> with no problems there 's also ample room for cords and dvds i like how this bag doubles as a storage case and a way to mount it in the car for viewing all in all , a very nice product
good quality material , seems like it will be very durable like the organization pocket for dvd 's the only thing i would wish for is that the pocket that holds the dvd player have two velcro straps one going each way so that the dvd player is held in more securely
our dvd is a bit chunky and did n't fit in some other cases we tried it fits very well in this case this one does n't have a system for hanging the case between two seats in the car that is it 's most significant drawback another minor issue is the power supply and cables barely fit in the pockets but this would probably be an issue for any case the front pocket of the case has sleeves for up to # dvds which is a nice feature
well designed case for portable dvd player has a nice velcro insert that allows you to adjust the fitting for your particular player very well padded and comfortable to carry has sleeves to carry , <unk> , # discs
this bag had a lot of room my dvd player fit nicely and the dvd case that came with it was very handy i also had room for the cord and the strap held the player in position so it did n't slip around and risk damage
this is a great case for the money it 's very well made , nicely padded and very much worth the money i have bought # of these for # different portable dvd players
although this case is a bit more pricey than your standard discount store types , it is well worth the extra $ $ my family just used this on a # mile trip the viewing case allowed us to configure the dvd player to a comfortable viewing angle , even with the bothersome plastic handles on the back of my van seats the viewing case has an awesome design , and keeps the dvd player very secure , while at the same time making it easy for my son to change discs the carrying case will hold everything easily for transportation and storage when not in use the only suggestion for improvement i have is to include one extra storage pocket for headphones i am very glad i returned the $ # cases to the local discount stores , as they did n't offer any flexibility in <unk> the player to comfortable viewing points this is a purchase you wo n't regret
i have a panasonic # . # inch screen , and it fits great into this case very sturdy case , with lots of room in it too ! and not big and bulky i love it
after dealing with some long car rides and a <unk> # year old , we invested in a # `` portable dvd player for our daughter we needed a travel system that would be easily installed and removable to move from one car to the other and would also fit the dvd player this worked perfectly we are able to install it between the two front seats within minutes and the dvd player has never moved once strapped in the case is durable and functional holding both travel and home power cords as well as several dvds
we have this case and have found it very useful for travel works well in the minivan when set between the two front seats to eliminate sound issues , we use a splitter and a long extension cord so headphones can be used but i <unk> the storage space for dvds is great lots of room to place the other items like car charger , remote , power cord , rca cables , etc . easy to carry and simple to open up at the airport security for those having problems , they are not taking the time to set it up properly it is not rocket science for the price , i would buy another for my family and friends when they get a portable dvd player
i bought this case for my # -year-old nephew after i purchased a sony dvd player for him for christmas last year he likes to take the dvd player with him pretty much wherever he goes , so the case is <unk> my sister reports that the dvd player -lrb- sony dvp-fx # -inch -rrb- fits well , and there are no problems with the case
este bolso es de excelente calidad , lo <unk> para un <unk> asus , y <unk> perfectamente <unk> , buenos <unk> , buena <unk> para el <unk> this product has a excelent quality , i bought for a asus laptop , and it fit perfectly , good material , and offer a good protection for the
this is the bag for your portable dvd player i 've tried so many bags prior , only to send them back because of there capacity , they hold no accessories i have a # . # `` toshiba which is large and this bag holds everything perfectly well made and good looking with very good padding and not to large i would recommend this bag for all who like to carry there accessories along , so if you have a # `` to # `` unit this is a great bag a really great bag at a great price !
this review is for the targus dvd # case -lrb- inside , according to targus , is # `` x # . # `` x # . # `` -rrb- i bought this over a year ago to use with a small # . # inch laptop -lrb- # . # by # . # by # . # -rrb- the laptop fit is snug with room for # or # rows -lrb- # each -rrb- of standard dvd cases on top so as long as you are looking at the dvd # , then you can be sure it will hold players of like size however accommodating accessories like power supplies , might still be an issue the side pocket will , at a stretch , accommodate the power supply , as long as you do n't mind the bulge and do n't intend to use the dvd slots if you find that an issue you might want to aim for # `` laptop cases instead targus has discontinued the dvd # , so get it while you can targus does n't make anything in the # ' size anymore
i read other <unk> 's great reviews about this bag and it was all true while being lightweight and compact , it is sturdy and has lots of room for many dvds , my earphones and plugs , and it still cushions my dvd player it has a great over-the-shoulder strap , which is padded and soft i do n't think i could find a more perfect bag to travel with me on my many plane trips and it is so reasonably priced
bought the product just before the family went away on vacation the targus case fits the portable dvd player perfectly there is plenty of room for storing the chargers , extra wire <unk> , earphones & plenty of dvds really like the product
this case is perfect for what we needed it fits our # inch dvd player , a set of child 's headphones and a bunch of movies we used it on a flight and it worked perfectly we are very happy with this product
this case is just awesome it has extra compartments for your dvd 's or cd 's , your power cords and anything <unk> you might want to place in it for your dvd player a handy strap for carring i am very please that <unk> this item worth the money
we got this case to hold our son 's dvd player that we use for airplane trips we have used it on two trips so far and are very satisfied it is very well-cushioned so i think it affords a lot of protection it is big enough to hold all the extra cords and dvds when he <unk> we just leave it in there and adjust the strap so it is tight about the bottom half and it works great
i bought this bag to hold my asus eee pc # gb laptop it has a # -inch screen this is the perfect sized bag for it , and there 's enough room for a little mouse and my flash drive case in the second pocket there 's plenty of padding i have dropped it once -lrb- about # feet onto a wood floor -rrb- , and my eee pc is just fine very good product well worth it
i saw the small size of this case and was in love it has plenty of space for dvds and cords -lrb- though it wont hold large headphones unless they fold -rrb- it is padded enough for protection but not too padded to be too bulky it 's great you wont regret it
i was skeptical when purchasing this travel case we just purchased as portable dvd player and was leaving for a road trip , and it was n't safe just sitting on the console once i strapped this to our mini van , it was awesome it brought the player higher up so it was at eye level , and closer to the children in the <unk> i totally reccommend this product great product and easy to install
i was wondering why i could not find this hard case anywhere that the tungsten was sold , and i had to order it online upon receipt of the case i figured out why : on the internet you can fool people by showing them a picture of an `` aluminum `` case and it looks aluminum you ca n't fool people when the item is right in front of their eyes do not be fooled : this case is made of ... plastic the hinge is also made of plastic , and every time i open the case it feels like it is about to crack in half if you are <unk> , this case will not feel ergonomic in your hand , as the person from ireland pointed out below when the item this case is supposed to protect is more rugged than the case itself , you know you have a problem it is a shame that such a well-made , classy item like the tungsten does not have a decent case to hold it
confusion regarding the exact use had to return <unk> was not clear but the picture and wording suggested i had chosen the right item problem was there was no effort to provide the proper replacement
decent case for the money . not aluminum though and i found a better aluminum case for about the same money and replaced . shop around and you may find better for similar
the hard case does what it is supposed to do , which is to protect the palm tungsten from being `` squeezed `` to the `` on `` position while in transit the problem it solved was the loss of battery power because of the squeeze so far , so good
the hardcase that i purchased for my palm tungsten t was a valuable investment the protection it provides for my pda and its screen in invaluable this genuine palm case is not as bulky as i expected and us easy to use the additional storage spaces for memory cards is a bonus i highly recomment this case for anyone that owns a t , t # , or t #
this laptop case is big enough for my computer and projector but after only # months it looks atrocious the handles are coming apart and the slightest abrasion and it gets all `` furry `` with threads cheaply made and i paid way too much for it
- the case is light and very well made - nice pocket set up - shoulder strap is incredibly comfortable - zippers are high quality -lrb- i know it sounds silly but it stinks when they 're poor quality and snag all the time - small : it says it will fit a # `` computer my # `` mb pro struggles to fit inside of it and wo n't fit with the microfiber sleeve i keep it in if the computer is in the bag , it will fit little else - could use another storage compartment - if you 're a teacher , which i am , this bag is pretty much unusable as there 's not enough room to carry many things overall would be a great case if it had more room , it 's <unk> though compared to other # `` bags
i love the <unk> color and the case looks really nice and professional the only complaint is the compartment is kind of small when i try to put in one textbook and a binder
i just love this bag . is big enought to fit all my stuff & aacute ; nd at the same time is very confortable to hand carry it i just have one bad comment i was unlucky and i received my bag without the shoulder strap still waiting for the seller to mail it
this is an inexpensive bag that keeps your laptop at hand and still provide appropriate storage for pens , a notebook and small storage devices and power pack you can pack your cell also
this is a very well made and light carrying case it has replaced another case which was more security screening friendly , but is much more useful it seems to be half as heavy as the other case and i can still carry everything i need i like the construction i like the looks i apparently like everything about this case i have one similar to it for my # `` laptop targus makes the best equipment
review posted from <unk> <unk> is for a ttl # case which does not have the expanded compartments the ttl # does previous review is on the money for the small case the ttl # has all those features and a significant added pocket that can carry a portable printer , a work binder , or a thin projector the ttl # also has an expanding portfolio file section for letter sized folders nice package and storage for # lbs
i have purchased this laptop case in amazon and used it for # weeks this is a good case , spacious enough to hold a big screen laptop and several books . good quality <unk> i recommend this to everyone but if you have a moderate size laptop , below # inch screen , do not buy this bag this is really big for it this bag is only good with a big laptop
i looked at the other reviews on this product and many more before i purchased my case for my # `` laptop this case is just enough room for the laptop and cord ; papers and folders ; and the essentials on the inside no fluff and <unk> - just the basics , but useful and effective
i must to say that this <unk> notebook case is too large for my # `` dell # m those who have small laptops may need to choose a smaller carrying case instead this one but it is a really good product
the cpt # fits my # laptop perfectly and the additional storage pockets are well <unk> in general , the entire case appears to be well made for the price i have given the case only four stars because i do n't any long-term durability information at this time
this is a good laptop bag i only wished that it came with a shoulder strap b/c with the computer and accessories the bag gets extremely heavy other than that it is a good bag
the strap cuts into your shoulder the case is very protective of the equipment and has a few extra pouches but the thing is bulky and the strap is to small for the size of the case
a great case for the price paid i only considered the leather targus as a possible alternative i have traveled twice with it ; my only complaint is one of the inside lock & stitch -lrb- velcro -rrb- square <unk> was not solidly sewn ... an easy repair
very practical , good quality , ok price , holds # inch lt w / bunch of other stuff i 'll <unk> this product # out of # there is really nothing wrong w / this case
i own a dell # `` inspiron # laptop and i could n't have found a better notebook case than the targus cpt # i love this bag it has many compartments that hold so much i even carry my laptop cooling fan and many more accessories you will not be disappointed with this purchase very sharp looking and durable ! !
i bought this targus cpt # <unk> deluxe notebook case for my # inch laptop i have used other targus bags and have never had a problem this bag holds my laptop in place and has lots of pockets for other things i looked at lots of laptop bags and this targus bag beats the others hands down

the reason i picked this one out of all the other cases was because where the laptop sat was in a zipped up compartment i also really like how the laptop is strapped down tight inside -lrb- a velcro safety strap to fit to the size of your laptop -rrb- there are a lot of little pockets for all the other things to bring along i have a bluetooth mouse , and my battery cords that i bring along and it does n't add bulk at all it fits my # `` dell inspiron laptop perfectly with even a tiny space left this is a good product if you travel a lot with your laptop and you want it safe but if your looking for a case that is lightweight , then do n't look at this one it 's not that heavy , but it 's not the lightest of the cases i rated this item # stars because i think it 's a really good product
this is my second bag i get from targus , and i can say they keep their quality in their products great product for my # `` laptop i love this case
two days after i got the <unk> headphones , the right ear stopped working i think the product should be <unk> , since i never see it at best buy or <unk> city
i purchased a bulk amount of headphones for my daughter as she goes thru these things like water each one was damaged , she 'd have to hold the wires in place to be able to hear as they kept `` <unk> out `` . they really are terrible quality and i would n't recommend anyone purchase
there is a warning label on the product stating that this product has lead on it & that you must wash your hands after every use complete waste of money lead is dangerous can cause medical issues avoid this product
i bought it because it was cheap it worked well for about # months then the cable became frayed and now sound comes out of only one <unk> the two earphones this is a common problem with cheap headphones , and these are as good as any
