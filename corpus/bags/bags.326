nice bag for the price looks professional with a lot of room great for a variety of laptop sizes i use mine when traveling with my # & # # ; laptop and still room to spare for additional items
i 'm a student at the <unk> school of management and there are many days that i am dressed up for interviews , project presentations , meet and <unk> with <unk> , etc . i wanted something that could fit my laptop and a binder or two so the days i 'm in business professional attire my get up would n't be <unk> by a backpack for my textbooks this is sturdy , professional , and spacious it 's perfect
this bag is wonderful , excellent construction , including the carry straps are sewn in all the way to the bottom , fantastic for the price point much prettier than the picture and professional looking as a stage manager , i bought it to carry my call <unk> , pencils and other supplies there are five feet on the bottom of the bag so the material never touches the floor a built-in key chain in the bag so i can transfer my car keys and other items into the bag and not carry around my purse extremely well padded and could easily carry a small lap-top
this bag is perfect it is very hard to find a stylish bag to accomodate such a large laptop i have a dell # . # `` laptop & it fits like a glove there is cushioning on the bottom to protect it & a velcro strap to keep it in place with a divider to place folders & such on the other side plenty of space for other items , but not too overbearing i love it great price too
this is a very nice laptop bag for the price i was worried i would not find a bag big enough for my wifes # `` dell laptop but this worked just fine it is attractive and has enough protection surrounding the laptop and a storage pocket for the a/c power adapter
i was worried this bag would n't fit my extra large laptop , but it does and it has lots of little extras ~ straps inside , pockets , and zippers it 's very stylish i 'm very happy with it
i ordered this bag after the strap of my old bag was simply worn out it has plenty of room for my music materials and music cds it also has a pen/pencil area for three , two open pockets attached to a zip pocket , and an area for a computer however , when i received my order and removed the plastic and all , the smell of my new bag was quite strong i aired it out for several days and sprayed it thoroughly with air <unk> ; the odor left so far , i had no other problems ... truly grateful for my bag
i have a leather purse that i use as my computer bag and it 's very fashionable and does n't look like a computer bag but the leather straps are cracking so i was looking into something new and came across this it 's very durable and spacious , and feels better on my shoulder than my leather one it 's really big and holds a lot plus the material is easy to clean and wipe any spills off of the price was low and the quality is great for what i need it for ... to look good and hold a lot of weight without breaking
this notebook bag comes in very handy ! i use it to store the new macs that are out it fits perfectly inside and is well cushioned it has storage for the power supply and other accessories as well i keep all my gadgets inside this bag highly recommend it
this bag is modern , practical , fashionable and durable i keep my hp # in laptop in a neoprene sleeve by <unk> , along w / the cord , a surge protector , wireless mouse and pens / paper in the bag it 's snug , but would fit better if i did n't have the extra protection of the sleeve
this is an awesome bag for a larger laptop its easily accessible , has comfortable straps , pockets for my wallet , and plenty of room for the power cord plus magazines , and a snack etc . its got good padding , and most of all , it did n't cost over $ # like most other stylish bags for larger laptops it seems to be pretty durable i 'm very happy with this purchase and would recommend it to anyone . :
after buying the smaller version , it did n't have the power pack pocket i returned and got the # in version but after i put everything in this bag , the flap <unk> n't find the magnet to keep it closed the magnet is very small and does n't keep the bag shut i ended buying the timbuk # command and i love it i spend the extra $ $ but now have room for all my gear -lrb- laptop , cords , accessories -rrb- the handle is cheap and the strap is fixed
this product if junk it 's not sturdy and not made from good materials also , the video on this bag says the outer flap is held by magnets it 's not it 's held by cheap velcro i hate velcro ! ! !
the `` # year limited warranty `` is actually less than # months it lasted # months before the zipper broke <unk> and it never really managed to fit a # ' computer without <unk> the skin off your fingers trying to close it worse than garbage what 's so much worse than the unacceptable quality of this crap is amazon 's <unk> of the product and complete <unk> regarding the `` # year limited warranty . case logic made an inferior product , but i bought it because amazon <unk> to me about it i can spend as much returning it as i spent on it and i ca n't even get back the full price that i paid i feel completely screwed over because i absolutely was
i would definitely not buy this bag again i have only had the bags for a few weeks and take good care of it , and the strap has broken off my laptop was inside of it , but luckily the actual padding is good and let them laptop unharmed however it is very bulky , but can not carry many things inside if you are a college student and need to carry anything besides your laptop and an mp # i would not recommend this bag i could have gotten a better deal , for something that would not break on me
do n't buy if you plan to carry anything in this bag i only used it for one month carrying a # inch laptop and a few additional items -lrb- small books & papers -rrb- , and the strap has already ripped out on the side it was only used to carry these items to and from work ; no major travel or situations where it faced major stress i want my money back ... too bad it started to go after the one month return date had been passed
i just received this item and am disappointed that it does not have enough room to house adequately a # -inch laptop/notebook the tag on the front reads # - # `` , but the back of the tag 's small print states max : # . # x # . # x # . # `` i was able to force the # -inch into the bag , but it pressed against the metal zipper side and simply is not the <unk> bag for a # `` i would have been pleased with the bag , otherwise technical details for the product are confusing : `` convenient , <unk> access to a quilted laptop compartment suited for most laptops with up to a # ? screen fits devices up to # . # ' x # . # ' x # . # ' `` and in the product description : `` padded laptop compartment fits all laptops up to # -inch . even the video states the messenger bag holds laptops from # `` to # . # inches back to amazon this case goes
when purchasing this bag i thought i was getting what saw and read : a messenger bag what arrived was nothing more than a purse i had to pass the adjustment ring under the pad on strap to get more slack and even then it was still uncomfortable to carry yet the video clearly shows an average sized man wearing a bag with sufficient slack now they 're either lying about the length of the strap or the man in the advertisement was a <unk> either way i 'm returning it
the zippers are not that good i was hoping it would be a better product being case logic , but well ... you get what you pay for i will now have to find a more expensive messenger bag laptop case that fits my # . # & # # ; computer might want to step up a bit in price range if you can but , if this is the right price ... just do n't use the zipper pouch for the power cords i ca n't get mine to close and i only used it once
after less than a year of use the shoulder strap pulled off of it because the piece that holds it to the bag is made of cheap plastic i travel a lot and need a laptop bag that both <unk> easily onto a carry-on piece and is durable enough to get me through a year or two i wound up repairing the strap holder because i like the design of the bag my base carry on is also this brand and and they have light green highlights that are sewn into the edging that look kind of simple but elegant the mfg . needs to use a metal connecting piece to join the strap to the bag
this is a pretty good laptop briefcase it 's canvas material makes it considerably lighter than the <unk> dell bag i have been carrying around for years my hp laptop fits fine and there is plenty of room for the power cord , legal pad and other items i typically carry this bag puts the <unk> on slim , trim and light so it would not be a great choice if you carry alot of books or bulky items as well as a computer i like it
i just received this case today and it looks to be a good case , sturdy , and a decent amount of pockets now the however , it is just a little small for the claimed # inches i have a dell inspiron # `` and it just fits without a fraction of an inch to spare what is it with all these # `` cases that are just to snug or barely fits make the dang case for a # `` wide laptop how hard is it to find out the dimensions of the biggest # `` laptop and make the case , all others would fit sorry for <unk>
i received this package about a week ago overall the quality of the product is good but as shown in one of the picture , separate space to store laptop charger is missing in the bag i
this product is okay however , the zippers on this product are defected sometimes , the zippers open and sometimes they do not close the zippers separate and split open without warning i have a # -inch , pavilion dv # , hp laptop that i rarely carry in my case logic messenger bag the bag has enough space and compartment for storage however , i think in terms of picking upscale & # # ; zippers & # # ; to open and <unk> product is in order and <unk> a serious concern for the marketing success of this product for this reason , i would not recommend this product to anyone
has room to hold my laptop as well as a pocket for some <unk> binder like the ability to organize and all the little pockets it has to pens and phone
this is an excellent on the go messenger bag i was able to easily fit my # `` dell laptop in the bag it 's well made and had enough pouches and pockets for my daily items i would recommend this for daily usage but if you are a pack <unk> , this might not work for example , between carrying around my various chargers , extra batteries , headset , headphones , gum , <unk> , pens and papers , this bag is <unk> in fact , i could not fit my dell power adapter but when commuting to work where i do n't need those items , this bag works great but i would not take this on a trip for work where i 'm going to need all of my various items
this case has enough padding to protect your laptop i like the fact that there 's a dedicated place to store the power cord & transformer on other cases i 'm always trying to find a good spot to store them there 's enough storage for other associated items you always need with your computer you can get the computer out with fully opening the case , simply use the top zipper next to the carry handle , nice feature is you 're on airplane or cramped <unk> this is a good case with good features
this case seems a little bulky at first but after using it a few times case logic did a great job like always creating this one it has plenty of storage for anything you may need to take along with a little room to spare the only part of this case that i was slightly disappointed about is the magnet that holds the front flap closed , they could be a little stronger to combat this i went and purchased some velcro tabs and placed then on the corners of the flap i love this thing and you will never go wrong with case logic
this bag is just the right size to carry all my day to day school stuff it can be a bit small if i have anything extra though and definitely can not hold a drink but all in all it 's a good bag
i ordered this case for a new dell # `` laptop i am satisfied with this product i did have to let it sit on my porch for several hours as it had a `` new `` smell to it after that , the smell was not a problem otherwise , it works as advertised
the little pocket on the bottom for your cord is not big enough , makes the bottom too bulky i use the front zipper pocket for my cord otherwise <unk> it
i bought this messenger bag to replace a backpack i used to carry my laptop and stuff i am a computer technician so having critical tools is important i was able to fit everything i had in my backpack but in a much more organized way two drawbacks for me are the shoulder strap <unk> tend to get the strap twisted which is a bit of a nuisance and i like to have two zippers for the laptop compartment just makes it a little easier to open definitely recommend this bag
this carrying case is good with just one flaw , it looks more roomier than it is i grew out of it in just few months of use also it does n't have many pockets so i had hard time putting my wd passport drive and mouse <unk> it also after putting the laptop charger in it there was no room left for anything else
my # / # inch laptop fits very nicely into this bag it has plenty of padding , and plenty of room to store all of the things that must go with the computer when i take it anywhere although it is plenty roomy , the bag is not bulky or over sized the price is also a great value , it is hard to find a computer bag under thirty dollars , especially one of this quality
the bag fits the apple great , the only issue is the power supply for macs are so fat they <unk> the bag in the front , other than that the bag works well for my macbook pro
love it and it works great only marked a star because it does n't have a swivel strap at both ends so sometimes the strap gets crazy other than that it is awesome pull the trigger on this one if you are thinking about it : -- rrb-
this bag works perfectly i have a # `` acer notebook that fits like a glove at first the bag was just a tad tight but after using it for a month or so it grew to hold the notebook , power adapter , textbook , legal pads and supplies perfectly before this i used a back pack no more back packs for me this messenger bag works better and looks much more professional
i am very glad i have this laptop bag the photos i saw of it was right on to what the bag really is has plenty of storage for everything i carry with my laptop could not be happier with it well worth the money
i bought this case for a new laptop and was happy with the fit and organization options that are in this case i did a lot of looking around before i chose this and am happy with my
for the money , awesome has great padding in main computer area love the extra pockets , and design arrived in time and well packaged the shipping a little high , but <unk> out cost , versus paying sales tax thou good solid build quality , and good shoulder strap holds new hp dv # laptop and cords , and mouse just fine , along with # ipad mini 's and even apple tv with ease might i add that even fairly loaded with my great technology inside , does not look lumpy or <unk> , like many in this price range been their done that and have the t-shirt i highly suggest this great laptop bag
i love this bag ... it works for my needs it has alot of padding in the computer holding area has compartments enough for some accessories and papers etc . . . , but not too much my bag for work has to have more compartments and wheels etc . . . , but for my own personal computer this is perfect it 's thin , light , attractive , and protective the only con i have , which is small , is i wish the shoulder strap could be a little longer sometimes over all ... great bag , great price !
i was having a hard time finding what i wanted at a great price in the stores was not sure about looking on line for something i could not get to see in hand first the <unk> and pictures were a great help this product is exactly what i was looking for wow was i happy the price was perfect
plenty of pockets , plenty of padding , lightweight and strong everything one could want in a laptop case and more do not hesitate to purchase this case for your # & # # ; laptop
i was looking for something to serve as both a laptop bag and briefcase without too much weight this is the perfect blend to provide padding and keep me organized
i was n't sure about getting her a bag of any sort without her seeing it first but this is perfect for her # & # # ; laptop and she loves it this bag is perfect for her and the insides are even green to match the green trim
i like the function and the hint of color around the edges the first one i bought the zipper did n't work but since getting a new one i 've had this bag for over a year and it works great
bought this bag for a # inch macbook pro and it fits perfectly i feel that there is adequate padding and although i can not yet attest to the longevity of this product , after two weeks i feel that it is made of sturdy material the zippers function well and the velcro is the right strength if you are looking for a bag for your small laptop , this is an excellent choice it 's small , but just the right size for what it is
when it comes to things like clothes and bags i get a little picky , its even worse for bags because i want it to be able to hold all my stuff which this awesome bag does the pocket on the bottom is awesome for the charger i love that , though i worry that the heat from the charger might hurt the bag when i put it in the compartments are very easy to get too and reach in and out to get your items overall very worth the price
i received this product sooner than expected and was amazed , made of good quality material , fits my # inch laptop with room to spare , along with padding to protect my laptop i am very pleased
the case is very well designed to allow easy access to my macbook air # & # # ; & ipad # . # & # # ; kept in the rear compartment also , the front flap has separate compartment <unk> passport & mobile phones inside the flap is another compartment to keep my chargers & cords another touch to the case 's excellent design is its adequate protection through adequate cushioning material from external impact & from gears stored between compartments
it is very light weight and has # pockets plus the two spaces for files and laptop i would recommend this item it would have been nice to have a thin pocket on the back for things like boarding passes and a smaller zippered pocket on the front for keys there is a large zippered pocket on the front but there are other items in there that i would prefer to avoid scratching with the keys
the product came quickly which was very much appreciated , but after only a few weeks of <unk> the item , the zipper <unk> to not work one week after that the zipper handle broke off now i can no longer close the laptop case
i was really excited when i found this product and made a right <unk> of myself until my boyfriend bought it for me when i got it , though , i was so disappointed there is hardly any padding at all , and none along the zipper , so the zipper itself becomes a <unk> none of this is the fault of the seller , i should have wondered why it was so much cheaper than the -lrb- <unk> -rrb- one they are selling at the apple store and read the reviews i did n't , now it is what it is , and hopefully someone else will see this and not have the same experience
this case is as lovely as the photos and i enjoy using it , but i am disappointed that the <unk> part of the zipper broke off after about a month i put on a thick key ring and it has been fine since then
this case did the job for what i needed it for , carrying to and from class , but it was n't by any means excellent the design on the front is pretty although pieces of it are now falling of from use overall i 'd rate it as okay , but it is only around # . #
i bought this when i was in iraq to cover it and keep it safe when i travel with it i like it because it is a sung comfy fit it keeps dirt and crumbs from the bottom of my <unk> bag getting into my computer my macbook pro is an expensive purchase and i hope to keep it in the best condition as possible for as long as possible this does the trick i think i also bought the matching messenger bag so when i go to school i can have my computer in its case in the matching messenger bag safe and sound
this sleeve will fit your macbook and other slim # `` laptop i think it did not fit my # `` lenovo # laptop all other looks very good including quality to me
i love this case it looks exactly like it was pictured and it fits my # `` macbook pro perfectly there was no bad smell and the zipper and padding seemed fine -lrb- i can see why some people may have had trouble with the zipper before , it does n't seem like its amazing quality however , if you are n't rough with it -lrb- which you should n't be anyway , it is holding your computer ! ! -rrb- it 'll be just fine -rrb- it is a sleeve , so of course the case is not like a huge pillow -- but my laptop is well protected and it fits perfectly in a backpack or side bag my computer is still the same weight -lrb- in and out of the case -rrb- so there is no extra bulky or heavy feeling -- which i love it shipped quickly and was delivered right to my door
i just received this case today , and i could n't be happier with it however , i did want to take a moment to address the smell , which was my main concern when purchasing this case and other cases by this company -lrb- see other reviews for more explanation -rrb- yes , the case does come with a definite `` smell `` attached - but unlike stated , it is not overly unpleasant in fact , it 's basically the `` new shoe smell `` that you smell in shoe stores , or at home i 'm going to wait and edit this review once it has dissipated so that other customers know about how long that takes on other notes , the colors are just as bright as in the picture and beautiful it fits my macbook pro # `` -lrb- bought about two weeks ago -rrb- perfectly and is a very handy case mine even came with a screen cleaning cloth -lrb- unnecessary because i have one from apple , but i might use it for other things ! -rrb- i definitely would recommend this case
the case is very cute a little on the thin side so if your looking for a lot of protection , this is not the case for you if you want a <unk> case , than get this one and my # `` mac fir perfect in the
the sleeve is very pretty and protects my laptop well i 'm no longer worried about carrying my laptop in my bag since i know it 's well protected i bought the <unk> bag , and even though i keep many books in my bag , the sleeve keeps the laptop well protected from being crushed
i am very pleased with this case even with a snap on cover it fits perfectly with my # & # # ; macbook air exactly what i was looking for and arrived fast
i was starting to get worried that my macbook was starting to get a little beat up , so i wanted to get a sleeve/case for it - this is perfect very nice design , very nice fit could n't ask for anything more
i ordered this case mainly for its good price but it is also so super cute and super perfect for my macpro # `` it fits it perfectly and it is a quality case i love it plus , got it pretty quickly , along with a cleaning cloth
this case is great plush and pretty , and it 's a good value for the price the quality is good i 've been using it for a year now with no problems i put it through the wash and it came out good as new
i 've had this case for a couple of months now it has worked great so far nice thin , little case i was a little disappointed with the color when i first received it as the background is definitely gray and not light blue like i thought from the picture ... but it 's still cute
bought it for my girlfriend so she would n't scratch the macbook when she puts it in her purse this case provides adequate protection and is a good fit she 's also happy with the design , which is a plus
the case is exactly the same size of my laptop , the colors are very pretty and the price was very good compared with other cases i liked it in general
this case was a great choice i would not change it with anything else i 've been using it for almost one year and is looks just like new i would recommend it to anyone
i bought an apple mac book pro so i wanted something to protect it this is beautiful ! ! ! i also bought a hard case for my laptop and was worried it wouldnt fit but it definatly does ! : -rrb- exactly what i was expecting ! ! !
i really like the carrying case for my macbook pro i received i slip it in whenever i am not using the computer and it keeps it from getting scratched it is nice and light weight and looks really good i am very happy with my purchase
i was unhappy with this purchase because the product was not like the image instead of a solid shell as pictured , there is a cut out in the shape of a circle where the apple symbol should be also , the cut out was slightly off center not a quality product
i just got mine in the mail today and it does not fit my computer and my computer is a # inch i am confused on why i received a # inch when it says # inch
i bought the wrong one and i could n't return it bc there was no return address i love the product , but i still need a green protective cover for a white macbook pro
i recently ordered this case when i noticed that my # macbook was starting to look a little banged up i saw it online and was really excited to order it it was my favorite color and a great price however , when i received it i was really disappointed the case is not `` rubberized `` at all , it is just plastic and the bottom has cheap foam circles as feet i think this is one of those situations where you get what you pay for , and i would advise spending a little extra to protect your computer
the color was amazing , but the case would not come off the bottom part of the case would n't fully snap on , but the top part that covers the screen would n't come off i had to use a pair of <unk> to pry the case off and i was afraid that it would scratch my new mac this case was too small for my new macbook pro i would not recommend this to other people i did n't know these cases were meant to be permanent !
i ordered and had it shipped overseas i was thrilled with the color and put it on soon as i got it noticed just about a week later that the bottom piece has <unk> <unk> <unk> all around the corners very disappointing :
i have only had this product for a few weeks and it has already cracked i would not recommend this product i am extremely careful with the way i handle my items , this did n't even hold up
i was excited to get the perfect color protection for my mac when it came a small part used for keeping the cover in place was broken i contacted the sender and they shipped another one in the wrong color besides that its not very sturdy and cracked easily not really worth it
i ordered this product twice and now have to return both of them the first one i got in the mail was for a macbook air instead of a macbook pro so i ordered a new one which came in today not only is the bottom too small for my laptop , but part of it was cracked before i even opened the box now i have to try and send them both back not worth the hassle
the case for my macbook pro isnt what i seen in the image ... in person its a dark purple not a light lilac . dont get me wrong i enjoy purple . but its not what it appears to
cracked on me in less then # weeks ... and i am <unk> pretty color and finish , just wish it was a little more durable i believe these probably cost $ # to make , and yet they charge $ # + :
it broke within two weeks . i 'm not happy about this . it looked sturdy when i put it on my computer but now it is all cracked and chipped and i 've never dropped it
protected the laptop , but the case started peeling , so it was clear in some areas and matte in others it ended up looking gross after about a month being taken to school in my backback , so i took it off
first off when my case arrived from the mail , it was poorly packaged and was slightly damaged from transport second , i thought i was buying a product made by topcase , the product i recieved says osaka on it
ok , so i purchased this case for my macbook pro and it protects my computer just fine i have had the case on my computer now for about # months and i have found the case to remain in good shape the only downside is when you touch the case it leaves fingerprints due to natural oils or residue from your hands other than that the case is ok for me not sure i would order again due to fingerprints all over the case and constant cleaning the case
i bought this almost about # months ago maybe and it still looks good the only problem i have with this case is that even though i try to clean it inside and out it still looks dirty , as if somebody touched it with greasy fingers but then again , you get what you pay for compared to brands like incase and speck , this case was worth it for the price it is pretty sturdy as well because i have removed it many times and i take my laptop everywhere and it is still in one piece
this product looks great on my mac book but after dropping my mac one time the bottom part of this case cracked it stayed on though which is a good thing it fits like a glove too
the case looks really cool and it fits my laptop well the only problem i have had with it is that the corners of the case are already cracking and chipping away after # months of
i like the color , it seems to be strong but it does n't fit my computer the reason i only give it # stars is because i am unable to return it so i am now stuck with it and unable to use it
this product seems very good but my one major complaint is that my decal doesnt show through . on the photos , it shows one with a decal showing through the case but mine
it is too see through also the center of it does not fit onto the computer although the edges do fit the quality of the plastic is also very poor
i bought this case for my macbook , but then took it off because it 's chunky and heavy i also did not receive <unk> mouse pad not that i really needed one , but i would like to get what is advertised i do not plan on using this case at all
i received the order in a timely matter color is good and protects laptop , but seems cheap because the corners look like they are starting to crack already also , already have a chunk taken out of it and have no idea how since i never move it i have had this skin on my laptop for about a month
i originally got the wrong size and they quickly gave me the correct size for some reason i thought it would be a thicker and more protective product it 's still a decent quality for the price also , i 've had it for a few weeks and there 's smudges on it that wo n't seem to go away
the case is nice and deserves # stars because of the smudges on the black that i did n't want i ordered red an <unk> black and they sent the wrong one otherwise it 's alright the bottom part slides off a little bit just be careful when using nothing 's perfect but god
this is very very nice however it did not fit my macbook , even though it say it would i am not sending back because it would cost me more to , hopefully i can find someone with a macbook it fits .
when i first got it , i was quite <unk> , but when i put it on the macbook itself , i noticed that it gets dirty by just touching the skin itself , it leaves finger prints
not * quite * as nice as the speck cases , but close it 's very pretty with the computer is turned on and you can see the apple logo -lrb- like in the product picture -rrb- i do n't like it as much when the computer is turned off then it looks a little cheap it does show dirt more than i expected i 've wiped it with cleaner and that helps all in all a great case for the price
i enjoyed this case only thing is the top picks up whatever is on your hands and gives it sort of a discoloration until you rub it out
